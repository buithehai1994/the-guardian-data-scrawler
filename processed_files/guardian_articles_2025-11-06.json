Or did the faithfuls just play really – I mean sensationally, phenomenally, mindbogglingly badly? We will argue over this on social media feeds galore, but either way the winner of the first – but surely not the last – series of The Celebrity Traitors is the treacherous Alan Carr. When first anointed by that collection of cloaks, cuffs and curt instructions we have come to know as presenter Claudia Winkleman, we thought he wouldn’t last an hour. Nor did he. “I feel sick. I’ve got a sweating problem and can’t keep a secret.” He also cannot whisper or remember whether he’s won a shield. Surrounded, however, by some of the daftest players of the game since records began (2022 here, 2021 in its native Netherlands), he made it through, having grown into the role with terrifying ease. He finished with a flourish, bursting into semi-crocodile tears about how hard it had been for him to bear the murderous burden. The two surviving faithfuls, Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga, rushed to comfort him (“It’s been tearing me apart!”). At home, Paloma Faith raises her face to the heavens and screams.The Celebrity Traitors final – as it happenedRead moreAt the start of the final, there had been five surviving competitors of the original 19. After one last group mission, involving a steam train, £20,000 in padlocked caskets, keys and clues dispersed throughout the carriages, and two chain-wrapped coffins (“I took the lead a bit there,” says Joe Marler of the unwrapping. “Because I was happy to lose a finger”), they assembled for their last round table. Cat and Alan cast their votes for David, despite the historian’s impressive record of reasoning himself to every wrong conclusion possible. I remain firm in my belief that David would have made the world’s greatest traitor, but as a faithful he was catastrophic. He did manage to vote for Cat at the table, however, and she was correctly banished at last.View image in fullscreenGet off the Traitors Express! … the last mission.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryNow we are four. I can hardly bear to write about what happened next. Nick … had a moment. A moment when he doubted Joe. One of the greatest love stories of our or any age, between the hugest man and the tiniest man on television, the rugby player and the puzzlemaster, staggered under the blow as Nick turned over his final slate to reveal his best buddy’s name. Joe did not reel – he is not built for it – but if he could, he would have. “But I love you,” Nick said, hopelessly.Joe went, Nick and David thought they were safe and after some business throwing pouches into a fire, the three agreed to end the game. As the sole surviving traitor, Alan was declared the winner and took the entire £87,500 prize pot for the children’s cancer charity Neuroblastoma UK. But the most important thing is that when Claudia led the five to a reunion on the castle steps, Joe forgave Nick instantly.I shall, along with the more than 13 million other viewers, miss them all. (Apart from Lucy Beaumont, who never got a chance to do much, and Clare Balding, who never apologised for bungling the Trojan horse challenge.) I shall miss the bitter fury of Ruth Codd, the Shakespearean sorrow of Mark Bonnar, the utter inability of Kate Garraway to take things anything other than personally. I shall miss Tom Daley’s suspicion of long words, Tameka Empson and Joe Wilkinson’s wit, Paloma’s sheer presence, Charlotte Church as the distillation of everything that remains good in this fallen world, Jonathan Ross as television’s last remaining showman, sweet Niko Omilana and the relentless avuncularity of Stephen Fry, along with all the finalists themselves. Above all I shall miss the grace and elegance of Celia Imrie, so exquisitely regal even when screaming down a well or farting in a shack. As the figure under Winkleman’s hair made clear on many occasions, you were, largely, awful at the game. But you were great, great entertainment.The Celebrity Traitors is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

But if zero stars is the new benchmark for critical rage, three films deserve the big 0Thu 6 Nov 2025 11.47 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.29 ESTShareKim Kardashian’s world-historically horrendous TV show All’s Fair has detonated a firestorm of critical horror which, as well as everything else, may have undermined the currency of the star-rating review economy. My colleague Lucy Mangan gave Kardashian’s show an all-but-unprecedented zero stars andzero stars are in fact very rare on this paper.The Guardian has only ever published 18 zero-star reviews. Here they all areRead moreYet perhaps in the post-Kardashian world they will become more commonplace. I actually have the distinction of giving the first zero star review in the Guardian’s history — forCuba Gooding’s terrible comedy Boat Trip back in 2002. But it’s weird. There have been worse films than that which didn’t get zeroed. Not many. But some.Maybe the pure trauma of Boat Trip caused me both to award no stars and blitz all memory of having done so, because until re-reading that review I’d thought I’d stuck to the parameters of the five-star system, five for the best and one for the worst. (And I am actually the only broadsheet critic in captivity who likes the star system because it prevents reviewers superciliously sitting on the fence.)View image in fullscreenAmong the worst experiences of my life … Tom Green in Freddy Got Fingered.Photograph: Chris Helcermanas-Benge/Associated PressGiving zero stars, I’d always assumed, was the negative equivalent of Spinal Tap guitarist Nigel Tufnel cranking his amp to 11. What was the point? One is the worst. Isn’t it? If you give zero stars, why not give six stars at the other end? Or seven stars, as if you’re reviewing a luxury hotel in Dubai?And once zero stars becomes the norm, someone is going to give minus one or minus two. Like Weimar citizens during hyperinflation, critics will be wheeling barrowloads of valueless minus 38-star reviews to the publishing marketplace, to find someone has given a minus 39. If zero stars is to be the new benchmark of critical spleen, perhaps it’s the time for a reset moment; critics will have to issue a new star rating system, like the new French franc in 1960.View image in fullscreenReduced me to a nervous breakdown … The Incredible Hulk.Photograph: Marvel Studios/AllstarSo anyway. If zero stars is the new normal for critical rage, then so be it. Here are the ones who deserve the big 0, 1-star movies from which I am now ceremoniously reducing the rating to nul points. (You will have to imagine in the film’s director and producer on some bleak military parade ground, their heads bowed, as to a rattling drum roll I rip away their single star.)In describing the 2001 grossout comedyFreddy Got FingeredI said it had “been hailed as the 21st century’s worst movie; I think it is the 21st century’s worst cultural artefact. Watching it was among the worst experiences of my life, up there with having a quarter of millimetre shaved off my upper molar without anaesthetic by an eccentric dentist when I was 15.”Louis Letterier’s mindblowingly badly actedThe Incredible Hulkreduced me a virtual nervous breakdown.But the gold medal for zero stars, for pure moviemaking horror, goes to Julia Roberts’s interminable self-help spiritual journey in the 2010 film Eat Pray Love.Here is the review I wrote at the time, and I can feel myself worrying that zero is generous.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm criticismcommentShareReuse this content"

Some of the fake spirits in my local supermarket cost more than £25 a bottle!It doesn’t seem to make any sense, does it?Alcoholattracts tax and soft drinks do not, so why do some of the options on the no/low shelf have such big price tags? When browsing the drinks menu at a London venue recently, I saw a sparkling non-alcoholic wine costing £85 – enough to make me wonder if there’s a fake-champagne bubble.The drinks being offered as booze substitutes fall into two categories: those that are low or 0% versions of established alcohol brands, and those developed separately. Often the latter come from small manufacturers that specialise in alternative adult-targeted drinks.Research for Sheffield Addictions Research Group (Sarg) – a group of public health experts based at the University of Sheffield – has looked at the price of alcoholic drinks compared with the price of no- and low-alcohol alternatives, focusing on the first category (ie established brands).The group publisheda reportfeaturing figures from across 2023; the time lag isn’t ideal, but it gives us a sense of the market. It showed the average price paid for a litre of no/lo beer was 5% higher than standard beer in supermarkets and off-licences and 25% higher in pubs and restaurants. No/lo cider was 10% more expensive than standard cider in the off-trade and 9% more expensive in the on-trade. 0% wine was cheaper everywhere, while for spirits prices were lower in supermarkets but higher in pubs.While there are lots of cheaper alternatives to alcoholic drinks, and the figures above don’t tell the whole story, Prof John Holmes, director of Sarg, says pricing matters. Alcohol causes most harm among more deprived groups and they may miss out on the benefits of 0% drinks.“If no/lo products are only taken up and used by people in higher socioeconomic groups, then those people might enjoy better health outcomes,” he says. “It’s widening the health inequalities already associated with alcohol.”Sarg’s focus groups have found many think 0% drinks are poor value for money. “When people buy alcohol they feel they’re buying more than a drink – maybe they think they’re buying intoxication, or they just know they have to pay tax, so they expect the price to be higher,” Holmes says.But he says the pricing picture is complex, with the report’s headline figures skewed by what’s on the market. “The industry seems to have made a deliberate decision that the no/lo drinks are versions of the premium products,” he says. “They seem to have made a choice not to associate alcohol-free beer with the cheaper brands.”View image in fullscreenThe average price of a four-pack of Guinness 0.0 is £5.43.Photograph: David Burton/AlamyThis may be because early iterations of booze-free booze were pretty bad. “If you want to reform a product’s reputation, you want to launch a premium version,” he says. Quoted costs are also affected by the range of sizes on offer – bigger multipacks tend to be available of standard beers and ciders.Holmes says comparing like with like typically reveals the price of the alcohol-free drink is cheaper. But this is not always the case: often retailers’ deals tip the balance so it’s cheaper to buy booze.Recently, Corona’s website highlighted two offers at Amazon: one for Corona Cero, its 0% brand, and one for pale lager Corona Extra. At that point Corona Cero was more expensive.When I asked Corona, it provided data showing that between 1 January and 23 August this year the 0% product was cheaper on average. The figures, from Nielsen, put a litre of Corona Extra at £4.38 when bought in a four-pack of 330ml bottles and Corona Cero at £3.33, which is 24% less. For a 12-pack, Corona Extra cost an average of £2.92 and Corona Cero 16% less at £2.46.The difference is not as much as the duty – on a 330ml bottle of 4.5% ABV beer the duty is about 32p. For a four-pack that adds up to £1.28 and for a 12-pack it’s £3.84. Zero-alcohol drinks, of course, are exempt from this duty.The same is true on Guinness 0.0 – one of the most popular alcohol-free versions of a mainstream beer. The average price of a four-pack of Guinness Draught is £5.98, while the average price of the non-alcoholic version is £5.43 – a difference of 55p, while the duty would add up to £1.57.‘Coke and beer – in one glass, please’: my gut-churning search for a signature drinkRead moreA spokesperson for Guinness’s maker, Diageo, says the price reflects years of research and development, quality control and “the production process, which is not only more complex but more expansive than regular Guinness”. I asked if they meant expensive rather than expansive. They said no. It seems they were hinting at a longer process that involves brewing Guinness, then removing the alcohol.The length of the production process is also cited as a factor in the price by the makers of the new breed of alcohol-like alternatives. Pentire’s distilled drinks – designed to be served with mixers – are typically £28 for a 70cl bottle, while Botivo, which styles itself as a “big-sipping botanical aperitivo”, costs £27.50 for 50cl. That’s a long way from a bottle of lime cordial and more expensive than some brands of gin, despite the lack of tax.The makers say the main cost of the drink is not duty but how it is made. Rhiannon Williams, head of marketing at Pentire, says the drinks are made using distilled fresh coastal botanicals. “Unlike soft drinks, which are often made from concentrates or cordials, we work with whole plants and run small-batch distillations to capture delicate, natural flavours. This process is time-intensive and requires specialist equipment and expertise, much like traditional spirit-making,” she says.The creators of Botivo say it takes a year to make. Imme Ermgassen, Botivo’s co-founder, adds that the price cannot be compared with the same sized bottle of gin. “Most non-alcoholic spirits are 10–13 serves per 750ml, whereas Botivo is highly concentrated, delivering around 20 serves per bottle,” she says. She adds the drink is “not about mimicking alcohol, but about creating a category in its own right”.Do you have a question for The Price of Everything?

A show of strength from the justice department. The system may be in crisis but there was leadership at the very top. There was one prisoner who was most definitely not getting an accidental early release. And that was the justice secretary himself.After his distinctly disastrous showing – he had the shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, to thank for it not being far worse – while standing in for Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions,David Lammyhas been kept banged up on 15-minute observation watch by civil servants and advisers inside the department. Allowed out of his office only under electronic tag for toilet breaks.We had been promised that Lammy would be giving a short interview to broadcasters some time on Thursday morning. Both to reassure us that he was still alive and possibly to update us on the two prisoners who had gone awol. Assuming he had any idea of what was going on. And not forgetting any others who had been mistakenly released in the past 24 hours. It’s hard to keep an up-to-date checklist these days.Overcrowding, understaffing and old IT: chaotic context to prison release errorsRead moreBut by lunchtime there was still no sign of the justice secretary. Not even a press release from the department to announce a new policy of accidentally jailing people. This could prove a lifesaver for the Labour government. It would be catnip to the rightwing media, and Robert Jenrick and Chris Philp would be kicking themselves for not having thought of it.And it would all be so simple. Just send round vans to pick up foreigners and then put them in prison for years for any unsolved crimes. What could go wrong? Fewer migrants and a reduction in the crime statistics. A double whammy.It wasn’t until the afternoon that we had our first sighting of David. A short, grainy TikTok clip clearly filmed by ITV while Lammy appeared to be on the run. Surely the justice department hadn’t lost track of its boss already? That would be a disaster. But at least that would make it one in, one out. For while we had been waiting for Lammy,one of the missing prisoners had handed himself in. Knocking on the door of Wandsworth nick, begging to be allowed back in. Anything to escape the clutches of GB News.Step forward William “Billy” Smith. A good, old-fashioned con. The type of inmate who makes you proud to be British. Obviously you can’t trust him with your credit card – or anyone else’s, for that matter – as he is a convicted fraudster, but you can still trust him to do the right thing. In a Guy Ritchie film, the SAS would have lifted him out of prison to trick the German government into revealing their plans to invade Poland.Good old Billy. Saving everyone the effort of finding him. Not like the Algerian sex offenderwho had managed to go missing for six daysbefore anyone had noticed he had gone.0:54Moment mistakenly released prisoner Billy Smith hands himself in – videoThat still left Lammy with a couple of minutes of awkward questions. “No comment” and “You’ll never take me alive” clearly weren’t going to cut it. Instead we got a few clipped sentences, accidentally released through gritted teeth. And surprisingly, it turned out nothing that had happened on his watch had been his fault.There had been another David Lammy running around masquerading as the justice secretary. It had even been a doppelganger who had taken his place at PMQs. He had been out and about, minding his business while buying a new suit to impress his godmother. Big Dave could look the camera in the eye and declare that Big Dave was innocent. OK?It was like this. The Algerian sex offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, had been accidentally released before Lammy’s new improved measures to make sure that even more prisoners were accidentally released had been put in place. What the country needed to understand was that it was a long and noble tradition of the British justice system that at least one prisoner was accidentally released every other day.A kind of national lottery for cons. An incentive scheme to give prisoners a sense of purpose. A reason to get out of bed each day and not riot about the conditions inside. A scheme that had been started by the Tories, so it was a bit rich for Honest Bob to choose today to start complaining. This was what the country had voted for. Given the choice, the electorate wanted to underfund the Prison Service to make sure it was on the point of collapse. After all, no one wants their taxes to be spent on a load of cons. Though they might now make an exception for Billy.So why, if he had been briefed on Tuesday night about Kaddour-Cherif, had Lammy not updated the house when asked at PMQs? Dave looked puzzled. Although he had been updated on Tuesday night it was only on Wednesday morning that he had remembered he had been updated on Tuesday night.These things have a habit of happening when you’re in government. One minute you’re just minding your business choosing the fabric for a new suit and the next, 12 hours have slipped by without you noticing.A la Recherche du Temps Perdu.In any case, people just had to learn to manage their expectations. Dave had been in the job for just a couple of months and the country shouldn’t expect miracles. He had his work-life balance to consider. If his predecessors couldn’t get the department into shape then there wasn’t that much point in him having a go. It would be a waste of effort. And there was so much detail involved.That’s why he had stalled at PMQs. Cartlidge had gone on about an asylum seeker without getting round to naming him, so he had got confused. As anyone might. The Tories might have been referring to another prisoner.And it just so happened that he had been given all the information the moment PMQs had ended. Coincidentally, at the same time the media had worked out what was what. And he hadn’t wanted to go back and update the house because it was lunchtime and he was quite tired. At which point Lammy’s parole officer called it a day. The justice secretary was only out on day release.A year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsDavid LammyThe politics sketchPrisons and probationUK criminal justicecommentShareReuse this content"

Over the coming days, the pilot and more than 25,000 other American troops hunted the autocrat, who finally surrendered on 3 January 1990.US ‘Night Stalkers’ seen in Caribbean as fears of regime change rise in VenezuelaRead more“Noriega was a bad, bad man … and he needed to be removed,”said Durant.Memories of Just Cause have resurfaced in recent weeks after Donald Trump ordered the largestUS militarybuildup in Latin America and the Caribbean since that invasion almost four decades ago.A seventh of US naval assets – including the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford – have been sent to the region since August, with B-52 bombers and special forces spotted off Venezuela’s northern coast. Airstrikes on alleged drug boats in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea have killed more than 60 people.Officially, the deployment of warships, Reaper drones and about 10,000 service personnel is part of a crackdown on Latin American narco-traffickers who Trump accuses of flooding the US with drugs. Butmany suspect Trump’s real goal is toppling Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, just as George HW Bush toppled Noriega before he was tried and jailed in the US.View image in fullscreenChief Warrant Officer Four Michael J Durant.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle/Getty ImagesSome members of Venezuela’s opposition appear keen for a replay of Just Cause, on an even greater scale. The exiled politician Leopoldo López recentlyvoiced supportfor a US attack to unseat Maduro, who iswidely believed to have stolen last year’s presidential election. But many observers, including Trump backers, question the wisdom of invading a country 12 times larger than Panama, and more politically and geographically complex.“Not to be the bearer of bad news, but it looks like we are about to embark on another regime change war, like, next week,” Tucker Carlson declared last week, flagging Iraq as a prime example of the US’s ignominious track record of regime changes gone wrong.“It never works – but we are doing it again, apparently,” Carlson said.A recent YouGov pollfound almost half of Americans opposed using military force to overthrow Maduro with only 18% supportive.Durant also had reservations, despite considering Just Cause the most successful mission of his two-decade military career. He was certain US troops could overthrow Maduro, as they did Noriega. “We have tremendous capability and great people. But is it worth putting all that at risk?” wondered Durant,who was shot down and held captive for 11 days in Somaliaduring a 1993 operation that left members of the 18 US military dead.Before Just Cause, thousands of US troops were stationed in Panama, Durant noted, but it has no such presence in Venezuela.It was also unclear how capable Maduro’s Bolivarian armed forces were of fighting back. “That to me is the biggest wildcard,” Durant said. “They do good parades. But what can they really do? Are they trained? Are they resourced? Are they willing to fight? Are they loyal?”View image in fullscreenPeople watch the USS Gravely departing Port of Spain in Trinidad for exercises off the coast of Venezuela.Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty ImagesMichael Grow, a historian who wrotea bookabout US presidents and Latin American cold war interventions, saw “intriguing similarities” to past operations.In 1988, on the eve of Just Cause,the US indicted Noriega for drug smuggling– just as they have with Maduro who recently hada $50m bounty put on his headfor allegedly running a “narco-terrorist” cartel. “So … they’ve established a convenient pretext if they choose to pursue a military route,” Grow said.“But I don’t think it’s on the cards with Trump … These people are not neocons. They’re much more America First … I just don’t see the US getting involved in a land war in South America,” Grow added, although he did not rule out “surgical strike drone warfare”.James Story, the US’s top diplomat for Venezuela from 2018 to 2023, also doubted a Just Cause-style onslaught was coming: “We always like overwhelming force and it would take 100,000 troops – and that’s not Trump.”But the former ambassador –who initially considered Trump’s military buildup sabre-rattling– now saw an 80% chance of “some proactive action” on Venezuelan soil in the next 30 days, probably an airstrike. “The amount of assets that have been arranged in the zone indicate to me that we’re going to do something,” Story said.Grow thought a better analogy than Panama was what happened in Guatemala in 1954 when the US brought down its democratically elected president, Jacobo Árbenz, with what the historian called “a masterpiece of psychological warfare and bluff”.Operation PBSuccess – ordered by Dwight Eisenhower to extinguish a spurious communist threat – involved using a CIA-funded disinformation and sabotage campaign to convince Guatemalan military officials they were on the brink of being attacked by “a powerful liberation army” and should abandon Árbenz to avoid “devastating US retribution”.View image in fullscreenFlames engulf buildings in Panama City during urban combat between the Panamanian Defense Force and US forces on 21 December 1989.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“[Árbenz was] in effect deposed in a military coup produced by US intimidation and deception,” wrote Grow, who suspected something similar might be afoot with Venezuela, as Trump waged a war of nerves hoping “the Venezuelan armed forces will take him out for us”.Last month Trumpconfirmedhe had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.Story also believed Trump’s desired outcome was for “somebody close to Maduro” to do one of three things. “Send him into exile; send him to the US; or send him to meet his maker.”But the US has spent years trying to break Maduro’s regime, most memorably during Trump’s first term when he recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful president. Such efforts have repeatedly failed.Last weekend, TrumpclaimedMaduro’s days were numbered. But John Polga-Hecimovich, a Venezuela expert from the US Naval Academy, said Maduro’s foes had been claiming “his days were numbered” almost since he succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013.Maduro has remained in power, thanks to a masterful strategy of regime “coup proofing” which involved packing the military with Cuban and Venezuelan spies and using torture, purges, promotions and largesse to ensure loyalty, he said.View image in fullscreenUH-60 Black Hawk helicopters stand by to evacuate wounded US military personnel during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989.Photograph: Alamy“He has promoted 2,200 officers to the positions of general or admiral over the past 12 years. That’s basically three times as many generals and admirals as exist in the US,”saidPolga-Hecimovich, the co-editor ofa bookabout the Maduro regime.“Getting the military to overthrow him is not as easy maybe as his opponents might portray it – that’s not to say that it’s impossible,” added Polga-Hecimovich noting how none of more than half a dozen military mutinies had snowballed.Durant hoped Trump’s deployment was about intimidating Maduro and the military, not a prelude to invasion. “Actually putting boots on the ground, I would not support that at this point,” said the pilot, calling a coup “the perfect solution”.Even if Maduro was successfully toppled, that would not necessarily usher in a brighter future. “[Sometimes] you just remove one problem and replace it with another,” Durant said, highlighting the 2001 Afghanistan invasion as “a cautionary tale” of how interventions sometimes veered off course.“No one went in there thinking we’d be there for 20 years,” he said.View image in fullscreenA member of the Bolivarian militia holds a picture of Nicolás Maduro during a military deployment in Caracas on 23 September 2025.Photograph: Federico Parra/AFP/Getty ImagesGrow recalled how, from Washington’s perspective, the 1954 Guatemala gambit had “worked astonishingly well”.Eisenhower was said to be “immensely pleased” and his CIA chief, Allen Dulles, “exuberant”.But for the Central American country the CIA-sponsored coup was a disaster: Árbenz’s resignation ushered in more than four decades of dictatorship and civil war during which more than 200,000 people were killed or disappeared.Polga-Hecimovich feared a US intervention in Venezuela might also “unleash a great deal of chaos” and provoke “an enduring low-intensity conflict”.“What happens the day after?” he asked. “I sure hope people are considering this.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasPanamaUS militaryUS foreign policyUS national securityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve known each other for seven years: I sent her a message on Twitter, and we started chatting. Since then, we often meet up to work together and have dinner.The thing is, Chioma has always shortened my name to “Pris”, or even “P.” I tolerated it because I love her, but recently I mentioned that I actually prefer to be called by my full name, Priscilla.I am sure that I’ve told Chioma this several times over the years, but it never seems to register. I got particularly annoyed recently when Chioma and her new friend Mary, who I don’t know very well, started calling me “Prissy”. I hate it – my cousins used to call me that when I was a kid, and I would get upset. When I told them I didn’t like any of my nicknames, Chioma was shocked and said she hadn’t realised.She also said that a nickname is given out of love, and that when she shortened my name, it was done with fondness. I said that’s fine for some other people, but I prefer being called by my full name. It also felt as though she wasn’t really taking my preference seriously, and was trying to make an excuse in front of Mary.There’s also that thing about white people shortening the names of people of colour when they can’t be bothered to pronounce them properly. It’s not like that between me and Chioma, as we are both black, but when Mary – who is white – started doing it, it did feel a bit like that. I don’t think Chioma or Mary meant any harm, but intent doesn’t always erase impact.There’s a subtle power dynamic in deciding what someone should be called, even among friendsI also think Chioma can’t really relate because everyone calls her by her full name all the time.There’s a subtle power dynamic in deciding what someone should be called, even among friends. Everyone has the right to be called by their full names, and when someone calls you something you don’t relate to, at best it can feel triggering, and at worst it’s a racist microaggression.The defence: ChiomaHer nickname was born out of love. I feel hurt she’s framing it as if I’ve been disrespecting herI honestly didn’t realise Priscilla felt that strongly about nicknames. I’ve been calling her “P” or “Pris” for years as it just came naturally. We know each other’s families and spend a lot of time together, so I didn’t think about it too much. Her nickname was born out of love. It felt like something that belonged to us, as most nicknames between friends do.I thought it was affectionate, and my way of showing closeness. But when she said in front of Mary that she didn’t like her nicknames, I thought: what the heck? I was taken aback, not because I don’t respect her wishes, but because I genuinely thought she understood that I had good intentions. I wasn’t mocking her. “Prissy” was something Mary and I said light-heartedly. It never occurred to me that she might take it as an insult.She told me it makes her feel like a kid being told off, as that’s what her family used to call her when she had a tantrum. I took that onboard, but I know she feels I brushed her off by saying the nicknames I use are given out of love.I think she should have said something earlier, as “P” or “Pris” is how she’s always been known to meNicknames signify closeness. For years, our friendship has been easy and comfortable. We don’t really argue and have lots of similar interests. I wouldn’t want her to think I am going against her wishes by calling her something she hates, but she is literally saved in my phone as “Pris”. I’ve called her that since we met. I certainly didn’t mean to embarrass her in front of Mary.But I do feel hurt that she’s now framing it as though I’ve been disrespecting her for years. I also think she should have said something earlier, as “P” or “Pris” is how she’s always been known to me. I didn’t have a clue she didn’t like it. I also don’t remember her bringing this up before, even though she says she has.Nicknames to me mean we are really close and at ease with one another. Full names can feel formal sometimes. I think it might be difficult to retrain my brain, but I will try.The juryof Guardian readersShould Chioma start usingPriscilla’s full name?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Chioma says: “I think it might be difficult to retrain my brain” to call her by her full name. Calling her Priscilla in your phone may help.Andrea, 58Saying that this is “triggering” and a “racist microaggression” is an overreaction. Sure, tell Chioma to stop calling you an annoying nickname, but turning it into something deeper is a way of wilfully creating strife where there was once easy affection.Frank, 39Priscilla has the right to be called by her preferred name. Chioma didn’t intend to upset Priscilla but that’s the outcome. Saying it was done with love and that Priscilla should have said something earlier are ways of deflecting responsibility for doing something hurtful.Rachel, 53Chioma was expressing her affection for and intimacy with Priscilla and was clearly not intending to mock or belittle her. Priscilla should focus on the love Chioma obviously feels for her and take herself less seriously. On this occasion she is indeed being a tad prissy.Daral, 27A nickname may be seen as a friendly abbreviation, but its use has to be consensual. Priscilla tolerated this for a time, but has since made her feelings known and this should be respected.

It describes itself as a “strategic advisory firm” that advises chief executives and political leaders to manage “high-stakes issues”.Working with at least one other firm, Highgate sought to establish connections between the woman andIsrael. However, documents seen by the Guardian suggest no such evidence was found.People familiar with activities of the private intelligence firms said its operation was commissioned by a high-level diplomatic unit within the Qatari state.Khan’s alleged victim told the Guardian she was appalled by the “disturbing” operation. “The idea that private intelligence firms have been instructed to target me is as incomprehensible as it is heartbreaking.”In a statement to the Guardian, Highgate confirmed it had worked on an operation related to the ICC but said it had not “acted against any individual”. It denied the project was paid or commissioned by the “government of Qatar”.Details about a Qatari unit’s apparent involvement in the spy operation – which also appears to have targeted other ICC officials – is the latest twist in the saga relating to the prosecutor that has thrown the court into an unprecedented crisis.Khan’s decision to seek warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged crimes in Gaza has made him and the court a target for the US and Israel.The abuse allegations have further complicated his tenure as prosecutor. He hasstepped aside pending a UN inquiryinto his conduct.The Guardian has seen no evidence that Khan had any personal involvement in the operation. However, people familiar with the operation said Highgate met Khan’s representatives, raising questions about the purpose of the meeting.Year of turmoilKhan’s term as ICC prosecutor was thrown into turmoil late last year when the abuse allegations made by the court stafferbecame public. The woman, a lawyer in her 30s, worked directly for him.Her claims include allegations of coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. The alleged sexual misconduct is said to have occurred in hotel rooms during work trips, in Khan’s office at the ICC, and at his home.A UN watchdog is investigating her claims. In August,the Guardian reportedthat a second woman had come forward to the inquiry with allegations that Khan mistreated her while working for him as an unpaid intern earlier in his career.Khan’s lawyers have repeatedly said he “categorically denies” having mistreated any individual and claimed the prosecutor “has been the subject of an orchestrated campaign” to discredit him.While the Guardian understands there have been attempts by pro-Israeli actors to leak information about the ICC staffer’s complaint, it has found no evidence to suggest the women have raised the allegations as part of a plot against the prosecutor.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The funding was regarded as highly sensitive. Executives involved in the project were careful to refer to its client as the “client country” or “Q country”.A document seen by the Guardian suggests that at one stage during the operation Highgate sought information that would link the alleged victim and her family members with Israel or its intelligence agencies.Highgate engaged a specialist firm, Elicius Intelligence, to assist with its information gathering about the woman, her child, her husband and his parents. Highgate also asked the company to investigate other ICC officials who had been involved in the court’s response to the allegations.Documents suggest that Elicius produced several reports for Highgate that included “sensitive” information about their private lives, former relationships, and financial situations. At one point, according to the files, Highgate asked for the birth certificate of the woman’s young child to be obtained.Highgate also obtained the woman’s passport details and sought detailed information about flights she had taken in recent years. The reports contain passwords used by the woman for online accounts, including a private email address, that appear to have come from hacked data available on the dark web.In its statement, Highgate said the claim it sought information about the woman’s child was “inaccurate” and suggested descriptions of other types of information obtained by the private firms were incorrect.“Highgate led an independent assessment into potential covert or improper activities that may have sought to undermine the credibility, independence, or efficiency of the ICC,” it said. “The review has considered several incidents involving multiple individuals over an extended period.”Highgate did not deny meeting Khan’s representatives, describing such information as “private, commercially sensitive and confidential”.In a statement to the Guardian, Khan’s lawyers did not dispute such a meeting took place.However, they said his representatives had “no knowledge of, let alone involvement in, the alleged activities” of the private intelligence firms. Khan’s lawyers added that he had not been provided with any “information” about its activities.Elicius Intelligence declined to comment. The government of Qatar did not respond to a request for comment.Khan’s alleged victim, who has been waiting for almost a year for the UN inquiry to reach its conclusions, and has found herself at the centre of a major geopolitical fallout at the ICC, expressed frustration at the situation.“Where does this end and how much will be allowed? If this is what international justice looks like, it is not the system that I have dedicated my life to serving.” She added: “I have always done my work quietly and under the radar. I came to serve, not to be seen.”Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceQatarIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We should be following through on our manifesto, of course. There’s no question about that.”Powell made the significant intervention on BBC Radio 5 Live, calling at the same time for the two-child benefit cap to be lifted in full rather than softened.She said she wanted a “budget of fairness”, with more money being put into people’s pockets, rather than less, and one with a “strongLabourstory about how we are rewiring the country in the interests of the many not just the few”.Her remarks are likely to be uncomfortable for the chancellor and Keir Starmer as both have in recent weeksdeclined to repeat their commitments to stand by the manifesto pledgeon tax.The government has been looking at the possibility of raising income tax as a way of giving a substantial boost to the public finances and leave an extra buffer for potential financial shocks.Powell’s spokesperson later clarified that she would support the chancellor whatever the decisions made in the budget, which will be taken by Reeves and Starmer.A spokesperson for Powell said: “As Lucy made clear in the interview the chancellor and prime minister make decisions on the budget in the round. As the chancellor said this week the context for this budget is particularly difficult and Lucy will continue to support them on these issues.”Downing Street had no comment on Powell’s remarks.Reeves gave a speech this week that was widely interpreted as making the case for tax rises to allow greater investment in public services.“It is important that everyone – the public and politicians – understands that reality. The less we spend on debt interest, the more we can spend on the priorities of working people … our NHS, our schools, our national security … the public services essential to a decent society and a strong economy,” she said.However, it is still not certain that Reeves will opt for a rise in income tax, which could raise £7bn, instead of an array of smaller tax measures. The final forecasts have not yet been presented to the chancellor, meaning the decisions are still to be taken.Powell’s intervention before the budget is a sign that she is willing to question the dominant thinking in Downing Street, after shewon the deputy leadership electionon the back of promising not to “sugar-coat” her views.She is in a unique position to challenge Starmer and Reeves as the party’s deputy leader, who was chosen last month by the membership to replace Angela Rayner ahead of the government’s choice, Bridget Phillipson. Powell had previously been pushed out of her job as leader of the House of Commons by the prime minister at the reshuffle after the summer recess and is not bound by collective responsibility.View image in fullscreenPowell’s remarks are likely to be uncomfortable for Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer.Photograph: Justin Tallis/ReutersThe deputy leader’s statements echo the concerns of a number of Labour MPs who are privately worried about the impact on trust of breaking a manifesto pledge and Reeves’s ownclaim last yearthat she would not come back to the public with further tax rises.Cabinet ministers appear to be largely resigned to the idea of raising income tax, rather than fiddling with a large number of small tax measures, having bought the argument that it is better to make a big tax-raising move relatively early in the parliament.However, some backbenchers are concerned that it is a “dangerous moment” for the government to be seen as going back on a promise and that it may not be forgiven by the electorate.“The two major reasons people are leaving us is they perceive we broke our promises and secondly because of the cost of living. This entrenches that,” one Labour MP said.“Emotionally, colleagues don’t feel the same way about this as with welfare. But before Rishi [Sunak, the former Conservative PM] raised national insurance in 2021, it ‘polled’ well. Not when it hit the ground. But it’s hard to go to chancellor and say don’t do X when everything has to add up.”In her BBC interview, Powell also said the two-child benefit cap “should be lifted in full” as a matter of urgency to deal with “grotesque levels” of child poverty.“Every year that passes with this policy in place, another 40,000 minimum, 40,000 children, are pushed into deep levels of poverty as a result of it and that’s why it is urgent that we do lift it and we lift it in full.”Reeves is believed to be looking at only partly lifting the two-child benefit cap affecting universal credit, after the government previously hinted earlier in the autumn that it would be scrapped entirely. Instead, she is thought to be considering smaller measures that would go some way to blunting its impact.The Guardianfirst reported last monththat Reeves was considering raising income tax to help reduce a shortfall, expected to be between £20bn and £30bn, after abigger-than-expected downgradein productivity forecasts.However, government insiders believe the economic landscape to be less gloomy than predicted, which may allow Reeves to avoid the problem of breaking the manifesto pledge. While theOffice for Budget Responsibility’s productivity downgradehas created a headache, they point out that a fall in debt financing costs and more people coming into the jobs market may help limit the damage.Explore more on these topicsLabourLucy PowellTax and spendingBudget 2025Economic policyRachel ReevesBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the NHS has not met its target for 85% of cancer patients to start treatment within 62 days since December 2015.The authors argue that without legal rights in the UK, the government’s forthcoming national cancer plan risks being a paper exercise that will fail to get the UK off thebottom of cancer survival league tables.“The concern is that the [cancer plan] will be a consensus plan to appease multiple stakeholders, rather than to provide radical, accountable, independent leadership,” the Lancet paper concludes.Statutory rights to timely treatment would cut waiting lists and improve survival rates, the experts argue. Eduardo Pisani, a co-author of the paper and chief executive of All.Can, a global nonprofit that aims to improve cancer care efficiency, said: “International evidence shows that strong cancer plans, supported by legal rights, ensure patients have guaranteed access to timely, high-quality care. This protection promotes early treatment, reduces inequalities and ultimately improves health outcomes.”Since 1999, a cancer patient in Denmark has the right to start treatment within 28 days of being referred, and within a maximum of 14 days of consenting to the treatment. Five-year survival rates for some cancers are among the best inEurope, with minimal waiting lists.Mark Lawler, a professor of digital health at Queen’s University Belfast, chair of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership and joint lead author of the paper, said introducing legal rights for cancer patients like Denmark would mean “if UK cancer patients cannot be treated at their own hospital within 62 days, theNHSwould have to pay to treat them at another NHS hospital, privately or in another country”.“This fundamental contract between patients and the NHS must be explicit, with patients able to seek legal redress for any breaches.”As well as the right to be treated within two months, patients should have the legal right to be given a designated named cancer professional to oversee their care, and after successful treatment they should be legally entitled to be forgotten. The law, already in place in nine European countries, means that five years after successful treatment, patients would not have to reveal their previous cancer diagnosis. Insurers and mortgage providers would be prohibited from asking for or accessing this information, ensuring patients are not discriminated against and charged more because of their previous diagnosis.Cary Adams, the chief executive of the Union for International Cancer Control, said: “Cancer plans recognising the rights of all people living with cancer to receive the treatment they need when they need it are essential in every country. Time and time again, we see governments struggle to respond to cancer in their country without a robust, well-funded plan, resulting in the unnecessary loss of people’s lives and trauma to their families.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “This government is committed to transforming cancer care following years of neglect.“We are determined to ensure patients get timely diagnoses – that is why we have introducedJess’s rule, requiring GPs to reconsider cases where symptoms escalate or no diagnosis emerges after three appointments.“We are also cutting waiting times for cancer care, diagnosing or ruling out 135,000 more cancer cases this year, building more community diagnostic centres, offering evening and weekend appointments and spending £70m on new radiotherapy machines to get patients faster access to the tests, checks and scans they require.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthNHSDenmarkEuropeShareReuse this content"

Rupert’s youngest son acquired a 17.9% stake in ITV for £940m in 2006.Sky, which took the stake toblock a move by Richard Bransonto buy ITV after the cable companies NTL and Telewest merged to create Virgin Media, was ultimately forced by regulators to sell its holding.ITV’slargest single shareholder, Liberty Global, which jointly owns Virgin Media O2 with Spanish telecoms operator Telefónica, halved its 10% stake in ITV last month.The broadcaster’s value has slumped to £2.5bn, about 75% below levels seen a decade ago, as the Netflix-led streaming revolution has hammered the stocks of traditional broadcasters.On Thursday, ITV reported that it would “temporarily”cut £35m from its budgetsas it deals the poor macroeconomic environment and advertiser uncertainty ahead of the budget later this month.The company said it expected advertising revenues, which still account for most of its income, to fall by 9% in the key fourth-quarter advertising period in the run-up to Christmas.ITV is being advised by the banks Robey Warshaw and Morgan Stanley.The performance of ITV Studios has led analysts to argue that the production arm alone could be worth more than the broadcasting business, which includes some of the UK’s most popular channels.Since buying Sky at a premium in a bidding war in 2018, Comcast haswritten down the value of the business by billions of dollars, mainly due to the poor performance of European operations in Italy and Germany.Sky UK, which controls rights to crown-jewel assets including most of the rights to the Premier League, remains highly profitable.In June, Comcast agreed tosell its German pay-TV business to RTL, the former owner of Channel 5 in the UK, for €150m.ITV, Sky andComcastdeclined to comment.Explore more on these topicsITVComcastSkyShareReuse this content"

Chants of “Elon” erupted in the room at the news of its approval.“Thanks, guys,” Musk said, after briefly dancing on stage alongside the company’s Optimus robots.Musk described the Optimus robots, which have not gone into mass production, as the future of the company and of humanity. He reiterated a claim that it would be “the biggest product of all time”, and suggested they could be used in everything from healthcare to prisons.“You now get a free Optimus and it’s just going to follow you around and stop you from doing crime,” Musk said. “You don’t have to put people in prisons and stuff. It’s really wild to think of the possibilities.”Musk had previously said he wanted the pay package for more control over the company and exert “strong influence over this robot army” that he vowed to build as the company branches into robotics.Musk’s staggering compensation is comparative with the GDP of entire countries, exceeding that of Ireland, Sweden and Argentina. It vastly exceeds federal funding for entire government programs such as annual cost of Snap food benefits and dwarfs that of other tech moguls such as Mark Zuckerberg.Critics of the package, including some investors, argued that awarding Musk concentrated power in one erratic leader and ignored the challenges the company has faced.“Elon Musk just got $1tn for failure. Sales are down, safety risks are up, and his politics are driving customers away. This isn’t leadership – it’s the world’s most expensive participation trophy,” the protest groupTeslaTakedown said in a statement.If Musk delivers on the lofty milestones in the pay package laid out at the annual meeting, he could become the world’s first trillionaire. To do so, he would need to guide Tesla to $8.5tn in market capitalization, eight times what it’s worth today. He would also be required to deploy millions of autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, and sustain the company’s bottom line in the hundreds of billions over the next decade.The major goals of the compensation plan, split into 12 tranches, lay out a path for Tesla to reach that enormous market capitalization. If he brings the company to that financial height, Musk would be able to cash in on an additional 12% of the company’s stocks. To do so, he has to be vested in the company for at least seven and a half years. He would also have to help develop a long-term succession plan for the company he has led for more than 20 years.Elon Musk’s $56bn Tesla pay package rejected again by US judgeRead moreThe stock options provided by the new compensation plan, on top of shares guaranteed to him in his 2018 package, would leave Musk with 25% ownership of Tesla’s stock. As of 5 November, Tesla stock was trading close to its 52-week high, at about $450 per share.Over the course of a decade, Musk is required to deliver 20m of Tesla’s electric vehicles to buyers, sell 10m active full self-driving subscriptions, develop and sell 1m humanoid robots and deploy 1m robotaxis in commercial service.Musk will also be required to bring the company to $400bn in actual earnings for four consecutive quarters. Tesla’s actual earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $4.2bn, down 9% from the year prior.As of November, Musk’s net worth was $460bn, the highest in the world, according toBloomberg’s Billionaire Index.Reviving a rescinded packageShareholders also approved a plan that would compensate Musk after his 2018 compensation plan was invalidated by a court in Delaware. The pay plan, worth an estimated $56bn, was challenged by a single stockholder, who won his case. The Delaware court of chancery rejected Musk’s pay package twice.After Musk’s 2018 pay package was first rescinded, he moved Tesla’s corporate homefrom Delaware to Texas. He followed suit withSpaceXand other companies’ headquarters. In 2024, under Texas law, shareholders once again voted to approve the pay package.But Delaware’s so-called “court of equity” once again ruled against one of the largest CEO payouts in modern history. Following that unfavorable ruling, Muskvoiced displeasure with the state and its “activist chief judge”, arguably fueling a series of corporate exits that Delaware lawmakers have attempted to staunch with legislation.“He had a big megaphone,” said Lawrence Hamermesh, Widener University Delaware Law School professor emeritus and a former corporate lawyer. “I think there’s more to the movement than just Elon stirring the pot, but I think that had some effect.”In considering whether Musk had undue influence in being awarded that 2018 pay package,Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School professor, noted that the judge recognized that other “superstar CEOs” like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos were not awarded these kinds of incentive-based contracts.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

She seized it with style and gleeRead moreShe died peacefully, surrounded by her family, in her care home in Highgate, north London, having had Parkinson’s disease for several years, they said.Collins starred in the first series of the BBC sitcom The Liver Birds but did not become a household name until landing a regular role in Upstairs, Downstairs in 1971. She married her fellow actor John Alderton in 1969. Her role in the 1989 film Shirley Valentine earned her an Oscar nomination and a Bafta for best actress.Her family said on Thursday: “Pauline was so many things to so many people, playing a variety of roles in her life. A bright, sparky, witty presence on stage and screen. Her illustrious career saw her play politicians, mothers and queens.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with Maggie Smith in the 2012 film Quartet.Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock“She will always be remembered as the iconic, strong-willed, vivacious and wise Shirley Valentine – a role that she made all her own. We were familiar with all those parts of her because her magic was contained in each one of them.“More than anything, though, she was our loving mum, our wonderful grandma and great-grandma. Warm, funny, generous, thoughtful, wise, she was always there for us. And she was John’s [Alderton’s] lifelong love. A partner, work collaborator and wife of 56 years.“We particularly want to thank her carers: angels who looked after her with dignity, compassion and, most of all, love. She could not have had a more peaceful goodbye. We hope you will remember her at the height of her powers; so joyful and full of energy; and give us the space and privacy to contemplate a life without her.”Collins had taken the role of Shirley Valentine in the stage version in London’s West End and New York’s Broadway before appearing in the film adaptation alongside Tom Conti.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with her husband, John Alderton, in 1973 in an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockBorn in Exmouth, Devon, in 1940, Collins was raised near Liverpool and started out as a teacher. She switched to acting and after appearing as Samantha Briggs in Doctor Who in 1967 she was offered another 39 episodes but turned them down.In a2012 interview with the Guardian, Collins said the opportunity felt “like a prison sentence”. “Maybe it would have given me a profile early in my career but then I would have missed so many things,” she said.Her TV credits also include the UK’s first medical soap, Emergency Ward 10. There followed one series of No, Honestly, in which she and Alderton played a married couple.In 2005, Collins starred as Miss Flite in the BBC’s adaptation of Bleak House. In 2013 she appeared in Quartet, Dustin Hoffman’s directing debut, playing a former opera singer diagnosed with dementia.On being offered the role, Collins told the Guardian at the time: “Surprises. That’s what I love about this business. Even at my age you can get surprises. I thought he [Hoffman] doesn’t even know me.”Collins’s film credits include City of Joy alongside Patrick Swayze, Paradise Road and Mrs Caldicot’s Cabbage War, in which she appeared alongside her husband.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with Patrick Swayze in the 1992 film City of Joy.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockAlderton said: “Pauline Collins was a remarkable star. I had the great good fortune to have worked with her more than any other actor in our many TV series, films and West End stage shows together and watched her genius at close quarters.“What I saw was not only her brilliant range of diverse characters but her magic of bringing out the best in all of the people she worked with. She wanted everyone to be special and she did this by never saying ‘look at me’. It’s no wonder that she was voted the nation’s sweetheart in the 1970s.“She will always be remembered for Shirley Valentine, not only for her Oscar nomination or the film itself, but for clean-sweeping all seven awards when she portrayed her on Broadway in the stage play, in which she played every character herself. But her greatest performance was as my wife and mother to our beautiful children.”Dame Joanna Lumley, who acted alongside Collins in Shirley Valentine, also paid tribute to the “unforgettable” actor.She said: “We only shared one afternoon, filming a scene for Shirley Valentine, but in that short time I could see at once why she became a blazing star.“The blend of truthfulness and soulful naivety with impeccable comic timing and mischief made her unforgettable.”Russell T Davies, who worked with the actor on the 2006 Doctor Who episode Tooth and Claw, wrote on Instagram: “It was such an honour to have her on set, I was in awe … Oh she was salty and wonderful, and the finest of actors.“As for Shirley Valentine, as writer Matthew Todd says today: ‘Says more about UK life at that time than any history book ever could.’ A true star. And she’d laugh at that.”The actor James Dreyfus wrote on X: “Had the enormous pleasure to briefly, but memorably, share the screen with this remarkable actress. RIP Pauline Collins.”The author Morris Bright wrote on X: “I’ve led a little life & even that will be over pretty soon. I’ve allowed myself to lead this little life when inside me there was much more. She couldn’t have given us more. Shirley Valentine star Pauline Collins has died at 85.

The three remaining players, Carr, Olusoga and Mohammed, voted to end the game, after which the comedian revealed himself to be a traitor.The Celebrity Traitors final review – what an absolute blinder!Read moreThe final challenge involved a steam train journey in which the contestants had to retrieve five gold bars in 20 minutes before the train exploded. They managed to escape and add £20,000 to the prize fund.The comedian said the prize money would go to a children’s cancer charity for neuroblastoma.Carr was overcome with emotion after he declared “I am and have always been a traitor”, adding: “I’m so sorry, it’s been tearing me apart.”He was then comforted by Olusoga and Mohammed, who said: “You did brilliantly.”Carr revealed to the faithfuls the identity of the other traitors, Burns andJonathan Ross, who was banished at a roundtable earlier in the series, leaving Mohammed to cover his mouth in shock.Who is Joe Marler? From hair-raising rugby antics to breakout star of Celebrity TraitorsRead moreThe Ted Lasso star said: “Alan Carr. He played an absolute blinder.”Carr’s victory concluded the first celebrity version of theBBCmurder mystery gameshow. Only one of the three non-celebrity UK series was won by a traitor.The series was notable forthe ineptitude of the faithful. Only two traitors were banished; in the each of three non-celebrity series there were five traitors banished.The finale wasaccidentally released online more than 24 hours before its UK airtime. Viewers in Canada reported being able to view the episode in its entirety before it was pulled by the television network Crave.Before the final, Burns said she did not believe she was a good liar, despite having avoided suspicion until the end of the series.Appearing on BBC Radio 2’s Breakfast Show, Scott Mills asked her if the show had made her realise she was an excellent liar. Burns replied: “I don’t think I am though. I don’t think I am that great of a liar. My mum watches me and she is like: ‘I can just tell that you are lying.’ But that’s the fun of the game isn’t it?”Ed Gamble, who hosts the show’s companion programme, Uncloaked, said he considered the viral moment of Celia Imrie’s fart to be the highlight of the series, joking it had “altered the dynamic of guffs”.The comedian told BBC Breakfast: “I know there’s so much more that goes into this show, it’s such an incredible team, it looks beautiful, these huge, sweeping shots of the beautiful Highlands, but there’s nothing funnier than a fart, especially when it comes from a national treasure.“Maybe in the future we will see more open farting followed by a swift admission. There will be no need for ‘he who smelled it, dealt it’ from now on – Celia has altered the dynamics of guffs.”The programme had an average of 12.6m viewers across the first four episodes.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsBBC OneBBCEd GambleTelevision industryDavid OlusogaJonathan RossnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the word,” Verbeekwrote in his newsletter, The Planet.“Here, taking care of one another through public programs isn’t radical socialism. It’s Tuesday.”That view hit on the wide differences in how Mamdani’s promises are seen by many across the Atlantic. “Europeans recognize his vision about free public transit and universal childcare. We expect our governments to make these kinds of services accessible to all of us,” said Verbeek. “We pay higher taxes and get civilized societies in return. The debate here isn’t whether to have these programs, but how to improve them.”More than a decade ago, Tallinn, the Estonian capital, became the largest city in the world tointroduce fare-free public transport. Financed by the city’s resident tax, the scheme faced heavy opposition before its rollout, with some describing it as a political stunt that the city couldn’t afford.Nearly a year later, researchersfoundthat public transport use had increased by 14% and that the mobility of low-income residents had improved. Similar schemes have since sprung up across the continent, in France’sMontpellierandDunkirk, for example, and expanded across countries in the case ofLuxembourgandMalta.When Mamdani promised to launch one city-owned grocery story in each of New York’s five boroughs, with a view to expanding if the pilot was successful, it reminded Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, of the city-run grocery store she had visited in Istanbul in 2014.Back then, she had been surprised to see the heaving shelves, laden with products that ranged from bread to lentils to basic household appliances, much of it provided by small, little-known manufacturers. Access to these stores was limited to low-income households, with families receiving a preloaded monthly loyalty card to use at these shops, she said. “These city-run grocery stores in Istanbul were successful and replicated by other cities.”More than a decade on, the experience convinced her of the viability of Mamdani’s promise. “I was struck by the fact that New York elite and Republicans wanted to paint these proposals as sort of coming from the moon,” she said. “Things like non-profit stores or free buses, these are not outrageous ideas, nor are they socialist. They’ve been tried in different parts of the world.”For New Yorkers, precedents for city-run grocery stores can also be found closer to home. Chicago ismullingsimilar plans, whileAtlantaandSt Paul, Kansashave launched their own takes on municipal-run grocery stores.Mamdani’s campaign also promised to make childcare free for all children in the city, ages six weeks to five years. Days before the election, the state of New Mexico provided the city with a precedent-setting example,becoming the first US stateto offer free childcare to all of its residents, in an effort to boost its economy and raise education and child welfare levels.Across the Atlantic, Portugal’s government began introducing free childcare in 2022,starting withchildren ages one and under with promises to gradually expand the program to children up to the age of three. While the program is open to all, places are limited and can be tough to access, with priority given to low-income and single-parent families.In Berlin, childcarehas been free for childrenfrom their first birthday until they start school since 2018, though centres are allowed to levy additional charges for provisions such as lunches and extracurricular activities. Across the Nordic countries, free childcare is not universal, but is heavily subsidised by the state for most families.Mamdani’s platform also included a promise to provide new parents with a free baby basket that includes items such as diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, swaddles and books. In Finland,the baby boxhas been a universal benefit since 1949 and has sincebeen emulatedby nearly 100 programs in 60 countries around the world.How Mamdani built an ‘unstoppable force’ that won over New YorkRead moreThe sharp contrast in how Mamdani’s policies were seen within the US and abroad probably has much to do with the scant existence of a welfare state in the US, writer Mary Holland noted this week. “To anyone living in a western European state, the self-professed democratic socialist’s ideas probably sound entirely reasonable,” she wrotein Monocle.“But to many Americans, they’re wildly ambitious – radical, even.”Perhaps the most widely panned of Mamdani’s ideas is his vow to freeze rent for nearly 1 million rent-stabilised tenants in the city. The former US treasury secretary Larry Summers was among those who slammed the idea, writing on social media that rent control was the “second-best way to destroy a city, after bombing”.In 2020, Berlin passed a law that resulted in a five-year rent freeze, at June 2019 levels, for 90% of the flats in the city. While the law offered relief to about 1.5 million households who had seen rents rise by an estimated third in the six years prior, itwas ruled as unconstitutionalin 2021 after Germany’s highest court sided with landlords and property investment lobbyists who had argued it was inappropriate and illegal for the state to meddle with the private market.A 2022 paper, however, marked out an interesting impact of the short-lived measure,in that it foundthat while rent control was in place, residents were seemingly more receptive to new housing developments in their area. The finding suggests that if Mamdani is able to carry out the rent freezes as promised, it could help to pave the way forhis promiseto also triple the city’s production of affordable homes.Perhaps the strongest precedent, however, for rent freezes comes from New York’s own recent history. In the past 10 years, during Bill de Blasio’s tenure as mayor, members of the city’s rent guidelines board voted to freeze the rent four times, one former member of the New York City rent guidelines board, Leah Goodridge,noted recentlyin the Guardian. “This is why criticisms of Mamdani’s rent freeze ring hollow for me – it’s painted as out of touch, yet there’s already a precedent, backed by government reports and data.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkEuropeSocialismUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But my features can be’: Fiona Shaw on Austen, Andor and Harry PotterAs told toAmy FlemingThe actor answers your questions about slipping swearwords into Disney shows, breakfast with Terrence Malick and lunch with Richard GriffithsThu 6 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.15 ESTShareYour funeral speech in Andor was a huge highlight of a showsurprisingly packed with anti-fascist sentiment (we all know that when you said “Fight the Empire!”you really wanted to use a different f-wordthere).Did you know at the time just how apt the whole show would be in theUS political climate?notanauthorityI did say a different word in my speech, and the writer hoped that Disney were OK with it, so we kept the strong f-word right to the end. And then I think some executive buckled, so it became “fight the Empire”. It was filmed after the first Trump incumbency, when there was another president, so it wasn’t overtly connected to the America that is now.When I performed that speech, I was filmed by about 200 cameras so they could make a hologram. I was alone in a huge studio, no director or crew inthe room with me. There was a “God” mic – somebody spoke to me remotely saying, “We’ll do that again”. It was quite scary.What can you tell us about the upcoming adaptation of Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility?bumble1We’ve just finished shooting it, and the one thing an actor does not see is the film. It was filmed by the really lovely Georgia Oakley, who is very assured. And we filmed in these beautifulhouses around Britain, including in Dorset, Knebworth and Devonshire. The scale was thrilling. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a carriage with four horses. Although the truth of swanning about in posh houses is that you’re 13 hours in a corset and wigs, but I’m sure the outcome will be well worth it.The best part of anyHarry Potter filmwas watching you and thelate Richard Griffithson screen together.How much did you enjoy the experience, and how did you prepare for those scenes with each other?sesposito01Richard was the most elegant, artistic and talented man. He had the most mellifluous handwriting and once sent me a note to say, “Will you join me for lunch?” in sort of gothic lettering. He spoke non-stop. On set he was always telling me and the two boys, Harry [Melling, who played Dudley Dursley] and Daniel [Radcliffe, Harry Potter] interesting anecdotes and facts.He had fantastic general knowledge so we would sit in thrall to him.View image in fullscreenRichard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon), Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley) and Shaw (Aunt Petunia) in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007).Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarYou gave a beautifully nuanced performance[as Mrs Croft] in the Jane Austen drama Persuasion(1995), when you spoke about voyages with your husband, and said you never felt afraid as long as you were together. You looked into the distance as if having genuine memories.It was very touching. How muchwas preparationand how muchwas spontaneous?IrishstewforteaThe director,Roger Michell, who is also now departed prematurely, had said no wigs and no lighting except candlelight. He really wanted to get the experience of what it was like in the early part of the 19th century. He’d asked me to read a book about maritime life which opened up for me a world beyond the pages of Jane Austen’s book, including illegitimacy and prostitution. These things Austen never wrote about, but very often her characters are touched by this sort of thing.Mrs Croft is in love with the admiral, went on board with him and would have slept in a hammock, at a time when most women married in order to get a roof over their head. Your happiness was not necessarily the priority. Mrs Croftdidmake her happiness a priority, and the result was she had a much more interesting life, but she would have seen terrible things.Roger would only do three takes, so I knew I had to really play that moment as intensely as I could.I saw your amazing performance ofMedeaon Broadwayin 2002. It must have been so emotionally demanding. How could you do it again night after night?vjanewindsorI met one of the chorus members three years later, who said: “I’m not over it yet.” It started in Dublin, and then a year later came to London, followed by Washington DC, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and then Broadway. It had been running for over two years when we finished it in Paris. Actors’cars were being towed away in London because they never got home. We only had summer clothes, and now it was winter. We all just got stranded on Broadway, which was bonding for the group.The preparation of it was to try to take the zenith of what the situation was,dare to look at it and dare to stay sympathetic to everybody in the story. You must never judge any of these people. We went running as a group before the show, which meant we spent time together, and each night we played a very silly ball game, which unified us all and was an alternative to the content of the play.You have playedmythic characters and deeply human ones. Do you feel myth helps us understand humanity? Or does humanity make myth resonate?TVbydayI think myth is a way of dealing with the incomprehensible. The Greeks were very clever, putting logic on one side of an argumentand logic on the other. And the two points of viewmeet and clash. And somewhere in the middle, a truth emerges, for that evening.You made me laugh so hard inLondon Assurance(2010) at the Nationaland you seem to slipeasily betweencomedy and drama. Do you find it easier to perform in one or the other?Ozwriter22Comedy connects us as it’s about rupturing the norm. The best comedy is probably in our families where we understand the norms, but it isn’t easy to play. The night before a comedy, I always sleep badly, because you have to catch the wave on the day, and you have to hope that the moment lands correctly. Nearly all drama has comedy and tragedy in it. The difference is that in comedy the characters override their circumstances, but in tragedy they are overpowered by them.View image in fullscreenFiona Shaw as Lady Gay Spanker in London Assurance.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianYou’ve played some wildly disparate characters, but always slipped into their skin utterly convincingly. Were there any you found particularly hard, and if so, how did you approach it?What were your hardest roles?Seawitch3I find them all hard. But even if the person you’re playing is quite far away from you, there is often something about them that you recognise. Sometimes you find your way into the character through the language, sometimes you find it through the costume. Sometimes you find it through worrying about it all night, and sometimes you have to just abandon yourself to it. I found Electra hard, as it had no humour, and I found Mistress Millamant hard as it was too near me at the time.I try to approach each character in a different way, which has always made the experience like a first time. I try to start knowing nothing so I find a new way into the new territory, but of course, in the end, you look in the mirror, and it is always you.I really enjoyed your recent performance inHot Milk. I wondered how you prepare yourself for playing a character like Rose, making her sympathetic, while still so corrosive in her daughter’s life.Buffalo666I really liked Rose. I loved that she likes literature. The story hints at ambiguity as to why she cannot walk – but sometimes she can. She has a functional neurological disorder, which I did some investigation into and it’s a very upsetting ailment, the source of which is hard to identify. It may be that one’s neurological misfirings are connected to an emotional past. For the sake of the story, that was the case, but in fact it is as varied as the people who suffer from it. But Rose doesn’t know she has that, and certainly doesn’t know that anything is connected to her past or her history. So very often, what you’re playing is what the character doesn’t know.View image in fullscreenEmma Mackey and Fiona Shaw in Hot Milk.Photograph: Nikos Nikolopoulos/MubiOf course, she’s a terrible woman, but you can’t play anything from that point of view. She is blind to the effect she has on her daughter. All she knows is that she wants to get better. She’s benign and blind. Perhaps that’s what most of us are.You are the perfect gang boss/mafia leader/secret service head honcho. Your face says: “I’m going to kill with my intellect, but if you’re still around after that I’ll send one of my people round to finish you off.” Do you agree?I’m sure you’re lovely butI’d be a little bit scared by you in real life, sorry!AmongstTheWavesOh dear! I’m so not scary. But maybe when infused with intention, my features can be. I am in life sometimes quite scatty so maybe it’s redemptive for me to play very intelligent, organised characters. I try to play interesting people so I never judge them. Don’t be scared – come and say hello!At university, a lecturer showed us a tape of you performingThe Waste Land, and it blew me away. Is your heart always there in the poetry, even in a big-budget production?HamesJoyceMy heart is always in the language, because the clues to everything are there in the choice of words. The sound of the word usually has a hinterland of many more meanings than just the word. Poetry is the refined version of language, or the moment that has been captured.View image in fullscreenFiona Shaw performs The Waste Land in 1987.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhen people boil down to what they really want to say, it’s often poetic. They get down to very old words at the moment of intensity. So I am always looking for the poetry, even in scripts, and it’s usually in one line which sticks out, which I call the “plumb line”. And that line is your key.I love listening to audiobooks read by you. You performedAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland so brilliantly, and many others too. What is reading an audiobook like for you?Sunshine2000I loved reading Alice in Wonderland because I put everybody I knew into it – my friends and other actors. So I did the caterpillar as Alan Rickman, and the Red Queen was Geraldine McEwan. I read the The Mill on the Floss, too, and it always seems a privilege to sit and speak literature – but it takes days and days.What was it like working withTerrence Malickon Tree of Life?PunCrockEverything Terrence Malick says and does is different. He left a message on my answering machine, which said, “I wonder, would you come and help me with my film?” We went out for breakfast. He said, “Well, what are you going to have?” I said, “I’m going to have scrambled eggs.” He said, “I think I’ll have scrambled eggs too,” like it was the most exotic choice in the world.One of his extraordinary approaches was to say “Would you like to do this scene indoors or outdoors?” These are questions you’re never asked by a film-maker. He only used natural light, so you could either do the scene inside, by a window, or you could perform it on the street.He takes about three years to edit the film. I had heard from the producer about two years into this that I was probably one of the main characters, but by the time the film came out, I was nearly gone. He builds this huge edifice, and he takes most things away. He unbuilds films.Park Avenueis in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewFiona ShawinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This isn’t entirely surprising given ourinformation overloadand increasedburnout rates. When the present feels overwhelming, we tend to look back to eras that feel simpler, more familiar, even comforting.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The 90s are a kind of cultural palate cleanser: pared-back style, analogue pleasures and a reminder of life before never-ending notifications and algorithmic scrolling. Beauty was playful – think Pamela Anderson’sfrosted lipsorGwen Stefani’s hot pink hair;fashionswung between supermodel glam and DIY-infused rebellion started by the grunge music scene; and technology was charmingly clunky but endlessly fun, from Tamagotchi pets to digital watches.Happily, you don’t need a time machine – or a house full of Beanie Babies – to bring a little 90s magic into your present day. Many brands are reissuing cult products, while new ones pay tribute to the aesthetic with a wink and a welcome upgrade.Whether you’re after a perfume that evokes the decade, a nod to the bands that soundtracked it, or just something steeped in end-of-the-century cool, here are the 15 best ideas.The best 1990s Christmas giftsFor retro tech fansView image in fullscreenSaint Laurent × Lomographyfilm camera£50 at YSLLomography was the decade’s cool-kid way of turning everyday moments into arty, grainy, offbeat shots, laden with endless creative options. Saint Laurent has given the cult 35mm “Lomo” a sleek monochrome makeover, pre-loaded with 27 frames of black-and-white film, ready to refill once you’re done. Plus, receiving the physical snaps after they’ve been developed is such a nostalgic joy.View image in fullscreenTamagotchi Original£20 at Argos£19.99 at AmazonFew playground fads defined the 90s like Tamagotchis – digital pets that lived (and often died) in your pocket. The reissued versions look just like the originals, complete with eggshell case and bleepy demands for food, games and attention. Nostalgia, responsibility and digital chaos wrapped into one tiny keyring – ideal for kids who want a pet, and adults who still can’t keep a plant alive.View image in fullscreenCasio vintage watch£43.90 at TH Baker£43.90 at CasioIf the 90s had a wrist uniform, it was a Casio. Equal parts indie cool and computer-club chic, this reissue keeps the square face, digital display and backlight glow intact, with heritage colours to choose from. And yes, the alarm still beeps.For nostalgic beauty loversView image in fullscreenLancôme Juicy Tubes£20.80 at Lancôme£19.50 at John LewisNothing says 90s quite like a Juicy Tube. Glossy, sticky in the best way and sweetly scented, it was once the school-disco essential. Now back with an updated formula, it still gives that MTV-ready shine, only in better shades. Tickled pink is my favourite – it’s a beautiful, suits-all shade that gives your lips a hint of colour.View image in fullscreenCK One Essence Intense unisex perfume£31 at John Lewis£43 at BootsIf CK One was arevolution– a unisex fragrance, and an ad campaign shot by Steven Meisel, featuring Kate Moss – this reboot is its grownup, moodier sibling. Twice as concentrated as the original, it blends zesty bergamot and blood orange with green tea, sandalwood and upcycled musk. Still clean and androgynous, it’s a modern twist on a genderless scent icon. I could still smell it at the end of a long day.View image in fullscreenUrban Decay naked eyeshadow sticks£20 at John Lewis£25 at Cult BeautyUrban Decay made its name in the 90s with grunge-girl shades and irreverent names. These new shadow sticks are a slick update: creamy, long-lasting colour in 90s-inspired shades, from champagne shimmer to matt brown. They’re easy to swipe on (and worked perfectly for my daily tube makeup-application ritual) and channel your inner riot grrrl or Spice Girl – whatever your preference.For throwback fashion fansView image in fullscreenAdidas Oasis Tour bucket hat£40 at AdidasNothing screams Britpop like a bucket hat, and 90s legends Oasis turned it into a swaggering uniform. Adidas’s take keeps it classic: black, understated, endlessly wearable. Pair with a parka and a pint, and you’ve basically got a backstage pass to Knebworth 96.View image in fullscreenDr Martens Jadon Wednesday platform bootsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Made in collaboration with the Netflix show Wednesday, they have a subtle spiderweb design, chunky platform sole, oversized eyelets and, of course, the signature DM yellow stitching. They channel the era of nu-metal and stripy arm warmers – only now they’re comfier, sturdier and built for stomping through real life, not just the mosh pit. I haven’t taken them off, and they break in much more easily than they used to.View image in fullscreenMinga London Rek earring set£24 at Minga LondonChunky silver with spikes was the jewellery of choice for those who spent the 90s in their local grimy rock club or getting piercings at Blue Banana. Minga London riffs on the era with ultra-cool statement jewellery that’s equal parts Camden market nostalgia and fashion-forward Rick Owens edge. I get stacks of compliments whenever I wear these.For a retro revival homeView image in fullscreenDiscotheque Kinky G candle£54 at Cult Beauty£54 at SephoraThis candle channels the heady rush of a proper 90s night out. Notes of coconut cream and cherry pie melt into white peach and almond, evoking perfume-filled dancefloors, and lip gloss applied in the loos. Light it to create your own 90s kitchen disco – it smells like going out-out in the very best way.View image in fullscreenMr Maria × Smiley Bundle of Light lamp£18 at Mori£17 at Urban OutfittersNothing says 90s like the yellow Smiley face, once splashed across rave flyers and playground notebooks. This portable lamp gives out a soft, ambient glow that is part nostalgia trip, part mood-booster (larger sizes are also available).View image in fullscreenJonathan Adler Vice weed canister£30 at Jonathan AdlerA playful nod to the 90s hazy counterculture, this ceramic stash jar is as chic as it is cheeky. With bold lettering and a glossy finish, it’s a contemporary upgrade on shoeboxes under the bed, although naturally you’ll now be using it for storing jewellery and trinkets like I do (won’t you?).For old-school culture fansView image in fullscreenVinyl Deli subscriptionFrom £28 at Vinyl DeliFor the friend who still insists music sounds better on vinyl, Vinyl Deli hand-picks records each month based on your taste – like mixtape culture reborn.

Here’s what to know about getting more in your dietAdrienne MateiThu 6 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.08 ESTShareBeans are affordable, accessible and versatile –deliciousin dense salads and creamy sauces alike.They grow worldwide and are good for the planet,enrichingthe soil they sprout from with nitrogen while emitting fewer greenhouse gases and requiringsignificantly lessland and water per gram of protein than any animal source. Thanks to enormous diversity, more than 400 varieties are used in culinary contexts, some of which aregorgeousto boot.Yet fewer than20%of Americans eat the daily half cup of beans recommended by health authorities, and in the UK more than40%of the population eat no beans at all. Crucially, they are healthy – with a capital “H”. What makes them so? And should we make room for more beans in our diet?Are beans nutritious?Beans “definitely don’t get enough love, in my opinion”, says Roxana Ehsani, a Miami-based registered sports dietitian, “but they’re really a true nutritional powerhouse”. That’s because beans are a good source of both fiber and protein while being free of saturated fat, says Ehsani. One cup of cooked beans will net you about 18g of protein, about 32% of the daily recommended amount for a 155lb adult.You may have heard that beans are not a “complete” source of protein, meaning they don’t provide all nine of the amino acids our bodies need for optimal health. But Ehsani says that anyone eating beans along with other protein sources throughout the day, such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, eggs, dairy and/or animal protein, is more than covering their bases.Beans are also packed with “shortfall” nutrients: micronutrients that can fall through the cracks of our typical eating habits. One recentstudyby the University of Toronto nutrition researcher Yanni Papanikolaou focused on the effect of adding a serving or two of beans to the typical American diet. Papanikolaou, who has been studying the nutritional relevance of beans since 2007, determined that adding one daily serving of beans to the average diet boosts fiber intake by 77%, and is better for restoring shortfall nutrients than taking a multivitamin.“When you consume a whole food like beans, you not only get several shortfall nutrients, like dietary fiber, potassium, magnesium, folate and choline, but also many other plant bioactives that together have synergistic effects,” says Papanikolaou. “Improved diet quality has been linked to reduced risk of death and a better quality of life.”Are beans a healthier protein source than red meat?While red meat in moderation can be part of a balanced diet, beans are an overall healthier protein source thanks to their high fiber and low fat content.Americans and people in theUKeat about a pound of red and processed meat a week, exceeding the upper limitsuggestedby health authorities like the American Heart Association by roughly 25%.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Substituting beans for some of that red meat would cut saturated fat intake. An excess ofsaturated fatis associated with elevated diabetes risk and worse cardiovascular health, raising “bad” LDL cholesterol and promoting the formation of plaque in arteries.“When people substitute beans for red meats, their cardiovascular disease risk lessens,” says Dr Teresa Fung, a professor of nutrition at Simmons University and member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee for the US Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. (The committee recentlyadvisedthe federal government to emphasize beans as a protein source over meat in the official dietary guidelines.) The high fiber content of beans can help lower bad cholesterol, which can reduce the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease.Beans’ low glycemic index and “high fiber content can help keep our blood sugar stable so we’re not experiencing spikes or falls” that can contribute to the development of diabetes, adds Ehsani.Can beans help with weight loss?Beans’ high protein and fiber content help “keep you full for longer so you’re less likely to overeat” or snack between meals, says Ehsani. They’re also a lower-calorie substitute for red or processed meats.Papanikolaou’s research found that adults who ate about two cups of beans a day “weighed 2.5kg [5.5lb] less and had waists that were 2.3cm [0.9in] smaller than those who avoided beans altogether”, he says.“Adult dietary patterns with increased bean consumption are associated with lower added sugar, improved weight-related outcomes and better diet quality,” he adds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhy is adequate fiber intake important?You probably know that fiber is really good for you. But what exactly does it do?“Fiber is a prebiotic. It’s fuel for the good gut bacteria” in the stomach, says Fung. The gas we associate with eating beans is “produced by the bacteria in our gut fermenting the bean’s insoluble fiber”, which gels in our intestines, trapping bad cholesterol, she explains. That fermentation process creates beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which lower inflammation, support immunity and improve metabolism.If you’re not used to eating a lot of fiber, it can take time to adjust to the growth and activity of your intestinal flora. If you’re interested in increasing your bean uptake, start with a small amount – like a quarter cup added to a wrap or salad, Fung advises: “Let your digestive system and the bacteria get used to it.”Soy, oat, almond, rice: how healthy are alternative milks?Read moreOver time, this microbial partnership pays off. “Having regular and more poops has numerous benefits,” says Papanikolaou, “including better overall digestive health and function, improved removal of waste and toxic compounds, and reduced risk of bloating and constipation. All of these factors combined lead to a substantial improvement in wellbeing, which translates to a happier individual.”What is the best way to eat beans?Dried and canned beans are equally nutritious. However, the latter require less time to prepare. If you’re using canned beans, “rinse off the solution that they’re sitting in”, says Ehsani. “There’s someresearchshowing that rinsing them can reduce the sodium in canned beans by about 40%.”Dried beans need time to soak and cook. Fung suggests cooking them on the weekend, then freezing them in small portions. “I call these my emergency protein,” she says. “When I’m really busy and I have no time to cook, I can just defrost some.”Beans contain from 4mg to 7mg of iron per cup, but that iron is a little different, and harder for the body to absorb, than the iron that comes from animal products. To get more plant-based iron from your beans, eating them alongside vitamin C-rich ingredients – for instance, sprinkling them on a vibrant salad dressed with lemon – can help you absorb their iron content better.And don’t forget about bean products like tempeh and miso, which undergo fermentation processes that help make somemicronutrientslike vitamin B12, iron and polyphenols more bioavailable.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyBeans, pulses and legumesHealthFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without him, though, it might have been harder to take this film’s rather redundant, laborious dramatic gestures and its macho-sensitive narcissism. Even with Day-Lewis, in fact, there are tricky moments in the dialogue, and at the end of each of the two big speeches you might imagine a drama teacher saying: “… and … scene!”Yet Day-Lewis’s instinctive command of the moment and address to the camera – that fascinating theatricality and artifice visible in even his most realist performances – make him endlessly watchable. He is supposed to be playing a former army sergeant here. I’d put his rank higher than that. It is a movie that Day-Lewis co-wrote with his son Ronan, who also directs. It’s about a father coming to terms with his neglect of his son. We must make of that what we will.Day-Lewis plays Ray, a man living an ascetic, hermit existence in a remote forest hut somewhere near the coast in Britain in the late 1990s, radiating angry integrity and self-reliance, and cultivating the anemones that his father also used to grow. Watching this, I realised how much I want to see Day-Lewis play Timon of Athens.Out of the blue, Ray’s brother Jem (played by Sean Bean) shows up on a mission to ask Ray to go home to his wife Nessa (Samantha Morton) and teen son Brian (Samuel Bottomley) – though this is the family Ray left long ago, with whom Jem has actually been living as husband and father, to Ray’s seething rage.‘Handbags at dawn’: Daniel Day-Lewis discusses his method acting conflict with Brian CoxRead moreBrian has followed his dad by joining the army and is in deep trouble for violent brawling. He needs to reconnect with his dad, and both father and son (and brother) need to expunge their toxic masculinity and hurt. Ray must come to terms with the abuse done to him, and must talk about why he was forced out of the army after his last tour of duty in Northern Ireland, many years before. When we hear about those terrible events during the Troubles, though, it is a bit of a cheat. It’s made clear that Ray really isn’t guilty of anything that we might consider culpable – and yet Day-Lewis sells it magnificently. He can’t help looking like an exiled emperor.This is a movie with, in the Scots phrase, no small opinion of itself; a movie of big scenes, big performances, big images, epiphanies and hallucinations. Not all of them work, but the presence of Day-Lewis settles and moors it.Anemone is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDaniel Day-LewisPeriod and historical filmsSamantha MortonSean BeanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: El Salvador’s Presidency press office/AFP/Getty ImagesDays before we ran interviews with gang leaders describing their alleged ties to Nayib Bukele’s government, we left the country to avoid arrest. We fear our exile will never endThis story, republished with permission, was originally run byEl Faro EnglishByÓscar Martínez and Carlos MartínezThu 6 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareWe figured we would spend only a few days out of the country. We figured that within a week of publishing, some other matter would distract the Salvadoran government. We would weigh the risks of returning and would then go back. We left with carry-on bags: no one was carrying more than 10 pairs of underwear.We had invented a routine for these situations, which had worked out fine so many times before: “preventive departure”. One of us, for the first time, mentioned that the government would make us pay dearly. But we kept repeating “preventive departure”. We kept repeating it a week later, two weeks later, a month after we could not return.The reason for our preventive departure was a series of videos our newspaper, El Faro, was about to publish.The first instalment– titled Charli’s Confessions: Interview with a Gang Leader on His Secret Pacts with Nayib Bukele – was published in early May. By then, the journalists who had done the interviews were in different locations: New York, Mexico City, Guatemala City, Los Angeles.In El Salvador, the popular dictator Nayib Bukele is the king of social media. Thumbs up, hearts, comments and views are the currency of his kingdom. His most watched video on YouTube, about the Cecot megaprison – the only Salvadoran prison thatBukele wants the world to see– has racked up more than 4m views in two years. The second most-viewed video on his channel, titled “Why did we destroy the gravestones of gang members?”, has reached more than 3m views in the same span. For the leader of a country like El Salvador, with a population of only about 6 million people, those numbers are huge. And that is just on his channel. Across social media, Bukele is a brand.The first videowas an interviewwith two gang members who had escaped the country with the Bukele government’s help. They described the details of a pact with the dictator’s inner circle that had lasted more than eight years. Within 24 hours, the video surpassed 326,000 views. Two months later,the three instalmentsof the interview series had reached 2m views on YouTube. On the newspaper’s other social media accounts, excerpts from the interview were viewed more than 15m times.Over the course of the three episodes, 93 minutes in total, revelations by the leaders from the 18th Street Revolucionarios destroyed the image of Bukele as the arch-enemy of the gangs. Bukele’s party, they said, had paid the gangs $250,000 to help get him elected mayor of the capital (where he served from 2015 to 2018), back when he was still claiming to be a leftist. The pact continued once he became president and included loopholes that allowed gang members tocontinueextorting and murderingwithout fear of punishment. The gang members also said the Bukele government had ultimatelyhelped both of them escapethe country. (Bukele has publicly denied such allegations and has not been charged.)Abundant evidence previously published by El Faro lent credibility to the gang members’ claims, but in these times, anintelligence document with official stamps and signaturesorpictures from prison security camerashave less weight than a famous fugitive gang leader saying it himself on camera. Many people want reality to be revealed to them like in a Netflix series.Social media is Bukele’s kingdom – he gives orders to his ministers via X, announces his most important political decisions on Facebook Live. The videos of gang members’ confessions conquered that kingdom for several days, just over a month after Bukele had received more than200 Venezuelanssent by Donald Trump to his mega-prison. Bukele, at Trump’s side, had wanted to be seen as the criminals’ nemesis. In the El Faro videos he was shown as the gang members’ political partner.View image in fullscreenEl Salvador president Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office with Donald Trump in April 2025.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersJust three hours after publication, the director of Bukele’s State Intelligence Agency, Peter Dumas, posted on X that we were guilty of several crimes “linked to gangs, drug trafficking, sexual abuse, human trafficking … You can’t hide for ever behind the invisible shield of ‘journalism.’” That same night, a source with detailed internal knowledge warned us that the attorney general’s office was preparing at least seven arrest warrants against members of the El Faro newsroom for crimes related to gangs. Since March 2022, when Bukele declared emergency measures to crack down on gangs, and imposed the “state of exception”,due process has been suspendedfor anyone accused of gang membership: trials are secret, judges are faceless, there can be a single trial for up to900 defendants, preventive detention is unlimited and in many cases the evidence is so flimsy that sometimes they simply say that the detainee was arrested for appearing “nervous”.It seemed we were facing a fate already suffered by tens of thousands of innocent people among the more than 85,000 arrested under the current regime: not a public and scandalous trial, but rather a life in Bukele’s prisons, where, as we have reported in El Faro,torture is systemicand several people with no criminal record or tattoos of any kind have emergeddead with signs of torture. Often the regime’s forensic doctors sanitise prisoners’ autopsies with the refrain “death by pulmonary edema”, which is barely more specific than saying that someone died because they stopped living.A few hours after publishing, we all regretted how little we had packed in our suitcases. “We’re screwed,” said a colleague in a virtual meeting, summing up the collective mood. But the plan remained the same. Report what happened, alert international organisations, publicly confront the threats, give interviews about what we discovered, and come back.The Bukele government resorted to its lowest tactics. Dozens of YouTubers and self-proclaimed “political analysts” accused us of being gang members and demanded our arrest. The dozens of documents published by El Faro,other media outletsand theUS governmentthatvalidated the statementsof the two gang members in our interviews no longer mattered. All that mattered was the affront to the king.On our behalf, a lawyer went to the attorney general’s office to file a formal request for information about allegations against us. The prosecutors had 15 business days to respond. From the moment the letters were written, we suspected that those 15 days, and however many more were needed, would be filled with institutional silence. We were not mistaken.A week after publication, seven El Faro journalists were still out of the country. “I’ll be back on 14 May, I already have my ticket,” said one, and the rest agreed to try around the same time. But as the weeks passed, we would not return, and dozens of other journalists and human rights activists would join us in leaving the country.The idea of returning on 14 May was ruled out within days. The same source continued to assure us that we would be arrested upon enteringEl Salvador, and we had not been able to find a new source to contradict this.For years now, finding sources in El Salvador has been a thorny endeavour. Bukele has publicly expressed his hatred for El Faro, as well as for other media outlets, and in 2020 he even accused us of money laundering on national television. (The accusation forced El Faro to move its legal status to Costa Rica; the newspaper itself is essentially in exile.) In 2022, we revealed that 22 employees at the newspaperhad been hackedwith Pegasus spyware between June 2020 and November 2021. “If you find Pegasus, you know that person has been hacked by a government,” said John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto’s cybersecurity lab, which examined our devices and discovered 226 hacks.Obtaining sources not only became more difficult under Bukele, it also became more expensive. What used to cost us a cup of coffee now involves a whole strategy that, if we are inside the country, includes renting apartments and cars for 24 hours so we can meet people in safe places without being followed; or setting up meetings in foreign cities, if the case is very sensitive and sources only agree to speak outside the country.Even so, during those days in May, after the publication of the videos, we spoke with several sources, police officers, prosecutors and investigators close to government institutions. They all told us that if there were arrest warrants, only a select few would know about them and that they did not have access to that information.In El Salvador, the published videos continued to dominate the discussion on social media. Bukele, as he often does, reacted with a gimmick designed to boost his popularity: five days after our publication, on 5 May, he ordered free public transportation for six days throughout the country, claiming that the closure of the important Los Chorros highway warranted it, even though it only affected a small part of the territory.The first day of free public transportation was chaotic: dozens of Salvadorans hung from the few buses that were running. Those images were splashed across the news, newspapers, and social media. Bukele blamed the transportation companies that decided not to operate because they had no guarantee of payment from the state, apart from a social media post from Bukele. Bukele resorted to his favourite tactic: he ordered the arrest of the owners of these companies. The police and the prosecutor’s office, faithful tools of the dictatorship, captured 13 businessmen in just a few hours, including two who had come to negotiate at Casa Presidencial. One of them,José Roberto Jaco, 64, died in custody five days after his capture. The family declined to give details about his death.View image in fullscreenSalvadorean environmental lawyer Alejandro Henríquez (left) and evangelical pastor Jose Angel Perez (second right)  speak with their lawyers during the initial hearing at the Integrated Judicial Center of Santa Tecla, El Salvador, 30 May 2025.Photograph: Daniela Rodriguez/AFP/Getty ImagesOn 12 May, 300 families from the poorest parts of the country who were facing eviction from their homesgathered outside the wallsurrounding the luxurious private residential complex where Bukele lives with his family. The families, with signs, children and elderly people, asked Bukele to please prevent the evictions. Bukelesent the military policeto break up the demonstration and arrest five community leaders, including an evangelical pastor and an environmental lawyer. Images of children and elderly women crying and begging the military to release their leaders flooded social media once again.From the publication of interviews with gang members, to the chaos in public transportation, to the military repression of dozens of poor families, Bukele had had a terrible month. His reign on social media had been disrupted, and his flock was no longer looking where he wanted them to look.A day later, Bukele set the tone from his X account. He said, without providing any evidence, that “humble people” had been “manipulated by self-proclaimed leftist groups and globalist NGOs, whose only real goal is to attack the government.” He wouldsend a Foreign Agents Billto the legislative assembly to impose a 30% tax on all international donations or payments to organisations or individuals considered by his government to be “foreign agents.” A week later, his assembly passed the law.We, from the outside, no longer understood anything. We no longer knew how to make sense of this unique maelstrom of repression. Not only did we not know if we were going to be punished for publishing the interviews with the gang members, but we now most likely would also be considered foreign agents and could face fines of between $100,000 and $250,000 – sums of money that no journalist at El Faro possesses. It was the first time since we left the country that one of our colleagues said it loud and clear: “We must not return to El Salvador.”On 18 May, just after midnight, the newspaper’s group chats began to buzz insistently: “Ruth López has been arrested.” One of the reactions in a chat was naive: “Shit, it can’t be!” A few minutes earlier, police officers had forced anti-corruption lawyer Ruth López out of her home. Once outside, they told her she was under arrest and forced her to change out of her pyjamas on the street. López recorded the audio of the moment on her phone. “Hurry up, put your pants on,” one of the police officers ordered. “Have some decency,” López replied, in a phrase that almost immediately became a slogan among the opposition.View image in fullscreenRuth Lopez is escorted by police to a hearing at the Isidro Menéndez judicial centre in San Salvador, 4 June 2025.Photograph: Marvin Recinos/AFP/Getty ImagesLópez, who together with her organisation Cristosal has exposed dozens of cases of corruption in Bukele’s government, remains in prison on accusations of corruption while she was an adviser to the supreme electoral tribunal, the country’s highest authority on electoral matters. Her trial remained secret, as did the alleged evidence that the prosecution claims to have.López’s arrest was interpreted by us and dozens of colleagues as an ultimatum from the regime. Bukele, after a disastrous month, was not willing to tolerate any more affronts. López was one of the most internationally recognised voices speaking out against his regime; in 2024, the BBC listed her as one of the100 most influential womenin the world. In Bukele’s narrative, there are no activists, journalists, cooperatives, or environmentalists. There are opponents. Anyone who does not think like him is lumped together and counted as an enemy.Several colleagues from other media outlets started to feel as though they should leave. “I’ve published a ton of articles on this government’s corruption. Do you think I should leave?” asked a journalist from San Salvador in a chat.By then, some colleagues at the newspaper had already decided not to return. Others remained determined to go back. Meanwhile, we were preparingthe new issueof El Faro’s monthly magazine. It was titled Silencing Dissent: The Return of Political Prisoners in El Salvador. It had been just 20 days since we left.There were no new developments. There was no new information. There were, however,many interviewswith media outlets from different parts of the world where we discussed the findings we had published. There were meetings with international organisations that listened with concern to what we had to say. There were embassies in different countries that welcomed us and asked what they could do. We replied that we did not really know – that, if they could obtain information about our possible capture, if we were to return, it would be very helpful.On 1 June, commemorating one year since his unconstitutional re-election, Bukele appeared on national television from the national theatre, surrounded by his deputies, his loyal magistrates and prosecutor, and many soldiers. In an80-minute address, he said that he did not care if they called him a dictator, that the country’s supposedly independent press was made up of “political activists who are doing business”.View image in fullscreenA woman holds a placard asking for the release of Ruth Lopez.Photograph: SOPA Images Limited/AlamyWhy did we still insist that we would, somehow, return? It is not entirely clear. Perhaps it was what remains when everything is uncertain: a dose of excitement at the idea of seeing colleagues whom we had not seen for a month, a few good doses of caustic humour about our circumstances. “I can’t come back on a plane other than the one he’s going on?” someone said jokingly about their colleague, and the rest of us laughed. But none of that could mask the gravity of the moment: fears for our families, the prospect of a life in prison with no chance of a fair trial and the overwhelming shadow cast by the capture of Ruth López, who had spent 48 hours without her family even knowing her whereabouts.Even so, the decision had been made: Seven members of El Faro would travel at 3.05pm on Saturday 7 June, on Avianca flight 638 to El Salvador, where we would land at 4.35pm.On the afternoon of 6 June, we spoke at the Central American Journalism Forum in Costa Rica. The last discussion was titled Under Fire: How Does Central American Journalism Survive? It ended about 9pm, and then a diplomat asked us to leave the closing cocktail party and speak privately.“I have information from two independent sources that tomorrow you will be captured at the airport in El Salvador,” the diplomat told us. “Starting tonight, a police deployment is waiting for you. Don’t travel.”The metaphor of a bucket of cold water is inadequate. It was far from invigorating. It was, said one of the journalists, as if you suddenly grew a hump and your body weighed more. The fatigue that had been lifted by the excitement of returning home suddenly came back. We had packed our suitcases, been assigned our seats, checked 40 times that our passports were in our backpacks. In our minds, we were basically already on that plane. Now we were cancelling.Nobody boarded the plane. The shaky construction of “preventive departure” finally blew up in our faces in a thousand tiny fragments, and there was only one word left to describe our situation. For many of us, it was still part of a naive question: am I now in exile?Some of us flew to Guatemala. I suppose there was an ulterior motive: to be closer to our country, three hours by car from our border. As the days passed, more colleagues from El Faro and other media outlets arrived in Guatemala. Some had calculated that if the government had not been able to catch those it was expecting to arrive on our flight perhaps it would try to arrest other journalists; others had noticed patrols loitering around their homes or had police knocking on their doors. Others had received a direct call from a trusted source: “Get out of your house, they’re coming for you tonight.”One night, 25 colleagues from five different Salvadoran media outlets gathered at a house in Guatemala City. We exchanged information. “I don’t know what I’m going to do,” said one colleague. “And I don’t think anyone knows what the hell they’re going to do. At least when you decide to do something, tell the rest of us, because we’re all walking in the dark here.”Almost two months after publishing the interviews with the gang members, several of us still did not call ourselves exiles. We still thought about returning.A group of Salvadoran journalists met at a pub in Guatemala City to share our sorrows and wash them down with more than one beer. The seven of us from El Faro had accepted that, for the foreseeable future, our homeland was forbidden, distant, hostile.One was planning to sell his house to find another place, in another land, to call home; another was desperately missing his son and counting the minutes until he could hug his little boy; another had been abandoned by his partner of many years upon learning he was being targeted; another was trying to figure out what to do with the small business they had opened in El Salvador a year ago that was just starting to bear fruit. Some just drank beer.That is where we were when a veteran journalist who we’ll call El Nuevo announced he was coming. El Nuevo is a meticulous and orderly man. He has had a suitcase packed and ready to go ever since Bukele, in September 2021, congratulated himself publicly for not using teargas against a protest march, “… for now”. And yet, on 7 June, when someone warned him that police patrols were loitering around his house, he forgot to take the suitcase with him. Since then, he had been on the run, staying with friends, with his phone turned off. He sneaked back home briefly to pick up the suitcase and pack a few extra things. Looking around at the room, the bed, the kitchen, he thought: “This is the last time I’ll turn off the stove.” And he left.He caught a bus and left El Salvador: “When I crossed Río Paz, I thought: who knows when I’ll cross this river in the opposite direction?” Arriving in Guatemala, he found out that a group of colleagues were having a drink and decided to go join us. El Nuevo arrived with the look that the rest of us had had for weeks: that of a boxer getting up after a knockout. Exile invariably happens to other people in other countries in other times … until it happens to you. He tried a joke by way of greeting: “Now they’re going to accuse me of illicit association.” He did not laugh.How the US helped create El Salvador’s bloody gang warRead moreHe took a bite of a hamburger, sipped a beer reflectively, and said aloud to himself: “It’s tough because you’re convinced that your life and your reason for living is to serve there.”There, he said. Not here.Before leaving El Salvador, he had said goodbye to his daughter. Emotion welled up in his eyes as he recalled her words of farewell: “I have the feeling that, just like in video games, one life has ended for you. I hope the other one works out.” That night, the future was just as inscrutable for us all.This piece first appeared inThe DialandEl Faro EnglishListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readEl SalvadorAmericasDonald TrumpJournalism educationJournalist safetyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the other, no big parties could mean greater corporate influenceThu 6 Nov 2025 11.22 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 14.18 ESTSharePolitics as we have known it in Britain for more than a century seems to be falling apart. Only six years ago, atthe 2019 election, the Conservatives and Labour got 76% of the vote between them, coming first and second in both votes and seats, as they have at every general election since 1922. Yet in most opinion polls now, the two parties around which politics is usually arranged at Westminster, in the media, and in the minds of millions of voters, activists and party donors have acombined supportof less than 40%.Not only has Reform UK surged well past them, Labour and the Tories are no longer consistently ahead of the Greens andLiberal Democrats– and sometimes level with them, or even narrowly behind. With an inexperienced, hard-right populist party dominating, and an equally unprecedented four-way battle to be Reform’s main challenger, British politics appears to be assuming a strange and volatile new shape.Yet so far only the electoral consequences of this are being widely considered. These may be both explosive and almost impossible to predict. The website Electoral Calculus, which converts poll ratings into general election forecasts,currently reckonsthat Reform will win between 170 and 426 seats, Labour between 33 and 243, the Tories between 14 and 200, the Lib Dems between 29 and 93, and the Greens between 7 and 70. Every party’s gains or losses could be hugely magnified or minimised by an electoral system not designed for such multiparty competition.Electoral Calculus also predicts a dizzying range of results for the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and Your Party, Zarah Sultana and Jeremy Corbyn’s half-built political vehicle. With a painful budget due from the government this month, Labour’s deep unpopularity, the source of much of the present instability, may well worsen, at least in the short term. Given many voters’ abhorrence of Reform, which party, or parties, will form our next government could remain unclear right up until the latest possible election date, July 2029, and possibly for days of fraught negotiations afterwards.But all this fascinating, in some ways frightening, electoral uncertainty means that the wider possible effects of the fragmentation have been little explored. If it continues, little in the once stable and predictable world of British politics may remain as it was.All or most safe parliamentary seats could disappear, and with them long Commons careers. Experienced ministers and veteran rebels may become even more rare. Swing voters – easy to identify in battles between two parties – may be replaced by a multitude of still more fickle electoral groups, chased by half a dozen parties. Meanwhile, party heartlands may crumble, old loyalties overcome by dynamic-seeming new choices. In London, my home borough of Hackney has been controlled by a party other than Labour for only three years of its 60-year history, yet its mayoralty is increasingly expected to be captured by the Greens at next May’s elections.If parties no longer have dependable long-term support, and therefore a regular presence and leverage in local councils, parliament or government, then donations may dwindle. National structures may become unaffordable, mass memberships and networks of loyal activists a thing of the past. And the whole process may become a vicious circle: if parties don’t seem to be solid institutions with clear prospects any more, then why make a lasting commitment to them, as a voter, donor, volunteer or politician?In 2013, when the disintegration was in its early stages, the Irish political scientist Peter Mair wrote inhis book Ruling The Void: “The age of party democracy has passed. Although the parties themselves remain, they have become so disconnected from the wider society, and pursue a form of competition that is so lacking in meaning, that they no longer seem capable of sustaining democracy in its present form.”That may be too gloomy. It’s possible that a fragmented, more unstable politics will be more responsive to voters, and offer more choice. In Britain, the latter is already happening, with the political spectrum widening to include everything from Nigel Farage’s reactionary national rescue plan to Zack Polanski’s radical green populism. Politics could also become less complacent, corrupt and susceptible to lobbying: ministers and MPs whose careers are shorter would be less worth bribing and manipulating. They might even be more humble.If, as seems likely, the results of the next general election are more unfair than ever before, in the link between votes and seats won by each party, then the case for proportional representation may finally become irresistible. And even if that doesn’t happen – Britain has a way of avoiding logical constitutional reforms, as shown by the continuation of the House of Lords – two-party politics could be replaced by a culture of coalition government, as in much of Europe, with Labour and the Tories no longer able to win Commons majorities. For anyone disillusioned with what their duopoly has done to Britain, a more diverse and fluid politics may seem very appealing – or at least, a risk worth taking.However, a less entrenched political class could mean that other disliked and powerful, yet unelected and more permanent interests, such as big corporations and Whitehall, gain more influence. There is also a danger that a faster-changing, more multiparty politics will simply accelerate the current disillusionment cycle, with voters working their way through an ever-lengthening menu of choices, faster and faster, without ever feeling sated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then, unusually, there were two general elections, and in both Labour and the Tories won lower shares of the vote than for decades. The Liberals, the SNP and the racist National Front all significantly increased their support. But this messier, more pluralist politics didn’t last long. Instead, in 1975, Margaret Thatcher captured the Tory leadership and began making politics narrower than ever. Somewhere on today’s crowded electoral battlefield, our next overlord may be waiting for their moment.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourConservativesReform UKLiberal DemocratsGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

Incidentally, 1990 was the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the global authority on climate change science – released its First Assessment Report confirming the threat of human-caused global warming. As scientists all over the world prepare the IPCC’s Seventh Assessment Report, we do so knowing that our work is still being overshadowed by politics. Despite all the well-intentioned half-measures, the truth is that the world is still disastrously off track to limit dangerous climate change.In the avalanche of technical reports released beforeCop30, the World Meteorological Organization stated that CO2concentrations reached a record high of 423.9 parts per million in 2024, with the growth rate from 2023 to 2024 surging by the largest yearly increase since modern measurements began in 1957. The latest figures from Global Carbon Project show that 90% of total global CO2emissions in 2024 were generated from the burning of fossil fuels, with the remaining 10% coming from land-use changes including deforestation and wildfires.While the growth in fossil CO2emissions in 2024 was driven by increases in gas and oil – together accounting for just over half of global emissions – the burning of coal reached a record high, accounting for 41%. Despite Cop28’s global stocktake calling on all nations to contribute to “transitioning away from fossil fuels”, collectively there are still plans to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5C, with the continued extraction of gas rationalised as a lower emission intensity “transition fuel”.Instead of focusing on economic incentives to encourage the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, climate policies are heavily reliant on feelgood “nature positive” solutions that aim to neutralise carbon emissions by essentially planting trees instead of reducing industrial emissions. While the protection, expansion and rehabilitation of natural carbon sinks like forests and wetlands is an inherently good thing to do, researchers have shown that there is not enough land to meet the global goal of net zero emissions using nature-based solutions alone.Climate change IS in fact bad and IS getting worse! Who knew!? | First Dog on the MoonRead moreApproximately 1bn hectares – an area larger than the United States of America – is needed to achieve net zero pledges. More than 40% of this land would need to be converted from existing uses like food production to carbon sequestration projects by 2060 at an unprecedented rate.And even if this regenerative utopia could be realised, we know that forests take time to mature and can burn down so cannot be thought of as a quick or permanent carbon storage solution, especially in a rapidly shifting climate. As extreme heat and aridity engulfs more of the planet, these well-intentioned efforts could literally go up in smoke.The science tells us that about half of the total CO2emitted each year remains in the atmosphere, while the rest is absorbed by oceans and the Earth’s land ecosystems. As the planet warms, these natural carbon sinks are becoming less effective at absorbing CO2, meaning that more carbon accumulates in the atmosphere, further exacerbating global warming. Pushing the mitigation burden on to the land sector simply relieves the fossil fuel industry of the pressure to reduce emissions any time soon.Achieving net zero by 2050 requires carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which currently relies almost exclusively on land-based measures to soak up excess carbon from the atmosphere. Polluters can simply buy carbon credits to offset their emissions and continue on with business as usual. Meanwhile, the energy imbalance caused by the burning of fossil fuels continues to further destabilise the Earth’s climate. Essentially we are adding more carbon debt to our planetary credit card, leaving future generations with an unpayable liability.To limit the magnitude and the duration of overshoot of the Paris Agreement temperature goals, ultimately the world needs to go well beyond the neutralising effect of net zero and begin to drawdown cumulative historical emissions to achieve “net negative emissions”.According to the Global Carbon Project’s latest numbers, vegetation-based CDR is currently absorbing the equivalent of about 5% of annual fossil carbon dioxide emissions, while technology-based CDR accounts for only about one-millionth of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuels. More generous industry estimates sit around 0.1% of total global emissions. At the risk of sounding like a heretic, the political distortion of net zero is an insidious loophole that distracts from the scientific imperative to eliminate the primary cause of our overheating planet – fossil fuels.While this scientific reality should dominate discussions at Cop30, history tells us that polite incrementalism and political kowtowing will prevail. Vague statements of future ambition will continue to delay the urgent need for concrete immediate action. Until our leaders have the courage to put a price on carbon to bring the era of fossil fuels to a definitive end, we are adding more and more carbon to the atmosphere, compounding the physical catastrophe now unfolding all around us.The dilemma we face is simple: genuinely respond to the scientific reality of our predicament or endure the consequences of this profound moral failure for centuries to come.Dr Joëlle Gergis is an award-winning climate scientist and writer from the University of Melbourne.

Here’s why a new UK law banning it is so vitalClare McGlynnStrangulation during sex damages young women’s brain health and breeds deep gender inequality. But the real test will be its enforcementThu 6 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 10.10 ESTShareThis week marks a turning point in the UK’s approach to violent porn. The government has announced it will makepublishing or possessingpornographic depictions of strangulation or suffocation – often known as “choking” – illegal. This bold move could transform the porn that appears on porn sites and social media platforms.Strangulation in porn was once niche.Indeed,studiesinvestigating the content of porn 20 years ago found hardly any instances of it.Yet anindependent review of pornographyreleased this year found that it was rife on the most popular porn sites. This summer the children’s commissionerreleased a reportrevealing that 58% of young people had seen strangulation in pornography, even though only 6% had searched for it. As renowned porn producer Erika Lustputs it, strangulation has become the “alpha and omega” of “any porn scene”.This matters because the more porn we watch, the more strangulation we see – and the more likely we are to strangle someone during sexual activity. This is not speculative –studies of male studentsshow precisely this link. Porn is today’s sex education: in arecent surveyby LadBible, 70% of young men said that porn was their first exposure to sex.We see this playing out in young people’s lives. Reports suggest that between one-third andone-halfof young people have experienced being choked or strangled during sex. And it’s a gendered practice: mostly men strangling, and women and sexual minorities being strangled.Pornography is not, of course, the only influencing factor. Popular culture reinforces and reproduces these messages of it being normal and harmless, with supposedly humorous memes and hashtags, such as#chokemedaddy; as well as popular songs such as Jack Harlow’sLovin on Mereferring to choking as “vanilla”. There’s also a far darker underbelly, with the manosphere normalising and encouraging it, characterising it as ultra-masculine.This all matters because of the serious risks and harms of strangulation. We’velong knownthat strangulation may cause unconsciousness, sore throats, dizziness, bloodshot eyes, incontinence and even strokes. But what is also now emerging is the adverse impact on the functioning of young women’s brains.Medical research withMRI scansandblood testsis finding that frequent sexual strangulation is impairs brain functioning, which can affect information processing and concentration. This is worrying at any time, but especially for younger people whose brains are still developing.And it’s vital to emphasise that these risks are not specific to non-consensual acts. Consent does not protect you from brain damage. These studies must not be dismissed as “sex-negative” or a “moral panic” (unless you don’t care about brain damage in young women).Even more worrying is that these are hidden harms – difficult to detect, and largely unknown. Young women are largely unaware of the serious risks of strangulation, meaning they can’t freely consent to them. Many men are also strangling without awareness of the real risks to their partners – and to themselves if it all goes badly wrong. The commonassumptionis that this is a safe practice. This is why we also need to increase public awareness of the harms of sexual strangulation, as the#Breathlesscampaign has done in Australia.This is all to explain why action to reduce the prevalence and normalisation of sexual strangulation is urgent. The government’s proposed new law means that under theOnline Safety Act 2023, porn platforms and social media such as X will have to proactively detect and remove this content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But adopting a law is just the first step – it must be implemented and enforced. So all eyes will now be on the regulator, Ofcom. Will it prioritise this issue and force platforms to act? Unfortunately, the omens are not good. Rape porn is already illegal, but it remains common on mainstream porn platforms and X.This new law is a watershed moment. It acknowledges that mainstream porn has real consequences and that strangulation is inherently harmful. It’s the start of a fightback against the mainstream porn shaping our lives in profoundly damaging ways.Clare McGlynn is a professor of law at Durham University and author of Exposed: The Rise of Extreme Porn and How We Fight Back (out in 2026)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I have convened world leaders in the days leading up to the conference so that we can all commit to acting with the urgency the climate crisis demands.If we fail to move beyond speeches into real action, our societies will lose faith – not only in the Cops, but in multilateralism and international politics more broadly. That is why I have summoned leaders to the Amazon: to make this the “Cop of truth”, the moment we demonstrate the seriousness of our shared commitment to the planet.Humanity has shown its ability to overcome great challenges when it acts together and is guided by science. We protected the ozone layer. The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic proved that the world can act decisively when there is courage and political will.Brazil hosted theEarth Summit in 1992. We approved the conventions on climate, biodiversity and desertification, and adopted principles that defined a new paradigm for preserving our planet and our humanity. Over the past 33 years, these gatherings have produced important agreements and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions – from ending deforestation by 2030 to tripling renewable energy capacity.More than three decades later, the world returns to Brazil to confront climate change. It is no coincidence thatCop30takes place in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. This is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness the reality of the Amazon. We want the world to see the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region. Cops cannot be mere showcases of good ideas or annual gatherings for negotiators. They must be moments of contact with reality and of effective action to tackle climate change.To confront this crisis together, we need resources. And we must recognise that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities remains the non-negotiable foundation of any climate pact. That is why the global south demands greater access to resources – not out of charity, but justice. Rich countries have benefited the most from the carbon-based economy. They must now rise to their responsibilities, not only by making commitments but by honouring their debts.Brazil is doing its part. In only two years, we have alreadyhalved deforestation in the Amazon, showing that concrete climate action is possible.In Belém, we will launch an innovative initiative to preserve forests: the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF). It is innovative because it operates as an investment fund, not a donation mechanism. The TFFF will reward those who keep their forests standing and those who invest in the fund. A genuine win-win approach to tackling climate change. Leading by example, Brazil has announced aninvestment of $1bn in the TFFF, and we expect equally ambitious announcements from other countries.We also set an example bybecoming the second countryto present a new nationally determined contribution (NDC).Brazil has committed to reducing its emissionsfrom 59% to 67%, covering all greenhouse gases and all sectors of the economy. In this spirit, we call on all countries to present equally ambitious NDCs and to implement them effectively.The energy transition is fundamental to meeting Brazil’s NDC. Our energy matrix is among the cleanest in the world, with 88% of our electricity coming from renewable sources. We are a leader in biofuels and are advancing in wind, solar and green hydrogen energy.Redirecting revenues from oil production to finance a just, orderly and equitable energy transition will be essential. Over time, oil companies worldwide, including Brazil’s Petrobras, will transform into energy companies, because a growth model based on fossil fuels cannot last.People must be at the centre of political decisions about climate and the energy transition. We must recognise that the most vulnerable sectors of our society are the most affected by the impacts of climate change, which is why just transition and adaptation plans must aim to combat inequality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In response, we will launch in Belém a declaration on hunger, poverty and climate. Our commitment to fight global warming must be directly linked to the fight against hunger.It is also fundamental that we advance the reform of global governance. Today, multilateralism suffers from the paralysis of the UN security council. Created to preserve peace, it has failed to prevent wars. It is our duty, therefore, to fight for the reform of this institution. At Cop30, we will advocate for the creation of a UN climate change council linked to the general assembly. It would be a new governance structure with the force and legitimacy to ensure that countries deliver on their promises, and an effective step toward reversing the current paralysis of the multilateral system.At every climate conference, we hear many promises but see too few real commitments.

We can’t afford not to tax electric carsNils PratleyThe issue of how motoring taxes should change as we decarbonise the economy has been dodged for too long. Car salesmen need to get realThu 6 Nov 2025 11.51 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 13.59 ESTShareIf you want a document to give you sleepless nights, the Office for Budget Responsibility’s biennial Fiscal Risks and Sustainability report is a go-to publication. This is the one that looks to the horizon and covers everything from demographic trends to state pension promises to the climate crisis.The headline finding in this July’s version was a true jaw-dropper. The UK’s public financesare on an unsustainable long-term trajectorybecause government debt would rise to a remarkable 270% of GDP by the early 2070s – up from almost 100% today – if current policies were left unchanged.The “if nothing changes” qualification is important because some of the risks to the public finances are so blindingly obvious – and have been for ages – that it is astonishing successive governments have ignored them. One is the certainty that government income from fuel duty will dwindle to next to nothing once we’re all driving electric vehicles.The July document spelled out the arithmetic. From expected revenues of £24.4bn from fuel duty in 2024-25, a halving is projected by the 2030s and receipts will be close to zero by 2050. “This is an average £15.5bn a year lost in fuel duty receipts, driven by the assumption all new cars and vans will be zero-emission by 2035 and new HGVs [heavy goods vehicles] by 2040,” said the OBR.The sums, to state the obvious, are huge. Indeed, fuel duty alone accounts for three-quarters of the revenues that will be lost to government arising from decarbonising the economy. Something plainly has to change on motoring taxes.And here – finally – is a proposal. Rachel Reeves is considering using this month’s budget to announce plans for a pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicles from 2028. A charge of 3p a mile for EVs, on top of other road taxes, would offset falling revenue from petrol and diesel cars.Crucially, from a transition perspective, the numbers would still be loaded in favour of EVs. The suggested rate would work out at an average of £250 a year, a lot less than the average £600 that petrol and diesel drivers pay in fuel tax, which can itself be considered a pay-per-mile charge. Enforcement remains an unanswered practical problem if Reeves’s system will rely on EV drivers estimating their mileage themselves. But the principle is sound: the Treasury cannot afford to let motoring taxes disappear.Naturally, the idea provoked howls from predictable quarters. TheSociety of Motor Manufacturers and Traderssaid that at such a pivotal moment in the UK’s transition towards EVs, it would be “the wrong measure”.The car salesmen need to get real. It is their sort of “not the right time” thinking that has made the problem of evaporating fuel duties so urgent. It would have been better to start reform incrementally half a decade ago, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies was urging at the time. Fromits 2019 report: “The government needs to rethink how it taxes motoring. It should start now, before the revenue disappears and expectations of low-tax motoring become ingrained.” Quite. The issue has been dodged for too long.Reeves’s proposal is too blunt to tackle the costs of congestion, the other problem identified by the IFS, but it’s better than letting the pressure on Treasury receipts build and build.If the UK can’t rejig motoring taxes to keep up with changes in technology, it hasn’t a hope of easing bigger headaches in the OBR’s book of scary projections, such as rising pension and healthcare costs. Reeves should implement her pay-per-mile idea. Most EV drivers, one suspects, will see the fairness.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsNils Pratley on financeGreenhouse gas emissionsMotoringTravel and transportFuel dutyTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

We need to keep calling it outThu 6 Nov 2025 12.22 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.38 ESTSharePack your bags and flee, infidels: New York City has fallen to a cabal of socialist jihadists. WithZohran Mamdanito become the city’s first Muslim mayor, many are celebrating the democratic socialist’s historic win. Billionaires, Islamophobes and Republicans, however, are in the throes of hysteria. But what’s new? The New York mayoral race has been marred by bigotry so unhinged it’s almost impossible to parody.Far-right activist and unofficial Trump adviser Laura Loomerposted on X, for example, that “there will be another 9/11 in NYC” under Mamdani. New York City councilmember Vickie Paladino called the 34-year-old a “known jihadist terrorist”. Actor Debra Messing, meanwhile, has been having a Mamdani-inducedmeltdownon Instagram, posting story after story about how the puppy-eyed politician is a threat to civilization. Sherecently posted: “In Judaism and Christianity, we are commanded to speak the truth. In Islam, they are commanded to lie if it means spreading Islam … Now, take a look at Mamdani … He’s revealing their goal: mass conversion.”In an era of ever-diminishing bipartisanship, Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreementZohran MamdaniMamdani’s goal, as he has made almost comically clear, is actually affordable mass transit and housing. One of the reasons his campaign was so successful is that it stayed laser-focused on affordability. However, Mamdani has addressed the attacks against him on a number of occasions, noting how common it is for Muslims to be branded as terrorists. And, it’s not just Muslims, I should note. Islamophobes don’t tend to differentiate between a Muslim of Indian descent who was born in Uganda, like Mamdani, and a Palestinian atheist like me. They don’t care if you’re a Christian Arab or even aSikh. We’re all the same to them: brown barbarians.The incoming mayor has also called out how just how normalized Islamophobia is on both sides of the aisle. A couple of weeks ago Mamdani released asix-minute videoaddressed to Muslim New Yorkers in which he talked about how Andrew Cuomo “laughed and agreed when a radio show host said that I would cheer another 9/11”. He talked about how outgoing mayor Eric Adams said Mamdani and his followers wanted to “burn churches”. And he stated: “To be Muslim in New York is to expect indignity. But indignity does not make us distinct – there are many New Yorkers who face it. It is the tolerance of that indignity that does. In an era of ever-diminishing bipartisanship, Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreement.”Amen to that. Islamophobia is so normalized that’s it’s not even seen as bigotry by many but, as conservative commentator and former Fox News host Megyn Kelly recently put it, “a sensible position”. It’s so normalized that trafficking in Islamophobia is not career-ending, but often career-elevating. Making breathtakingly racist comments about Muslims certainlydidn’t stop Randy Finefrom winning a special election earlier this year to represent Florida’s sixth district in Congress. Fine, by the way, is now leading a push to investigate Mamdani’s path to US citizenship in an attempt todenaturalize and deport him.And Islamophobia hasn’t hurt the career ofShaun Maguire, a partner at the influential venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. In July, Maguire, who has a well-documented history of making inflammatory statements, posted on X that Mamdani “comes from a culture that lies about everything. It’s literally a virtue to lie if it advances his Islamist agenda. The West will learn this lesson the hard way.” Sequoia didn’t take action against him, citing a policy of “institutional neutrality”. In the end, the only person to lose their job was Sequoia’s female COO. Sumaiya Balbale, a practising Muslim quit after Maguire’s comments;the Financial Times reportedthat she felt her position was untenable.In the US, Muslims make up onlyabout 1%of the adult population. Media coverage, therefore,disproportionately affectspeople’s views of Muslims and support for anti-Muslim policies. And there is a huge body ofresearchdemonstrating the extent to which the mainstream media in the US has dehumanized Muslims. One2018 studyby Middlebury researchers, for example, found that Muslims were the most negatively portrayed minority in America, “principally due to reporting on foreign conflict zones”.The reason that someone like Cuomo was so comfortable insinuating that Mamdani was a terrorist sympathizer throughout the election is because the media has embedded the idea that all Muslims are terrorists. A 2019 analysis media coverage found that between2008 and 2015terror attacks carried out by Muslims received more than 350% more coverage in the US media than terror attacks committed by non-Muslims. That’s even though attacks by non-Muslims (largely white supremacists) were more prevalent during that timeframe.Mamdani refused to compromise on his values – and was rewarded for it | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreThe mainstream media’s peddling of Islamophobia doesn’t just help politicians run racist campaigns; it helps them pass racist policies. There’s a direct link between the dehumanization of Muslims in the mainstream media and Trump’s Muslim ban. A direct link between decades of the media portraying Muslims as terrorists and US complicity in thegenocide in Gaza. While it’s easy to call out the Laura Loomers of the world and their crass Islamophobia, it’s respectable Islamophobia that’s more insidious.

The ruling upheldlaws in 27 states, all of them passed since 2021, which banned the treatment outright; according to theHuman Rights Campaign, about 40% of trans minors live in states where treatment for them is against the law. Now, the Trump administration seems to be looking to cut off access to care for the other 60% of those kids.Ina proposed ruleleaked to NPR, the administration plans to ban gender-affirming care for minors from being covered by Medicaid or by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or Chip. In a second, more sweepingproposed rule, the Trump administration looks to ban hospitals, clinics and providers from receiving any Medicaid or Medicare reimbursements at all if their practice provides transition-related pediatric care.If enacted, the orders – which NPR reports are scheduled for a rollout in early November – would dramatically reduce the number of providers able to treat trans teens, even in states where the care remains legal. Unable to keep their practices financially viable without reimbursements for care provided to Medicare andMedicaidrecipients, the majority of medical professionals currently treating trans kids with puberty blockers, hormones or affirming forms of psychotherapy would be forced to stop providing such treatment. The result would be a back-door ban on transition-related care for minors nationwide: even in states that have not passed laws banning the care, like the one upheld in Skrmetti, trans teens and their families – even those are able to pay for the care – would not be able to find a doctor willing to help them.The exclusion of Planned Parenthood from Medicaid means that clinics are shutting their doors even in Democratic-controlled statesThe move is remarkably similar to one that the Trump administration and their allies have pursued with respect to abortion access. After the supreme court’s 2022 Dobbs decision allowed states to ban abortion, Republicans placed a provision in last summer’s budget reconciliation bill that excluded Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, from receiving Medicaid reimbursements; the ban was laterallowed to proceedby an appeals court. Abortions themselves are already almost entirely banned from Medicaid reimbursement; the bill went further, as the Trump administration’s proposed order on gender-affirming care does, by saying that no practice that provides such treatment can receive Medicaid reimbursements for any care that they give.The exclusion of Planned Parenthood from Medicaid means that clinics areshuttingtheirdoorseven in Democratic-controlled states where the procedure remains legal, making it much, much more difficult for women to end their pregnancies and restricting access to the care nationwide.Technically, neither of these moves bans the targeted care: under the proposed trans care rules, and under the current Planned Parenthood Medicaid ban, none of the disfavored medical care is technically illegal under federal law, and states retain the option of allowing it. But just because something is technically legal does not mean that it is actually accessible: both of these policies function to place the medical care that gives these groups dignity, safety and control over their own lives out of their reach.The proposed exclusion of youth gender-affirming care providers from Medicaid and Medicare, and the continuing exclusion of abortion providers from Medicaid, point to one of the Trump administration’s more perverse strategies for punishing disfavored groups and accumulating power: the weaponization of the welfare state.Medicare and Medicaid were implemented to provide dignity and compassion to the nation’s elderly and impoverished. However flawed and partial these programs are their actual implementation, they are based on the principle that the state can improve the lives of its citizens, that it can catch those who fall prey to age or poverty, and recognize their membership in the American community with care. Above all, such welfare programs are tools of equality: they give Americans a degree of the dignity and freedom that are prerequisites to democratic citizenship. They prevent the kind of inequality that makes a farce of pretenses to republican government.Now, with the exclusion of certain kinds of care from these programs, the Trump regime has inverted Medicare and Medicaid into handmaids of inequality, wielded to degrade, humiliate, marginalize and punish certain Americans on the basis of their sex and gender.The US supreme court appears ready to nullify the Voting Rights Act | Moira DoneganRead moreIt is a playbook that the Republican right is using more and more. Under John Roberts, the supreme court has long been a fan of using statutes and constitutional amendments that were meant to mitigate racial inequality – like the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th amendment – for ends opposite to those of the lawmakers’. This is why it is on the basis of a scurrilous claim of racial discrimination against white and Asian students that the court could bar race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and universities that are meant to more fairly distribute educational opportunities among Black youth. And it is why this spring, in a 14th amendment race discrimination case brought by “non-African-American” (read: white) voters inLouisiana, the court will almost certainly gut what remains of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.The Trump administration has followed the court’s lead, subverting civil rights laws meant to curb inequality in order to entrench it instead. Of particular note is the Trump administration’s weaponization of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act against colleges and universities where students have staged pro-Palestinian and anti-genocide protests. The Trump administration has sought to marginalize pro-Palestinian speech and punish schools that do not crack down on it withfalse allegationsof antisemitism leveled at these universities under the civil rights law. Using these lawsuits and threats of withdrawals of federal funding, the Trump administration has been able to not only ensure crackdowns on disfavored minorities, but ensure muchbroader changesat many targeted institutions to hiring, curriculum and admissions policies.The welfare state, and the civil rights legal regime, have long been targets of the right; now, they have become their perverse tools, paths that the far right takes into Americans’ personal lives and most essential institutions in order to enforce a narrow, prescriptive and exclusive set of cultural values, namely white supremacy, sexism and a virulent transphobia. Those of us on the left will have to grapple both with the future of the welfare state and with the role of civil rights laws in a post-Trump world: as potent as these tools have been for ensuring a degree of dignity for Americans, they have also proved potent avenues for oppressing them.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS healthcareOpinionUS MedicareMedicaidTrump administrationAbortionTransgenderGendercommentShareReuse this content"

They need not only immediate relief but long-term justiceThu 6 Nov 2025 13.53 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 14.29 ESTShareWhat future is there for Palestinians in Gaza? The announcement of the ceasefire brought profound relief, shaded by an equally deep sense of trepidation. Almost a month later, the picturelooks bleaker. The Israeli offensive abated, Hamas has returned the surviving hostages and the remains of some of those who have died, and Israel has released some Palestinian detainees and the remains of others.But more than 200 Palestinians, including children, have reportedly died in strikes that Israel says are in response to Hamas attacks. Thousands of bodies are still believed to be trapped beneath the ruins ­– debris which, it is estimated, would take a fleet of more than a hundred lorriesseven years to shift. Aid is flowing again, but remains wholly inadequate, with NGOs warning that Israel’s new registration system isobstructing delivery. Israeli demolitions continue in the half of Gaza that its forces still hold. Unicefwarnedthis week that the education system – in so far as it survives after two years of war and the destruction of more than 90% of school and university buildings – is on the brink of collapse. New babies are bornliterally in the rubble, to mothers who have neither homes nor working hospitals.Fears about maintaining the ceasefire have not disappeared. Mediators are discussing apotential dealto give Hamas fighters safe passage out of Israeli-held Rafah if they surrender their arms, in the hope of resolving a possible flashpoint. But a senior Qatari diplomat, Majed al-Ansari, pointed to a deeper risk when hespoke to the Guardianlast week: that Gaza slides towards a limbo of “no war, no peace”, in which deaths continue and reconstruction cannot occur.The ceasefire agreement was reached by deferring all the difficult questions. But the US is keen to press ahead with aUN security council resolutionmandating the establishment of an international stabilisation force. That will require agreement on multiple difficult issues: the force’s mandate and composition – Israel has rejected a role for Turkish troops – and its relationship with a Palestinian civil police force; US military leadership; details of Israeli military withdrawal, and of what happens to Hamas weapons and fighters.Donald Trump does not want “his” ceasefire to disintegrate and has long hoped to expand the Abraham accords of his first term, normalising relations between Israel and more Arab states. That appears unlikelywithout stepstowards a better deal for Palestinians. Notably, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, will make arare visit to the USlater this month.But though much of what happens in the world is now dictated by the whims of the US president, it would be wrong to see the ceasefire as a random gift from Mr Trump. It reflected the growing international outrage at a genocidal war, led by the public, with governments dragged along behind. Gaza has now slipped back down the agenda. Germany was quick to suggest thatit would lift restrictionson arms exports to Israel which it applied only in August.Israelstill resists allowing international journaliststo enter Gaza. Public attention must be maintained to sustain Mr Trump’s interest, persuade him to press Israel to comply with the existing agreement, and ensure that further steps do not utterly betray Palestinians. Only sustained pressure can hope to bring anything approaching justice and lasting peace to the region.

But they reflect the overstretched and underfunded criminal justice architectureThu 6 Nov 2025 13.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 14.27 ESTShareAny mistaken release of a prisoner is a blow to the criminal justice system and creates a danger to public safety and confidence. So is any escape, abscondment or failure to return after temporary release. Failures of this kind nevertheless occur every year in the UK penal systems – not regularly, but often enough for governments to produce annual statistics about them. They are particularly alarming malfunctions in what is already a seriously flawed and pressurisedsystem.The mistaken release of two separate prisoners from the same prison, however, is unusually disturbing. Human error seemingly played a part in allowingWilliam Smithto walk out of HMP Wandsworth on Monday, the day he had been sentenced to 45 months for several fraud offences. That was bad enough. But the fact that he turned himself in on Thursday at the prison gates without being caught by a police manhunt simply compounds the record of official incompetence.The reasons for the sex offenderBrahim Kaddour-Cherif’smistaken release from Wandsworth on 29 October are not as clear as in the Smith case. Nevertheless, he is both a known danger to the public and due to be deported. It is wrong that he had not been transferred to immigration detention. The fact that his absence was not noticed for six days is disgraceful. AsOscar Wilde, himself shamefully a Wandsworth inmate in 1895, might have said, to lose two prisoners in this way looks like carelessness. At the institutional level, though, it looks far worse.The problem underlying these individual cases is that thecriminal justice systemhas been consistently underfunded for years. The consequences include continued reliance on shocking Victorian prisons such as Wandsworth, a struggle to recruit and retain prison staff, poor middle management, cuts in probation, and continued overcrowding, produced in part by overlong sentences. There has been some reduction in overcrowding in the past year, and spending is slowly increasing, but Wandsworth is still operatingat 166%of safe capacity.HMP Chelmsford, from which Hadush Kebatu, a convicted sex offender and asylum seeker, was mistakenly released last month, is operating at 133%.These are indisputably crisis levels. Yet parliament, which is now in recess again, handled them inadequately this week. Labour has been in charge for well over a year now. So the justice secretary,David Lammy, was wrong to be both badly prepared and so angrily partisan. Mr Lammy, and no one else, is accountable for the system now. Nevertheless, it is absurd for the Conservatives, who squeezed the criminal justice system so hard and destructively during 14 years in power, to wax so outraged about recent cases under Labour.The fact that mistaken releases in England and Walesmore than doubledfrom 115 in the year ending March 2024 (when the Conservatives were in power) to 262 in the year to March 2025 (for most of which Labour was in government) is a genuine national concern. The reasons, however, go beyond human error or the perils of inefficient paperwork. Much of the increase is likely to reflect the much enhanced use of accelerated releases and prison transfers since Labour’s assault on overcrowding started. Nevertheless, all these problems are a reminder that this is a whole-system problem for criminal justice. It will not be satisfactorily solved unless and until the Ministry of Justice receives the level of funding and leadership that would mean it can be put right.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Housing benefit represents a constant leakage of public finances into the pockets of private landlords, and the UK carries approximatelydouble the burdenof the EU average as a proportion of GDP. Such an appeal is doomed to failure unless there is a cessation of right to buy, which, asAndy Burnham has neatly put it, presents local authorities with an impossible task comparable with trying to fill a bath without a plug.An illustration of this no-win situation is the social-housing developmentGoldsmith Street, Norwich, which was built by the city council in 2019 and won the RIBA Stirling prize for architecture the same year. This scheme created a carefully designed community of ultra-low-energy Passivhaus homes. It was announced last spring thatseven residents want to buytheir homes under the right-to-buy scheme and there is nothing Norwich city council can do to stop this. The number of social homes being lost continues to outnumber those being built.Last year, governmentfigures revealedthat there was a net loss of 12,000 social homes in England, with sales and demolitions surpassing the number of homes built. The statistics showed that 22,023 social homes were either sold or demolished in 2023.Devolved governments have abolished the right-to-buy policy entirely, in Scotland in 2016 and in Wales in 2019. We are outliers among European nations in allowing private sector landlords free rein to charge whatever the market will bear.But as Labour has44 landlord MPswho own a rental property that generates more than £10,000 a year, we are unlikely to see any meaningful action on that front.

During the early 1970s, a cold war propaganda unit, the Information Research Department (IRD), was based at the British embassy in Santiago. It encouraged journalists to take a pro-Pinochet stance. An IRD official at the embassy said: “We point them towards the new military authorities for contacts and background.” He hoped that the hours of briefings and the gin and tonics on the patio had achieved the desired effect. But the schmoozing did not work on Gott. The same diplomat noted “private mutterings” from the Chilean military, complaining of Gott’s reporting.Gott later went to Argentina, after the coup in 1976, and was one of the first to report on the “disappeared”, opponents of the regime who were kidnapped. The Foreign Office saw him as one of the “triumvirate of Latin American correspondents who influence British opinion”, along with Hugh O’Shaughnessy and Christopher Roper.Grace LivingstoneCentre of Latin American Studies, University of CambridgeIt was perhaps with a sense of irony that Richard Gott agreed to unveil a blue plaque to his ancestor, the textile magnate Benjamin Gott (1762-1840), in 2018. Given his own interests in armed struggle, Richard may have found it amusing that Benjamin almost certainly provided the textiles that were made into uniforms for opposing sides in the military conflicts of the day.Martin HamiltonDirector, Leeds Civic TrustHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The closure of the shop in Kilchoan follows a number of other closures of similar local assets in Lochaber and Argyll (‘Morrisons killed us’: Britain’s most westerly mainland village shop closes after half a century, 30 October). But is it a policy failure or just a case of market forces?Nearly 50 years ago, a government-funded scheme offered a lifeline to communities that were keen to save key assets. A programme was initiated by the Highlands and Islands Development Board in 1977 as a way of supporting community-led development. It offered to match local financial contributions and provide practical support through an outreach team, of which I was a member. Tested in the Western Isles, by 1979 it was expanded to the rest of the Highlands and islands.Such initiatives contributed to vital community wealth-building and supported community investment in revenue-generating activities. Today there are numerous active co-operatives that help to retain people and money in communities across the Highlands and Islands – but even they are operating in challenging conditions.As Lochaber residents have seen, major retailers have extended home deliveries to remote households.

If it wasn’t so bleak, or so profoundly unsettling. But then, this is Birmingham, so there does have to be some gallows humour buried in there.Either way an hour before kick-off on the streets outside Villa Park it became clear that the 700 police officers present were being asked to keep apart three distinct, and equally energetic factions: pro-Palestine, pro-Israeli and pro YouTubers.Maatsen and Malen help Aston Villa avoid more controversy in win over Maccabi Tel AvivRead moreAt times it was tempting to ask which of these groups represented the greater danger to the public, out there kettled into their designated spaces on Witton and Trinity Roads, the YouTubers acting as a kind of mobile cavalry between encampments, tangling with police lines, pressing the global cause of the content warrior. Would we see the first UK riot shield charges against teenagers with GoPros, subscriber-base war on the streets, fully weaponised clickbait?So yes, you could have almost played it for laughs. If it wasn’t so fraught, tense and redolent of wider horrors at one remove. Opposite the Doug Ellis Stand there was something unavoidably disturbing an hour before kick-off in the sight of 30 or 40 pro-Israel … demonstrators? Not exactly. Old age pensioners? Mainly – being retained within a caged playground for their own safety.It will of course be overplayed in some parts as an act of oppression, because everything must now be overplayed. Clearly the police had decided this was the easiest way to maintain control of a febrile moment. It seemed to work. But still, the basic optics of placing these people inside a steel cage was undeniably strange. We’ve found you a camp. You’ll be safe here.Otherwise the atmosphere on the streets before Aston Villa vMaccabi Tel Avivwas tense, noisy, confusing and, beneath it all, undeniably depressing. The crowd milled and shifted, carrying with it a sense of wariness and rage at one remove. So this is what living inside the internet is going to feel like.View image in fullscreen‘The basic optics were undeniably strange’ when pro-Israeli protesters were escorted by police to a caged playground nearby the stadium.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianThere has never been a sporting occasion quite like this, perhaps the most un-football football match ever staged in England, a groaning platter of geopolitics with a tiny little sprig of sport dusted across the top.Arguably this was the most notable non-football match since Dynamo Kyiv’s Stalin-era tour of England, a series of games that began in a spirit of goodwill then quickly became fraught; and which crystallised George Orwell’s dislike of international sport, his dismissal of such occasions as “war minus the shooting”.Orwell was sniffing out something that would turn out to be undeniably true. Although we have now moved this on. These days sport is war plus the shooting, a PR megaphone for hard power, marched about the place in a headlock by every despot and opportunist with an army at his back.War and proxy-war follows the World Cup around as a natural next step. Earlier this week Fifa’s presidential popinjay Gianni Infantino revealed details of his new football peace prize, parroting the usual platitudes about empowering the peace-makers (who are also, as it happens, a very powerful bunch of war-makers).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The banning of the Maccabi fans from this game has always been couched as related solely to fears of Israeli hooliganism. It obviously isn’t that, and it’s OK to say this because no one here is blind to the reality. The ban exists because a cross-border ethnic and religious war is being waged between irrevocably opposed sides.So there were no Maccabi fans in the stadium as a room temperature game endedin a 2-0 victory for Aston Villa. There were none outside either, although a number of British supporters had made the trip. Two hours before kick-off a young woman called Emily walked down Trinity Road holding an Israeli flag, accompanied only by a hyped, rubbernecking police cordon, and was met with some isolated shouts of “Death, death to the IDF”.Is it OK to shout about death? She was warned under the police’s special crowd control powers, told to leave the area for 48 hours, and left cheerfully enough.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian protesters outside Villa Park before Aston Villa’s Europa League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianIn the main pro-Palestine camp on Trinity Road there were speeches, some calling for calm and tolerance, while also condemning the violent actions of Israel’s army in response to the violent actions of 7 October. Those present dispersed peaceably after kick-off. This was legitimate protest, expressed within the boundaries of free speech. The many banners about Zionists being unwelcome in the area, less so. Is this OK? Would it be acceptable in relation to any other group?Otherwise the policing was robust, backed by dogs, drones and horses draped in Christmassy lights. There were some scuffles between fans and police, who seemed to mistake people with tickets for ground-invaders. A YouTuber called Young Bob was detained for refusing to stop broadcasting near to the main pro-Palestine camp.At one point a man with a union flag tied around his shoulders was prevented from entering the ground (“You can’t go in wearing that”). Whatever your feelings about flags, which are in the end just bits of coloured cloth, it is undeniably a curiosity that this one should be such an object of provocation. But then, Britain is a strange country.By the end there was sense of relief at the absence of serious flashpoints and flare-ups. The centre held, the lines were maintained. With any luck Birmingham will now get though the night unscathed. But the depth of feeling here was undeniably real, undeniably visceral, and undeniably strange.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivanalysisShareReuse this content"

Minimum of fuss. The team from Italy’s capital did, nonetheless, meet favourable opposition when placing theirEuropa Leaguebid back on track. There was a glaring gulf in quality between Roma and a Rangers side that has now lost a club record seven European games in a row.To their credit,Rangersat least huffed and puffed during a second half when capitulation felt the more likely option. However, the game was settled as a contest by then. Rangers remain rooted to the bottom of the Europa League, which should constitute an embarrassment to a club of this standing. Roma have eyes once more on making proper impact. Their only regret here was in not delivering a scoreline appropriately depicting men against boys.Europa League: Midtjylland dispatch Celtic as Nottingham Forest draw blankRead moreAmazingly, this marked only Roma’s second European joust with Scottish opposition since Fairs Cup business with Hibernian in 1961. The previous one, against Dundee United 23 years later, became overshadowed (to put it mildly) by the bribing of a referee. Back then, Scottish clubs could compete with the best in Europe. This season has seen the co-efficient plunge to a level that will soon have huge ramifications.Danny Röhl’s main quality so far as the Rangers support are concerned is that he is not Russell Martin. The latter’s ghastly spell as the head coach lasted 123 days in the early part of this season. Röhl, the new man at the helm, has shown promise albeit within a tiny sample size. The dugouts witnessed a generation game; Röhl is 36, his opposite number Gian Piero Gasperini is 67.Another element was far more striking as the teams lined up. Rangers’ glaring lack of height against the Italians looked ominous. This point was proven within 13 minutes as Bryan Cristante comfortably flicked on a corner at the near post. At the back, Matías Soulé burst forward to knock Roma in front. A Roma team minus the injured Evan Ferguson and Paulo Dybala, who have been criticised for bluntness despite reasonable results in this campaign, were delighted with their early advantage.View image in fullscreenMatías Soulé gives Roma a 13th minute lead.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersRangers should have levelled matters instantly. Instead, Youssef Chermiti screwed his shot wide after a mix-up in the Roma defence. Chermiti’s £8m purchase from Everton has piled pressure on the Rangers transfer hierarchy. He has at least the physical attributes to be an effective centre forward but appears unwilling or unable to use them.Roma dominated first-half possession thereafter. They doubled their lead through Lorenzo Pellegrini, whose curling shot into the bottom corner of Jack Butland’s net arrived after a lay off from Artem Dovbyk. Rangers will bemoan the fact Pellegrini stood in blissful isolation but it was a gorgeous finish. Ibrox, typically a raucous place on European nights, had been silenced nine minutes before the break. Even the boos which met the half-time whistle were timid; Rangers were simply in the process of being outclassed.The second period began against a curious backdrop. Those Rangers fans turned their attentions for the latest time towards the club’s chief executive, Patrick Stewart, and sporting director, Kevin Thelwell. Two banners, clearly sinister in tone, depicted the pair with targets on their faces. One wonders what the Rangers chairman makes of all this. After all, Andrew Cavenagh enjoyed an anonymous life as a successful businessman in the United States before fronting a takeover of this club. Paying punters have not turned on Cavenagh yet but there is a mutinous mood in the air. It is one which is easy to understand; Rangers’ leadership is wholly unconvincing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This actually triggered Rangers’ finest spell of the game, in which their substitute Thelo Aasgaard fired just wide. It was, however, difficult to determine Roma’s remaining attacking motivation until Zeki Celik was presented with a chance all of a yard out which he somehow hit up and on to the underside of the crossbar.That was it as far as meaningful opportunity was concerned. The raft of substitutions from both teams meant this game closed more in the fashion of a pre-season friendly than serious contest. This of course suited Roma fine. There was cause to ponder how on earth Rangers, finalists in this competition in 2022 and worthy of the quarter-finals a season ago, reached the point of making up the numbers.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueRangersRomamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Hoops’ hopes of prolonging theirEuropa Leaguecampaign into the knockout stages suffered a major blow as the Danes hammered in three goals in eight first-half minutes.The teenage substitute Callum Osmand won a late penalty which Reo Hatate converted, but the 19-year-old was then taken off on a stretcher in tears after suffering what appeared to be a hamstring injury on a horrible evening for the Scottish champions.Matías Soulé and Lorenzo Pellegrini on target as Roma outclass RangersRead moreCeltic actually had the first shot on goal after just 25 seconds, with Johnny Kenny firing straight at home keeper Elias Rafn Olafsson. It was Celtic’s only effort on target for the next 80 minutes. They were quickly under the pump. The former Rangers right-back Kevin Mbabu was denied twice by Kasper Schmeichel and Mads Bech Sørensen guided Osorio’s free-kick over the crossbar. The hosts came even closer when Philip Billing dummied a low cross for Cho Gue-sung, who forced a point-blank save from Schmeichel, with Anthony Ralston taking the rebound right in the face.Schmeichel, back on home soil a day after his 39th birthday, was at full stretch to tip a 20-yard volley from Pedro Bravo wide. But he could only hold back the tide for so long and the dam finally burst following the resulting corner. Celtic cleared the initial cross but Mikel Gogorza reached the byline again and his chip across goal was nodded in by Martin Erlic.Within two minutes,Midtjyllanddoubled their lead when Arne Engels and Ralston let Gogorza squirm in between them and whip a low drive past Schmeichel. It was three by half-time from a Sørensen long throw, the exciting Guinea-Bissau forward Djú collecting the second ball and curling his 18th goal of the season inside the far post.O’Neill threw on Osmand at half-time and the 19-year-old earned his side a penalty when he was brought down by Erlic. But Hatate’s spot-kick could not mask what was a chastening evening for Celtic, while Osmand’s late injury dampened the mood even further.“It was a tough evening, there’s no question about it,” said interim manager O’Neill.“We conceded two goals within a minute or 90 seconds of each other and the game goes away from you very, very quickly. They score a third and it’s a long way back. The goals that we conceded weren’t good. But in terms of European football, they’re a very fine side, there’s no question about it.”Nottingham Forestremain unbeaten away from home in the Europa League after they battled to a goalless draw withSturm Grazat the Merkur Arena. Sean Dyche also continued his undefeated start in Europe since he took over at Forest and ensured they took a point back to England after their2-0 victory over Portoin their last game in the competition.Forest spurned a golden opportunity to make their early dominance count when Morgan Gibbs-White had a first-half penalty saved by Oliver Christensen after Maurice Malone had a goal ruled out for offside.The second half turned into a scrappy stop-start affair as both sides failed to register a shot on target after the interval but Nicolás Domínguez was denied the winner in stoppage time by the crossbar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forest controlled the early proceedings in Austria and almost had the opener but Ryan Yates had a close-range header cleared off the line by Malic in the 17th minute.Sturm Graz thought they had taken the lead before the half-hour mark with their first foray forward. Otar Kiteishvili’s run put the Forest defence on the back foot and his strike was parried by John Victor into the path of Malone who tapped into an empty net but was marginally offside.Forest were given a chance to open the scoring from the penalty spot after Williams struck the ball off the hand of Emanuel Aiwu. Gibbs-White assumed the responsibility but his spot-kick was stopped by Christensen who went low to his left to keep it out.Dyche brought Gibbs-White off for the defender Murillo with 13 minutes to play as Forest set their stall out for a point away in Europe. Forest almost snatched victory at the end when Domínguez let rip with a firecracker outside the box but he was denied by the crossbar.Afterwards, Dyche expressed frustration that Forest could not take their chances. “Other than the penalty, the chances we had from set-pieces, some of those final moments where we just didn’t capitalise,” he said. “There were some really good performances.

The head coach sparked a major sideshow in October when hedid not select Bellinghamfor the friendly with Wales and the qualifier against Latvia.Bellingham was not in prime physical condition having returned to the Real Madrid squad after shoulder surgery only a couple of weeks before Tuchel’s announcement. It was nonetheless a bombshell call given Bellingham’s ability and status, with Tuchel doubling down on it when he said hemight have excluded himeven if he had been 100% fit.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tuchel wanted to reward the players who ignited his tenure in September with thewin over Serbiain Belgrade – plus the homevictory over Andorra– when Bellingham was unavailable. He named the same initial squad, the injuries to Tino Livramento and Noni Madueke not withstanding, and the themes were faith and continuity; an attempt to build spirit and momentum. Inevitably, though, the move was interpreted as a slight on Bellingham, who had wanted and perhaps expected to be included.Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City’s Phil Foden to push for England recallRead moreThe Bellingham situation has stalked Tuchel and it is the main story in advance of his squad announcement. England face Serbia at Wembley next Thursday and Albania in Tirana three days later, havingguaranteed their place at the finalswith six qualifying wins out of six.The October camp featured convincing victoriesover Walesand Latvia and a part of the drama around Bellingham has taken in the notion of Tuchel holding his line about avoiding unenforced changes when things have gone well. Another detail is that there is only one more camp, next March, before Tuchel names his squad for the finals.It feels as if Tuchel has made his point about what is important and Bellingham will be expected to embrace the collective; the competition that the manager has repeatedly said is on. Tuchel has plenty of options in the No 10 position on top of Bellingham – namely Morgan Rogers, Eberechi Eze, Morgan Gibbs-White, Cole Palmerand Phil Foden. Palmer is injured and Foden was overlooked in October.There is an opinion in Spain that the Madrid manager, Xabi Alonso, brought Bellingham back into his starting XI too soon when he played him in the derby against Atlético on 27 September, which Real lost 5-2. Alonso promptly returned him to the bench for Madrid’s following two games which led into the October international window.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I need to win this weekend, next weekend and all the final races. That’s my goal.”He had, however, been given a spur by his control at the very front of the field in Mexico. A salutary reminder that the McLaren is still very much at the front of the field for all that Red Bull have made great strides over recent races.“When I have a weekend like last weekend, I can prove to myself that I can dominate,” he said. “That is a nice thought because it is nice to prove to myself what I am capable of and what I can achieve. It was a small achievement of a bigger puzzle. There is a much bigger picture in mind.”Verstappen, who had all but given up hopes of winning a fifth title this season at the midway point, has been re-energised by the improvements to his car that have allowed Red Bull to unlock its potential and provide a stable and balanced platform to the Dutchman’s liking.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen plots his next move for Red Bull.Photograph: Sebastião Moreira/EPAHe has won three of the five races since the Dutch GP, an achievement he believed had been an extraordinary turnaround.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But just as she looked poised to seize the first set, Sabalenka found her best self, saving the break points with two service winners, then responding from advantage down with three aces in a row.Gauff, though, stuck with her, holding under pressure to secure a tiebreak and earning its first mini-break. But again, Sabalenka responded well to pressure, fighting back to snaffle the set before dominating the second, breaking twice to lead 4-0 before closing out the match to send the champion home.Share"

But amid all the gloom, there has been an unlikely beacon of hope for the sport’s promoters.As the 52,000-plus crowd filtered away from Everton’s Hill Dickinson Stadium on Saturday evening, there was a huge ruckus outside the players’ entrance. Not for any of the home players,who had once again flattered to deceive. Not even for Nathan Cleary, regarded as the world’s biggest star for a number of years and someone with genuine worldwide cut-through.Tears and trouble: Shaun Wane on England’s narrow defeat to AustraliaRead moreNo. The mob of supporters who had hung around were only interested in seeing one man: the Kangaroos full-back Reece Walsh. Walsh’s notoriety and reputation in Australia was solidified long before he made his Kangaroos debut last month, but the 23-year-old has now become the hottest attraction in rugby league, and is the star the sport can hang its hat on globally.Without his on-field heroics, this series would probably be going to a decider in Leeds given his performance inthe first Test at Wembley. But off the pitch Walsh has been just as influential, with organisers in England probably thankful the Brisbane Broncos superstar has thrown himself into everything asked of him to leave some sort of legacy for this series.Quick GuideNewman and Burgess in England squad for final Ashes TestShowHarry Newman and Joe Burgess have been added to Shaun Wane’s 19-man squad for Saturday’s third and final rugby league Ashes Test against Australia at Headingley.The inclusion of Newman means three Leeds players have the chance to represent their country at their home ground, with Kallum Watkins and Mikolaj Oledzki keeping their places from last week’s loss at Everton.Burgess will make his first international appearance for a decade with the 31-year-old having last played for England in the 2015 series against New Zealand. Newman replaces the Wigan centre Jake Wardle, while the Hull KR winger  Burgess comes in for Dom Young, who sustained a broken foot in the defeat at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.Despite the Headingley clash having effectively been rendered a dead rubber, Wane is determined to avoid a repeat of the 3-0 whitewash suffered by England – then Great Britain – in the previous Test series in 2003.Wane said: “Of course we are disappointed not to be going into this final game with the opportunity to win the Ashes, but the goal now is to come away from the series with a victory.“We did a lot of good things last week but ultimately, we need to be even better if we want to get a win this weekend.“It will be great to see Joe Burgess and Harry Newman in action this weekend. Joe has had a great season with Hull KR and Harry has been a consistent performer for me in an England jersey.“I’ve no doubt the England supporters will get behind us once more as they have in previous seasons at Headingley – and hopefully we can give them something to celebrate come Saturday evening.”Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Last Saturday, he was one of the last to leave as he signed every autograph and posed for every photograph. The star of theBroncos’ NRL Grand Final victoryearlier this year, Walsh has been compared to LeBron James by the Australian Rugby League Commission chief, Peter V’landys, for the impact he can have in bringing new eyeballs to rugby league.“He’s so big over here, that people who just watch Premier League football are saying: ‘Who’s Reece Walsh?’” Kevin Brown, the former England half-back, said this week. His former teammate, Jon Wilkin, added: “A guy I train in the gym with went to London with no interest in rugby league to Wembley to watch Reece Walsh.“Because he caught the NRL Grand Final, first game of rugby he’s watched. And he saw something special. He saw Reece Walsh, and he’s like: ‘Well, I just love watching the best in the world do it.’” Australia’s assistant, Gorden Tallis, even said that the South Africa rugby union team, staying in the same hotel as the Kangaroos in London, only wanted to talk about Walsh.View image in fullscreenReece Walsh has left local supporters spellbound in the first two Ashes Tests in England.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnd while England have bizarrely chosen to hide away and bunker down in Wigan this week and will not even step foot in Leeds until they get off the bus for the third Test at lunchtime , Australia have thrown themselves into the local community with training sessions at Headingley and community events.It is the tourists, not the hosts, who have become the flavour of the month in the eyes of the British public with Walsh at the heart of it. Those at Leeds Rhinos who have been present for those events insist that while the likes of Cleary and Cameron Munster have been popular attractions, it has been Walsh who young rugby league players want to really get a glimpse of.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Super League champions, Hull KR, will do battle with Walsh’s Broncos in the World Club Challenge in Hull in February: you do not need too many guesses to work out who was front and centre of the promotional material on this side of the world.Hull KR will sell that night as the biggest in their club’s history, but they will also acknowledge the must-see opportunity to witness rugby league’s new global superstar. “You don’t need to be a Hull KR fan to get excited about that game, probably for reasons like Reece Walsh,” the Rovers chief executive, Paul Lakin, says.“The chance to see him play in Hull … I would expect there are a lot of rugby league fans who will want to get a ticket for the game. Personally, I’m so excited to see him play against Hull KR. As a rugby league fan, I want to see the biggest players playing in the biggest games in England. He will help make it a special night.”Walsh’s pull has even been so strong that there is an urban myth doing the rounds that there has been an unprecedented demand for replica versions of the bright pink shorts he has made famous during training sessions. That would ordinarily feel too far-fetched but, with how Walsh’s star has risen of late, perhaps not.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueEngland rugby league teamAustralia rugby leagueAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It could push ecosystems past catastrophic tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”Speaking to heads of state from more than 30 countries, Guterres called the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels a “red line” for a habitable planet and urged his audience to bring about a “paradigm shift” so that the effects of the overshoot could be minimised.“Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement and loss – especially for those least responsible. This is moral failure – and deadly negligence,” he said.On Thursday, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed that greenhouse gas emissions, which are heating the planet, had risen to a record high. It said 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. All of the 10 hottest years in measured history have been in the past decade.Guterres said there had been some progress but it was not fast enough. Many countries had put forward more ambitious plans to cut emissions. If they were fully implemented, he said, the world would be on a pathway to about 2.3C of global warming.View image in fullscreenAntónio Guterres speaks at the Cop30 summit on Thursday.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APThis forecast leaves the planet in dangerous territory but is considerably better than seemed possible 20 years ago. This is largely thanks to international support for the 2015 Paris agreement and a clean energy revolution that is gathering pace. But several powerful countries are stepping away from climate action as far-right nationalism takes hold, particularly the US.Guterres said the oil, gas and coal industries were holding back change. In his fiercest criticism yet, he said these companies commanded vast subsidies and political support and used them to the detriment of everyone else.He said: “Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation, with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress.”The summit – and next week’s Cop30 – takes place in turbulent times. Much of the world is distracted by war, and the US is leading an attack on efforts to build international collaboration to deal with shared global problems.Ding Xuexiang, a vice-premier of China, made a thinly veiled reference to Trump’s tariffs, saying the green energy transition depended on a free flow of green technology and the removal of trade barriers. “China is a country that honours its commitments,” he said, noting that his country, which is the world’s biggest carbon emitter, has set a goal for the next five years to peak its carbon use and reinforce ecological security goals.Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, had particularly harsh words for the absent, science-denying US president. “Mr Trump is literally against humankind,” he said. “We can see the collapse that will happen if US does not decarbonise its economy. It is 100% wrong.”“This is a real apocalypse,” he said. In addition to Trump, he laid much of the blame at the feet of petroleum industry lobbyists in the Cop system. “They are going against life. This is immoral. This is not human.” As a result, he said, the world had lurched from climate change to climate crisis and now faced climate collapse.Many countries have already been hit by climate disasters. The UK’s Prince William noted the world was moving perilously close to tipping points in the natural systems – ocean currents, rainforest and ice caps – that all life depends on. Among the solutions, he said, was the need to acknowledge that Indigenous people were climate leaders and to give them legal recognition to their land.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Guterres said developed countries must lay out a clear path to that goal.Keir Starmer told the summit that the UK was “all in” on tackling the climate crisis because it was a “win-win” for people and the economy that would reduce bills, create jobs and could be worth £1tn to the UK in five years.He said: “Ten years ago the world came together in Paris, united in our determination to tackle the climate crisis. A consensus that was based on science that is unequivocal. And this unity was not just international, it was there within most of our countries. There was a cross-party consensus in the United Kingdom. The only question was how fast could we go. Today, sadly, that consensus is gone.”The prime minister took veiled aim at prominent figures, including Bill Gates and Tony Blair, who have urged a slowdown on climate action. In a robust rebuff to that attitude, he said: “With some arguing this isn’t the time to act, and saying tackling climate change can wait, my question is this: can energy security wait too? Can billpayers wait? Can we win the race for green jobs and investment by going slow? Of course not.”The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said Belém should be the Cop of truth. “Now is the time to take seriously the warnings of science,” he said, praising the Paris climate agreement for helping to nudge the world away from its previous doomsday path of 5C of warming, but warning that the planet was still heading towards 2.5C of warming, which would kill 250,000 people each year and shrink GDP by 30%.He told leaders there could be no solution for the climate crisis without tackling inequality within and between countries, and said they should be inspired by Indigenous people who live more sustainably with nature.He finished with a reference tothe Yanomami Indigenous belief that the people of the forest are helping to hold up the skyand said he hoped this summit would help with that task of climate stabilisation.The first day of the summit saw two other major announcements. Brazil formally unveiled its flagship Cop30 initiative,the Tropical Forest Forever Facilitywith new investment commitments of $3bn from Norway over 10 years and unquantified promises of support from China. The facility aims to attract $25bn of investment from governments and another $100bn from financial markets to pay for the preservation of standing forests.Another breakthrough was a first global agreement to recognise and strengthen land tenure for Indigenous peoples and other traditional communities. More than 160m hectares (395m acres) will be covered by the commitment up to 2030.Explore more on these topicsCop30Global climate talksClimate crisisAntónio GuterresUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

No deaths had been reported at the time of publishing.The attacks came despite a ceasefire deal signed between Hezbollah and Israel nearly a year ago that ended 13 months of fighting.Under the terms of the deal, Hezbollah is to disarm, both parties are meant to stop firing on each other and Israel is meant to withdraw from Lebanese territory. Israel still holds five positions inLebanon.Before the airstrikes, an Israeli military spokesperson published maps of buildings it was going to target, telling residents to move at least 500 metres away from them. The spokesperson claimed the buildings were part of Hezbollah’s military infrastructure.The Israeli military bombs Lebanon on a near-daily basis, but Thursday’s strikes were unusual in their intensity and for being preceded by an evacuation warning.They came hours after Hezbollah had sent an open letter to Lebanon’s leadership saying that while it was committed to the ceasefire, it still had a “legitimate right” to resist what it called the “Israeli occupation”. The group has fired at Israel once since the signing of the ceasefire in December 2024.Hezbollah said it stood behind the Lebanese army, but it condemned direct negotiations with Israel, a prospect recently floated by Lebanon’s president, Joseph Aoun.Israeli officials have accused Hezbollah in recent days of attempting to rebuild its military capabilities in Lebanon after the group was devastated by the war with Israel.“Israel will continue to defend all of its borders, and we continue also to insist on the full enforcement of the ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel,” the government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters on Thursday.Israel would not allow Hezbollah to recover its military capabilities.Lebanon’s government has committed to disarming Hezbollah and ensuring the monopoly of weapons lies with the state. It said it had disarmed about 85% of Hezbollah’s weapons caches in southern Lebanon and was aiming to completely disarm the area by the end of the year.Israel has pressed the Lebanese government to move more quickly on disarmament, but it has said that to do so would risk inflaming internal civil strife.Explore more on these topicsLebanonIsraelHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The court corrected the error but HMP Wandsworth was not informed.An Algerian sex offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, who was released from Wandsworth by mistake last week, remains at large.The Met police, who are hunting him, were only told about his release on Tuesday and have expressed frustration over his “six-day head start”.The accidental release of the two men intensified pressure upon Lammy, who last week had announced a checklist to ensure prisoners were not freed in error after the release of Hadush Kebatu on 24 October.Prison governors were called to a meeting with Lammy in Leicestershire on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, the lord chancellor told reporters that the accidental release of Kaddour-Cherif happened before the new checklist was in place.“We have found out that the release that has caused concern this week was actually before I introduced those checks just a few weeks ago following the release of Kebatu. And the other prisoner was a court mistake not, in fact, a prison mistake.“But the truth is I’ve been in post two months – the rate of release by error is too high,” he said.The “paper-based” system which is used to process criminals at prisons, courts and in the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) will be overhauled, he said.“We had 800 errors under the last government, this has now gone on for a generation. Our prison system is in crisis so we have to bear down on this but we have a mountain to climb,” he said.Lammy has faced scrutiny over his handling of the mistaken release of Kaddour-Cherif after he refused to answer questions put to him on the issue in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Parliament had not been misled, he insisted. “I took the judgment that it is important when updating the house and the country about serious matters like this that you have all of the detail,” he said.A senior Labour MP said the government “has to take responsibility” for the wrongly released prisoners’ crisis. Andy Slaughter, the chair of the Commons justice committee, told Sky News that the prisons’ system was “chaotic” and suffered from inadequate staffing and lack of modern technology.Asked who was to blame for the current situation, he told Sky News: “The government has to take responsibility, the Labour government going forward. I think if you’re looking at how we’ve got here, you’re talking about years if not decades. And it’s not one issue, it’s an accumulation of issues.”The number of prisoners released by mistake has more than doubled in one year, official figures show.In the year to March, 262 were freed in error, compared with 115 the previous year, according to data from the MoJ.Prison sources say the overcrowding crisis was partly to blame for the sharp increase in “releases in error” – the official description for the mistakes.Before the meeting, the Prison Governors’ Association described releases in error as “neither rare nor hidden”, but said the scale of them was “deeply concerning”.In a statement, the PGA insisted only 0.5% of prisoners were not released on the correct date, but added: “While that may appear to be a small percentage, in a system managing tens of thousands of releases and transfers each quarter, it does represent a significant operational failure.”The Metropolitan police has meanwhile continued to appeal to the public over the whereabouts of Kaddour-Cherif, who the force believes is still in London just over a week after his release.“We are actively searching for Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, who was released in error from HMP Wandsworth on Wednesday 29 October. He is believed to be in London and has links to Tower Hamlets and Westminster. If you see him, please call 999 immediately,” the Met said.Kabatu was wrongly released from Chelmsford prison and attempted to walk back into prison at least four times. He was eventually apprehended in Finsbury Park, north London, and given money as he was deported to Ethiopia.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationLondonUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

It read: “The king has been pleased by warrant under his royal sign manual dated 30 October 2025 to direct his secretary of state to cause the Duke of York to be removed from the roll of the peerage with immediate effect.”The king’s decision to remove his brother’s birthright and dukedom followed growing controversy over Mountbatten Windsor’s links to the convicted child sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, including that caused by the posthumous publication of Virginia Giuffre’s memoir.Giuffre alleged that the former prince had sexually abused her after she was trafficked by Epstein, claims Mountbatten Windsor has always strenuously denied.The king chose to remove Mountbatten Windsor’s titles using his royal prerogative – powers recognised as held by the monarch – after consultation with Cabinet Office officials, rather than by parliamentary means.Letters patent are instruments of that prerogative, along with royal warrants, which the monarch uses to bestow titles and honours. Because the HRH style is conferred by letters patent under the royal prerogative, it can be removed by the same instrument.After Buckingham Palace’s announcement a week ago, the lord chancellor, David Lammy, was instructed by royal warrant to prepared the documents necessary for the removal of the titles.The king’s decision, which also includes Mountbatten Windsor giving notice on his lease on Royal Lodge, the 30-room crown estate property in Windsor where he has lived for two decades, was fully supported by the government.It was confirmed on Wednesday that Mountbatten Windsorwould be allowed to retainhis South Atlantic medal awarded for his service as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot during the Falklands conflict.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten WindsorMonarchyKing Charles IIIJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

At least 61 people have died as a result.The savage strength of Melissa was exacerbated by the overheated air and ocean, caused by the heat-trapping emissions that come from the burning of fossil fuels, an international team of scientists has determined.Climate change increased Melissa’s maximum wind speeds by 7% and extreme rainfall by 16%, the team atWorld Weather Attribution, a consortium of 20 researchers from the US, UK, Sweden, Dominican Republic, Netherlands, Jamaica and Cuba, found.Events such as the five days of pounding rainfall in Jamaica from Melissa are now about 30% more intense and twice as likely due to today’s altered climate, which is about 1.3C hotter, globally, than the pre-industrial average, the analysis found.Global heating has made the atmospheric and marine conditions behind such extreme events six times more likely.“What we see with Hurricane Melissa and other recent monster storms is that they are becoming so intense that they will soon push millions of people beyond the limits of adaptation,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and one of the authors of the study.“Unless we stop burning coal, oil and gas, we will see more and more countries reaching these limits.”Melissa is just the latest example of a major storm suddenly picking up strength with unusual speed. This “rapid intensification” was particularly pronounced with this hurricane, with Melissa’s wind speeds shooting up from 68mph to 139mph in just one day.This process is a hallmark of a warming climate, scientists have found, with storms able to feed upon heat in the ocean and atmosphere to become more fierce. Melissa crawled slowly over seas that were nearly 1.5C hotter than the long-term norm, gaining a brutal strength it then unleashed upon Jamacia.“Hurricane Melissa’s catastrophic landfall in Jamaica is not an anomaly, it is the canary in the coalmine,” said Jayaka Campbell, senior lecturer at the University of the West Indies, Jamaica.“When a storm can explosively intensify from 70 to 185mph in less than three days over ocean waters that are 1.5C warmer than normal, we are witnessing the dangerous new reality of our warming world.”The huge task of cleaning up and rebuilding from a storm that caused around $6bn in damages to Jamaica has again highlighted the vexed question of international climate finance. For years, developing, climate-vulnerable countries have urged richer nations to contribute funds to help them with the heatwaves, storms and droughts that these less wealthy places have done little to cause.Next week, countries will convene for annual UN climate talks in Belém, Brazil, to again discuss climate finance. In September, before Hurricane Melissa, Andrew Holness, Jamaica’s prime minister, told leaders at the UN thatcontributions to a fundto aid at-risk countries like his were so far “grossly inadequate”.“Developed countries must honor their commitments and scale up climate finance, recognizing that adaptation is a necessity for the survival of small island developing states,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHurricane MelissaJamaicaAmericasClimate crisisExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Sixty-nine birds have already died after the outbreak of a flu-like illness, but on Wednesday, Canada’s supreme court issued an interim stay on the cull order as it weighed whether to hear the case.Canada: order to cull over 400 ostriches sparks protests and death threatsRead moreThursday’s ruling removed any legal impediment to commencing the killings.Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, lobbied Canadian officials andMehmet Oz, a physician and former TV host appointed by Trump as the director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, offered to move the birds to his ranch in Florida. US billionaire John Catsimatidis has also pleaded with the Canadian government to reverse its cull order.The growing row over the ostriches – and a simmering post-pandemic skepticism of government – have inspired protesters to descend on the farm, with many broadcasting their frustration on social media. Under a live stream of the bird enclosure posted online by the farm, commenters frequently express skepticism towards vaccines and call for more proof that the birds are ill.The case has also penetrated Canada’s federal politics. In early October, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, was asked twice by reporters whether he supported protesters. The Tory leader has avoided making specific comments on the issue, despite many within his party protesting against the cull. He told reporters the issue had been “mismanaged from the very beginning” but didn’t say the word “ostrich”.The Canadian federal government said the food inspection agency was following a “stamping out” policy in order to limit the spread of avian flu, a move in line with broader advice from theWorld Health Organization.But animal advocacy groups have called on the agency to conduct further testing on the animals to confirm they are infected. The farm owners said that because the last bird flu death occurred on 15 January 2025, with the surviving majority appearing healthy or recovered, the flock has developed at least partial herd immunity against H5N1. They have also cast doubt on the scope and effectiveness of testing on the birds.On Thursday, Katie Pasitney, the farm’s spokesperson, told the media that the agency was “murdering” healthy birds.“They are prehistoric animals that have survived millions of years, but they won’t survive the Canadian Food Inspection Agency,” she said. Co-owner Dave Bilinski said he was “afraid there’s – in my opinion – there’s no justice left”.A federal court, however, found that allowing the birds to remain alive could lead to the spread of avian influenza to other animals, the poultry industry – or to humans.The agency has not said when it expects to begin culling the birds.A 2016 CFIA manual, obtained under freedom of information laws, says ostriches can be killed by various methods, the preferred being lethal injection, which requires three people: one to hold the bird by sitting on its back, one to hold the head, and one to inject the drug. Staff can also use gas or break the birds’ necks. Members of the agency can only shoot the birds “as a last resort”, if they have a “skilled marksman” on site.According to the Canadian Press, shortly after the court ruling, inspection agents workers began setting up more equipment and flood lighting around a large hay-bale enclosure near the back of the ostrich pen.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasAnimalsFarm animalsBirdsnewsShareReuse this content"

The extreme heat triggered mass die-offs among endangered Amazon river dolphins and fish, which cannot survive in such high temperatures.The shallow waters of Lake Tefé, which were only two metres deep, reached 41C – warmer than an average spa bath. “We couldn’t even put our fingers in the water. It was really hot, not just in the top bit, but right down to the bottom,” said the lead researcher, Ayan Fleischmann, from the Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development. “You put your finger in and remove it instantaneously, it’s unbearable.”Floatingcarcasses of up to 200 river dolphinswashed up over a six-week period around September 2023. No one in the region had seen this happen over the past century, said Fleischmann. “It was completely surreal and really scary.”This incident led them to look at other water bodies across the Amazon region. Half of the 10 lakes investigated experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures above 37C, according to thestudy, published in the journal Science.View image in fullscreenA satellite image from August 2024 of Lake Tefé in Brazil’s Amazonas state, showing sandbanks exposed because of severe droughts.Photograph: European Union/Copernicus Sentinel-2/ReutersResearchers analysed water temperatures from central Amazonian lakes during the drought of 2023, which was followed by another extreme drought late last year, with new record-breaking low-water levels and severe heating of the lakes. On average Lake Tefé reaches 30C in the hottest months, but in 2024, it hit 40C.Amazon lakes have been warming by 0.3 to 0.8C each decade over the past 30 or so years – rates higher than the global average, researchers found. At the same time, they are shrinking.

Heat exchangers and pumps recover the heat, which is distributed via district heating networks to homes and buildings, providing low-cost, long-term, stable energy.Thereportestimates that about a quarter of UK homes sit above flooded workings where MWGH could be used to provide low-cost heat, and that the technology could play a significant role in helping the UK meet its carbon reduction targets, cutting emissions by an estimated 10-20%. MWGH systems produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional gas boilers.The technology has already been proved. GatesheadEnergyCompany operates a 6MW MWGH system, supplying about 40% of the city’s district heating network. Lanchester Wines in Gateshead is the first UK business to implement MWGH, heating 30,000 sq metres of warehouse space. These projects demonstrate that MWGH can operate at scale.Prof Simone Abram, co-author and director of Durham Energy Institute said: “With the right support in place, MWGH could be built out at scale within five years. It’s not technologically complex, relatively speaking, but it takes some governance and social organisation.”She points to Denmark, where publicly backed, non-profit heat networks have already shown how stable investment and community ownership can deliver reliable, low-carbon heat: “We have a working model right next door that we can learn from,” she said.There are significant economic benefits to local communities, as well; in addition to low-cost heat, MWGH schemes create high-quality, specialist jobs, from drilling and engineering to network management, which could be particularly beneficial for coalfield areas and those facing economic disadvantage.Abrams said: “There are good jobs to be developed and meaningful work,andMWGH promises cheap, reliable and accessible heat for generations. That will obviously most benefit those communities that live in poor quality housing where heat is expensive and incomes are low … The key element we want to stress in developing MWGH is to ensure that the benefits do stay local and aren’t just extracted by financial interests only.”However, despite the advantages, uptake has been slow, with high upfront costs and a complex regulatory environment acting as obstacles. Currently, there is no single regulatory framework for MWGH and heat is not legally recognised as a resource, complicating investment decisions.Central government will have to play a crucial role in enabling the large-scale development of MWGH by offering financial incentives, such as grants, low-interest loans, or heat-based payments and state-backed insurance for exploratory drilling. There also needs to be a clear regulatory framework, coordination across planning authorities and inclusion of MWGH in strategic energy and housing plans, the report concludes.Community engagement is also vital; currently public awareness of MWGH is limited. Abram says: “In our experience, once people realise what value there is in the ground beneath their feet, they are enthusiastic. But many people, especially in less affluent communities, feel that things are being done ‘to them’ and not ‘with them’, and that breeds resentment and objection.”Demonstration projects, such as Lanchester Wines and Gateshead, play an important role in building confidence and providing practical lessons for future schemes. Chris Smith, Lanchester Wines’ energy and renewables manager said: “We are currently heating 33,445 sq metres (360,000 sq ft) of warehouse and reducing the energy required, emissions, and energy cost by a factor between four and six.”Prof Jeroen Van Hunen, co-author of the report said: “Besides providing domestic heat, MWGH could be used for heating greenhouses or heat warehouses, as with Lanchester Wines. Mines can also be used to store summer heat to be used again in winter. This can be used to cool datacentres or replace air-conditioning units.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyCoalGreenhouse gas emissionsWaterCommunitiesHousingEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Her apology comes a week after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, madeher own written apologyto the prime minister for failing to obtain a licence before renting out her family home.In a letter to Nandy, Starmer said he accepted the apology, but noted that the process to appoint the media executive David Kogan “was not entirely up to the standard expected” and said her department could learn lessons from it.The reprimand does not affect the role of Kogan, whose long career in sport and media has included negotiating TV rights deals for the Premier League and the English Football League.He was confirmed last month as the head of the Independent Football Regulator (IFR), a fan-friendly watchdog proposed by the Conservative government after plans for thebriefly mooted European Super Leaguecollapsed, and brought into existence under Labour.After the conflict of interest emerged, Nandystood asidefrom any role in deciding whether Kogan would be given the role.It is nonetheless another embarrassment for Starmer’s government, particularly so soon after it emerged that Reeves had not obtained the council licence needed to let her family home after she moved into Downing Street following the election.In his 18-page report, Shawcross said Nandy or her department had breached the governance code on public appointments in three ways: Nandy by not immediately declaring that Kogan had donated twice to her unsuccessful 2020 campaign to succeed Jeremy Corbyn asLabourleader; and the culture department by not discussing this when she interviewed him for the role and not declaring Kogan’s larger donations to Labour, including to Starmer’s leadership campaign.Nandy said she did not know at the time that Kogan had even donated to hers. However, Shawcross said in the report that given Kogan’s known links to Labour, Nandy “ought to have considered and ascertained whether he had made donations to her”.The report said Nandy and other ministers should be “reminded of their duties to declare and resolve any interests and relationships which they have with a candidate participating in a campaign regulated by the governance code”, recommending that the Cabinet Office and Shawcross work together to avoid a similar situation happening again.Nandy, in her letter to Starmer, said she had taken “robust steps” to check her register of donations before the process of nominating Kogan began, but accepted the report’s findings, saying: “I deeply regret this error. I appreciate the perception it could create, but it was not deliberate and I apologise for it.”In response, Starmer said he accepted an error was inadvertent, adding: “I know you to be a person of integrity and on the basis of your letter, it is clear you have acted in good faith. The commissioner acknowledges that you acted swiftly to step back from the appointment when you became aware of the perception of a conflict of interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the teenager had “turned out to be a monster” and that he and his wife, Laetitia Muzayire, had “lost control” of him.However, the parents of the three murdered girls – Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, Bebe King, six, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine – immediately hit out at the Rudakubanas, saying they “continue[d] to deny, deflect, and protect themselves, rather than face up to the truth”.Elsie’s parents, Jenni and David Stancombe, said they found the family’s evidence “deeply distressing” and believed the pair knew Axel was “going to do something horrific”.“We believe they should be held to account for what they allowed to happen,” they said. “They knew how dangerous he was, yet they stayed silent. They didn’t report their concerns, they didn’t act, and in doing so, they failed not only as parents but as members of our society.”Their words were echoed by Alice’s parents, Alex and Sergio Aguiar, who said Axel Rudakubana’s mother and father should be accountable “for the actions and behaviours of their children when they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent harm”.Lauren and Ben King, the parents of Bebe, accused Rudakubana’s parents of being “absent” and “turning away from their duties”.“What we’re struggling to comprehend is not just their failure then, but their failure now – to acknowledge, to take responsibility, to face up to what they allowed to happen,” they said.Alphonse Rudakubana, 50, had earlier told the inquiry he should have reported his son to the police when he stopped him getting into a taxi to his former school with a knife on 23 July last year, seven days before his attack on the Taylor Swift dance workshop.Rudakubana said his son, then 17, had come into his bedroom that morning holding a knife and started to “lightly stab” the bed as he demanded to be given a another knife that his father had hidden.Axel had also been asking for petrol, the inquiry heard, and had a jerry can in the living room. Rudakubana said he believed his son was planning an arson attack on his former school, Range high school in Merseyside.Rudakubana said that after stopping his son from taking a taxi to Range, Axel told him: “Next time, if you stop me, there will be consequences.”Answering questions from Nicholas Moss KC, counsel to the inquiry, the father said the incident was “really frightening” and that he was ashamed he did not call the police.Moss told the inquiry that Rudakubana messaged his wife, Laetitia Muzayire, later that day, saying “our child needs to be protected” and that if he had gone to Range, “he could have been killed or in prison for life”.Rudakubana, 50, denied he was discouraging Muzayire from calling the police, but admitted he had not wanted his son to be taken into care or jailed.Muzayire, who claimed asylum with her husband in the UK after the Rwandan genocide, sobbed as she told the inquiry she hated knives “with all my heart” because they had “been used to kill my family in the past”.Rudakubana had earlier admitted taking delivery of at least three knives for his son over the previous year. He claimed not to know that one of these was a machete, despite the parcel being labelled Mach Panther and coming from Knife Warehouse.Days before his son’s murderous attack, Rudakubana took delivery of another package of knives, left them in the landing and went back to bed.Asked by Moss if he had anything to say to the families of the girls murdered and harmed by his son, Rudakubana said: “My deepest sympathy, my condolences for the beautiful angels whose lives were taken by my son.“I am so desperately sorry to them and everyone else who’s been harmed. I cry for them all the time … because we have a reminder of my son, who turned out to be a monster.”He said he had “lost the courage to save the little angels” and that he “could have done far more”.“The love I had for him overrode [my] good judgment,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSouthport attacknewsShareReuse this content"

She said she had contacted the conciliation service Acas and the whistleblowing charity Protect.The latest turmoil comes after the Guardianpublished a recordingof an incendiary internal meeting in which the council leader, Linden Kemkaran, told dissenting Reform UK colleagues they had to “fucking suck it up” if they did not like her decisions.Four Reform councillors were suspended shortly after the leak. One of those and another who had been suspended over separate allegations have now formed an “Independent Reformers” group on the council.Kemkaran faced questions at a full meeting of the council on Thursday about the real-world impact of the suspension of Kemp, who had been chair of the adult social care and public health cabinet committee.The Liberal Democrats, the second largest group with 12 councillors, appealed to Kemkaran to restore Kemp, who now sits as an independent, as chair of the important committee.Another impact of Reform’s suspensions of its councillors was felt last month by another committee, which had been preparing to adjudicate on appeals by at least seven families who say they need supported school transport for their children. The committee meeting had to be cancelled because its chair was among those Kemkaran had suspended.Kemkaran was in combative form during the meeting on Thursday, likening her experience to that of her son who she said had just finished the first phase of military training and had been “beaten up and ambushed”.She compared the dropout rate among his fellow recruits to the axing of former Reform councillors inKent, telling the meeting: “Along the way some had quit because they couldn’t hack it. Others had been thrown out for bad behaviour or were simply unwilling to accept discipline. It did make me reflect on my own troops.”Kemkaran earlier answered simply “yes” when an opposition councillor asked if she believed her behaviour was in line with the Nolan principles setting out recognised standards in public life, and Kent’s own code of conduct.Kemkaran has come under pressure from other council leaders in Kent after the leaked video showed her complaining about some of them, saying they had a “shocking” level of ignorance about upcoming local government reform plans and suggesting they did not like her because she was a woman.2:02Linden Kemkaran says she has faced hostility from other Kent leaders because she is a woman – videoOn Thursday the council leadership also faced repeated questions from opposition councillors over whether it would be raising council tax, after Reform promised savings in leaflets to voters in the local elections. A senior member of Reform’s Kent team hadlet slip last monththat rates may have to rise by 5%, the maximum permitted.Brian Collins, a member of the Reform cabinet, said no decision had been made on council tax as the local authority was awaiting the outcome of a government funding review.Alister Brady, a Labour councillor, said: “You are running away from residents when it comes to the question of what you will do on council tax.” He said while he had not agreed with the previous Tory administration, at least it had managed to get together spending plans by this point in its term.Harry Rayner, the leader of the Tory group of councillors, said the council was now “mired in the consequences of self-inflicted damages” and he had seen nothing to rival it in 40 years of local government experience.“This council has been made a laughing stock with more clowns on display since I saw Bill Smart’s last circus,” he said.Kent is one of Britain’s largest county councils, with a £2.5bn annual budget.Explore more on these topicsReform UKKentLocal governmentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was found guilty of murder in July, a year after another set of jurors failed to reach any verdicts in the case.He was also found guilty of two counts of grievous bodily harm and wounding with intent, while his father was found guilty of perverting the course of justice for helping him dispose of evidence.Delivering the verdict, Judge Morris called Jhangur’s car assault a “deliberate and senseless act of hot-headed and wanton violence resulting in the tragic death of Chris Marriott and life-changing consequences for many others”.The food delivery driver showed no reaction as his sentence was read out. Morris said that the fact that Marriott “was engaged in the public-spirited and selfless act of assisting a young woman who was lying apparently unconscious in the street” when Jhangur killed him was an aggravating factor that was taken into account for the sentencing.The two families at the centre of the case are reported to have had a complicated relationship, being described at points during the trial as “rivals”. Tensions were at their highest on 27 December 2023 when Amaani Jhangur and Hasan Khan got married.At the reception, which took place at the Khan family’s home in Burngreave, north Sheffield, the arrival of the bride’s mother, Ambreen, and sister, Nafeesa, led to an argument between members of the two families. This in turn developed into a fight that spilled out into the street and led to Nafeesa being knocked unconscious.Witnesses say Marriott, a 46-year-old father of two, was out on a post-Christmas walk with his family when he acted as a “good Samaritan” by trying to break up the fight and help Nafeesa. He was aided by another passerby, Alison Norris.View image in fullscreenChris Marriott, 46, was trying to break up the fight and help Nafeesa.Photograph: Family handout/PAThe jury was told that Jhangur, who was described as “flying round the corner” in his blue Seat Ibiza, came out of nowhere and hit Riasat Khan, Hasan’s father, with his car before driving directly into the group that surrounded Nafeesa.Jhangur got out of the car and took out a knife, which he used to attack his new brother-in-law, Hasan. Sheffield crown court was told Hasan was stabbed several times in the left side of his head, near his ear and in his chest. Jhangur gave the knife to his father, Mohammed Jhangur, who hid it in the boot of his taxi.Despite the efforts of emergency services, Marriott died at the scene. Norris, Ambreen, Nafeesa and Riasat were all seriously injured.Speaking at court before Jhangur’s sentence was delivered, his widow, Bryony Marriott, said her husband of 16 years was her best friend and someone whose “love for God and for people shone through in what he devoted his time to”.Bryony said he “had a compassionate heart and loved helping, supporting and empowering others” and that she would miss “his smile and his laugh, his touch, and his wisdom and his encouragement”.She added: “Our time as a family of four was so much shorter than we ever imagined. But it is my hope that Chris’s life, more than the manner of his death, has a lasting impact on me, my children, and many others.”Addressing the Marriott family, the judge praised their behaviour during the trial, which he said was a “moving and very sad case, which has been dealt with the appropriate amount of dignity and courtesy throughout”.Explore more on these topicsCrimeSheffieldYorkshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to line up with their gender identity on new or renewed passports.Pam Bondi, the US attorney general,hailedthe decision, saying in a post on X: “Today’s stay allows the government to require citizens to list their biological sex on their passport. In other words: there are two sexes, and our attorneys will continue fighting for that simple truth.”When is a tariff not a tax? When I say so, Trump tells supreme courtRead moreMeanwhile, the court’s three liberal justicesdissented, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson calling the decision a “pointless but painful perversion”.She added: “Such senseless sidestepping of the obvious equitable outcome has become an unfortunate pattern. So, too, has my own refusal to look the other way when basic principles are selectively discarded. This Court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any) justification.“What the Government needs (and what it does not have) is an explanation for why it faces harm unless the President’s chosen policy is implemented now. It suggests that there is an urgent foreign policy interest in dictating sex markers on passports, but does not elaborate as to what that interest might possibly be,” Jackson wrote.“As is also becoming routine, this court misunderstands the assignment,” she added.The state department changed its passport rules after Trump, a Republican, handed down an executive order in January declaring the United States would “recognize two sexes, male and female”, based on birth certificates and “biological classification”.Transgender actor Hunter Schafer, for example, said in February that her new passport had been issued with a male gender marker, even though she has been marked female on her driver’s license and passport for years.The plaintiffs argue that passports limited to the sex listed on a birth certificate can spark harassment or even violence for transgender people.“By classifying people based on sex assigned at birth and exclusively issuing sex markers on passports based on that sex classification, the State Department deprives plaintiffs of a usable identification document and the ability to travel safely,” attorneys wrote in court documents.Sex markers began appearing on passports in the mid-1970s and the federal government started allowing them to be changed with medical documentation in the early 1990s, the plaintiffs said in court documents. A 2021 change under Joe Biden, a Democrat, removed documentation requirements and allowed non-binary people to choose an X gender marker after years of litigation.A judge blocked theTrump administrationpolicy in June after a lawsuit from non-binary and transgender people, some of whom said they were afraid to submit applications. An appeals court left the judge’s order in place.The solicitor general, D John Sauer, then turned to the supreme court, pointing to its recent ruling upholding of a ban on transition-related healthcare for transgender minors. He also argued Congress gave the president control over passports, which overlaps with his authority over foreign affairs.“It is hard to imagine a system less conducive to accurate identification than one in which anyone can refuse to identify his or her sex and withhold relevant identifying information for any reason, or can rely on a mutable sense of self-identification,” Sauer wrote in court documents.Since taking office in January, Trump has ramped up attacks against LGTBQ+ communities across the country. In October, his administrationthreatenedto pause federal funding unless states remove references to gender identity and the existence oftransgenderand non-binary people from a federal sex education program.At least 11 states and two territories acquiesced to Trump’s demands. Meanwhile, 16 states and Washington DC sued the administration over the demand.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We still think rates are on a gradual path downwards, but we need to be sure that inflation is on track to return to our 2% target before we cut them again,” he said.Borrowing costs have been cut five times since Labour came to power in July 2024, easing pressure on households and businesses, with thelast reduction made in August. Meanwhile, inflation isrunning at 3.8%– almost twice the Bank’s 2% target.In her 26 November fiscal statement the chancelloris expected to increase taxes, potentially slowing the economy, alongside measures takingaction against the rising cost of living.Reeves welcomed the Bank’s updated forecast showing inflation falling back at a faster-than-anticipated rate. “At the budget later this month I will take the fair choices that are necessary to build the strong foundations for our economy so we can continue to cut waiting lists, cut the national debt and cut the cost of living,” she said.After the vote to hold, which was closer than the City expected, Bailey suggested the MPC would have an “opportunity to consider the budget” before its 18 December meeting. Financial markets shifted after the vote to indicate an almost 60% chance of a quarter-point reduction in rates next month.Economists said tax increases could encourage Threadneedle Street to take action. “There is a plausible case for even weaker demand, hence pushing inflation lower from 2026,” said Janet Mui, the head of market analysis at the wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin.“[We will] only get more clarity post-budget, and governor Bailey’s vote will be crucial. Overall, markets believe the BoE has opened the door for a rate cut in December and has priced in that happening.”Five members of the MPC voted to keep rates unchanged at 4%, including Bailey, while a minority of four pushed for a quarter-point reduction.Expressing growing concern over the strength of the economy, the Bank said unemployment was poised to climb to a higher peak above 5% early next year – from 4.8% now – amid subdued hiring demand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It forecast the rate would fall back to about 2.5% next year, before returning to its 2% target over the course of 2027.In the minutes of its decision the MPC said that speculation over Reeves’s budget had probably contributed to weakness in the economy in recent months, while households had kept a lid on spending amid heightened pressures on living costs.It also found weaker exports to the US and disruption to Britain’s manufacturing base linked to the Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack had pulled down output in the third quarter, forecasting a weaker growth rate of 0.2%.The Bank forecast GDP growth would slow from 1.5% this year to 1.2% in 2026, before picking up to 1.6% in 2027 and 1.8% in 2028.However, policymakers warned that inflationary pressures could continue to weigh on households and businesses. Huw Pill, the Bank’s chief economist, said there were signs that the UK could be suffering from “intrinsic inflation persistence” because workers and businesses were responding to current rates of inflation by demanding higher pay settlements and raising their prices.But Bailey said the risk of inflation becoming entrenched at high levels was diminishing as a risk, and signalled “if disinflation becomes more clearly established in the period ahead” he would vote for a cut.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesBank of EnglandRachel ReevesBudget 2025BudgetEconomicsMonetary policy committeenewsShareReuse this content"

The company is offering customers a replacement seat post that can be self-installed.The recall follows a 2023 voluntary pullback of more than 2 million of Peloton’s original model bikes, which were recalled over a similar seat post issue.The company’s shares, down 18.1% so far this year, dropped 6.5% in New York on Thursday.Peloton has been cutting costs and reducing headcount under a turnaround effort, while raising prices for its products to help offset higher expenses tied to Donald Trump’s tariffs.In August, the company said it would reduce its global workforce by 6% and warned that the latest tariffs were expected to dent its 2026 free cash flow by about $65m.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Passengers will be able to connect multiple devices and they will not need a special login.Sean Doyle, British Airways’ chief executive, described the launch of the Starlink service as “gamechanging for us and our customers, elevating their experience onboard our flights by offering them seamless connectivity from gate to gate. Especially on short-haul, this will really differentiate us from our competitors.”Limited wifi access is currently offered to BA passengers on most of its aircraft through its .air service. Members of BA’s loyalty club are able to send messages and text-based emails onboard at no cost, while passengers who want to stream music, video and films during their flight and are not travelling in first class can expect to pay between £4.99 and £21.99 for a wifi package.Starlink has anetwork of thousands of satellitesand is operated by Musk’sSpaceXcompany.Doyle and BA’s management have beenworking to turn the airline aroundafter years of cost cutting, IT problems, strikes and mass redundancies. BA said use of artificial intelligence technology had helped it to bring its punctuality to the best levels since 2012.In August, BA reported ajump in operating profitsfor the first half of the year, helping to push its owner IAG’s profit higher. IAG is due to report its results for the three months from July to September on Friday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.9%.A report showed that last month was theworst October for US layoffs since 2003, which grabbed the attention of investors in the absence of official data delayed by the federal government shutdown. Companies cut jobs and imposed hiring freezes, according to theglobal outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at the trading platform IG.com, said: “The lack of US data and the ongoing government shutdown is making investors nervous.”US markets have been rattled bya review of Donald Trump’s tariffs by the supreme court, which could result in the US president being forced to abandon his flagship policy.A lack of official data has also forced the Federal Reserve to judge the state of the US economy with only a fraction of the information it would usually sift before judging the level of interest rates.Beauchamp said the Fed and financial markets had found themselves “groping around in the dark” after the suspension of inflation and employment data.Speaking on CNBC, the Fed board member Austan Goolsbee said the lack of official data on inflation during the government shutdown accentuated his caution about cutting interest rates further.“I lean more to the: when it’s foggy, let’s just be a little careful and slow down,” he said.The survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that employers announced 153,074 job cuts last month, compared with 55,597 in October 2024. It said US firms announced the termination of 1.09m roles during the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts in 2024. Technology businesses led private-sector layoffs, it added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Stoxx Europe 600 closed 0.7% lower, with tech stocks suffering the heaviest losses, and the Dax in Germany fell 1.3%.Beauchamp said: “If the supreme court rolls back some of the tariffs then inflationary worries will subside to an extent, though this is a topic that will not come to fruition for weeks.”Tech valuations have ballooned, and fears of a bubble loom large. “In the US, most of the big tech beasts have reported earnings but there is still lingering concerns about those lofty valuations and the mind-boggling sums of cash being invested into the AI dream,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

By the time he made Quaranta and Scaring the Hoes, however, he was in serious trouble: “blackout drunk” when recording the latter, “in pain all the time, throwing up and shit” during the making of the former. By the time of the interview, he’d been to rehab and got sober: ostensibly a happy ending, but Brown struck a note of caution. “I’ve seen so many artists get sober,” he said. “And their musicsucks.”Even the track listing of Stardust suggests this is an album made under very different conditions to its predecessors. The post-rehab positivity of song titles Lift You Up and 1L0v3myL1f3! isn’t intended ironically. Apparently written from the perspective of an invented character called Dusty Star, a “90s-era pop star” who nonetheless sounds remarkably likeDanny Brown, the lyrics contain appealingly chaotic swagger, eclectic reference points – at one juncture, he goes from Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World to Winona Ryder’s 2001 shoplifting charge in the space of two lines – and evidently heartfelt advice: “You’ve only got one life so stick to your goals.” There are moments that look back to a past when the songs’ protagonist had, as guest Angel Prost puts it in one of a number of spoken-word interjections: “You resign yourself to delinquency, quirkifying your life.” Elsewhere, What You See offers a lengthy, rueful apology for past behaviour, quoting Outkast’s Ms Jackson along the way.But Brown’s rhymes are nowhere near as conflicted as those on Quaranta, an album on which even the wildest boasts were immediately undercut by expressions of loneliness and torment. And the supporting cast on Stardust – 12 of the 14 tracks have guest stars – skews far more heavily towards names from the hyperpop underground and various other niche electronic hinterlands than it does to hip-hop: Frost Children, 8485, Underscores, Jane Remover et al.This isn’t entirely uncharted territory for Brown – his 2013 album Old was liberally sprinkled with production credits for maximalist electronic auteur Rustie and he’s talked about his regret that he never got to work withSophie– but the results are remarkably arresting. There are moments where Stardust sounds more poppy and obviously hook-laden than Brown has ever done before. You could just about imagine the house-influenced Copycats or the 8485 feature Flowers on the radio, were it not for Brown’s nasal, yowling voice: powerful, perfect for adding a snotty edge to his hugely entertaining brand of cartoonish threats and brags – “I ponder going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” – but very much an acquired taste.Equally, however, Stardust is more than capable of dealing in bracingly confrontational blare. 1999 is a painfully trebly, glitching chiptune at a gabber-like pace. For 1l0v3myl1f3!, his newfound positivity is backed by a beat that sounds like someone playing an old happy hardcore track on a turntable with a knackered stylus and occasionally dips into half-speed drops that, while electronic, have something of a metal song about them.Occasionally, the switch between pop mode and chaos happens mid-track. The End features not just Zheani, a corpse-paintedformer model from Australia best known for her 2023 track Bring Wet Cunt, but ta Ukrainka, the latter an example of Brown’s ability to find collaborators in the farthest reaches of the internet: she’s a Polish indie-pop artist who seems to be quite obscure even in the universe of Polish indie-pop. Her sweetly mellifluous voice acts as a foil to Brown’s warp-speed flow, in much the same way as the backing track’s pillowy synths and gentle piano figures smooth out the ferocious drum’n’bass break. Then, midway through, the whole thing erupts, Brown’s vocal fighting with a nightmarish mass of chattering sampled voices.It’s one of a number of moments that might provoke a sharp intake of breath on the part of the listener, which is presumably the point. “I made it here against the odds, now I do it all for you,” he swaggers on closer All4U. He sounds like a man who knows he’s beaten not just his demons, but his fears: a demonstration that Brown’s edge has not been dulled by sobriety as he worried it might.This week Alexis listened toLankum – Ghost TownA cover of the Specials’ classic that begins as if Lankum thought the original was too upbeat for its own good, then midway through transforms itself into … a banging dance track.

A triumphant inaugural VIP series of The Celebrity Traitors has blown such worries out of the Highland loch water.Ratings have surpassed 13m, overtaking Strictly Come Dancing as the BBC’s biggest franchise. It has been the most talked-about TV show of the autumn, if not the year. Anticipation is now at fever pitch for Thursday night’s final. As we approach the endgame, relive the highlights so far with our cloak-clad catch-up …Alan gets anointed (episode 1)View image in fullscreenThe cloaked crusader …Photograph: BBCAlan Carr’s treacherous trajectory has been the most dramatic turnaround in Traitors history. When he got that fateful shoulder-tap from Claudia Winkleman, the chaotic comedian came over all a-fluster. Nervously glugging rosé, he lamented: “I feel sick. I’ve got a sweating problem and can’t keep a secret.” Just watching him remove his blindfold and put his specs back on was mildly farcical. The first shot ofAlan in his cloak, carrying a lantern into the turret like a Victorian nana, became an instant meme. Entering the conclave, he revealed himself to co-conspirators Jonathan Ross and Cat Burns – who promptly screamed with laughter. Alan was set to be the worst Traitor since head-swivelling Linda. Well, wasn’t he?Clare fluffs it (episode 1)View image in fullscreen‘What have I done?’Photograph: BBCOf all the people to mess up, nobody predicted it would be the professionally capable Clare Balding. In the Trojan Horse task, the first gate was opened by answering the question: “How many characters die in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet combined?” While the assembled luvvies worked it out, Balding briskly dialled in a random number andpulled the lever. “Oh shit,” she wailed, head in hands. “I’ve locked it in and I didn’t mean to.” She immediately looked like a Traitor for sabotaging the mission. “Clare had a flashback to Vegas and thought she was on the slots, the way she yanked that lever,” cackled CarrNick leaves Stephen in his dust (episode 1)View image in fullscreen‘Self-effacing’ Nick Mohammed.Photograph: BBCCastle residents kowtowed to Stephen Fry as the world’s cleverest man, but faced with a sequence of fiendish puzzles, he was utterly upstaged by self-effacing Nick Mohammed. He recognised one as “a basic Klotski puzzle”, then worked out that word tiles bore anagrams of “traitor”. As the team completed the mission, Kate Garraway hailed Nick as a “puzzle ninja”. Social media lit up with viewers suddenly finding himstrangely sexy.Jonathan overshadows Claudia (episodes 1-7)View image in fullscreenDressed to kill … Jonathan Ross.Photograph: BBCFrom swishing capes to oversized knits, black veils to red fingerless gloves, every other series of The Traitors has seen Winkleman’s outfits go viral. This time, though, it wasJonathan Ross who stole the style plaudits. Highlights included his Top Gun jumpsuit, tartan trousers, furry stole and leopard-print cardigan. He even sported a tweed cape-and-fingerless gloves combo in tribute to La Winkle. It beat Garraway’s selection of rubbish hats.Alan’s betrayal (episode 2)View image in fullscreenPutting the knife in … Alan and Paloma.Photograph: BBCWhen the Traitors’ first murder had to be in plain sight, the job somehow fell to flapping Alan. Dodging detection in a crowded castle, he must fondle a black lily, rub his hands with poisonous pollen, then touch the face of the faithful he wanted to murder. He cornered his closest friend in the castle, singer Paloma Faith(ful), and tenderly brushed an imaginary hair from her cheek. “I feel awful,” he said. “I’ve gone and murdered one of my best friends.” Jonathan Ross told him to “toughen up”. Alan took him at his word and was soon writing death warrants with relish.Tom’sside-eye (episode 2)View image in fullscreenFlabbers were gasted … Tom Daley.Photograph: BBCAt Paloma’s gloriously camp mock funeral – complete with veil-clad Claudia on horseback – Tom Daley went viral for the Olympic standard side-eye he gave Kate when she gasped: “Gosh, that is flabbergasting!” Tom took this as a clue that she was over-compensating for having killed her. “Who uses the word flabbergasted anyway?” he scoffed. “It’s like saying ‘whoopsie daisy’.” Alan shot back: “You can’t accuse someone of being a Traitor just because they have a better vocabulary than you!”Daylee male (episode 2)Misspelled names on chalkboards have become a Traitors trope. YouTube prankster Niko Omilana trolled us all at the first round tableby writing “Tom Daylee” in his slate. The best we’ve had since are “Johnathan” and “Claire”.Celia breaks wind(episode 3)View image in fullscreenGone with the wind … Celia Imrie.Photograph: BBCDuring the creepy cabin mission, the gothic melodrama was undercut by an audible trump. “What just happened?” asked Winkleman. “I just farted, Claudia,” said actor Celia Imrie sweetly. “I’m so sorry. It’s nerves but I always own up.” The blooper went viral and gave ratings, well, a following wind. It emerged that producers gave Imrie the option of having it edited out.

It was the ex-rugby player who hatched the fabled “Big Dog Theory”, positing that castle heavyweights Jonathan Ross and Stephen Fry would be made leaders of the traitors and faithful, or vice versa. Joe later coined the term “My hundies” for those who, like best buddy Nick, he believes are “100% faithful”.Celia wails down the well(episode 4)View image in fullscreenWell, well, well … Celia’s anguished shriek.Photograph: BBCOn a woodland mission, the teams imitated different banshee wails.

When it moved to a banishment ballot, each received four votes. A tie is a rare enough occurrence in Traitors history. Both were allowed a final plea before the second round of voting. This time it was five votes apiece. Double deadlock has never happened on any UK series. The result had to be decided by fate, with the pair given “the chests of chance” – one of which contained an immunity shield. Broken man Bonnar departed.

Ice-cool Cat calmly pointed out that her autism and ADHD means that group interactions take more out of her and “sometimes I need time away”. Fry backed down and was soon banished.

Music itself mysteriously exalts and redeems the community, and I mean it as the highest possible praise when I say that The Choral reminds me ofVictoria Wood’s musical That Day We Sang, about the recording of Purcell’s Nymphs and Shepherds byManchester Children’s Choir.‘I’ve played a lot of sneery bastards’: Roger Allam on bad singing, big paydays and Elgar’s level of ‘gitacity’Read moreThe film is about men in a fictional Yorkshire town during the first world war who are variously too old or too young to fight, and the women who have to deal with the menfolk’s repressed emotions and their own. The place is upended by the arrival of Dr Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes) who is to be the choirmaster, directing the music society’s annual production; he scandalises some with the fact that he once lived in Germany and has a scholar’s love of that country’s literature and music – as well as the fact that he is a bachelor who had a close friendship with another young man now serving overseas.German composers such as Bach, Beethoven and Handel being unacceptable, Dr Guthrie proposes to his ragtag crew of amateurs a radical new production of Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius, its theme of death being the more heartwrenching in the circumstances. He gets permission from Elgar himself for this performance, though not his daringly interpretive new variations.The humour is delivered with the same conviction and discreetly weighted force as the sadness, and the same goes for this film’s determinedly unbowdlerised view of sex; just when you thought this was a picturesque movie, Bennett gives us the question of a young disabled soldier having to learn to masturbate with the other hand now that he only has one arm, and having to persuade his now ex-sweetheart to do it for him. Perhaps this is Bennett’s late style: a wintry, comic acknowledgment of mortality.The Choral is out on 7 November in the UK, 25 December in the US and 1 January in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAlan BennettNicholas HytnerRalph FiennesEdward ElgarPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He is part of an exploited itinerant labour force in the early 20th century who cleared woodland wildernesses, built bridges and made way for the American railroad. He lives a quasi-hobo existence but is possessed of a passionate, unspoken inner life to which this fine movie gives expression. His emotional life is the tree that falls in the forest without making a sound.Greg Kwedar has adaptedthe 2011 novella by Denis Johnson; the director is Clint Bentley, and they have created a lovely looking, deeply felt film, clearly absorbing the influences of Terrence Malick in some of the low camera positions, sunset-hour compositions, narrative voiceovers, and epiphanically revealed glories of the American landscape. There is also something of the early work of David Gordon Green, a film-makeronce considered an heir to Malick.Edgerton’s Robert is a man who grew up an orphan in Idaho, stoically accepting his hardship and his loneliness, working a brutally tough job. He is also the haunted witness to a racist assault on a Chinese labourer (although the film effaces what in the original novella was his complicity in this). He is quietly astonished by the miracle of meeting and marrying Gladys (Felicity Jones), having a baby with her and being exalted by happiness, but heartsick at having to leave for long periods of time to support them.On the job, he works with taciturn, weatherbeaten men whose own histories seem as unreadably blank as the trees they cut down. And yet the film shows how Robert savours, or is startled and appalled, by the revelations of their personalities. William H Macy is talkative old-timer Arn, who is in charge of the alarmingly unsafe explosives, and Paul Schneider is the strangely jabbering “Apostle Frank”.Robert sees a heartstopping fate for both men, and is also transfigured by the beauty of all that surrounds him, while troubled by the sense that he is despoiling it. He can see a future in which he is one of the silent drifter caste who do nothing but saw down trees. And above all he is stricken by the absence of his wife and child – a pain that runs concurrently with his joy at periodically seeing them again. He and Gladys have plans to open a little sawmill: perhaps it would be best to quit his wandering life and do it now while there is still time.The later sequences in the big city show that part of the mystery of any life is how very short it is, how it can be telescoped into a fleeting series of remembered moments; Edgerton transmits all this with sympathy and grace.Train Dreams is in cinemas from 7 November and on Netflix from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsJoel EdgertonFelicity JonesPeriod and historical filmsWilliam H.

And like so many British working-class pleasures and pursuits, shifting tastes and the relentless march of gentrification have seen its popularity wane substantially since heydays past. This frisky film explores the canine-centric milieu with affection and respect – but, laudably, it also makes room, about halfway through its runtime, for the case against racing as articulated by several animal rights activists who decry the conditions in which some dogs are raised, the practice of euthanising animals deemed no longer viable for racing, and the injury risks racing itself poses.Naturally, the trainers, breeders and owners we meet here violently disagree with these critiques. It’s to director Greg Cruttwell’s credit that he gives the subjects time to voice the point-counterpoint around these arguments. Some, like garrulous Scottish trainer Rab McNair, will have absolutely no truck with the activists’ points, insisting that they are grounded in ignorance of how well the dogs are treated. All the animals we see here look pretty bright-eyed and waggy-tailed, although some of the kennel spaces we see them hanging out in look a little on the spartan side; but who knows, this is hardly a meaningfully large enough sample to judge by. Encouragingly, one pro-racing speaker acknowledges that recent exposés of poor treatment in the industry, such as RTÉ documentary Greyhounds Running for Their Lives andreports in the Guardian, have compelled breeders and the sport in general to clean up their act significantly.Assessed purely as a work of film-making, Going to theDogsis competent if repetitive, playing at times like one long montage often set to jaunty vintage reggae tunes; but it certainly gets across the boozy romanticism of the sport, made all the more poignant by the fact that it’s clearly in decline in terms of popularity. Above all, the film gets across how lovable and sweet greyhounds are, creatures capable of running 40 miles an hour but who love to sleep 23 hours a day.Going to the Dogs is in UK cinemas from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGreyhound racingAnimal welfareAnimalsDogsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Build That Wall (1999)Aimee Mann has had hits and acclaim from critics and her peers, but the sense that she’s slightly undervalued still clings. A song as deceptive as Build That Wall might explain why: on the surface it seems straightforward and easy-on-the-ear, but beneath its mellow, mellifluous surface lurk stinging lyrics and real emotional force.19. ’Til Tuesday – (Believed You Were) Lucky (1988)View image in fullscreenMann (right) in ‘Til Tuesday, with Robert Holmes, in 1985.Photograph: John Kisch Archive/Getty ImagesA song Mann and bandmate Jules Shear co-created about their collapsed romantic relationship, though with Mann handling the lyrics alone. (Believed You Were) Lucky couches its regret – which curdles into something sharper in the sweary final chorus – in a lush arrangement and autumnal pop melody.18. Stupid Thing (1993)Mann’s solo debut, Whatever, was also a first production gig for Jon Brion, later to become famed for his work with everyone from Fiona Apple to Frank Ocean. You can hear his influence in the thick blanket of organ that opens Stupid Thing, a marvellously weary dismissal of an ex.17. Labrador (2012)Not everything on the bright-hued, pop-facing Charmer – an album heavy on synth and jangling guitar – is great: its mid-tempo pace can make the songs seem samey. But when it works, it really works. Labrador is funny but fatalistic, a masterclass in compact, unflashy but hugely affecting songwriting.16. You Don’t Have the Room (2021)Initially intended for a musical version of Susanna Kaysen’s memoir (and subsequent movie) Girl, Interrupted, which was abandoned when Covid hit, the Queens of the Summer Hotel album had Mann dealing in contemplative songs with lush orchestration. Here, the lyrics are bitter, the melody is exquisite.15. Video (2005)View image in fullscreenPerforming in London in 2005.Photograph: Hayley Madden/RedfernsA concept album about an alcoholic boxer returning to the US from the Vietnam war, The Forgotten Arm was audibly recorded live, and its songs work perfectly when isolated from the overarching concept. You don’t need to know the story to fall for the sad sigh of Video, its melancholy amplified by the watery-sounding guitars.14. ’Til Tuesday – The Other End (of the Telescope) (1988)Mann collaborated with Elvis Costello for The Other End (of the Telescope), a pairing that makes perfect sense: both have a spiky, cynical vein to their writing. Mann came up with the waltz-time music, Costello the lyrics: both recorded versions, although the lusher ’Til Tuesday take might edge it.13. Stuck in the Past (2017)The “saddest, slowest, most acoustic” of Mann’s albums, Mental Illness is also among the most beautiful, and Stuck in the Past sums up its charms: a simple but lovely song, subtly arranged, which breezes by so sweetly that you scarcely notice how downcast and regretful its lyrics are.View image in fullscreenIn 1996.Photograph: Lawrence K Ho/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images12. Wise Up (1999)Written for Jerry Maguire – it appeared on the soundtrack album despite being cut from the film – Wise Up found its perfect cinematic home in a singalong scene in Magnolia. Its fatalistic lyrics crash against its wonderful arrangement: orchestral and lush, even epic, at least by Mann standards.11. I’ve Had It (1993)Presumably informed by ’Til Tuesday’s demise – memories of the excitement of starting a band contrasting with later disillusionment – I’ve Had It is all about pared-back subtlety (check the understated musical Springsteen reference), focusing attention on Mann’s fabulously careworn vocal. What an enchanting song.10. Choice in the Matter (1995)I’m With Stupid, her second solo album, was something of a bid for a broader audience, featuring moments inspired by Beck, but Choice in the Matter is straight-ahead distorted guitar alt-rock. No matter: melodies this effortless-sounding don’t need much in the way of voguish sonic trickery. Its failure to become a hit single is baffling.9. It’s Not (2002)A depiction of depression that scrupulously avoids the standard rock pitfalls of overdramatising or perversely glamorising the subject, instead portraying inner torment in strikingly mundane terms: like a TV broadcast that’s been interrupted, like being unable to press a car’s accelerator when the lights change. Fabulous melody, too.8. ’Til Tuesday – Voices Carry (1985)Her old band ’Til Tuesday’s commercial breakthrough remains Mann’s biggest hit, going Top 10 in the US. Its booming sound is so redolent of its era that it’s gone past dated and become nostalgically charming, but there’s a smart, pointed song bristling away beneath the mid-80s gloss.7. Suicide Is Murder (2021)The bleak heart of Queens of the Summer Hotel, Suicide is Murder marries a classic early 70s singer-songwriter sound to a lyric that’s flinty, cynical and utterly compelling, grabbing you from its opening line: “Picture yourself there in the snow, turning blue – get used to that being you.”6. Driving Sideways (1999)Plucked from demos for Mann’s third album, Bachelor No 2, and debuted on the Magnolia soundtrack, Driving Sideways seems informed by Largo, the west Hollywood club where she developed the album’s material. There’s a relaxed, late-night-at-the-bar feel to its mood, and the perfect chorus defies an audience not to join in.5. That’s Just What You Are (1994)Another should-have-been-a-hit, That’s Just What You Are conceals simmering venom beneath a loping breakbeat, shimmering guitars, breezy tune and gorgeous harmonies by Squeeze’s Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook: “You’re like a sleepwalking man, it’s a danger to wake you / Even when it’s apparent where your actions will take you.”4. Goose Snow Cone (2017)View image in fullscreenMann and friend in 2007.Photograph: Dan Tuffs/Getty ImagesA latter-day Mann classic, a sweet acoustic meditation on homesickness, inspired by seeing a photo of a friend’s cat while on tour. Warning: avoid the video – which involves a sick pet, visits to the vet etc – if you’re feeling emotionally fragile (tryMann’s stark performance of the track on Laterinstead).3. 4th of July (1993)The album cover of Whatever may have depicted Mann as Doc Marten-clad and grunge-adjacent, but its contents told a different story. This was the slow-burning sound of a mature, considered, masterful songwriter, apparently uninterested in passing fashion: why would she be, when she could write songs as good as this?2. Red Vines (2000)For Bachelor No 2, Mann took control, placing herself in charge of everything from production to release. Its contents, and sales, offered vindication: if Red Vines’ lyrics sound battered by her music industry experience (“I’ll be on the sidelines, with my hands tied”), the surefootedness of the song speaks of new confidence.1. Save Me (1999)Director Paul Thomas Anderson compared Mann’s musical contributions to his film Magnolia to Simon and Garfunkel’s songs for The Graduate. He’s right, in that, like Mrs Robinson et al, Mann’s songs were integral to the film, but took on their own life thereafter. You certainly don’t need to know Magnolia to love the Oscar-nominated Save Me, which perfectly encapsulates Mann’s songwriting. Beautiful but low-key, its gentle arrangement – pattering percussion, sweetly wheezing accordion – has huge emotional impact: a sucker-punch delivered in cashmere gloves. Its subject, former boyfriend Dave Foley, noted with relief that he was her only ex “Aimee’s ever written a positive song about”.Aimee Mann’s US tourstarts on 28 NovemberExplore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The German composer was dead before the clarinet as we know it today was established, butMartin Fröst, his playing as silkily eloquent as ever, makes the short but sweet selection on this recording very much his own.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Martin Fröst: BACH.Photograph: Sony ClassicalThere’s an intimate feel to the whole thing, which was recorded at Fröst’s studio in the Swedish countryside, with the fellow musicians sleeping over. The tone is set by the aria from the Goldberg Variations, with a hint of a jazz sensibility thanks to Sebastián Dubé’s bass, Fröst’s melody seamless on top. Fröst duets with his viola player brother Göran on two Inventions, and with himself, double-tracked, on the G major Sinfonia; fair enough, few others would be able to keep up. Yet though this is lightning fast, it still holds to the quiet, unassuming mood.Jonas Nordberg’s theorbo helps the Air on the G String to skirt cliche, and it’s almost startling whenAnastasia Kobekinaleaves the baroque cello lines behind and busts out Gounod’s full-toned Ave Maria melody, Fröst rippling through Bach’s Prelude in C below. Things finally get a little schmaltzy when Fröst is joined by Benny Andersson for a wistfully reverb-heavy version of the Largo from the Keyboard Concerto No 5. Yes, even Abba too turns to Bach in the end.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her songs, mostly, are misty-eyed ruminations on puppy love and its ensuing devastation; they yearn for a redamancy that feels both fated and vexingly out of reach. You can imagine Harriette Pilbeam’s mille-feuille harmonies soundtracking a high school prom dappled with a disco ball’s refractive glimmer, or picture her fleecy guitars over a montage of light teenage debauchery. These are tracks prefabbed for telegraphing big feelings; everyone knows the outsize melodrama of a first, second or 20th crush.Liquorice, the title of Pilbeam’s potent third album, winks at her 2018 breakout EP, Sugar and Spice. That formative work was a candy blast of dreampop, emphasis on pop – indebted as much to Carly Rae Jepsen as Cocteau Twins, whose co-founder Robin Guthrie ended up providing a remix of Pilbeam’s single Sure. Liquorice, meanwhile, is more mature and less immediately palatable, eschewing the fairyfloss hooks of Pilbeam’s earlier work.Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers: ‘We don’t want to be the biggest band in the world. It’s just fun playing with our besties’Read moreAt its best, the record attempts to dismantle the grand romance on which Pilbeam cut her teeth. On Liquorice’s dizzyingfirst single, Lose It Again, the rush of new love cedes to motion sickness as she pillories a distant suitor’s “convoluted poetry” – as close to a snarl as her honeyed vocals will allow. The propulsive poison pen letter Wonder strikes an even crueller note to a similarly unavailable beau. “I want you to wonder til the sky is red / I want you to hang on every word I said,” Pilbeam sings, relishing not reciprocated affection but mutual misery. These are welcome flashes of depravity which lance otherwise earnest declarations of desire and devotion.The romance of the music industry, too, has soured. On her 2022 sophomore record, Giving the World Away, written during lockdown, Pilbeam interrogated her vocation with startling anxiety: the portrait of a fêted ingenue whose relationship with art and ambition has become brittle with time. Named after the feeling of nostalgia for something never experienced, Liquorice opener Anemoia plays like a lament to Pilbeam’s thwarted dreams. “Maybe the world you want has to slip away,” she elegises over throbbing synths.The track ends on an unexpected wink: “Secretly you were happier all along.” But happiness comes atthe expense of experimentation. Giving the World Away was a big swing that saw Pilbeam expand her sound – inflected by disco, electroclash and new wave – and work with bona fide hitmakers including Dan Nigro, the pop guru behind much of Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan’s output. Liquorice, in contrast, feels more restrained by design: a retreat into the references which have long coloured Pilbeam’s music. You can hear Dolores O’Riordan’s wounded yodel on Only One Laughing, or the deafening deluge of My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive across Liquorice’s production, so cavernous it can threaten to subsume Pilbeam’s voice entirely.For an artist so influenced by shoegaze, Pilbeam’s attention has always been fixed towards the heavens. Throughout her career, she haskissed the stars,stared into the sun,watched the cloudsandwrung meaning from the moon. Again and again, she has turned to the firmament for divine guidance, retribution and absolution from love and its consequences.Ninajirachi: I Love My Computer review – a surprisingly moving tribute to 2010s EDMRead moreDespite her best efforts, though, Liquorice finds Pilbeam unable to totally resist the lures of infatuation. Lyrically, the album often edges towards giddy abandon. “Lost control of myself / Again and again,” she sings on Carousel, giving in to the centrifugal force of a reckless romance. On the title track, “I surrender myself to you”; elsewhere, on Part That Bleeds, there’s a “surrender to curiosity”. At times, her capitulation to love’s stupefying force can sound frustratingly opaque. “You’re falling in love with me / falling in love,” she deadpans like an amorous hypnotist on Sage, skirting the line between awestruck and anaesthetised. The droning entry Anchor is particularly inert, never quite progressing beyond its metaphor tethering a doomed dalliance to oceanic depths.When Pilbeam eventually ascends skywards again, the result is thrilling. Stuck – the album’s closer and its best track – rockets headlong into a crush so intense it’s downright degrading. “I’m still stuck with these pathetic dreams,” she laments, her vocals diaphanous above catapulting guitars that thud like a heartbeat. It’s classic Hatchie: she’s embarrassed and enchanted, impossibly captivating in the face of it all. Cue the credits.Liquorice by Hatchie is out now (Secretly Canadian)Explore more on these topicsMusicAustralian musicPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

His portrayal of the crank who killed the US president in 1881 takes his mastery to the next levelJack SealeThu 6 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.27 ESTShare‘My name,” says Charles Guiteau (Matthew Macfadyen), the anti-hero of punchy four-part historical miniseries Death by Lightning, “will be known one day all across this country!” Guiteau was, until now, wrong. He tried to insert himself into history by assassinating the US president, James Garfield, in 1881 – but Garfield was only four months into his tenure, so all Guiteau did by shooting him was turn them both into difficult pub quiz answers.Death by Lightning pays careful tribute to Garfield, a quietly extraordinary statesman, but its focus is Guiteau and, if this show is a hit, he might finally get his wish. If so, it’ll be because Charles Guiteau has become a byword for the sort of pitiable crank thatMatthew Macfadyenplays better than anyone else on television.Wild of eye, sporting a beard that is somehow pointy and scraggly, and forever adjusting his old clothes, Guiteau is a fantasist, a liar and a serial non-payer of bills who has no skills or vocation beyond relentless self-promotion. You can almost smell his desperation as he pings from one humiliation to the next: a bank manager instantly refuses him the loan he needs for his ill-conceived plan to found a newspaper; Guiteau’s snooty brother-in-law (Ben Miles) correctly tells his kind wife Franny (Paula Malcomson) that her brother is a parasite who will never repay her faith. Female company eludes him even when he spends five years in a free love commune, because he was too annoying for any of the women to have sex with him.He is running out of eccentric scams when he happens upon a crowd gathered outside the 1880 Republican party convention in Chicago. As Garfield becomes the Republican nominee and then the 20th president, Guiteau’s greatest and last obsession will be his quest to become Garfield’s trusted acolyte and, perhaps, his friend.Macfadyen has obviously been cast on the back of his portrayal of greasy climber Tom Wambsgans inSuccession, but here he takes his mastery of grasping losers to another level. Wambsgans accepted every Faustian bargain going to achieve wealth and status; Guiteau has not even received the offer. Macfadyen nails everything, from his maniacal joy when he briefly thinks he’s winning, to his strangled guffaw of disbelief when he’s rejected. He’s mostly comic but his one substantial meeting with Garfield, which he spends weeks angling for, is agonisingly tragic, as Guiteau opens up his soul to reveal nothing inside. Macfadyen is brilliant in every awful moment.View image in fullscreenProgressive president … Michael Shannon as James Garfield.Photograph: Larry Horricks/NetflixThe lesser of the series’ parallel narratives stars Michael Shannon as Garfield, who gives a candidate endorsement speech at that 1880 convention that is so rousing, he wins the Republican nomination despite not being on the ballot. By sticking to his principles and convening directly with the electorate – his campaign features him inviting citizens to his front porch for a chat – Garfield becomes president. His programme of progressive reforms horrifies the corrupt Republican elite, who move to protect their financial interests and are willing to burn the party to the ground if it means they can rule over the ashes.Here is where Death by Lightning has the most fun, with Shea Whigham as cocky, bullying plunderer Roscoe Conkling, and Nick Offerman perfectly cast as Chester Arthur, a violent, vomiting stovepipe of a man who is sworn in as Garfield’s vice-president because of the political necessity of getting the fat-cat New York faction on side. Offerman is terrifically funny when Arthur is a roaring boor (his drunken catchphrase: “Music! Fighting! Sausages!”), then suddenly affectingly vulnerable as we glimpse the man inside the monster. Arthur is the product of a system that preys on people who grow tired of punching up, offering rewards if they sell their principles and punch down instead. Arthur can’t drink enough to blot out this shame.The show struggles to find a similar narrative for Garfield, who is considered and self-aware to a fault, which doesn’t give Shannon much to chew on. In its desire to get the story done in under four hours, Death by Lightning also resorts to some hasty character transitions and a fair chunk of heavily expositional dialogue, while its female characters are rarely heard above the din of flawed men. Everyone is in Guiteau’s shadow: when he’s not on screen we’re waiting for him to return, to see what horrible self-inflicted defeat he will suffer next.The last of those is at the gallows, which he sees as an opportunity to stun the gathered crowd with his oratory, one last time. He dies on his arse, then dies. We know the name now, but Macfadyen’s performance is what we’ll really remember.Death by Lightning is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionMatthew MacfadyenSuccessionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even its title is confusing. Dear England is already the name of a hitGareth Southgateplay, a forthcoming Gareth Southgate TV show and an open letter to the nation authored by Southgate himself in 2021.This Dear England isn’t formally related to any of those. It is instead an anomaly in the Dear England Multiverse, a book about leadership: aclassically dull elite football manager trope that Southgate sticks to doggedly, using the words “leader”, “leading” or “leadership” at least 500 times in 336 pages. “What are leaders? What do leaders do? And what do leaders know?” he asks early on, setting out his stall, but stopping short ofWhy are leaders,How are leaders, orWhen are leaders?,questions he will presumably touch on in volume two.Otherwise, this is a book with a book-shaped hole in the middle. It’s an exercise in passive-aggressive self-justification, in almost-but-not-quite saying the actual thing, hopping nimbly from unsettled score to unscabbed wound across a series of pie charts, corporate platitudes and stuff about Thomas Cromwell.Reading it is like overhearing your parents having a mannered but deeply felt argument in the next room while you’re trying to concentrate on a business seminar called 112 Reasons Why Naturally I Had the Last Laugh. But it is also impossible to stop reading, as Southgate keeps drifting near to something you actually want to hear about, before abruptly changing tack.There are always news headlines in books like these, such is the peeled-eyeball fascination with England managerdom. The best ones are: Southgate made up his mind he was definitely going to quit as England manager after fans threw beer glasses at him at the Euros; he came very close to abandoning the game at half-time against Bulgaria in 2019 after his players were racially abused; he invented the idea of set-piece coaches and everyone in the Premier League is now copying him; he has now lost his passion for football, a startling admission thrown away in a single paragraph at the end.Managing England through a period of rage, hope, political ferment and lockdown was a brutal experience. The bruises are obviously still freshOtherwise, the book is overrun with an AI-style word-sludge of generic leadership chat. Copies of this book were shared with reviewers under non-disclosure agreements ahead of publication, presumably out of fear someone might leak that “difficult conversations can, by their nature, be difficult”, that you should always look before you leap, that leadership happens where change meets empathy.There is nevertheless real emotion here. Managing England through a period of rage, hope, political ferment and lockdown was a brutal experience. The bruises are obviously still fresh, albeit expressed in a jargon-laden reimagining of the classic football manager theme: why I was actually right about everything all along.Even the book’s opening passage, Trojan-horsed as exciting memories of the final of Euro 2024, is all about how good Southgate actually was at substitutes (the big Southgate gripe being he wasn’t good at substitutes). Later, he goes into great depth about how he managed the Euros final of 2021 perfectly – specifically the losing penalty shootout – because he followed a predetermined process, which must mean that throwing on young players very late to take the biggest kick of their lives was logical and correct.Gareth Southgate rails against ‘callous toxic influencers’ in Dimbleby LectureRead moreThis was proved right by a successful shootout against Switzerland four years later after a game where England spent 120 minutes looking as if they were trying to put on a jumper the wrong way round. “Our dominance in that shootout was simply thrilling,” Southgate writes, in between comparing the performance to US Navy Seals killing Osama bin Laden. Oh Gareth.When we do get close to a revelation, Southgate backs away from naming names or giving us the juice. We hear there were difficult England players who demanded more attention, perhaps because they were spoilt early in their careers. But as you lean forward expectantly, Southgate is already veering off into something called The Culture Code, which states that rather than a collection of qualities or principles, culture is in fact something that is created by, gah, please, no more.Among the better bits are when Southgate writes about the piecemeal nature of building resilience in young people, or how he tried to define Englishness more lucidly and more helpfully than anyone else in the public eye. Best of all, there is a really gripping account of that traumatic night in Sofia where England’s black players were viciously abused (and later defended robustly by their manager).Perhaps the most heartfelt section comes at the end, where Southgate talks about the scars left by eight years as England manager. “The role chews you up. It puts your family through incredible stress.” This is the basis of an actual book. Maybe even a good one. Not, sadly, of Dear England, which is engrossing enough if you skim the flow charts and David Brent-style aphorisms, but only ever teases at the pain underneath.Dear England: Lessons in Leadership by Gareth Southgate is published by Century (£25).

There he found, floating in the shallow waters, a vast sirenian,Hydrodamalisgigas,nine feet long and soon to be known as Steller’s sea cow. Having made it through the winter, largely by eating the sea cows, the following August Steller and the remaining survivors of the Great Northern Expedition left the island. Within 30 years, Steller’s sea cow was hunted to extinction.Having described these events, Finnish author Iida Turpeinen’s debut novel goes on to describe the lives of other historical figures, each of whom are touched in some way by the sea cow, now reduced to bones. There is Hampus Furuhjelm, governor of Alaska, in search of a complete skeleton, and his sister Constance, who finds peace and intellectual autonomy among her taxidermy collection. Later, there’s Hilda Olson, a scientific illustrator, and John Grönvall, specialist in the reconstruction of birds’ eggs, who is tasked with preparing a sea cow’s relics for exhibition.Other things beyond the sea cow connect these characters. Both Steller and Olson long to be remembered through the scientific naming of species, although it’s only Steller, his desire playing out through the acquisition of specimens rather than the gentler process of illustration, who gets his wish. Steller and Grönvall are both embroiled in the murkiness of scientific collection which, no matter how it might further our understanding, necessarily entails destruction on one scale or another, while both Constance and Olson find their intellects – and consequently their potential contributions – dismissed because of their sex. And in the background, throughout, there is the slowly dawning scientific understanding both that the extinction of species is possible, and that it can be driven by human action.Ideas are raised and then let go – it’s like being on a gallery tour led by a guide who is constantly aware of the timeBy any metric – temporal, geographical, intellectual – this is a huge tract of ground to cover, but Turpeinen does so apparently without effort. She writes in a flowing present tense, moving seamlessly from one character to another, drawing us gently but firmly onwards. Emotional detail is astutely rendered, although in rather broad strokes – Steller’s social inferiority to his ship’s officers, for example, and his frustration when they ignore his request for the time necessary to do his work: “what a laughable scientist he is, examining the new world from his cabin, where all he can do is imagine the contents of these islands”. The result is a book that is almost hypnotically readable; it’s been much garlanded in Finland and it’s easy to see why.There’s a downside, though, to so much smoothness. The section on Hampus and Constance Furuhjelm, which also follows Hampus’s wife Anna, feels unfocused. Moving between the three of them, it’s unclear where the story lies, perhaps because the material provided by real lives often refuses to coalesce. The sea cow’s bones are the thread that ties this story to the others, but Hampus has bigger things on his mind and Anna doesn’t seem to even notice them. The solution might be to give more space to imagined inner lives and desires – Constance in particular feels like an opportunity offered then dismissed – but that would have meant lingering here, with these people, when the novel has somewhere else to be.Hilda Olson, too, goes past quickly. The same could be said of ideas, which are raised and then let go. When her employer gives his sea cow skeleton to a colleague, the two of them have dinner to celebrate – but “they too have their differences: von Nordmann believes that in order to fully understand an animal one must examine it alive… but Bonsdorff shakes his head. The oxygen flowing through an animal’s cells does not change its structure.” Here it seems we might be arriving at a nub, but then, as soon as the thought has been put forwards, we’re moved along again. The culpability of science and its practitioners in the extinction of species – and by extension the tendency humans have to hide their destruction behind ideas of progress – lingers without ever quite coming into focus. It’s rather like being on a gallery tour led by a guide who is constantly aware of the time.Perhaps this is unfair. Beasts of the Sea is undeniably very good – interesting; thoughtful; beautifully written. It’s only that I had the sense that it, too, wanted something more. When Steller rows out to observe a sea cow, it doesn’t seem enough. “He must get closer, see its organs and its bones, he must measure it ... Only by penetrating the surface can he understand the true nature of the sea cow.” I, too, would have liked time to see a little deeper.Beasts of the Sea by Iida Turpeinen, translated by David Hackston, is published by MacLehose (£16.99).

Shame it’s not here for longMatthew ReynoldsThu 6 Nov 2025 05.40 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 05.42 ESTShareAfter years of collaborations with Disney on Marvel and Star Wars, it’s finally happened: The Simpsons have arrived in Fortnite. Whereas most of these crossovers comprise themed skins and emotes, this is a complete takeover, with an entire stylised map based on Springfield to explore. It’s a smart way of introducing American TV’s longest-running sitcom to a younger audience – especially withnews of a second movie on the way– but for millennials, this is the culmination of a year-long campaign to catch our attention, if previous collabs with Power Rangers, Scream and Mortal Kombat are anything to go by.Though this could have been a quick ploy for those who grew up on a diet of afterschool BBC Two repeats to open their wallets, it’s no lazy cash-in. The familiar sights of Springfield you’d expect are here: there’s the Simpsons home on Evergreen Terrace, the sloping lawns of Burns Manor, and a town square with Moe’s Tavern and a statue of Jebediah Springfield, detachable head and all. Towards the edge of the map is the nuclear power plant, pumping cartoon steam into the sky, featuring meltdowns that you can avert by tapping a control console to the tune of “eeny, meeny, miny, moe”. Cletus’s farm and a Slurp factory (the game’s spin on Duff – no beer on tap here) sit on the corners of the island, and every match starts with a charming recreation of the show’s intro, complete with parting clouds, title card and iconic theme song, before you thank Otto as you leave the battle bus and descend on to the map.View image in fullscreenExcellent … Burns Manor in Fortnite’s The Simpsons season.Photograph: Epic GamesWe’ve had virtual depictions of Springfield before (though not for a while – the most recent were Tapped Out in 2012 andLEGO Dimensionsin 2015), but never rendered with this level of detail. Playing is like stepping into the animation. Springfield is on the smaller side as far as Fortnite maps go, and while it’s mostly as you’d imagine it, there is the odd quirk: the Hollywood-style Springfield sign is in the middle, not overlooking the town, and surely Springfield Gorge, centerpiece of memorable episode Bart the Daredevil, isn’t this close to the residential streets where Homer, Marge and Ned Flanders live.No matter: Springfield’s geography has always been a mystery, and what counts is that this dense recreation is a joy to explore. The secret to Fortnite’s map design over the years is its knack for making good use of the space between larger landmarks, and here it’s an opportunity to cram in references for longtime Simpsons fans to uncover, whether it’s stumbling upon a 33 cents storeor the forever-burning tire yard. Exploration is interrupted by optional quests with fun cameos, where a set of car keys can lead to a joyride at Homer’s behest, or picking up a ringing payphone results in a prank call to Moe’s. Encountering boss characters such as Krusty, who appear across the map, see Nelson briefly appear to let out his telltale “Ha ha!” upon their demise.There’s a lot packed in; after a dozen or so matches, I’m still making new discoveries. If there’s a fault, it’s that the map has to be played in competitive settings, the storm circle ever closing in and moving you on; I wish there was a way to explore slowly without the battle royale setup. Though Fortnite’s vibrant pop-culture collabs are always best approached as playgrounds and not digital museums, I’d like an exception to be made here, especially for new or lapsed players drawn in by the update. If that’s you, here are a few things you can do to survive long enough to enjoy it: play the less frantic “zero build” mode,turn on “visualise sound effects” in the settings menu to show player positions on-screen, and remember, there’s no shame in landing in the quieter spots of the map and letting others pick each other off first. Some of the best references are off the beaten path, after all.The Simpsons collaboration is a month-long pause between fuller seasons, and ends on 29 November. It’ll be a shame to see such a brilliant tribute disappear, and though old maps have returned before – the very first Fortnite chapter did in 2023,breaking concurrent player records– most disappear for good. But if one series has staying power, it’s The Simpsons. Here’s hoping for a movie-style comeback.Fortnite’sThe Simpsonsseason is out now until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsGamesThe SimpsonsFortniteAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After a long break and an auditorium emptied for a medical emergency, the comic is performing to the handful of punters prepared to wait until well after 11 o’clock for the show’s closing moments. Helm perches on the bar. His diehards semi-circle around him. No other crowd on his tour will get this intimate an experience – and the laughs (more so than they were in the main theatre) are accordingly uproarious.No doubt Helm would prefer his show to have proceeded without an ambulance call for a sick audience member. But it allows him to build a rapport, and deliver a memorable experience, that otherwise hadn’t looked likely. The show’s first three-quarters find the 45-year-old grumping at his audience as usual, recalling being bullied in childhood and touching on the struggles with depression he has chronicledin earlier shows. He relates too his search for a house and his career drift sincehis sitcom Uncleended in 2017.This stuff is conspicuously meandering, unedited and not packed with laughs, with compensation coming in the form of Helm’s emotional honesty and sense of his own ridiculousness – or squalor, as per one routine about his relationship with his “fleshlight”. It’s also elevated by intermittent rock songs by the gravel-voiced metalhead, from opening singalong Dump the Motherfucker to a closer that takes devil-worshipping to a lewd new level.At its best, the show has the captivating idiosyncrasy that comes when an act does their own thing and no one else’s – see Helm roaring his Nosferatu song (about being sucked dry by a vampire – or is it a sex toy?) while bedecked in a pair of fairy-lit butterfly wings. Then come those unforeseen closing stages, a storytelling session for two dozen stragglers out in the foyer, when – off stage, unbowed, just for us – he’s even more enjoyable still.Touring until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

At 88 years old, and more than 60 years into a career that has seen him rise to the very top of the contemporary art pile, Hockney is still painting, still experimenting, still innovating, and still having shows.This exhibition – the first in a swish ultra-central London location for Annely Juda, his gallery since the 1990s – is packed with paintings so new you can almost smell the wet paint. The opening room is all eye-searingly bright still lifes: chairs, tables, fruit and flowers. It’s the most old-fashioned and staid of subject matter, but nothing Hockney does is that dull, is it?His Van Gogh-y wicker chairs are neon yellow and luminous purple; his floors are clashing compositions of red, yellow and orange shapes; his fruit is all primary and basic and childlike. Throughout, he toys with what he calls “reverse perspective”, an attempt to replicate how we actually see the world, not the static view of life we get in photographs and other paintings. So everything looks wobbly and twisted. His chair legs splay, his tablecloths warp. I don’t think it’s any closer to “real” perspective than traditional painting, but the woozy visual discomfort it creates is fun. Photos of gardens are pasted into some of the compositions – little glimpses of a somewhat dull English reality that just make the rest of each work feel brighter and sunnier.View image in fullscreenNothing he does is ever dull … Delphiniums on My Garden Table, 13 July 2025.Photograph: © David HockneyWhat you can’t really avoid is how much shakier these brush marks are than they used to be. Classic Hockney is so assured, so in command of his paintbrush, but these new works are almost shockingly unsteady. The brush marks are full of quivers and tremors, the lines are all over the shop, bits of white underpainting poke out everywhere. They’re almost a mess, but still immediately, uniquely and recognisablyhim. It makes for quite an emotional, affecting experience – we’re watching one of the great artists of modern times age in front of our eyes. Compare all this with the very early works on display in another showearlier this yearand it almost starts to feel like bookends of a career, and I’m not sure I’m ready to handle that level of morbidity, actually.The portraits are where this show fails the hardest though. Hockney’s approach to skin tone has edged more towards pointillism over the years and the result is a bunch of bodies that look as if they’re covered in sores. All the figures here are splotchy, red-faced and pockmarked, splodged with pink and red (except for poor John Kasmin who seems to have gone a bit mouldy and gangrenous). The figures are closer to fresh corpses than living beings with heartbeats and vitality. A triple portrait of a man in a mirror is a good idea, but he just looks like a bloke awkwardly waiting for his wife outside the John Lewis changing rooms. Only the self-portrait here, showing Hockney painting in a wheelchair, really works, and that’s because it’s so vulnerable, but also so funnily self-aware.View image in fullscreenQuiet and austere … 8th April 2020, No. 2.Photograph: © David HockneyUpstairs, Hockney continues his iPad experiments with a series of “paintings” of the moon; all dark and moody, big glowing orbs hovering above blackened landscapes. They feel quiet, austere, maybe a little sad. I won’t hear any whingeing about his iPad work – people complain about the lack of texture and brush marks and humanity and yadda yadda yadda, but to my mind they’re great – an artist bending new technology to his will, showing that whatever the medium, he still maintains all the hallmarks of his aesthetic.But look, do we really need yet another Hockney exhibition? There have been more than 10 shows of his work in London in the last eight or nine years alone, not to mention the giant retrospective at theFondation Louis Vuitton in Paris earlier this year, and this new exhibition isn’t even the last of it. The Serpentine is doing a big one in 2026, too. I love Hockney, but even I think enough might just be enough.And yet, I guess we should celebrate him while we can. Here, with all these new works with their wobbles and humour and light and colour, he’s just proving that he’s still at it, and he’s still got it, all these years later.At Annely Juda Fine Art, Londonfrom 7 November to 28 February.Explore more on these topicsDavid HockneyPaintingExhibitionsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

The backroom of Arnold Wesker’s Italian restaurant inThe Kitchenis one such bubbling space, as is Lynn Nottage’s Pennsylvania sandwich shop inClyde’s. Hannah Doran’s Papatango prize-winning play, which takes place in a butcher’s shop, joins the ranks.Like in Nottage’s play, the formidable owner, Paula (Jackie Clune), tends to employ ex-prisoners. This brings the notion of new beginnings but also turbulent pasts and narrowed choices. Doran’s Brooklyn establishment manifests the hopes and disappointments of the nation’s underclass. It is essentially a dissection of the American dream, beginning with 4July celebrations when the Italian-American meat store receives a massive order.View image in fullscreenHigh-pressure … Ash Hunter as Billy, Marcello Cruz as JD and Eugene McCoy as David in The Meat Kings! (Inc) of Brooklyn Heights.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJD (Marcello Cruz) is a gifted apprentice butcher and immigrant from Mexico who needs this job to stay in the country. Billy (Ash Hunter) is a less industrious apprentice of mixed American and Dominican heritage. Head butcher David (Eugene McCoy) is a former Wall Street worker with a history of addiction. Newbie and former convict T (Mithra Malek) is Billy’s cousin, drafted in as an extra pair of hands.Alliances form as they set about preparing the patties and cuts of meat on Mona Camille’s stainless steel set, but so do enmities. Billy and JD are pitted against each other (there is only room for one apprentice here) while Paula – rather generic in her mix of ballsiness and kindness – is under financial pressure, like her crew, and notices the books do not add up.Directed by George Turvey, the characters have some good banter and tensions that pull some of them back into criminality as a mode of survival. Billy’s trajectory involves a seriously ill mother and highlights the lack of safety net for those who can’t afford health insurance in the US. But his growing desperation combines with a bigger sense of inadequacy to render him one-dimensionally villainous by the end.A more convincing tenderness grows between T and JD. The latter is the most rounded character, believing in the American dream and betrayed by Trump’s administration. His plotline brings a harrowing scene featuring ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement), followed by an impassioned monologue about immigration by Paula. Not every character is as well developed and the drama at times seems led by plot. But this is a vigorous first play, beautifully performed, alive and energetic, by a playwright of promise.AtPark theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesreviewsShareReuse this content"

This tense thriller, its action scattered across multiple timelines, was expertly acted by a high-calibre cast of home-grown stalwarts, including Keeley Hawes, David Morrissey, James Nesbitt and Ken Stott.It was a less familiar performer, the Turkish-born French actor Tchéky Karyo, who provided the main point of continuity between both series, as well as supplying their moral centre. As the dogged, philosophical detective Julien Baptiste, he is first seen tending to his bees and contemplating imminent retirement. That is, until a cold case from eight years earlier re-enters his life.Nesbitt plays a man whose five-year-old son was snatched from the (fictional) French town of Châlons du Bois, and who has returned to the area after spotting his child’s distinctive scarf in a recent photograph taken there. Baptiste feigns scepticism, but is soon making his own inquiries. During the original investigation, he had declared: “Sadly, we find [the boy] immediately or not at all.” His tenacity lends the series its momentum, his wisdom and humanity its depth.Karyo, who has died aged 72 of cancer, was no newcomer. He had been acting on screen since the early 1980s. His roles included an urban planner caught up in the romantic imbroglios ofEric Rohmer’s Full Moon in Paris (1984); a hunter, one of the few human characters in Jean-Jacques Annaud’s The Bear (1988); Bob, a recruiter and trainer of assassins, in Luc Besson’s stylish thriller La Femme Nikita (1990); and the Spanish mariner and explorer Martín Alonso Pinzón, who sails with Christopher Columbus, played by Gérard Depardieu, in Ridley Scott’s 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992).View image in fullscreenTchéky Karyo in Boat Story, 2023, in which he played a gangster called the Tailor.Photograph: Amazon/Everett/ShutterstockHe also played the Russian defence minister in the James Bond adventure GoldenEye and made headway beyond Europe, appearing as the chief villain, a drugs kingpin, in the action-comedy Bad Boys (both 1995), where he had the distinction of being shot dead by Will Smith in the film’s climax. He starred as Mel Gibson’s second-in-command inThe Patriot(2000), set during the American revolutionary war.But even Nostradamus, whom Karyo played in a 1994 biopic, might not have foreseen the actor’s late-period renaissance as a beloved sleuth on British television.It almost didn’t happen. When Karyo was first offered the role of Baptiste, he turned it down, considering the subject matter too dark for him to tackle only three months after the birth of his daughter. It was offered instead to the British actorTom Wilkinson, only for Karyo to undergo a last-minute change of heart.The character was loosely based on the real-life detective Jean-Francois Abgrall, author of the memoirInside the Mind of a Killer, which detailed his pursuit of the serial killer Francis Heaulme. Baptiste inherited Abgrall’s patient, ruminative approach with suspects.After having his leg slammed repeatedly in a car door by an adversary in the first series, Baptiste staggers through subsequent episodes with a limp, though Karyo confessed that he sometimes forgot which leg was the injured one.Having hunted sex offenders, kidnappers and serial killers, Baptiste bows out at the end of the second series facing his mightiest foe yet: a brain tumour. As he lies on the operating table in the final scene, the anaesthetic takes longer to work than expected. “Perhaps you are made of stronger things,” he is told.He lived to fight another day, returning for two series of his own spin-off, Baptiste, in 2019 and 2021, thefirst set in the Netherlands,the second in Hungary. The Telegraph said he “carries the series along on his charisma”. The show even turned him into a pin-up in his mid-60s. “I didn’t expect it,” he said. “It has made me feel young again.”Viewers who knew Karyo only from that reassuring role might have been surprised to find that he previously specialised in rage. In the irreverent and cartoonishly violent Dobermann (1997), for instance, he gives law enforcement an uglier face as a cop who acts as savagely as the criminals he is pursuing: he throws a baby across a room, pistol whips the child’s mother, and gives the infant a grenade as a plaything. Karyo played another corrupt cop opposite the martial arts star Jet Li in Kiss of the Dragon (2001).View image in fullscreenTchéky Karyo, left, with Mel Gibson in The Patriot, 2000.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockHe was born Baruh Djaki Karyo (Tchéky is the phonetic pronunciation of his middle name) in Istanbul to a Greek mother and Turkish father, who was a delivery driver. He was raised inParis. At 13, his parents separated, and his mother asked his father to take Karyo with him. “It was terrible,” he recalled. “My world was breaking.”Later, however, he “started to appreciate that she had the guts to do it; in the period she lived in, a woman would never do that, but she stood against my father and said, ‘It’s enough. I need to find my way and this doesn’t work.’”After being educated at lycée Arago, he began training to be an accountant before quitting to pursue acting, taking a series of menial jobs to support himself. He studied drama at the Cyrano theatre, then joined the Daniel Sorano company and the National Theatre of Strasbourg.He had a small role in The Return of Martin Guerre but first made a splash as a gangster’s psychotic stooge in the thriller La Balance (both 1982) and as a bank robber inAndrzej Żuławski’s garish L’Amour Braque (1985), inspired by Dostoevsky’s The Idiot.Following the success of Bad Boys andGoldenEye, Karyo’s profile rose in English-language cinema. In John Hillcoat’s Vertigo-like melodrama To Have and To Hold (1996), he played a man remodelling his new lover (Rachel Griffiths) in the image of his former wife. The following year, he starred with Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan in the intriguingly sour romcom Addicted to Love, about two jilted lovers who spy on their exes; Karyo played Ryan’s former partner, a restaurateur who takes up with Broderick’s ex-girlfriend.He also starred in the disaster movie The Core (2003) and with Nick Nolte in Neil Jordan’s The Good Thief (2002), and played the prophet Elisha in Mary Magdalene (2018) opposite Rooney Mara in the title role and Joaquin Phoenix as Jesus.Karyo was reunited with Harry and Jack Williams, writers of The Missing and Baptiste, for anotherBBCseries, Boat Story (2023), in which he played a gangster known as the Tailor. Though still violent, the tone this time was quirky and ironic.It was Baptiste, though, who remained closest to his heart. Playing him, said Karyo, “I feel I can be myself more than any other character.”He is survived by his second wife, the actor Valérie Keruzoré, whom he married in 2002, and their children, Louise and Liv, as well as by a daughter from his first marriage, to the actor Isabelle Pasco, which ended in divorce, and by one grandchild.Tchéky Karyo (Baruh Djaki Karyo), actor, born 4 October 1953; died 31 October 2025Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFranceTurkeyBBCJames BondGoldenEyeParisobituariesShareReuse this content"

The script is from John Logan, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter behind Gladiator, The Aviator and Hugo.The central role will be played by Jaafar Jackson, the singer’s real-life nephew, while Oscar nomineeColman Domingowill play Joe Jackson and other roles filled in by actors includingMiles Teller, Nia Long and Laura Harrier.“Michael’s life was complicated,” British producer Graham King said about the project. “As a film-maker, I look to humanise but not sanitise and present the most compelling, unbiased story I can capture in a single feature film and let the audience decide how they feel after watching it. Michael clearly remains an impactful, culturally relevant artist with a life and legacy worth exploring.”Allegations of sexual assault against Jackson were resurfaced in Dan Reed’s 2019 docuseriesLeaving Neverland, which included interviews with two accusers who claimed he had abused them as children. Reedreportedlyread a draft of the Michael script and called it “startlingly disingenuous” after it allegedly discredited both accusers.“Jackson is only ever seen caring for children with childhood cancer, or dancing with a little girl in a wheelchair, or tucking up multiple little boys, mostly his nephews, at sleepovers,” he said.Earlier this year Domingo spoke about the Jackson family and their embrace of the project at an event in Venice.Michael Jackson’s daughter Paris criticises ‘sugar-coated’ biopic about her fatherRead more“They’re very much in support of our film,” Domingosaidof Jackson’s children Paris and Prince. “I’m excited to be here at amfAR tonight with Paris. It feels like that’s a nice way for us to be together.”But Paris quicklydeniedany involvement on Instagram, writing: “Don’t be telling people I was ‘helpful’ on the set of a movie I had zero percent involvement in lol that is so weird. I read one of the first drafts of the script and gave my notes about what was dishonest/didn’t sit right with me and when they didn’t address it I moved on with my life. Not my monkeys not my circus. God bless and god speed.”She added: “A big reason why I haven’t said anything up until this point is because I know a lot of you guys are gonna be happy with it. A big section, the film panders to a very specific section of my dad’s fandom that still lives in the fantasy, and they’re gonna be happy with it.”Michael carries a reported budget of $155m and comes out in the wake of disappointing box office returns forthis year’s Bruce Springsteen biopic, which has only made $31m since its release last month.Michael is scheduled to be released in cinemas in April 2026Explore more on these topicsBiopicsMichael JacksonPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Yet actors including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Sean Bean have pushed back against the profession, with some suggesting they interrupt their creativity.Speaking toLas Culturistas podcastto promote the release of Die My Love, in which she plays a woman who becomes increasingly disturbed after the birth of her child, Lawrence said: “We did not have [an intimacy coordinator], or maybe we did but we didn’t really … I felt really safe with Rob.”She continued: “He is not pervy and very in love with [partner] Suki [Waterhouse]. We mostly were just talking about our kids and relationships. There was never any weird, like, ‘Does he think I like him?’”“If there was a little bit of that I would probably have an intimacy coordinator. A lot of male actors get offended if you don’t want to fuck them, and then the punishment starts. He was not like that.”Earlier this week, industry website IMDb officially recognised intimacy coordinators, alongside 11 other professional credits including choreography, craft services, and puppetry, and announced that crew members would now be billed as such. They were previously grouped under the “additional crew” section.Yet intimacy coordinators face continued press suggesting they need not be industry standard, with high-profile actors rejecting their involvement. Lawrence’s rationale echoes that of Aniston, who said she rejected the interventions of an intimacy coordinator when working with Jon Hamm on scenes for The Morning Show.View image in fullscreen‘Such a gentleman’ … Jon Hamm and Jennifer Aniston on The Morning Show.Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy“Jon was such a gentleman, always – I mean every move, every cut, ‘You OK?’” she recalled. “It was also very choreographed. That’s the beauty of [director] Mimi [Leder] and our gorgeous editor, the music and lighting. So, you don’t prepare.”Aniston continued, “They said, ‘Where someone asks you if you’re OK,’ and I’m like, ‘Please, this is awkward enough!’ We’re seasoned – we can figure this one out. And we had Mimi there.”Despite its numerous scenes of sexual activity and frequent nudity, Anora – Sean Baker’s multiple Oscar-winner about the affair between a sex worker and a Russian oligarch’s son – proceeded to shoot without an intimacy coordinator.Mikey Madison, the star of the film, said she and her co-star Mark Eydelshteyn “decided it would be best to just keep it small.“My character is a sex worker, and I had seen Sean’s films and know his dedication to authenticity. I was ready for it. As an actress, I approached it as a job.”Her comments met with a backlash from intimacy coordinators, as didthose of Paltrow, who earlier this year said that working on the forthcoming Marty Supreme, which is her first leading role in a film since 2010, was her first experience of the relatively new profession, which she “did not know existed”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can step a little bit back.’ I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but … if someone is like, ‘OK, and then he’s going to put his handhere,’  I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”Speaking on a panel shortly after these comments were published, former Channel 4 drama head Caroline Hollick called them “irresponsible” and flagged that most of those speaking out against intimacy coordinators were sufficiently famous as to command their own power and protection on set.View image in fullscreen‘We decided it would be best to just keep it small’ … Mark Eydelshteyn and Mikey Madison in Anora.Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy“Every now and then an actor makes a comment over whether they like intimacy coordinators or not,” said Hollick. “Gwyneth Paltrow said she grew up in a time when [people in Hollywood] ‘took our kit off and got on with it’. As a powerful woman in Hollywood acting with a man much younger than her, well I’m sure [Chalamet] is chill but I thought it was quite an irresponsible thing to say.”Michael Douglas, meanwhile, said he felt the primary burden of responsibility when shooting heterosexual sex scenes fell on the male actor, rather than a third party.“In my experience, you take responsibility as the man to make sure the woman is comfortable, you talk it through,” he said. “You say, ‘OK, I’m gonna touch you here if that’s all right’.

He has a way with suspensions – crunchy enough for resolution to break through like sunlight, but strictly PG-rated compared with the harmonic adventures of his contemporaries. His music is as unfashionably essential as a five-pack of M&S briefs, asineffably English as queueing.From two royal weddings and a coronation to choir rehearsals, school assemblies and carol services across the UK and North America, British composerJohn Rutterhas dominated the anglophone choral scene for six decades. At 80, he is in a league of his own: a niche national treasure, even referred to as “the composer who owns Christmas”.St Paul’s was packed for this concert featuring the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Bach Choir with Rutter himself conducting. The cathedral’s magnificent dome makes for an acoustic in which coughing ricochets like gunfire, but this cross-generational audience sat through the long programme in rapt silence. The dome can also wreak havoc for the unsuspecting performer, of course – but it was no match for Rutter. He simply worked with its foibles, inserting minute pauses to allow chords to bloom and leaving its extraordinary reverberation to take over at the end of each number.Two large-scale works for chorus and orchestra by Rutter sandwiched Vaughan Williams’ Symphony No 5, in which the rougher edges of VW’s pastoral modernism were smoothed to a high shine, the RPO’s strings expensively blended, the climaxes irresistibly majestic and topped by gleaming brass. The world premiere of Rutter’s I’ll Make Me a World showcased miraculous diction from the Bach Choir and the RPO’s flair for musical code-switching, as baritone Jonathan Brown and mezzo Melanie Marshall led the way through gentle references to African American spirituals, blues and gospel.Rutter’s 2015 cantata The Gift of Life, setting a range of religious texts including verses of his own, offered a subtly different compendium: tender melodies and snazzy syncopations, Broadway-ready orchestral introductions and sopranos illuminating the texture’s upper reaches. It was polished, predictable and visibly enjoyed by the musicians on stage – unmistakably the work of a master craftsman.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It can help to consider if you’re being true to yourselfRead moreLeading questionsEleanor Gordon-SmithThu 6 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 16.44 ESTShareWhen I was 17, I was quiet, an observer on the fringes. That was often mistaken for being wise. Now 70 (and, by the way, gay), I am chatty and opinionated with a tendency to talk over others in conversation. I have come by the changes honestly, so I don’t whip myself over it because I am enjoying expressing myself. But I do wonder if this is a normal progression, the loss of filters with ageing, or if I am simply losing my sociability – going off the rails in some way.While I like being friendly to all and enjoy the company of women especially, I recognise how easily they can be hurt. I seem to put out a strong “new-best-friend” vibe but then sometimes, when they step close, I feel crowded and back off. The flip-flop clearly offends, and I don’t want to be doing that, but I frame it as being true to myself. Is this a destructive habit and, if so, should I dial down the friendliness?Helen Garner and Dua Lipa’s interview caused a personal crisis. How can I be ‘quietly intelligent’? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:How responsible are we for the ways other people see us?A lot of people have some version of the experience you’re describing, I think. Something about them seems to invite quick closeness, and they wind up with relationships or expectations they didn’t quite mean to create. A radio producer friend of mine, professionally trained to conjure intimate conversations, sort of forgot how not to do that in everyday interactions and found people opened up and bonded to them quite quickly – maybe quicker than either of them would want. And then comes the turn: the moment the other person wants more than you meant to give, the moment it feels like being consumed, and now everybody feels bad. They feel rejected by the flip-flop. You feel bad for causing pain and spooked by the eerie mirror-world of versions of you. The whole thing’s unpleasant and confusing and everybody’s left wondering who’s at fault.On one hand, there’s a strong instinct to say “this isn’t on me”. The version of me that you created in your head is your responsibility. It’s a weird puppet that looks a lot like me, and talks in my voice, but it’s your hand producing the motion – I didn’t say I wanted to be your best friend. I didn’t say yes to those expectations.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningOn the other, this pattern can cause genuine hurt. However we split the bill on the hurt, it’s still hurt. Even if we’re not stringing people along – if they’re singlehandedly deceiving themselves – we might have some obligation to prevent their mistake if we can reliably predict they’ll make it.So there are problems on both your hands! What I hear in your question is the bind between them. Your two choices are to tone down the extroversion that at last feels exciting (and risk not being true), or do what feels self-expressive (and risk causing hurt).I think which way you go depends on how much thisisbeing true to yourself. Both the chattiness and the wish to back off. They could well be.Or they could be part of a pattern that you don’t ultimately identify with. Sometimes we feel threatened or consumed by totally normal bids for closeness, not because they are actuallythreatening or unreasonable but because something in our past taught us that, when you give a bit, you lose a mile. A ghost in our memory makes normal attempts at connection feel like invasions. So we get cross at people for “demanding” things from us, when really all they did was show interest or reciprocate the interest we showed them first. If your wish to pull back isn’t a response to genuinely unreasonable crowding – if it’s shadowboxing with memory ghosts – then it’s not being true to yourself. It’s not being true to what’s actually going on, either.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The golden light lingers a little longer now, and somehow the evenings are full again. Autumn feels like the true social season of the year: the guest bedroom (for which we have an informal booking system) is full through to the end of the year, and suddenly every weekend and many weekday evenings are wrapped around company. Even if it’s just dinner at home for house guests, the rhythm has changed.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When it’s just us for dinner, anything goes – it is very relaxed and informal, and the emphasis is on ease of execution and speed of service. For a dinner party, meanwhile, we go all out: trips to the butcher and speciality deli, and as much time in the kitchen as is needed. But cooking for, and indeed with, house guests falls somewhere delightfully in between: cosy and welcoming, elevated but not exhausting. The kind of food that says: you’re here, you matter, let’s linger.This autumn, we’ve been turning to the sort of recipes that hit that sweet spot. Rukmini Iyer’sroast red pepper and tomato orecchiette, topped with pistachios and ricotta, is an easy win – full of colour and comfort, but smart enough for guests. On chillier evenings, a pot of Felicity Cloake’svegetable tagine, fragrant with saffron, squash, olives and prunes, practically cooks itself while you pour the wine and set the table.View image in fullscreenEasy breakfast … Honey and Co’s sesame and pine nut air fryer granola.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian.And, for the kind of meal that asks very little of you, meaning it’s just perfect for the last night of a long weekend, we love Gill Meller’schicken, paprika and tomato stew(pictured top), one of those dishes that comes out of the oven bubbling and ready to serve straight from the pan.In the mornings, when houseguests drift into the kitchen in their slippers, there’s nothing better than a batch ofgranola: crunchy, gently sweet and endlessly adaptable, it’s the kind of thing you can make ahead and keep in a jar, ready for slow breakfasts and second cups of coffee. And, of course, when there are guests around, it’s never a bad idea to havea good, breakfast-friendly loaf cakekicking around.This kind of cooking isn’t about showmanship, it’s about care. The dishes are forgiving, happy to wait a little, and they make space for friends to join in the cooking, to help set the table, for stories, laughter and another glass of wine. The tablecloth might not be ironed, the chairs might not match, but there’s a warmth that makes everything glow, and that makes us not mind all of the laundry that comes with operating a free bed-and-breakfast.My week in foodView image in fullscreenMake it at home … Mandy Yin’s spicy glass noodle and prawn salad.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian.Autumn reading (and eating)|Our cookbook of the season isMandy Yin’s Simply Malaysian, a cuisine that, until now, has rather intimidated us.

Right.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When I put out a call onmy social mediato ask for the contacts of inspiring women who work in whisky, my inbox was flooded with names, press releases and, most hearteningly, whisky professionals commending their contemporaries and friends. “The industry is getting better at giving women credit for the work they do,” whisky educator and writerKristiane Westraytold me, noting thatblender Margaret Nicol at Whyte & Mackay, who started in the industry way back in 1974, has only recently been in the spotlight. Similarly, Maureen Robinson, who worked in whisky for more than 45 years, was inducted into theWhisky Magazine Hall of Fame as recently as 2020. “There are also more women studying Stem subjects [science, technology, engineering and mathematics], which is usually a requirement in roles such as distilling and blending.”Support from within the industry is crucial to these women’s success, which is where theOurWhisky Foundationcomes in: this non-profit, established in March 2022 byBecky Paskin, supports women working in whisky internationally, and has the backing of the wider industry. Its dedicated editorial output (managed byaward-winning drinks writer Millie Milliken) is a bulletin for women’s wins in the industry.On the consumer side of things, are we seeing more women there, too? A few months ago, pop divaSabrina Carpenter was namedas the new face of Johnnie Walker, which, though it received a mixed reception from industry professionals, made something very clear: brands are targeting a female audience right at the nascence of their drinking habits, to secure the whisky drinkers of the future. (I doubt many 60-year-old old-school whisky collectors will be scrambling for the Johnnie Walker because Carpenter put her name to it, but I might be wrong.) That audience is growing, too: women now make up36% of whisky drinkers, up fromjust 15% in the 1990s. I asked Fikayo Ifaturoti, founder ofCellar Atelier, a wine and spirits consultancy, if she’s noticed an uptake in her female clientele: “I’ve seen women’s engagement deepen, but whisky still feels like ‘the other room’: admired by many, yet seldom invited into their collections,” she says. “For many men, whisky has long carried generational meaning – a father passing down a bottle, a toast at milestones – but women are often written out of that narrative.”Distillery experiences, for example, which tend to be built around clay shooting or fishing, rarely imagine how other audiences, especially women, wish to engage. “Why do we see special editions for Father’s Day, say, but not for Mother’s Day?” Ifaturoti asks. “The next frontier is the marketplace, and to craft experiences with women in mind as well as men.”Four whiskies defined by womenLaphroaig 10-Year-Old Single Malt Whisky£31 (on offer; 70cl) Waitrose, 40%.

Just reach for a lid and let the steam do its workBen LippettThu 6 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareSo, hear me out: the best baked eggs don’t ever hit the oven … When testing these recipes, I found that simply adding a lid creates a steamy environment to cook the top of the eggs, delivering a gently cooked, perfectly poached egg with a tender white and a warm, runny yolk. The intense, dry heat of the oven is much more aggressive than steam, and has a tendency to dry everything out and overcook the yolk. I’ve given you two sauces as a jumping-off point, but get creative. One is a super-simple turmeric coconut curry, while the merguez ragu is a riff on eggs in purgatory, or, to the likes of you and me, eggs baked in spicy tomato sauce.Turmeric coconut curry baked eggs (pictured above)Prep10 minCook55 minServes2Olive oil1 onion,peeled and finely choppedFine sea salt2 garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped10g fresh ginger,peeled and finely chopped1 tbsp ground turmeric½ tbsp cumin seeds6-8 curry leaves200ml coconut milk400g tin chickpeasA few basil leaves, plus extra to serve4 eggs2 green finger chillies, finely sliced, to serveSet a 25cm heavy cast-iron pot or frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add a shot of olive oil, toss in the onion and a pinch of salt, and cook for five to six minutes, until the onion is starting to crisp and caramelise. Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric, cumin seeds and curry leaves, leave to sizzle, stirring occasionally, for three to four minutes, then tip in the coconut milk and the chickpeas and their tin liquid. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and leave it to tick over for 30-35 minutes, until thickened and deep yellow in colour. Season with salt, then stir in the basil leaves.Use the back of a spoon to create four little pockets in the sauce, then crack an egg into each. Sprinkle the top of each egg with a little salt, then cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low heat for two to three minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks just warm.

It was Deptford market in the late 2000s: a reliably chaotic, noisy morass of jostling bodies, the wafted smell of sweating burger onions and a vast section where the “stalls” generally comprised gatherings of orphaned trainers, boxy VHS players and other random house-clearance items dumped on to lengths of tarpaulin. I was an eager but gastronomically green 25-year-old in my first proper flatshare and this ragtag locus of trade became an early site of core dining memories. I thoughtfully appraised very ordinary vegetables, channelling Rick Stein inGascony; bought warm, hectically seeded granary loaves from the Percy Ingle bakery; ate average pub Thai, better kerbside rotisserie chicken; and generally tried, with limited success, to ignore the creeping sense that I had settled in a part of town that wanted for some structure or culinary vitality.It was this atmosphere of cultural nascence into which the Deptford Projecttrundled. Predominantly housed on a former railway yard in the midst of redevelopment, this cafe, cultural hub and outdoor cinema was located around a decommissioned 1960s commuter train, boldly redecorated and reimagined by designerMorag Myerscough: a becalmed, brightly daubed piece of rolling stock that, between 2008 and 2014, jutted out into the high street like a glitch in the urban matrix. Though it sounds, I know, like an unforgivable cliche of “gritty” hipsterdom, the Deptford Project had a ramshackle edge, a palpable community ethos, genuinely affordable prices and a charming streak of weirdness (the toilet, if memory serves, was an eternally freezing garden shed turned into a shrine to Elvis).An umami-boosting lick of Marmite turns it into a soothing, early winter warmer, and a repository for new-season leeks.I do not remember a great deal about the menu of homemade cakes, sandwiches and brunch plates purportedly featuring eggs laid by the cafe’s own free-range hens. But what I do remember is the homity pie: a hulking great wedge of pastry with a crumbly, butter-rich shortness, generously filled with soft hunks of potato suspended in a set, sweetly lactic cheese and leek sauce. Homity was, to my vegetarian option-averse sensibilities, a total revelation; quiche mistranslated by a rugged, carb-addicted farmhand. And while it has a certain homespun, cosy-jumpered old-fashionedness – boosted by its association with the Devon land girls who supposedly invented it, as well asCranks, the pioneering vegetarian restaurant chain that popularised it – I think an umami-boosting lick of Marmite turns it into an intensely soothing, early winter warmer, and repository for new-season leeks.Serve with winter tomatoes or sharply dressed salad leaves. Above all, savour the fact that this expression of thrifty, comfort-forward resourcefulness works just as well in a contemporary home kitchen as it did in a train carriage cafe in credit-crunched, transitional Deptford.Marmite and leek homity pieServes6320g sheet shortcrust pastry(shop-bought is fine)20g unsalted butterOlive oil1 medium onion, peeled and chopped1 leek, washed, trimmed and finely slicedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped600gfloury potatoes, peeled and quartered100g baby spinach leaves2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped1 tsp grated nutmeg1 tsp English mustard1 heaped tbsp Marmite200g grated hard cheese(mature cheddar, gruyere or, even better, a mixture of the two)150ml double creamBegin by rolling out the pastry so that it can be pressed into the base of a 20cm springform tin or greased pie dish, with any excess trimmed off and saved for another use. Heat the butter and a generous glug of olive oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed saucepan or wok. Add the chopped onion and leek, and season thoroughly, before frying over a low to medium heat for 10 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further five minutes.Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in salted water for about 10 minutes, until tender, then drain and add to the softened onion mix. Fold in the spinach leaves, spring onions, nutmeg, mustard, Marmite, 150g of the grated cheese and the double cream. Stir thoroughly to combine.Pour the cheese-and-potato mixture into the pastry-lined dish, level, then grate the remaining 50g cheese on top. Bake in the middle of a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 40 minutes, until golden and bubbling. Leave the pie to cool and set for at least 20 minutes, then turn out on to a plate and slice into thick wedges.Picky, by Jimi Famurewa, is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £20.

Beside her, a man plucks a slow melody from his guitar. Arrayed on chairs and cobblestones in front of them, a large crowd sits in an expectant silence. From a nearby balcony, laundry sways in the sultry Calabrian breeze.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The guitar quickens, and the woman issues a string of tremulous notes with all the solemnity of a muezzin. She clutches a hand drum, beating out a rhythm that draws the crowd to its feet. As people surge forward, stamping and whirling around the square, the singing intensifies and the drum’s relentless thud deepens. Thefestival of Sustarìahas begun.Southern toe of Italy map and Sicily“Sustarìa is a word in the dialect of Lago,” says Cristina Muto, who co-founded the festival in summer 2020. “It is a creative restlessness, which doesn’t let you sit still.” We’re speaking at a drinks party the evening before the annual event, on a terrace overlooking Lago’s clay-tiled roofs, when her brother Daniele appears with a jug of local wine in hand. “Welcome to Lagos Angeles, Calabrifornia,” he winks, pouring me a cup.View image in fullscreen‘Creative restlessness’ … The festival of Sustarìa, in Lago.Lago is a hilltop village in the province of Cosenza, overlooking the Mediterranean. It’s surrounded by sprawling olive groves and small plots where families cultivate figs, chestnuts and local grains. Cristina and Daniele were born and raised in this grey-stoned hamlet, a medieval outpost of the Kingdom of the Lombards. Although their pride in Lago is palpable, few of the Laghitani I meet live here all year round. Like many young people from southern Italy, they have left in search of opportunities that are scarce in Calabria.The Sustaria festival puts a spotlight on Calabria’s ancient agrarian and cultural heritageIt’s against this backdrop that Cristina co-founded Sustarìa. “The trend is longstanding and severe,” she tells me, “but people still live here, and there are communities that thrive despite the problems. If more people stay or return, things will get better.” By spotlighting the allure of the region’s heritage, she hopes to play a part in this.With agriculture historically shaping Calabria’s economy and its inhabitants’ daily lives, many traditions have agrarian roots. The dance that erupted on the festival’s first night was thetarantella. It features distinctive footwork, with dancers kicking their heels rapidly. “It’s a dance of the field workers,” Cristina says. “Some say it began as a way to sweat out venom from spider bites during harvests; others say tired workers in need of a creative outlet danced slowly and just with their feet, and over time the pace and range of movement increased.”View image in fullscreenOlive groves at Agriturismo Cupiglione which offers guest rooms close to LagoThe vocals on display that night told of another aspect of the region’s history: its frequent colonisation. Calabria was variously conquered by Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Normans, Arabs, Lombards and Bourbons. The folk songs we heard were replete with Greek scales and Arabic cadences, a melting pot of Mediterranean timbres.After the concert, the crowd migrated to a field by a small waterfall on the outskirts of Lago for dinner featuring regional dishes:rosamarina(the pescatarian version ofnduja, known as “Calabrian caviar” made from tiny fish); fried courgette flowers;cipollarossa di Tropea(red onions from the popular beachtown of Tropea); andpecorinocrotonese, a sheep’s cheese from the Crotone province.Over dinner I spoke with two other festival organisers, Claudia and her husband Alberto. Claudia, a Lago native, returned permanently, after a career in aerospace engineering, to run the B&BAgriturismo Cupiglionewith Alberto. Nestled in woodland a few kilometres from Lago, Cupiglione was founded 25 years ago by Claudia’s parents as a restaurant with guest rooms. After closing during the pandemic, it was renovated and reopened in 2023 as a B&B with seven rooms for up to 18 guests (doubles from €40). The change in direction paid off, and Cupiglione has since welcomed hundreds of visitors to the area, evenly split between Italian and international travellers.During my stay, I’m lodging in a house on the edge of Lago, thanks to the Sustarìa team. Hospitality runs deep during the festival; organisers open up their homes and those of their relatives to anyone who enquires through social media. Other options abound during the festival and year-round, including B&Bs such as Cupiglione andA Casa di Ely(doubles from €60), a short walk from where I stayed.View image in fullscreenA musician playing the zampogna, an ancient form of bagpipes.Photograph: Valentina ProcopioThe following afternoon, I return to the field beforeaperitivi, where I meet up with Cristina, who explains the growth of her initiative: “Initially, it was just locals who came to Sustarìa, but then people from other parts of Italy and even other countries started coming. Every year it grows.” This year, there are nearly 600 people in attendance.Eric, a Londoner studying in Zurich, is one such international guest. Eric also attendedFelici & Conflenti, a festival in late July hosted by friends of the Sustarìa team, which focuses on preserving and reviving the region’s ancient music. It has held 11 editions over as many years, each one featuring a winter and summer instalment, to which more people flock each year. It takes place in Conflenti, a small inland village nestled at the foot of the Reventino mountain, at the confluence of two small rivers (hence its name).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I stroll over, and catch sight of someone playing thezampogna,which looks like a set of bagpipes improvised from foraged materials, and is truly ancient – it counts the Roman emperor Nero among its historical admirers.Initially, it was just locals who came to Sustarìa, but then people from other parts of Italy and even other countries started comingThe next morning, we head to the hilltop town of Fiumefreddo Bruzio, a short drive from Lago and officially recognised as one of “Italy’s most beautiful villages”. Clinging to the western slopes of the Apennines, this medieval village offers panoramic views of the swelling coastline, which traces the Tyrrhenian Sea. Its narrow, meandering streets are lined with squat houses made of the local grey stone, quarried from the surrounding mountains. We wander around Il castello della Valle,a sprawling 13th-century Norman castle partly destroyed by Napoleonic troops, but retaining a splendidportale Rinascimentale–or Renaissance gate – still in excellent condition.View image in fullscreenCastello della Valle in Fiumefreddo Bruzio, one of ‘Italy’s most beautiful villages’.Photograph: Yuriy Brykaylo/AlamyAt Palazzo Rossi, on the edge of town, we take a seat at a cafe and sip local craft beer as we admire the view of the active volcano Mount Stromboli, across the water.“You should see it in the winter,” Cristina says. “The air is cooler, so it becomes even clearer. Everything here is completely different in the winter, but most people don’t see it as visitors come mainly in the summer,” she adds with a note of regret.The sun starts to sink into the horizon. In the square, a band starts setting up for an evening gig. A waiter brings over a plate of bread and olives to our table, on the house. “Things are quieter but not empty. There are almost as many events as in summer. And you get to see how the locals live during the rest of the year.” Cristina tears off a piece of bread. “And, of course, the hospitality never changes – people are always welcomed with open arms.”Sustarìa will return to Lago for its sixth instalment on 1-3 August 2026.

It wasn’t my daughter’s fault – she was, mercifully, a wonderful and cheerful baby – but I underestimated what a huge shift it would be at an already stressful time. When I was pregnant, we moved to a new town, to a wreck of a house we planned to do up. My mum, who was ill, moved in with us, and then I was the carer of a newborn and a dying parent – at the two extremes of life, but sharing many of the same needs, and often at the same time.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Emine SanerMy daughter’s first year was the last year of my mother’s life – and probably the loneliest of mine. One of the dark secrets of new motherhood is how lonely it can be, and I had made it worse for myself by moving to a place where I didn’t know anyone. I would go to baby groups in the morning, not sure how I could make friends when I didn’t even know who I was any more. Long dark afternoons would drag on, and I’d force myself to walk endlessly with the pram, resentfully noticing other new mothers who had their own mothers with them. This photo, taken in a town centre Boots photo booth in 2014, when my daughter was seven months old, was for my partner’s birthday card, but more importantly was a way of killing time on one of those afternoons. I’d planned to dress us up for each of the four snaps, but wrangling a wriggling baby in a small space, with seconds between pictures, meant only the sunglasses made it.In kinder moments, I can be proud of how I (just about) coped that year, but I’m not often kind to myself. Mostly I feel guilty for bringing my daughter, who was planned and wanted, into a life with a mum who was already grieving. But memory is also unkind, because although I now remember it as a difficult time, I know it was also filled with fun, and love, as this photo reminds me. I look deranged, as I probably did that entire year, but my baby looks happy.Zoe WilliamsView image in fullscreenZoe Williams (left) and her sister.Photograph: Courtesy of Zoe WilliamsIn 1987, my sister and I were going to Hamburg for one of our dad’s first or second cousins’ first or second weddings. I was 14, she was 16 and I think only one of us needed a passport photo but we went to a photo booth for the kicks. It was on the concourse of Victoria station in London, but scrub everything you might know about what that looks like now, because this was the end of the degraded 80s, and Caffè Nero hadn’t been invented. Costa Coffee had, but it was so novel we used to call it Costa Packet. If you wanted to orientate yourself – meet someone there, remember who the hell you were – you had to do it by a platform number or the clock.Anyway, just before I went behind the curtain, she said, “Wait! You have a hair on your chin.”I’m 52 now, and I’m sure I speak for all of us when I say a rogue hair is no big deal. You wouldn’t bat an eye if one came out of your ear to meet one growing out of your nose. But I was 14. She went to brush it away; nothing happened. She brushed it again. “Wait, it’s …” She yanked it. “It’s growing. It’s growing out of your face.” She started laughing so hard she was crying before she even made any noise. I don’t know if anybody’s ever noticed this before, but it’s really hard, when your sister is laughing, not to laugh. Soon I was bent double, and my mascara had run, and we needed to go to the loo before the photo to sort it out, which set us back 30 whole pence – a steaming rip-off then, but at least you could make change.We went off, fixed my eye makeup, came back, and she said, “Wait! You didn’t get the hair out of your face?” If we’d been different people, in another age, one of us would have had tweezers, but we didn’t, and pulling it with your fingers isn’t a skill you’re born with. She started laughing again, and fully wet herself. We’d dropped a king’s ransom on the facilities and she hadn’t even weed.You can’t really tell from the photos that anything’s happened, but every time the hair grows back – jet black and incredibly luscious, approximately biweekly – and every time I pass a photo booth, and every time I use a passport, I start laughing again. That hair, and the day itself, are as fresh as the day they were born.Ammar KaliaView image in fullscreenAmmar Kalia (bottom) with his brother, mother and grandmother, in about 1998.Photograph: Courtesy of Ammar KaliaGrowing up, my Saturdays mainly consisted of traipsing to the local Asda for the weekly food shop. While my mum worked at her optician’s business, my dad would drag me from aisle to aisle for hours, scouring the shelves for the best deals before heading to the high street grocers for their specialities – cheap cucumbers at one, waxy lemons at another, kilos of rice at the last. This was practical, purposeful father-son time, an experience rooted in care but distinctly lacking in fun.Saturdays were different when my mum had a day off. Suddenly, the food shop was abandoned and instead we might go to the cinema or eat KFC for lunch, since her care was instinctual and often chaotic.On one of these Saturdays with her in the late 90s, when I was four or five, my older brother and grandma joined us to head to Hounslow’s Treaty Centre, the local, plastic-floored shopping centre. I can’t remember why we were all together but I do remember my mum spotting a photo booth in a dark corner and insisting we capture the moment.It reminds me of spontaneous Saturdays of fun with my mumI had only been in a booth once before, to take my passport photo, and the prospect of us all cramming in was exciting and overwhelming. My mum fed a note into the machine and since my grandma was wearing a sari, we stuffed her with her folds of fabric in the back first. My mum then sat on the stool and perched me on her lap while my preteen brother squeezed in. She tapped at the controls as we squirmed, growing confused at the range of options available.Suddenly, the camera flashed and we jumped in shock. Someone began giggling, then we all did, and the bulb flashed again. The same thing happened three more times, to increasing bewilderment. Finally, enough time went by in silence and we realised it was over. We tumbled out of the booth, sweating and picked up the five images my mum had bought.A year later, my grandma died of bowel cancer. My mum had those images framed and put on her dressing table as a reminder of that day. When I was 19, my mum died of cancer too, and ever since I’ve had that same frame on my desk.I look at it every day and each time I see something new: joy, tiredness, youth, old age, love. It makes me think of my mum’s body close to mine, that warmth and protection I’ll never experience again. If it wasn’t for the photo booth, that fleeting moment would never have been captured. It’s also a constant reminder of those spontaneous Saturdays of fun my mum would create, and it spurs me to carry on living as she would, being open to silliness and distraction – even if it means the food shop has to wait.Remona AlyIt was 1997, during my second year at university, when my accidental interfaith girl gang and I – a Catholic, a Protestant, a Muslim and an atheist (plus her boyfriend at the time) – piled into a photo booth. We spotted the little selfie-kiosk during a spontaneous Saturday out in Staines – the closest fun town we could get to from our leafy Surrey campus.View image in fullscreenRemona Aly (right) and her university friends, in 1997.Photograph: Courtesy of Remona AlyThe resulting picture captures a formative moment for me. I was navigating a different, sometimes challenging, identity as a new hijab wearer. Back at home, several people hadn’t exactly welcomed my decision. One grimaced, another called me a nun, a few asked if I was now a fundamentalist. Headscarves were rare in the late 90s, and here at university, I worried about how people might react. But, as I grappled with unsupportive reactions and snide remarks, the women in the picture were my rocks.Dom, Abi, Hannah and I bonded right from freshers’ week. We studied classics and English literature between us and chatted over Tesco Value toast and tea until the early hours.When I’d first moved into student halls, I felt out of place as I unpacked; finding a corner of a shared bathroom to hide mylota(basically a bidet, Indian style), which was actually a measuring jug. I was nervous about wearing my simple black hijab in a public setting for the first time. But, while I didn’t escape the odd uncomfortable remark from other students – once a guy in a lift grabbed hold of the end of my hijab and sneered, “What is this?”, another scoffed that I must know all about women’s rights – these three women took me for who I was from day one, measuring jug and all.They carried me towards more confidence. They helped me step into a space where I could feel more rooted in my faith and myself. They often joined me for student Islamic society events – granted, they were mainly there for the food, but it also felt natural for my non-Muslim friends to be part of that world with me.Meanwhile our uni house was known to have the best parties – anyone and everyone could join. There’d be bottles of booze in the kitchen, and when it was time to pray, I’d sneak off to my room, sticking a paper sign on my door saying, “Prayer in progress”, so my housemates knew not to barge in. Although one of them thought it would be hilarious to cross through the word “prayer” and scribble “smoking” instead. I keep that scrap of paper in my student diary to this day.This humble picture is more than just a photo booth image. It’s a visual reminder of how these three women were a core part of my story. They helped me feel more certain of who I was. I don’t remember a time I have ever felt more safe.Morwenna FerrierView image in fullscreenMorwenna Ferrier (left) and her friend.Photograph: Courtesy of Morwenna FerrierThe afternoon we took this there was no party, no event. Just me and my friend mid-week sinking a bottle of rosé while I periodically dragged her outside to smoke, unworried about anything because back then – 2017 – we lived lives that allowed for that.Now, of course, we are serious people and I’d sooner stick my hand on a hotplate than step into one of those booths. But that day, we’d just come out of the bathroom and found the booth, wedged into the corridor, with no queue. My friend nudged me inside and we started dicking about.As you can see, she is a visual person, and I am not. But I think on some level I was flattered that she wanted a photo with me. I never saw myself as a “fun” person, and I’ve never been good at navigating any gathering that involved getting one of these photos with your mates.Maybe that’s why I like this photo, even though I still hate the forced fun of it. Because it captured a precise moment of nothingness, a person caught halfway between who she was and who she wanted to be, and her friend who liked her all the same.Rich PelleyView image in fullscreenRich Pelley (right) and his friend Phil, pictured in 2012.Photograph: Courtesy of Rich PelleyI spent most of the 00s blagging me and my mate Phil into the Virgin Media Louder Lounge at V Festival in Chelmsford. Not only was the ticket to the festival free, but once inside this roped-off section, you could eat and drink as much as you like, safely shielded from the rest of the festivalgoers. We’d spend the days sipping free cocktails and barely watching any music, alongside former Big Brother contestants and journalists who had clearly promised coverage when they hadn’t even packed a pen.This photo was taken in 2012, when we nearly missed the Stone Roses as Phil had booked a free massage. By the time the Killers headlined, we were already home, watching it on telly instead.The V Festival shut down in 2017. This photo reminds me that, these days, I’m far happier among the punters who have paid good money to watch their favourite bands and celebrate the unparalleled emotion of feeling collectively human.Sundus AbdiView image in fullscreenSundus Abdi (right) and Ramla.Photograph: Courtesy of Sundus AbdiRamla and I have been friends since we were 11 – long enough to have a shared archive of badly lit photos. We met at the mosque the summer before secondary school, when I initially tried to act too cool to talk to her, a mix of shyness and misplaced confidence. Later, when my mum came to pick me up, I waved to Ramla from the car. She asked who the new girl was, and I said: “My new best friend.” Apparently her sister asked her the same question, and Ramla gave the same answer.We grew up side by side in Birmingham: getting in trouble together, eating chips after school, enduring many awkward phases. As teenagers who lived on Pinterest and Tumblr, taking photo booth pictures in Urban Outfitters was peak coolness – it was proof you’d had a proper day out. After shopping trips or iced-coffee runs, we’d cram into the booth, adjusting our hijabs as the countdown started, trying to look presentable.Recently, after both moving to London, we decided to take another strip of photos to mark the new beginning. It felt like a full-circle moment: the same poses and panic before the first flash, except this time we were in our mid-20s, pretending to be composed adults. When the strip finally printed, we burst out laughing. The photos came out exactly as they always did – slightly offbeat and wildly unflattering. We’ve taken so many together over the years, most now buried in books and memory boxes. One of us always keeps a copy, promising not to lose it again.The new strip is already creased from being passed between us and living in the bottom of our bags. I’ll probably lose it again, but that’s fine. We can always take another.Sasha MistlinView image in fullscreenSasha Mistlin (right) and his girlfriend, pictured at Revolution in Cambridge, 2023.Photograph: Courtesy of Sasha MistlinI met my girlfriend in the summer of 2023, a few months after a period of mental illness that had taken me out of work and left me rebuilding from scratch. She was different immediately – not in some mythical love-at-first-sight way, but she was adventurous and willing to trust a near-stranger to come along for the ride. By our fourth date, we’d booked flights to Rome, where she’d gone to school, which promised life-changing burrata and anchovy sandwiches.Then came a pair of stumbling blocks: her grandfather died the week we were meant to go and the trip clashed with his funeral. She decided to come anyway but the emotional stakes were certainly raised. Then, the night before our flight, I realised my passport was too close to expiry for me to board the plane. We sat dejected in an airport Pret, wondering if we were really meant to be after all.But then a brainwave. Why not reroute to Cambridge instead – the closest city to Stansted and somewhere I knew well from my time at university? Something about it made sense: I could show her somewhere that mattered to me when I couldn’t yet see the places that mattered to her.My expression is caught somewhere between smug and lost; hers is half amused, half guardedThat first night, we ended up in Revolution, a shots bar familiar to any British student. It was early on a Wednesday evening and I ordered a birthday cake shot – a drink I’d always had a borderline fascination with: why would anyone deliberately choose to associate childhood nostalgia with adult bad decisions? The bar was almost empty, and when we kissed, we felt suddenly, absurdly visible. So we pulled back the curtain on a photo booth whose backdrop announced: “V is for Vodka”.I’d loved photo booths as a young teenager at the height of the millennial revival of 90s technology. The booths were ever present, wedged into the corner of every barmitzvah and birthday party. But I hadn’t used one in years.The strip came out in four uneven frames, my expression caught somewhere between smug and lost, hers half-amused, half guarded. They’re still my favourite pictures of us, possibly because there aren’t many others to compete with. Neither of us are really photo people. There’s something contrived about posed pictures that makes us both uncomfortable – whereas photo booths are so contrived they somehow become acceptable.Two years on, I’m writing this from another departure lounge, heading to Portugal for our second anniversary. That photo booth strip, now living in a drawer with old cards and holiday trinkets, captured something I didn’t know I needed: proof that something great can start anywhere.Emma LoffhagenView image in fullscreenEmma Loffhagen (centre), and her university friends, in 2021.Photograph: Courtesy of Emma LoffhagenI have always been a sucker for photo booths – as soon as I walk into a pub or a club and spot one, I can instantly feel the money leaving my bank account. My bedroom walls and camera roll are littered with the evidence of years of cramming unwitting friends (and strangers) behind curtains.Of my cadre of photo booth memories, one stands out. It was August 2021, the first summer after the second Covid lockdown. I had just turned 22, and was moving out of my parents’ house into a new flat with three of my best friends from university. Life felt as though it had been on pause for a year, the promise of post-graduation freedom frozen in the stale air of cancelled plans and Zoom birthdays.Our move-in date happened to coincide with my flatmate’s birthday party, so we all rushed to pile our boxes into the flat before dashing out. It was frenetic, but things were happening in a way they hadn’t for so long – the sense of forward motion felt giddy.I remember the dizzy joy and the feeling that a new chapter had finally begunThe space was packed full of friends from university, people I hadn’t seen in one room together in more than a year. We hadn’t been able to have a proper graduation, our university experience cut short the previous year by the pandemic.My flatmates and I commandeered the photo booth, and took a series of increasingly chaotic group shots, the kind where no one quite manages to look at the camera at the same time. The memory of the photo booth itself is a bit of a blur, but what I do remember is the overwhelming, dizzy joy of it, and the feeling that a new chapter of our lives had finally begun.The next morning, we christened our then-bare fridge with one of the photostrips, a door that has since become crammed full of magnets and memories from four years of living together. When I look at those photos now I can see the pure relief on our faces, and a reminder of when the world cracked open again and we rushed headfirst into it.The Photographers’ Gallery in London is marking the centenary of the photo booth withStrike a Pose: 100 Years of the Photobooth, until 22 February 2026"

However, the development may be viewed by some as an attempt by the RSF to deflect attention from the El Fasher allegations.Hours before news emerged that the group had agreed to a ceasefire, satellite images appeared to show its recruits hiding bodies in mass graves.The ceasefire agreement is thought to have involved the RSF’s principal backer, the UAE, which has faced criticism for allegedly supplying weapons and mercenaries used in the capture of El Fasher.Map showing control of Sudan.The UAE denies the claims despite evidence being presented in UN reports and elsewhere.The RSF’s decision to accept the truce is unlikely to end its30-month waragainst Sudan’s army. Earlier this week, the military-aligned government indicated it would carry on fighting after an internal meeting on a US ceasefire proposal.The ceasefire announcement arrived amid more grim updates from Darfur, the vast region of west Sudan where El Fasher is located.A report from Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab, which is monitoring war crimes in El Fasher, said the RSF appeared to be conducting systematic body disposal, with mass graves being dug in trenches and pits.The extent of the massacre is not clear, although the activist groupAvaaz says its Sudan teambelieves “tens of thousands of civilians” have been slaughtered in the city.Prosecutors at the international criminal court said on Monday they werecollecting evidence of alleged mass killings, rapes and other crimes in El Fasher. Witnesses have reported RSF fighters going house to house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults. According to the World Health Organization, gunmen killed at least 460 people at a hospital and abducted doctors and nurses.Efforts are being made to bring the RSF and army together for talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at a permanent peace deal.Explore more on these topicsSudanAfricaWar crimesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of North Koreans are estimated to have died in the fighting.Ukraine faces ‘forever war’ unless Europe steps up pressure on Russia, says ex-Nato chiefRead moreUkraine has encouraged foreign nationals to enlist in its armed forces, with many volunteers fromEuropeand the US joining units such as the International Legion. More recently, Ukraine has recruited about 2,000 Colombian nationals as contract soldiers to help fill manpower gaps nearly four years into the war.Franz-Stefan Gady, a military analyst, said: “The role of foreign fighters on both the Ukrainian and Russian side has somewhat increased over the last two years.”For Ukraine, even an additional influx of foreign fighters would not be able to address its manpower shortage, Gady said, which “remains the biggest impediment in the Ukrainian war effort”.Jethro Norman, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, said the numbers of foreign fighters were “marginal on both sides”. “But symbolically, they punch far above their weight, especially in propaganda and recruitment narratives,” Norman said.“Early in the war, foreign volunteers carried significant propaganda value, signalling international solidarity with Ukraine. Numbers appear to have declined since, but the idea of foreign fighters continues to feature prominently in social media, recruitment videos and Russian disinformation.”Chinese social media is awashwith recruitment videos for the Russian army, with influencers touting the glamour, riches and masculine kudos that supposedly come with joining the war. Beijing says itdoes not supportits citizens getting involved in the conflict, but it allows the videos to circulate on China’s otherwise tightly controlled internet.Ukraine denies it recruits mercenaries but says it allows foreign volunteers to become part of its armed forces.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaUkraineRussiaEuropeAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The agency said South Sudanese nationals with status through the programme had 60 days to leave the US or face deportation.“Based on the department’s review, the secretary has determined the situation in South Sudan no longer meets the criteria for an ongoing armed conflict that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning South Sudanese nationals,” the notice says.Ina statement, USCIS said South Sudanese nationals who used the Customs and Border Protection mobile app to report their departure could receive “a complimentary plane ticket, a $1,000 exit bonus, and potential future opportunities for legal immigration”.Armed US immigration agents drive off with toddler after arrest of fatherRead moreTemporary protected status gives foreign nationals access to work permits and allows them to temporarily live and work legally in the US when their home countries are unsafe to return to.South Sudan’s designation, which was first authorised by the Barack Obama administration in 2011 because of armed conflict, expired on Monday after many extensions.The designation had so far been approved for about 232 people from the country.The termination is the latest effort by theTrump administrationto remove the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants living in the US.

In his 20s, under the stage name Young Cardamom, hemade musicwith Ugandan rapper HAB.London mayor sees parallels in Zohran Mamdani’s victory: ‘Hope won’Read moreMany in Uganda had not heard of Mamdani before the election win or that a Ugandan had become the youngest mayor of New York City in more than a century.But there was excitement and pride at Makerere University in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where Mamdani’s father taught until a few years ago.“Seeing Zohran up there, I feel like I can also make it,” psychology student Anthony Kirabo told Agence France-Presse.“It makes me feel good and proud of my country because it shows that Uganda can produce some good leaders,” said the 22-year-old, adding that he hoped it might encourage more tourists to come to the east African country.Mamdani’s win comes at a trying period for democracy in east Africa, where observers describe growing repression and violation of human rights in some countries.Uganda’s neighbour Tanzania is reeling from bloody election violence last week in which hundreds of people werereported to have been killedin demonstrations against what protesters said was the stifling of the opposition after the exclusion of key candidates from the presidential ballot.View image in fullscreenRadio host Siima Kyakuhaire Sabiti shows old pictures of her with Zohran Mamdani, New York’s mayor-elect, during his 2019 visit to her show in Kampala, Uganda, on 5 November 2025.Photograph: Hajarah Nalwadda/APSome hoped Mamdani’s victory would provide a lesson for Ugandan leaders as the country readies itself for a potentially fraught general election in January, with Yoweri Museveni, the president who has ruled the country for 39 years, seeking to extend his grip on power into a seventh term.Developments in the run-up, including the months-long detention of opposition politician Kizza Besigye, the passage of a bill to try civilians in military court andthe abduction of two Kenyan rights activists, have turned the spotlight on what critics deem intolerance and authoritarianism by Museveni’s administration.Joseph Sendagire, a 28-year-old procurement officer, told AFP he hoped Uganda would “borrow a leaf” from New York City’s mayoral election.“Uganda should embrace a culture of free and fair elections, allow candidates to compete for whatever post we want in a fair manner, treat them equally, and then at the end of the day, may the best candidate win,” he said.Robert Kabushenga, a retired media executive who is friendly with the Mamdani family, told the Associated Press that the win offers “a beacon of hope” for embattled activists and others in Uganda. The lesson is that “we should allow young people the opportunity to shape, and participate in, politics in a meaningful way,” he said.Bobi Wine, Museveni’s main challenger, sent “hearty congratulations” to Mamdani.“From Uganda, we celebrate and draw strength from your example as we work to build a country where every citizen can realize their grandest dreams regardless of means and background,” the 43-year-oldwrote on X.Joel Ssenyonyi, the leader of the opposition leader in the Ugandan parliament, told the AP he sees Mamdani’s victory as an inspiring political shift but somehow too distant for many Africans at home.“It’s a big encouragement even to us here in Uganda that it’s possible,” said Ssenyonyi. “But we have a long way to get there.”Agence France-Presse and theAssociated Press contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniUgandaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Sixty-nine birds have already died after the outbreak of a flu-like illness, but on Wednesday, Canada’s supreme court issued an interim stay on the cull order as it weighed whether to hear the case.Canada: order to cull over 400 ostriches sparks protests and death threatsRead moreThursday’s ruling removed any legal impediment to commencing the killings.Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, lobbied Canadian officials andMehmet Oz, a physician and former TV host appointed by Trump as the director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, offered to move the birds to his ranch in Florida. US billionaire John Catsimatidis has also pleaded with the Canadian government to reverse its cull order.The growing row over the ostriches – and a simmering post-pandemic skepticism of government – have inspired protesters to descend on the farm, with many broadcasting their frustration on social media. Under a live stream of the bird enclosure posted online by the farm, commenters frequently express skepticism towards vaccines and call for more proof that the birds are ill.The case has also penetrated Canada’s federal politics. In early October, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, was asked twice by reporters whether he supported protesters. The Tory leader has avoided making specific comments on the issue, despite many within his party protesting against the cull. He told reporters the issue had been “mismanaged from the very beginning” but didn’t say the word “ostrich”.The Canadian federal government said the food inspection agency was following a “stamping out” policy in order to limit the spread of avian flu, a move in line with broader advice from theWorld Health Organization.But animal advocacy groups have called on the agency to conduct further testing on the animals to confirm they are infected. The farm owners said that because the last bird flu death occurred on 15 January 2025, with the surviving majority appearing healthy or recovered, the flock has developed at least partial herd immunity against H5N1. They have also cast doubt on the scope and effectiveness of testing on the birds.On Thursday, Katie Pasitney, the farm’s spokesperson, told the media that the agency was “murdering” healthy birds.“They are prehistoric animals that have survived millions of years, but they won’t survive the Canadian Food Inspection Agency,” she said. Co-owner Dave Bilinski said he was “afraid there’s – in my opinion – there’s no justice left”.A federal court, however, found that allowing the birds to remain alive could lead to the spread of avian influenza to other animals, the poultry industry – or to humans.The agency has not said when it expects to begin culling the birds.A 2016 CFIA manual, obtained under freedom of information laws, says ostriches can be killed by various methods, the preferred being lethal injection, which requires three people: one to hold the bird by sitting on its back, one to hold the head, and one to inject the drug. Staff can also use gas or break the birds’ necks. Members of the agency can only shoot the birds “as a last resort”, if they have a “skilled marksman” on site.According to the Canadian Press, shortly after the court ruling, inspection agents workers began setting up more equipment and flood lighting around a large hay-bale enclosure near the back of the ostrich pen.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasAnimalsFarm animalsBirdsnewsShareReuse this content"

But after it mysteriously disappeared at the end of the second world war, historians and experts feared the diamond had been stolen, cut up or hidden away in South America.Buta report from the New York Timeshas revealed a different history: the prized jewel instead remained a closely held family secret, with few living heirs ever being told of the diamond’s location.After the first world war, the Austro-Hungarian emperor Charles I had prized jewels moved to Switzerland for safekeeping over fears of Bolshevik and anarchist uprisings. He and his family later fled to Switzerland in exile.View image in fullscreenA glass replica of the Florentine diamond.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesUprooted once again in 1940 as the Nazis moved swiftly across Europe, Charles’s wife, the Empress Zita, fled the continent with her eight children, arriving in the United States with the jewels in a cardboard suitcase. The family then travelled toCanadaand settled in the province of Quebec.“My grandmother felt very safe – she could breathe finally,” Karl von Habsburg-Lothringen, a grandson of Charles I, told the New York Times. “I assume that, at that stage, the little suitcase went into a bank safe, and that was it. And in that bank safe, it just stayed.”At the time, only two living people, her the empress’s sons Robert and Rodolphe, were told where the diamond had been hidden. Zita asked they keep the location – and the diamond’s existence – a secret for 100 years after Charles’s death in 1922. Before their deaths, the brothers passed the information to their own sons.“The less people know about it, the bigger the security,” said von Habsburg-Lothringen.Zita returned to Europe in 1953, leaving the jewels at the bank in Quebec. She died nearly four decades later, at 96.The storied history of the diamond – possibly owned by Charles the Bold, probably owned by Florence’s Medici family and most certainly the property of the Habsburg dynasty – in part fuelled competing explanations about its sudden disappearance. So too did its murky origins. Some speculated that its irregular octagonal outline with a cut that included 126 facets reflected how stones might once have been cut in India. Another theory is that the diamond was cut by a European – the famed Flemish jeweller Lodewyk van Bercken – into a pyramidal shape.The disappearance of the stone prompted speculation it was among the Austrian jewels stolen by Hitler when the Nazis annexed the country, or that American troops had located the diamond and returned it to Vienna. Another was that diamond was brought to South America, recut and then sold in the United States. Some posited that the Habsburgs, desperate for money as their empire crumbled, sold the diamond and other possessions.Briefly, the Shah of Persia, a 99-carat stone recut from larger diamond, was believed to part of the missing Florentine. Others suggested a recut diamond offered for sale in Geneva in 1981 could once again be the Florentine.But the stone unearthed in Canada is most certainly “the genuine, historical ‘Florentine Diamond’”, said Christoph Köchert of AE Köchert, once Austria’s imperial court jewellers.The family says it will display the diamond at a Canadian museum in the coming years, adding that it won’t be up for sale – and they won’t disclose how much it might be worth.Explore more on these topicsCanadaSecond world warEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

A blackout during the vote count was followed by results showing him as the winner. The country erupted in violent protests, and Morales resigned and fled to Mexico.Supporters of Bolivia’s first Indigenous president immediately branded Áñez’s assumption of power a coup – a perception reinforced when she postponed presidential elections initially scheduled for May, citing the Covid-19 pandemic.Her interim government was also marked by protests met with brutal repression by police and the army, with reports stating that Bolivia under Áñez persecuted opponents through“systematic torture” and “summary executions” of more than 20 protesters.She initially stood as a candidate in the 2020 election but, polling poorly, withdrew from the race, which was ultimately won by the current president, Arce.In June 2022, Áñez was sentenced to 10 years in prison for allegedly placing herself illegally in the constitutional line of succession. But on Thursday, the supreme court annulled the ruling, declaring that there had been no coup but rather “a constitutional necessity aimed at preserving the institutional continuity of the Bolivian state”.Explore more on these topicsBoliviaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Police this week reclassified her death as murder, after unspecified new evidence emerged.Malaysian media reported that Namewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, called emergency services after finding Hsieh unresponsive in a hotel room bath tub.Police said they found pills believed to be ecstasy, and Namewee was arrested that day. He was charged with illegal drug possession and released on bail. However, he was detained again on Wednesday in order to assist police with the murder investigation after Hsieh’s death was reclassified. Police did not detail the new evidence, and told local media that it would take three months to complete the toxicology and autopsy reports.Namewee’s lawyer Joshua Tay said his client would be held on remand for six days.In a statement posted online before his second arrest, Namewee denied any drug-taking, and said he was going to the police “to fully cooperate with the investigation to give the public and the deceased’s family an explanation”. He also denied any wrongdoing in relation to Hsieh’s death.In his post, Namewee also accused local media of sensationalism and “chasing shadows” and criticised emergency services, saying they took almost an hour to arrive at the hotel after he called them. He also claimed that unnamed people had attempted to blackmail him.Namewee is a well-known artist in Malaysia, Taiwan and China, having courted controversy on numerous occasions with his political work. He has been blacklisted in China over songs criticising the authoritarian government and nationalist attitudes. In 2023 he was also banned from performing in Hong Kong. Early in his career, when he was studying in Taiwan, Namewee caused a backlash over a song parodying the Malaysian national anthem, and has sincehad his work censoredover allegations he was criticising the Malaysian government, or Islam.Hsieh was reportedly in Malaysia to discuss a commercial video directed by Namewee. She has previously featured in a Namewee-directed music video, for his song China Reggaeton in 2020. She was previously a nurse, before becoming a popular online figure with more than 1.5 million followers across Instagram, X and OnlyFans.A statement on Hsieh’s OnlyFans account, purportedly written by her assistant with the consent of Hsieh’s family, asked for fans and media to give them privacy and to “refrain from excessive speculation or commenting on social media”.“I am deeply saddened by this heartbreaking news,” she wrote. “In my eyes, Yu-hsin is not only a creative girl who loves photography, but also my boss and best friend.”Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs (Mofa) said it had contacted Hsieh’s family to tell them about the development. “Out of the concern of privacy, Mofa chose not to issue any public statements in response to the issue,” it said.Additional research by Jason Tazu Kuan Lu and Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsMalaysiaTaiwanAsia PacificRapnewsShareReuse this content"

In October, after threats of legal action, the university lifted the ban and apologised, but the eight-month suspension has raised fresh concerns about the chilling effect that pressure from Chinese authorities can have on UK universities.Murphy told the Guardian: “I think that there are a lot of people who experience some version of this, typically more subtle, usually not so black and white. But it’s too risky to speak out against their university. They’re worried they might suffer consequences.”Andreas Fulda, a political scientist and China scholar based at the University of Nottingham, is among those to have been targeted as a result of his critical scholarship and media commentary. At one point, “spoof” emails bearing his name were sent to his colleagues announcing his resignation and inviting them to his farewell drinks.He does not know who sent the emails. There have also been death threats to him and his family. “What I’ve come to learn is that once you reach a certain perception threshold in the eyes of the Chinese security agencies, you are punished to dissuade you from airing your views,” he said.Counter-terror police investigate claim UK university halted research after Chinese pressureRead moreFulda said he hoped the Sheffield Hallam case would be a turning point, highlighting the risks of the current UK higher education funding model, in which universities are heavily reliant on the high tuition fees paid by international students, of which the largest group is from China.Recent government promises to increase domestic tuition fees in line with inflation were welcomed by the sector, although plans for a 6% international student levy to fund the reintroduction of maintenance grants risks wiping out much of the benefit.Fulda said: “What can be seen quite clearly is that the Chinese party state has considerable leverage and British universities have considerable vulnerabilities. I am afraid that we will experience many more Sheffield Hallam incidents in the future if universities do not stop cosying up to China.”Jo Smith Finley, a reader in Chinese studies at Newcastle University, was sanctioned by China in 2021 for her work on human rights abuses against the Uyghurs. She said: “Ever since then, Newcastle University has been walking a very difficult tightrope in its treatment of me, because I’ve become a liability in a context where universities are all dependent on Chinese student tuition fees.“It’s extremely heavy, the pressure that the Chinese authorities bring to bear, both on university representatives working in the PRC [People’s Republic of China] on recruitment and also on university managers in the UK.”Other academics in the field were reluctant to comment publicly. Against a backdrop of mass redundancies across the sector, one academic said: “I’m scared I will lose my job if I talk about my experiences of working on China in British universities.”Universities UK, which represents the sector, said: “UK universities are committed to upholding free speech and academic freedom. They work hard to protect these fundamental freedoms and meet significant legal duties in this area set out by the Office for Students. This commitment extends to international research and partnerships with institutions around the world.“UK universities take any threats to the freedom of their staff or students extremely seriously and we work closely with the government to prevent this. Anyone working or studying at our universities should know that their rights to personal and academic freedom are protected when they are on British soil.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesUniversity fundingResearchHigher educationSheffield Hallam UniversityChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The tropical cyclone blew out of the archipelago on Wednesday into the South China Sea.The typhoon’s onslaught affected nearly 2 million people and displaced more than 560,000 villagers, including nearly 450,000 who were evacuated to emergency shelters, the office of civil defence said.Marcos’s “state of national calamity” declaration, made during a meeting with disaster-response officials to assess the typhoon’s aftermath on Thursday, would allow the government to disburse emergency funds faster and prevent food hoarding and overpricing.While still dealing with the deadly and disastrous impact of Kalmaegi in the country’s central region, disaster-response officials warned that another tropical cyclone from the Pacific could strengthen into a super typhoon and batter the northernPhilippinesearly next week.Among the dead attributed by officials to Kalmaegi were six people who were killed when a Philippine air force helicopter crashed in the southern province of Agusan del Sur on Tuesday. The crew was on its way to provide humanitarian help to provinces battered by the typhoon, the military said. It did not give the cause of the crash.Kalmaegi set off flash floods and caused a river and other waterways to swell in Cebu province. The resulting flooding engulfed residential communities, forcing residents to climb on their roofs, where they desperately pleaded to be rescued as the flood waters rose, provincial officials said.At least 71 people died in Cebu, mostly due to drownings, while 65 others were reported missing and 69 injured, the office of civil defence said.It added that 62 others were reported missing in the central province of Negros Occidental, which is located near Cebu.“We did everything we can for the typhoon but, you know, there are really some unexpected things like flash floods,” Cebu’s governor, Pamela Baricuatro, said by phone.‘She died because of the flood’: Filipinos rise up as outrage over corruption scandal growsRead moreThe problems may have been made worse by years of quarrying that caused clogging of nearby rivers, which overflowed, and substandard flood control projects in Cebu province, Baricuatro said.A corruption scandal involving substandard or non-existent flood control projects across the Philippines has sparkedpublic outrage and street protestsin recent months.Cebu was still recovering from a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on 30 September that left at least 79 people dead and displaced thousands when houses collapsed or were severely damaged.Ferries and fishing boats were prohibited from venturing out to increasingly rough seas during the typhoon, stranding more than 3,500 passengers and cargo truck drivers in nearly 100 seaports, the coast guard said. At least 186 domestic flights were canceled.The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. The country also is often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesExtreme weatherAsia PacificFerdinand Marcos JrnewsShareReuse this content"

The staff and I are devastated,” said Janette Vallance, the sanctuary’s operator.“While it could potentially continue as a lion park under new ownership, such a future would require not only the purchase of the land but significant capital investment,” Vallance said.In an update on Thursday, the sanctuary confirmed two of its lions had been euthanised.“Yesterday we said goodbye to Imvula and Sibili, both of whom had serious health conditions that were not treatable and were deteriorating. These decisions were made with deep care and consideration,” Vallance said.But there was a “glimmer of hope” for remaining five lions, which the sanctuary had earlier said would be put down.“A few individuals have expressed interest in purchasing the facility and continuing to care for the lions. While the timeframe is short and the situation remains uncertain, we are doing everything we can to explore this possibility and keep hope alive.”Relocating the lions to another facility was not a “viable or humane option” she said, due to their age, the number of cats involved and their complex needs.The sanctuary’s updates were flooded with messages from members of the public, pleading for a reprieve for the remaining lions, while former staff members told broadcaster RNZ they hoped the sanctuary would reconsider putting them down.Vallance said amid the kind messages and words of condolence, she had also received threatening and abusive comments.“This is deeply distressing,” she said. “We understand that emotions are high, but we ask for kindness and respect as we navigate this heartbreaking situation.”Bolton Equities declined to comment.The ministry for primary industries (MPI) said the decision to euthanise the cats lay with the owners, and that it had been informed of the plan.The deputy director general of Biosecurity New Zealand, Stuart Anderson, told the Guardian that euthanasia had to be carried out humanely, and in line with animal welfare law.“MPI will have an animal welfare inspector onsite to verify this is done appropriately,” Anderson said. “We are satisfied that the operation continues to meet its animal welfare and containment obligations.”The sanctuary drew minor fame in the early 2000s when it featured on a television show about celebrity big cat handler Craig “the Lion Man” Busch.But it soon ran into problems. In 2009, a handler was mauled to death by a white tiger while cleaning its enclosure.The park frequently ran into financial trouble and employment issues, and changed ownership multiple times. In 2014 the ministry of primary industries ordered the park to close until the enclosures were upgraded. It reopened in 2021 but went into liquidation in 2023.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandAnimalsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It followed a furore over a luxury block on the city’s swanky Upper West Side that had a separate entrance for social housing.Luxury apartment development in Kings Cross pits Paul Keating against Morris IemmaRead moreLendlease, which developed Barangaroo South, said it had included the affordable units in the rear tower at 55 Hickson Road as part of its project development agreement for Barangaroo, signed with the NSW government in 2010.The agreement required that 2.3% of the residential gross floor area at Barangaroo South would be delivered as key worker housing on site, amounting to about 50 apartments.This was before the NSW government’s more recent housing SEPP bonus, which gives developers up to 30% additional height and floorspace if they designate 10% to 15% of the units in a development as affordable housing. The units must remain as “affordable” – that is, 20% below the market rent – for 15 years.“Sydney needs more diverse and affordable homes close to where people work to support our city’s future growth and productivity,” Tom Mackellar, the chief executive of development at Lendlease, said.“Almost 25% of the apartments at Watermans Residences in Barangaroo South are for key workers, including locals working in education and medical frontline roles.View image in fullscreenAffordable housing residents that Guardian Australia talked to were mostly grateful to be living in a brand-new apartment in the city.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian“All the apartments are fully occupied, showing demand is strong among those seeking secure, well-located and high-quality housing close to their workplaces.”Sources said the pool restrictions led to issues for families with children, although the residents the Guardian spoke with were mainly just grateful to be living in a brand-new apartment in the city.Janson from Indonesia, who is studying and working part-time as a cook, said it was the nicest unit he had found in the two years he had been in Sydney. He lives there with two other friends.“I don’t care that much about the pool,” he said.One young woman, an HR worker in the city who moved in three weeks ago, said her apartment was nice. But she lamented the lack of basic facilities, including supermarkets, in the area. “It’s really an area for tourists,” she said.Lachie, 22, who lives in an affordable apartment with his girlfriend, said: “Yeah, we can’t get to the pool.” He said his girlfriend’s work with NSW Health got them discounted gym memberships at a nearby private gym, so the lack of access at Watermans was not an issue.The key worker units are owned and managed by St George CommunityHousingand must remain below market rent for 20 years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was not a government-owned or managed building.“With that said, I believe mixed-tenure developments shouldn’t make any resident feel like a second-class citizen,” Jackson said.“Broadly speaking, our vision for mixed-tenure housing does not support different treatment for different types of residents. People shouldn’t feel stigmatised or excluded when living in mixed-tenure communities.”Leong said successive governments had “outsourced the responsibility of housing delivery” to developers, giving them “more control over affordable housing”.Beachside apartments deemed ‘affordable’ cost $1,000 a week. Is the NSW policy helping renters or developers?Read moreShe said she was concerned the circumstances would breed “contempt toward affordable housing tenants”, allowing developers to “squeeze out maximum profits with minimum regard for the social impact of their actions”.“Inclusionary zoning to deliver affordable housing is supposed to be a way to address inequity in our communities – ensuring everyone has access to housing in our city. It should not be a weapon for reinforcing socioeconomic hierarchies,” Leong said.While the NSW government’s affordable housing policy requires owners of the affordable housing component to rent the units at least 20% below market rents, there are also income thresholds that tenants must not exceed.With Sydney’s rents rising rapidly, it is difficult for anyone at the income threshold to pay the discounted rent for inner-city locations.There was also the problem of how long a young person could stay in the key worker or affordable housing. One young teacher who the Guardian spoke to outside Watermans Residences said she would probably be ineligible for her unit if she got a pay rise next year; she had started living there in March.“They should adjust the income requirements as they are too low,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRentingHousingNew South Wales politicsSydneynewsShareReuse this content"

Probably not.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“If they start rolling out features that look more like they’re becoming a social media company than an online gaming company, then we will seek to capture them.”Theregime rulescreated by the government stipulate that services that have the primary purpose of enabling users to play online games with others are not age‑restricted social media platforms.My chilling week on Roblox: sexually assaulted and shat on as a child avatar roaming the online worldRead moreBut some critics suggested this is too limited for platforms that merge gameplay and social interaction. Niusha Shafiabady, an associate professor of information technology at Australian Catholic University, believes Roblox should be included in the ban.She pointed to the way the platform allows players to create content and interact. “It’s exactly like a contained social media platform,” she said.The independent MP Nicolette Boele urged the government to reconsider. “If the government’s plan bans some apps but leaves platforms like Roblox – described as a ‘paedophile hellscape’ – untouched, then we’re not protecting kids, we’re driving them into more dangerous, less regulated spaces,” she said.A spokesperson for the communications minister, Anika Wells, said the decision not to include Roblox under the teen social media ban did not mean it was exempt from its responsibilities under the Online Safety Act.A spokesperson for eSafety said it “has been able to extract important safety commitments from Roblox that will protect children from a range of harms including online grooming and sexual coercion”.By the end of the year, eSafety said Robloxwill be rolling outage-assurance technologies, not allowing adults to contact children without specific parental consent and making accounts private by default for those under 16.“After a child aged under 16 has gone through age estimation and has chat enabled, they will be unable to chat with adults,” the spokesperson said. “Parental controls will also be introduced to allow parents to disable chat for 13- to 15-year-old users, on top of existing protections for under 13s.”The agency has enforcement powers if companies such as Roblox do not comply with codes and standards for child safety, including penalties of up to $49.5m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s the word,” Verbeekwrote in his newsletter, The Planet.“Here, taking care of one another through public programs isn’t radical socialism. It’s Tuesday.”That view hit on the wide differences in how Mamdani’s promises are seen by many across the Atlantic. “Europeans recognize his vision about free public transit and universal childcare. We expect our governments to make these kinds of services accessible to all of us,” said Verbeek. “We pay higher taxes and get civilized societies in return. The debate here isn’t whether to have these programs, but how to improve them.”More than a decade ago, Tallinn, the Estonian capital, became the largest city in the world tointroduce fare-free public transport. Financed by the city’s resident tax, the scheme faced heavy opposition before its rollout, with some describing it as a political stunt that the city couldn’t afford.Nearly a year later, researchersfoundthat public transport use had increased by 14% and that the mobility of low-income residents had improved. Similar schemes have since sprung up across the continent, in France’sMontpellierandDunkirk, for example, and expanded across countries in the case ofLuxembourgandMalta.When Mamdani promised to launch one city-owned grocery story in each of New York’s five boroughs, with a view to expanding if the pilot was successful, it reminded Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, of the city-run grocery store she had visited in Istanbul in 2014.Back then, she had been surprised to see the heaving shelves, laden with products that ranged from bread to lentils to basic household appliances, much of it provided by small, little-known manufacturers. Access to these stores was limited to low-income households, with families receiving a preloaded monthly loyalty card to use at these shops, she said. “These city-run grocery stores in Istanbul were successful and replicated by other cities.”More than a decade on, the experience convinced her of the viability of Mamdani’s promise. “I was struck by the fact that New York elite and Republicans wanted to paint these proposals as sort of coming from the moon,” she said. “Things like non-profit stores or free buses, these are not outrageous ideas, nor are they socialist. They’ve been tried in different parts of the world.”For New Yorkers, precedents for city-run grocery stores can also be found closer to home. Chicago ismullingsimilar plans, whileAtlantaandSt Paul, Kansashave launched their own takes on municipal-run grocery stores.Mamdani’s campaign also promised to make childcare free for all children in the city, ages six weeks to five years. Days before the election, the state of New Mexico provided the city with a precedent-setting example,becoming the first US stateto offer free childcare to all of its residents, in an effort to boost its economy and raise education and child welfare levels.Across the Atlantic, Portugal’s government began introducing free childcare in 2022,starting withchildren ages one and under with promises to gradually expand the program to children up to the age of three. While the program is open to all, places are limited and can be tough to access, with priority given to low-income and single-parent families.In Berlin, childcarehas been free for childrenfrom their first birthday until they start school since 2018, though centres are allowed to levy additional charges for provisions such as lunches and extracurricular activities. Across the Nordic countries, free childcare is not universal, but is heavily subsidised by the state for most families.Mamdani’s platform also included a promise to provide new parents with a free baby basket that includes items such as diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, swaddles and books. In Finland,the baby boxhas been a universal benefit since 1949 and has sincebeen emulatedby nearly 100 programs in 60 countries around the world.How Mamdani built an ‘unstoppable force’ that won over New YorkRead moreThe sharp contrast in how Mamdani’s policies were seen within the US and abroad probably has much to do with the scant existence of a welfare state in the US, writer Mary Holland noted this week. “To anyone living in a western European state, the self-professed democratic socialist’s ideas probably sound entirely reasonable,” she wrotein Monocle.“But to many Americans, they’re wildly ambitious – radical, even.”Perhaps the most widely panned of Mamdani’s ideas is his vow to freeze rent for nearly 1 million rent-stabilised tenants in the city. The former US treasury secretary Larry Summers was among those who slammed the idea, writing on social media that rent control was the “second-best way to destroy a city, after bombing”.In 2020, Berlin passed a law that resulted in a five-year rent freeze, at June 2019 levels, for 90% of the flats in the city. While the law offered relief to about 1.5 million households who had seen rents rise by an estimated third in the six years prior, itwas ruled as unconstitutionalin 2021 after Germany’s highest court sided with landlords and property investment lobbyists who had argued it was inappropriate and illegal for the state to meddle with the private market.A 2022 paper, however, marked out an interesting impact of the short-lived measure,in that it foundthat while rent control was in place, residents were seemingly more receptive to new housing developments in their area. The finding suggests that if Mamdani is able to carry out the rent freezes as promised, it could help to pave the way forhis promiseto also triple the city’s production of affordable homes.Perhaps the strongest precedent, however, for rent freezes comes from New York’s own recent history. In the past 10 years, during Bill de Blasio’s tenure as mayor, members of the city’s rent guidelines board voted to freeze the rent four times, one former member of the New York City rent guidelines board, Leah Goodridge,noted recentlyin the Guardian. “This is why criticisms of Mamdani’s rent freeze ring hollow for me – it’s painted as out of touch, yet there’s already a precedent, backed by government reports and data.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkEuropeSocialismUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

None of the jewels have been recovered.The report, covering the museum’s management between 2018 and 2024, concludes that decision-making had been “at the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical facilities, particularly those related to safety and security”.How the Louvre museum robbery happened in video, photographs and mapsRead moreIt also highlights a persistent delay in the deployment of security equipment for the protection of the artworks, saying the Louvre – which had more than 8.7 million visitors last year – had not addressed this failing during the period under review.A security audit a decade ago, which found the museum was not sufficiently monitored or prepared for a crisis, only led to a tender for security work last year, the report says, and recommended upgrades would take a further eight years to complete.It says only 39% of the rooms in the museum had been fitted with CCTV cameras as of 2024. “It will take several years to complete the project, which, according to the museum, is not expected to be finished until 2032,” the report adds.View image in fullscreenJewels stolen from the Louvre.Composite: Louvre/AlamyExcessive spending on artworks, only a quarter of which were on public display, wider management inefficiencies and ticket fraud had contributed to the museum’s inability to act on improving its security, it adds.The report sets out 10 recommendations for management, including reducing the number of acquisitions and raising ticket prices.The Louvre’s management said on Thursday it accepted “most” of the audit body’s recommendations.An administrative inquiry into the theft that was completed last week reached similar conclusions, highlighting a “chronic, structural underestimation of the risk of intrusion and theft” and “an inadequate level of security measures”.Aftercomplaints about the museum’s dysfunction, the Louvrelaunched an ambitious long-term development projectin January, involving a new space dedicated to the Mona Lisa and new security measures.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said the “coalition of the willing” hoping to assemble such a force for when fighting ends had been reduced to a coalition of the waiting.View image in fullscreenAnders Fogh Rasmussen said changes in strategy were needed as Putin had no incentive to engage in peace negotiations.Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPA“If we do not carry out major changes in strategy we will look into a forever war,” he said. “Putin has no incentive to engage in peace negotiations so long as he thinks he can win on the battlefield. Changes in speed and mindset are needed.”Rasmussen, who has forged close links with the Ukrainian leadership, is touring European capitals, including London to meet the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell. The two men discussed whether the US could provide security guarantees to Ukraine, using language similar to that recently used by the US when it provided security guarantees to Qatar afterIsrael attackedits capital, Doha.Iron-clad security guarantees would make it easier for Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, to sell a peace deal to his own people that involved the loss of Ukrainian territory, Rasmussen said.He said it was necessary to make dramatic adjustments to force a change in Vladimir Putin’s mindset. Apart from the development of a Ukrainian missile and drone shield based in Europe, and the deployment of some European troops into Ukraine, he urged Ukraine to be given long-range missiles to hit more targets inside Russia.He said it was still possible toreopendiscussions on the supply of US Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, which Donald Trump has not backed, if Germany was willing to be “the first mover” and provide Ukraine with its own Taurus cruise missiles.He said: “That would send a clear signal across the Atlantic and put pressure on the White House. It is a strong German interest to force Putin to engage in peace negotiations … Taurus is the means to do so.”Trump’s approach to Ukraine is in limbo after the US president appeared to step back from supplying Tomahawk missiles and announced instead a second summit with Putin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plan rests on the assumption that neither Ukraine nor the EU would need to repay the loan but could instead draw on a proposed Russian payment of war reparations to Ukraine.Belgium, however, is saying there is no guarantee reparations will be paid as a part of a ceasefire and it may require all EU states to provide guarantees to Belgium about the loan’s repayment.Explore more on these topicsUkraineNatoRussiaEuropeEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked in which of these seven settings they had personally been naked as an adult, more than half answered at least one, at least once. That compared with 45% of Germans and 44% of Spaniards.There was a marked divide between these three countries and the rest, with just 31% of French people, 25% of Britons and 22% of Italians confessing to having bared all in one or other public place at some point in their adult lives.Danes were the most likely to have been naked in their own garden or been skinny dipping, at 36-37%, compared with only 27-29% of Spaniards, 20-29% of Germans, 19% of French people, 13-14% of Britons and 11-12% of Italians.Germans, however, were the champions when it came to being naked in places designed for the purpose, reflecting a “free-body culture” –Freikörperkulturor FKK – dating back to the late 19th century.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

InDenmarkyounger generations were more open to naturism, but in Germany it was the reverse: 31% of 18- to 34-year-olds said they would be willing to be naked in public, compared with 46-48% of over-50s.Explore more on these topicsNaturismDenmarkFranceGermanyItalySpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

No deaths had been reported at the time of publishing.The attacks came despite a ceasefire deal signed between Hezbollah and Israel nearly a year ago that ended 13 months of fighting.Under the terms of the deal, Hezbollah is to disarm, both parties are meant to stop firing on each other and Israel is meant to withdraw from Lebanese territory. Israel still holds five positions inLebanon.Before the airstrikes, an Israeli military spokesperson published maps of buildings it was going to target, telling residents to move at least 500 metres away from them. The spokesperson claimed the buildings were part of Hezbollah’s military infrastructure.The Israeli military bombs Lebanon on a near-daily basis, but Thursday’s strikes were unusual in their intensity and for being preceded by an evacuation warning.They came hours after Hezbollah had sent an open letter to Lebanon’s leadership saying that while it was committed to the ceasefire, it still had a “legitimate right” to resist what it called the “Israeli occupation”. The group has fired at Israel once since the signing of the ceasefire in December 2024.Hezbollah said it stood behind the Lebanese army, but it condemned direct negotiations with Israel, a prospect recently floated by Lebanon’s president, Joseph Aoun.Israeli officials have accused Hezbollah in recent days of attempting to rebuild its military capabilities in Lebanon after the group was devastated by the war with Israel.“Israel will continue to defend all of its borders, and we continue also to insist on the full enforcement of the ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel,” the government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters on Thursday.Israel would not allow Hezbollah to recover its military capabilities.Lebanon’s government has committed to disarming Hezbollah and ensuring the monopoly of weapons lies with the state. It said it had disarmed about 85% of Hezbollah’s weapons caches in southern Lebanon and was aiming to completely disarm the area by the end of the year.Israel has pressed the Lebanese government to move more quickly on disarmament, but it has said that to do so would risk inflaming internal civil strife.Explore more on these topicsLebanonIsraelHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It describes itself as a “strategic advisory firm” that advises chief executives and political leaders to manage “high-stakes issues”.Working with at least one other firm, Highgate sought to establish connections between the woman andIsrael. However, documents seen by the Guardian suggest no such evidence was found.People familiar with activities of the private intelligence firms said its operation was commissioned by a high-level diplomatic unit within the Qatari state.Khan’s alleged victim told the Guardian she was appalled by the “disturbing” operation. “The idea that private intelligence firms have been instructed to target me is as incomprehensible as it is heartbreaking.”In a statement to the Guardian, Highgate confirmed it had worked on an operation related to the ICC but said it had not “acted against any individual”. It denied the project was paid or commissioned by the “government of Qatar”.Details about a Qatari unit’s apparent involvement in the spy operation – which also appears to have targeted other ICC officials – is the latest twist in the saga relating to the prosecutor that has thrown the court into an unprecedented crisis.Khan’s decision to seek warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged crimes in Gaza has made him and the court a target for the US and Israel.The abuse allegations have further complicated his tenure as prosecutor. He hasstepped aside pending a UN inquiryinto his conduct.The Guardian has seen no evidence that Khan had any personal involvement in the operation. However, people familiar with the operation said Highgate met Khan’s representatives, raising questions about the purpose of the meeting.Year of turmoilKhan’s term as ICC prosecutor was thrown into turmoil late last year when the abuse allegations made by the court stafferbecame public. The woman, a lawyer in her 30s, worked directly for him.Her claims include allegations of coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. The alleged sexual misconduct is said to have occurred in hotel rooms during work trips, in Khan’s office at the ICC, and at his home.A UN watchdog is investigating her claims. In August,the Guardian reportedthat a second woman had come forward to the inquiry with allegations that Khan mistreated her while working for him as an unpaid intern earlier in his career.Khan’s lawyers have repeatedly said he “categorically denies” having mistreated any individual and claimed the prosecutor “has been the subject of an orchestrated campaign” to discredit him.While the Guardian understands there have been attempts by pro-Israeli actors to leak information about the ICC staffer’s complaint, it has found no evidence to suggest the women have raised the allegations as part of a plot against the prosecutor.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The funding was regarded as highly sensitive. Executives involved in the project were careful to refer to its client as the “client country” or “Q country”.A document seen by the Guardian suggests that at one stage during the operation Highgate sought information that would link the alleged victim and her family members with Israel or its intelligence agencies.Highgate engaged a specialist firm, Elicius Intelligence, to assist with its information gathering about the woman, her child, her husband and his parents. Highgate also asked the company to investigate other ICC officials who had been involved in the court’s response to the allegations.Documents suggest that Elicius produced several reports for Highgate that included “sensitive” information about their private lives, former relationships, and financial situations. At one point, according to the files, Highgate asked for the birth certificate of the woman’s young child to be obtained.Highgate also obtained the woman’s passport details and sought detailed information about flights she had taken in recent years. The reports contain passwords used by the woman for online accounts, including a private email address, that appear to have come from hacked data available on the dark web.In its statement, Highgate said the claim it sought information about the woman’s child was “inaccurate” and suggested descriptions of other types of information obtained by the private firms were incorrect.“Highgate led an independent assessment into potential covert or improper activities that may have sought to undermine the credibility, independence, or efficiency of the ICC,” it said. “The review has considered several incidents involving multiple individuals over an extended period.”Highgate did not deny meeting Khan’s representatives, describing such information as “private, commercially sensitive and confidential”.In a statement to the Guardian, Khan’s lawyers did not dispute such a meeting took place.However, they said his representatives had “no knowledge of, let alone involvement in, the alleged activities” of the private intelligence firms. Khan’s lawyers added that he had not been provided with any “information” about its activities.Elicius Intelligence declined to comment. The government of Qatar did not respond to a request for comment.Khan’s alleged victim, who has been waiting for almost a year for the UN inquiry to reach its conclusions, and has found herself at the centre of a major geopolitical fallout at the ICC, expressed frustration at the situation.“Where does this end and how much will be allowed? If this is what international justice looks like, it is not the system that I have dedicated my life to serving.” She added: “I have always done my work quietly and under the radar. I came to serve, not to be seen.”Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceQatarIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

As they made their way to the stadium, officers directed them to hold their protest in a caged basketball court.More than 700 police officers were in attendance, along with police dogs, police horses and a drone unit. A section 60 was also in place in parts of Birmingham, allowing officers to stop and search without the need to have reasonable grounds.West Midlands police said three people were arrested for racially aggravated offences and one for a breach of the peace. A man, 21, was also arrested for failing to comply with an order to remove a face mask and a boy, 17, for failing to comply with a dispersal order.The pro-Palestine protest outside Villa Park drew large numbers, with speakers including local independent MP Ayoub Khan, who told demonstrators “we will continue in our plight and in our fight to support the Palestinians who are being massacred”.Signs were also put up around the stadium which read: “No war games allowed. Zionists not welcome.” In videos posted online, protesters are heard chanting: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Death to the IDF”.The Guardian also overheard an officer discussing the presence of members of the far-right and saw people swearing and gesturing at pro-Palestine demonstrators.1:06Protests outside Villa Park before match against Maccabi Tel-Aviv – videoUsman Rafiq, a 43-year-old GP and his wife, Uma Hani, a 40-year-old dentist, attended the protest with their three children. Hani said this was to “show solidarity to people in Palestine” and that Maccabi “should not have been playing in our city”.“A lot of people say that sport shouldn’t be part of politics but it is inherently part of politics,” Rafiq added.View image in fullscreenUsman Rafiq with his wife, Uma, and children outside Villa Park before the match.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianAsked about criticism that Maccabi had been unfairly treated, Rafiq said: “It’s the kind of hooliganism that they’re displaying, the Islamophobic hooliganism, tearing down Palestinian flags” before referring to incidents in Amsterdam.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Keir Starmer said the decision was wrong and opposition leader Kemi Badenoch branded it a “national disgrace”.The tension before the match led some schools to close early, Birmingham city council confirmed, with council staff working or travelling near the stadium asked to explore alternative arrangements.Policealso urged people to avoid the area where possible.Counter-demonstrator Jill Chant, 76, said she was shocked by the ban and came to the stadium to “protest against the antisemitism and the banning of Israelis from coming to Birmingham”. Her husband, Steven Chant, 79, wore a Maccabi shirt and said he believed the ban was “nothing to do with football, it’s all to do with sectarian politics – to be precise antisemitism”.Eran Hendler, 57, a hotelier from Tel Aviv and a Maccabi fan, described the ban on fans as “very strange” and said that decisions should be made for the majority, not an “extreme” minority.Hendler, who said he had felt safe in Birmingham, said: “Even to go to local competitions in Israel, in England, you can see that there are some extreme people who are not coming to watch the game, they are coming to make a mess. But in general, most of the people … want to come to the game.”Explore more on these topicsAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivEuropa LeaguePolicenewsShareReuse this content"

She seized it with style and gleeRead moreShe died peacefully, surrounded by her family, in her care home in Highgate, north London, having had Parkinson’s disease for several years, they said.Collins starred in the first series of the BBC sitcom The Liver Birds but did not become a household name until landing a regular role in Upstairs, Downstairs in 1971. She married her fellow actor John Alderton in 1969. Her role in the 1989 film Shirley Valentine earned her an Oscar nomination and a Bafta for best actress.Her family said on Thursday: “Pauline was so many things to so many people, playing a variety of roles in her life. A bright, sparky, witty presence on stage and screen. Her illustrious career saw her play politicians, mothers and queens.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with Maggie Smith in the 2012 film Quartet.Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock“She will always be remembered as the iconic, strong-willed, vivacious and wise Shirley Valentine – a role that she made all her own. We were familiar with all those parts of her because her magic was contained in each one of them.“More than anything, though, she was our loving mum, our wonderful grandma and great-grandma. Warm, funny, generous, thoughtful, wise, she was always there for us. And she was John’s [Alderton’s] lifelong love. A partner, work collaborator and wife of 56 years.“We particularly want to thank her carers: angels who looked after her with dignity, compassion and, most of all, love. She could not have had a more peaceful goodbye. We hope you will remember her at the height of her powers; so joyful and full of energy; and give us the space and privacy to contemplate a life without her.”Collins had taken the role of Shirley Valentine in the stage version in London’s West End and New York’s Broadway before appearing in the film adaptation alongside Tom Conti.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with her husband, John Alderton, in 1973 in an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockBorn in Exmouth, Devon, in 1940, Collins was raised near Liverpool and started out as a teacher. She switched to acting and after appearing as Samantha Briggs in Doctor Who in 1967 she was offered another 39 episodes but turned them down.In a2012 interview with the Guardian, Collins said the opportunity felt “like a prison sentence”. “Maybe it would have given me a profile early in my career but then I would have missed so many things,” she said.Her TV credits also include the UK’s first medical soap, Emergency Ward 10. There followed one series of No, Honestly, in which she and Alderton played a married couple.In 2005, Collins starred as Miss Flite in the BBC’s adaptation of Bleak House. In 2013 she appeared in Quartet, Dustin Hoffman’s directing debut, playing a former opera singer diagnosed with dementia.On being offered the role, Collins told the Guardian at the time: “Surprises. That’s what I love about this business. Even at my age you can get surprises. I thought he [Hoffman] doesn’t even know me.”Collins’s film credits include City of Joy alongside Patrick Swayze, Paradise Road and Mrs Caldicot’s Cabbage War, in which she appeared alongside her husband.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with Patrick Swayze in the 1992 film City of Joy.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockAlderton said: “Pauline Collins was a remarkable star. I had the great good fortune to have worked with her more than any other actor in our many TV series, films and West End stage shows together and watched her genius at close quarters.“What I saw was not only her brilliant range of diverse characters but her magic of bringing out the best in all of the people she worked with. She wanted everyone to be special and she did this by never saying ‘look at me’. It’s no wonder that she was voted the nation’s sweetheart in the 1970s.“She will always be remembered for Shirley Valentine, not only for her Oscar nomination or the film itself, but for clean-sweeping all seven awards when she portrayed her on Broadway in the stage play, in which she played every character herself. But her greatest performance was as my wife and mother to our beautiful children.”Dame Joanna Lumley, who acted alongside Collins in Shirley Valentine, also paid tribute to the “unforgettable” actor.She said: “We only shared one afternoon, filming a scene for Shirley Valentine, but in that short time I could see at once why she became a blazing star.“The blend of truthfulness and soulful naivety with impeccable comic timing and mischief made her unforgettable.”Russell T Davies, who worked with the actor on the 2006 Doctor Who episode Tooth and Claw, wrote on Instagram: “It was such an honour to have her on set, I was in awe … Oh she was salty and wonderful, and the finest of actors.“As for Shirley Valentine, as writer Matthew Todd says today: ‘Says more about UK life at that time than any history book ever could.’ A true star. And she’d laugh at that.”The actor James Dreyfus wrote on X: “Had the enormous pleasure to briefly, but memorably, share the screen with this remarkable actress. RIP Pauline Collins.”The author Morris Bright wrote on X: “I’ve led a little life & even that will be over pretty soon. I’ve allowed myself to lead this little life when inside me there was much more. She couldn’t have given us more. Shirley Valentine star Pauline Collins has died at 85.

Her apology comes a week after the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, madeher own written apologyto the prime minister for failing to obtain a licence before renting out her family home.In a letter to Nandy, Starmer said he accepted the apology, but noted that the process to appoint the media executive David Kogan “was not entirely up to the standard expected” and said her department could learn lessons from it.The reprimand does not affect the role of Kogan, whose long career in sport and media has included negotiating TV rights deals for the Premier League and the English Football League.He was confirmed last month as the head of the Independent Football Regulator (IFR), a fan-friendly watchdog proposed by the Conservative government after plans for thebriefly mooted European Super Leaguecollapsed, and brought into existence under Labour.After the conflict of interest emerged, Nandystood asidefrom any role in deciding whether Kogan would be given the role.It is nonetheless another embarrassment for Starmer’s government, particularly so soon after it emerged that Reeves had not obtained the council licence needed to let her family home after she moved into Downing Street following the election.In his 18-page report, Shawcross said Nandy or her department had breached the governance code on public appointments in three ways: Nandy by not immediately declaring that Kogan had donated twice to her unsuccessful 2020 campaign to succeed Jeremy Corbyn asLabourleader; and the culture department by not discussing this when she interviewed him for the role and not declaring Kogan’s larger donations to Labour, including to Starmer’s leadership campaign.Nandy said she did not know at the time that Kogan had even donated to hers. However, Shawcross said in the report that given Kogan’s known links to Labour, Nandy “ought to have considered and ascertained whether he had made donations to her”.The report said Nandy and other ministers should be “reminded of their duties to declare and resolve any interests and relationships which they have with a candidate participating in a campaign regulated by the governance code”, recommending that the Cabinet Office and Shawcross work together to avoid a similar situation happening again.Nandy, in her letter to Starmer, said she had taken “robust steps” to check her register of donations before the process of nominating Kogan began, but accepted the report’s findings, saying: “I deeply regret this error. I appreciate the perception it could create, but it was not deliberate and I apologise for it.”In response, Starmer said he accepted an error was inadvertent, adding: “I know you to be a person of integrity and on the basis of your letter, it is clear you have acted in good faith. The commissioner acknowledges that you acted swiftly to step back from the appointment when you became aware of the perception of a conflict of interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

William Smith, a convicted fraudster, was filmed waving to cameras and hugging his partner before he walked back into jail on Thursday, having been mistakenly released by a court on Monday.Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, a sex offender from Algeria who was released from Wandsworth by mistake last week, remains at large.The accidental release of the two men intensified pressure on Lammy, who last week announced a checklist to ensure prisoners were not freed in error after therelease of Hadush Kebatuon 24 October.Prison governors were called to a meeting with Lammy in Leicestershire on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, Lammy said the paper-based system used to process criminals at prisons, courts and in the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) would be overhauled.Overcrowding, understaffing and old IT: chaotic context to prison release errorsRead more“We had 800 errors under the last government; this has now gone on for a generation. Our prison system is in crisis so we have to bear down on this but we have a mountain to climb,” he said.Lammy has faced scrutiny over his handling of the mistaken release of Kaddour-Cherif after he refused to answer questions put to him on the issue in the Commons on Wednesday.On Thursday he said parliament had not been misled. “I took the judgment that it is important when updating the house and the country about serious matters like this that you have all of the detail,” he said.While government sources had insisted that Lammy was briefed about the loss of Kaddour-Cherif on Tuesday night, Lammy told Channel 4 that he found out on Wednesday morning.“The public have a right to know the facts, and they found out the facts a bit later on in the day,” he said.On 27 October, the Ministry of Justice said stronger release checks would be introduced immediately. Two days later, Kaddour-Cherif disappeared from Wandsworth prison.Lammy said his new checks had not been introduced at Wandsworth when the sex offender was released. “We have found out that the release that has caused concern this week was actually before I introduced those checks just a few weeks ago following the release of Kebatu,” he said.Keir Starmer defended Lammy later on Thursday, saying it was right that the justice secretary was “setting out the facts to the best of his knowledge”. He also expressed his frustration at the mistaken prisoner releases.Speaking to broadcasters in Brazil, the prime minister said: “Let me just say how angry and frustrated I am that these mistakes have been made in releasing people. They’re intolerable and they shouldn’t be made.“A lot of it comes from the burden and the strain on the system because of the failures of the last government. But I recognise it’s our job to step up and to fix this, and we will.”The number of prisoners being released by mistake has more than doubled in a year, official figures show. In the year to March, 262 people were freed in error, compared with 115 the previous year, according to data from the MoJ.Prison sources say the overcrowding crisis is partly to blame for the sharp increase in “releases in error” – the official description for the mistakes.The Metropolitan police continued to appeal to the public over the whereabouts of Kaddour-Cherif, who the force believes is still in London just over a week after his release.“We are actively searching for Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, who was released in error from HMP Wandsworth on Wednesday 29 October,” the Met said. “He is believed to be in London and has links to Tower Hamlets and Westminster. If you see him, please call 999 immediately.”Kabatu was wrongly released from Chelmsford prison and attempted to walk back into prison at least four times. He waseventually apprehendedin Finsbury Park, north London, andgiven moneyas he was deported to Ethiopia.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceDavid LammyLabourEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Chants of “Elon” erupted in the room at the news of its approval.“Thanks, guys,” Musk said, after briefly dancing on stage alongside the company’s Optimus robots.Musk described the Optimus robots, which have not gone into mass production, as the future of the company and of humanity. He reiterated a claim that it would be “the biggest product of all time”, and suggested they could be used in everything from healthcare to prisons.“You now get a free Optimus and it’s just going to follow you around and stop you from doing crime,” Musk said. “You don’t have to put people in prisons and stuff. It’s really wild to think of the possibilities.”Musk had previously said he wanted the pay package for more control over the company and exert “strong influence over this robot army” that he vowed to build as the company branches into robotics.Musk’s staggering compensation is comparative with the GDP of entire countries, exceeding that of Ireland, Sweden and Argentina. It vastly exceeds federal funding for entire government programs such as annual cost of Snap food benefits and dwarfs that of other tech moguls such as Mark Zuckerberg.Critics of the package, including some investors, argued that awarding Musk concentrated power in one erratic leader and ignored the challenges the company has faced.“Elon Musk just got $1tn for failure. Sales are down, safety risks are up, and his politics are driving customers away. This isn’t leadership – it’s the world’s most expensive participation trophy,” the protest groupTeslaTakedown said in a statement.If Musk delivers on the lofty milestones in the pay package laid out at the annual meeting, he could become the world’s first trillionaire. To do so, he would need to guide Tesla to $8.5tn in market capitalization, eight times what it’s worth today. He would also be required to deploy millions of autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, and sustain the company’s bottom line in the hundreds of billions over the next decade.The major goals of the compensation plan, split into 12 tranches, lay out a path for Tesla to reach that enormous market capitalization. If he brings the company to that financial height, Musk would be able to cash in on an additional 12% of the company’s stocks. To do so, he has to be vested in the company for at least seven and a half years. He would also have to help develop a long-term succession plan for the company he has led for more than 20 years.Elon Musk’s $56bn Tesla pay package rejected again by US judgeRead moreThe stock options provided by the new compensation plan, on top of shares guaranteed to him in his 2018 package, would leave Musk with 25% ownership of Tesla’s stock. As of 5 November, Tesla stock was trading close to its 52-week high, at about $450 per share.Over the course of a decade, Musk is required to deliver 20m of Tesla’s electric vehicles to buyers, sell 10m active full self-driving subscriptions, develop and sell 1m humanoid robots and deploy 1m robotaxis in commercial service.Musk will also be required to bring the company to $400bn in actual earnings for four consecutive quarters. Tesla’s actual earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $4.2bn, down 9% from the year prior.As of November, Musk’s net worth was $460bn, the highest in the world, according toBloomberg’s Billionaire Index.Reviving a rescinded packageShareholders also approved a plan that would compensate Musk after his 2018 compensation plan was invalidated by a court in Delaware. The pay plan, worth an estimated $56bn, was challenged by a single stockholder, who won his case. The Delaware court of chancery rejected Musk’s pay package twice.After Musk’s 2018 pay package was first rescinded, he moved Tesla’s corporate homefrom Delaware to Texas. He followed suit withSpaceXand other companies’ headquarters. In 2024, under Texas law, shareholders once again voted to approve the pay package.But Delaware’s so-called “court of equity” once again ruled against one of the largest CEO payouts in modern history. Following that unfavorable ruling, Muskvoiced displeasure with the state and its “activist chief judge”, arguably fueling a series of corporate exits that Delaware lawmakers have attempted to staunch with legislation.“He had a big megaphone,” said Lawrence Hamermesh, Widener University Delaware Law School professor emeritus and a former corporate lawyer. “I think there’s more to the movement than just Elon stirring the pot, but I think that had some effect.”In considering whether Musk had undue influence in being awarded that 2018 pay package,Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School professor, noted that the judge recognized that other “superstar CEOs” like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos were not awarded these kinds of incentive-based contracts.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how you can helpRead more“The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur,” McConnell said. “That’s what irreparable harm here means.”The judge added: “This should never happen in America.”McConnell gave theTrump administrationuntil Friday to make the payments through Snap, though it is unlikely that the people who rely on it will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries that quickly.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund Snap,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial Snap payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”This type of order is usually not subject to an appeal, but the Trump administration has challenged similar rulings before.Democrats urged to ‘hold the line’ in talks as shutdown stretches to 37th dayRead moreThe plaintiffs want the Snap program, which is a major component of the nation’s social safety net and serves about one in eight Americans, to be fully funded. Some states, including New York, Oregon and Virginia, declared states of emergency last week to provide funds that would keep benefits available. But the amounts provided were expected to amount to a fraction of normal federal government funding. The federal costs of Snap amounts to about $8bn a month across the US.The Trump administration said last month it would not pay benefits at all for November because of the federal shutdown. Last week, in separate rulings, two judges ordered the government to pay at least part of the benefits using an emergency fund. It initially said it would cover half, but later said it would cover 65%.The US Department of Agriculture’s insistence last month that benefits for November would not be paid because of the shutdown set off a scramble by food banks, state governments and the millions of Americans who receive the aid to find ways to ensure access to groceries.Kristin Bateman, a lawyer for the coalition of cities and non-profit organizations that challenged the government, told the judge the administration had other reasons for not fully funding the benefits.“What defendants are really trying to do is to leverage people’s hunger to gain partisan political advantage in the shutdown fight,” Bateman told the court.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS federal government shutdown 2025Food povertyUS politicsUS federal government shutdownsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has now been nearly two years since the game was announced, and more than 12 years since the release of Grand Theft Auto V.“Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026,” reads Rockstar Games’s statement on X. “We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.”The long-anticipated game stars a romantically entwined pair of criminals named Jason and Lucia in Rockstar’s sun-bleached version of Miami, Vice City, and the wider Florida-like state of Leonida. It has been development at Rockstar North in Edinburgh, with assistance from the company’s other studios in New York and worldwide, since 2018. Its original release window was late 2025.It has been hoped that GTA VI would revive an ailing games industry, which has seen a contraction after a Covid-era boom. According to game publisher Take-Two’s most recent financial reports, its predecessor Grand Theft Auto V has generated $8.6bn since its 2013 release. Rockstar’s last game, the critically acclaimed Red Dead Redemption 2, was released in 2018 and reached $725m in sales over its opening weekend.Players, meanwhile, have had a very long time to look forward to Rockstar’s latest: even by the standards of the video games industry, where six-year development periods for blockbuster games are not unusual, the more than 12-year wait for Grand Theft Auto VI has been extensive.Explore more on these topicsGrand Theft Auto VIGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

When I say so, Trump tells supreme courtCallum Jonesin New YorkThe fate of the US president’s signature, globe-rattling economic policy is in the hands of a court he shapedThu 6 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 10.24 ESTShareDonald Trump faced arguably thebiggest testso far of his contentious use of executive power at the US supreme court on Wednesday. The stakes could not be higher – “literally, LIFE OR DEATH” for the US, at least according to the president.Trump’s signature, globe-rattling economic policy, his sweeping tariffs regime, was in the dock – specifically, the legal mechanism his administration has used to enforce it. And the man dispatched to defend the White House put forward a somewhat puzzling argument.“These are regulatory tariffs,” D John Sauer, US solicitor general, assured the court. “They are not revenue-raising tariffs. The fact that they raise revenue is only incidental.”It was a curious, and more than a little confusing, explanation – tariffs on goods from overseas might raise revenue, but are not revenue-raising – designed to counter rulings by lower courts that set the stage for this test before the highest court in the land.A federal appeals court in Washington DCruled in Augustthat the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law Trump invoked to impose many of his tariffs,did not grant “the power to tax” to the president.Congress is granted sole authority under the constitution to levy taxes. Trump bypassed Congress – lawfully, his aides insist – to drive through a policyestimatedto equate to the largest tax hike since 1993.Thus, on Wednesday morning, the administration appeared to argue before the supreme court that these tariffs – taxes paid by myriad US companies on imported products – were notreallytaxes at all.Critics are not having it. “Anybody can look up in the dictionary,” Maria Cantwell, Democratic senator from Washington, told the Guardian. “Tariffs are an import tax, plain and simple. I would assume the administration understands that.“I actually am surprised that it was so lacking,” Cantwell added, of the administration’s case.The court did not appear persuaded, either. “You want to say tariffs are not taxes,” said the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor. “But that’s exactly what they are.”Some conservatives on the bench also sounded skeptical. “The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” said the chief justice, John Roberts.The administration’s argument that the fact tariffs raise money is “only incidental” might be more persuasive if the president spent less time boasting about the amount of money they raised. “My tariffs are bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars,” Trump declared in a speech hours after the hearing.The president has argued – in typically binary terms – that the fate of his flagship economic strategy is aligned with that of the nation. But there are many business owners in the US, grappling with the abrupt imposition of steep tariffs, who believe the fate of their companies has been jeopardized by this regime.The president who cried tariffs: will the US supreme court challenge Trump’s trade war?Read moreWhile official statistics (at least, those published before the government shutdown) have shownpersisting inflationand astalling jobs market, Trump continues to erroneously claim his agenda is producing stellar results. “Our Economy is BOOMING, and Costs are coming way down,” he wrote on social media during Wednesday’s hearing.It is ultimately down to voters,as some did on Tuesday, to deliver their verdict on Trump’s agenda. For now, a handful of small firms, together with a dozen states, have joined forces to challenge the way in which he has rammed it through.“We think that this case is really about executive overreach,” said Stephen Woldenberg, senior vice-president of sales at Learning Resources, a toy company based near Chicago that sued the administration to invalidate Trump’s tariffs as exceeding his authority.At the heart of this case is really a “broader issue”, according to Woldenberg, of who sets taxes – and how – across the US. “We weren’t really willing to let politicians, and really a single politician, decide our fate,” he said.That fate is now in the hands of a court Trump has shaped. The justices have pledged to fast-track their decision. On Wednesday, at least,most sounded unpersuadedby the administration’s defense.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS supreme courtTariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

She was initially fired along with most employees at the agency, but reinstated in May afterpolitical pressureto overturn the firings and acourt intervenedto block most of the firings.“For many agencies, like the one that I am employed by, we’ve been effectively shut down for many months already because of the reductions in force that have already happened, and all of the attacks that we’ve been seeing on the federal workforce,” said Niemeier-Walsh.“It’s become out of control, and I really hope that this shutdown is a wake-up call of how bad things have gotten.”In November, furloughed government employees received furlough extension notices, although many noticesdid not contain assurancesthey would receive back pay once the government reopens. Denial of back pay has been athreat repeatedly madeby the Trump administration during the shutdown, along with firings during the shutdown, which wereblockedin a federal court.“I have never, ever, ever, ever, ever thought that we would have our government attacking government employees,” said Omar Algeciras, who works at the Department of Labor. “ I think this is the epitome of harassment, bullying and attacks on people that are simply trying to do their best to provide a service or services to American workers.”The Trump administration’s treatment of federal workers and their unions has put significant pressure and mental health burdens on federal workers who provide services to the American public, said Algeciras, vice-president of AFGE Local 2391.“This is unprecedented, it’s unnecessary and I really do think that it’s very disheartening and saddening to see and to have to talk to some of our members and remind them that they need to take a moment for themselves, not to focus on what’s being said,” added Algeciras. “We’re having to take care of our union members, we’re having to take care of our co-workers, because it’s not coming from the top down any more.”The AFGE hascalledfor an end to the government shutdown, avoiding assigning blame to Republicans or Democrats for the shutdown and its prolongation.As the stalemate to end the government shutdown continues into November, Trump hasaffirmedhe has no plans to negotiate with Democrats, with the shutdown adding to the stress and anxieties federal employees have already endured under the administration’s efforts to cull their workforce.Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director,saidbefore the administration took office he wanted to put federal workers “in trauma” and for them to be viewed as “villains”, and he has attempted to use the shutdown to further those efforts.“For myself and my members, they’ve been going through this chaos and stress and anxiety since February of, from one day to the next, not knowing if they’re going to have a job,” said Tandy Zitkus, AFGE Local 898 president and a furloughed worker at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha).“Since February, there’s been a constant threat every day when you get up and go to work, and it’s unfortunately nothing new. It’s become a norm for the federal worker.”Workers have been forced to budget as best they can around missed paychecks, from filing for unemployment and waiting on those benefits, deciding whether to visit food banks and requesting deferments on bills, said Zitkus.“It’s overwhelming. It’s hard to stay positive,” Zitkus said. “Federal workers serve the people. They’re not politicians, and so there’s a lot of frustration being expressed to me by my members of: why is this going on, why is there a political fight going on that affects us? We’re civil servants, and we serve the American people, and we want to be able to continue to do that and be paid.”Abigail Jackson, the White House deputy secretary, placed the shutdown blame solely on Democrats andrepeated the misleading claimthat Democrats are pushing for healthcare for undocumented immigrants.“The only reason the government was shut down at all, let alone for this long, is because the Democrats decided to hold the American people hostage to push their radical, far-left policy agenda of free healthcare for illegal aliens,” Jackson said in a statement.“American families have missed paychecks and benefits because of the Democrats’ irresponsible behavior. President Trump wants the government reopen – the Democrats can choose to reopen it at any point, and they should do so immediately.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US unionsWorkers' rightsUS politicsDonald TrumpUS federal government shutdownsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.9%.A report showed that last month was theworst October for US layoffs since 2003, which grabbed the attention of investors in the absence of official data delayed by the federal government shutdown. Companies cut jobs and imposed hiring freezes, according to theglobal outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at the trading platform IG.com, said: “The lack of US data and the ongoing government shutdown is making investors nervous.”US markets have been rattled bya review of Donald Trump’s tariffs by the supreme court, which could result in the US president being forced to abandon his flagship policy.A lack of official data has also forced the Federal Reserve to judge the state of the US economy with only a fraction of the information it would usually sift before judging the level of interest rates.Beauchamp said the Fed and financial markets had found themselves “groping around in the dark” after the suspension of inflation and employment data.Speaking on CNBC, the Fed board member Austan Goolsbee said the lack of official data on inflation during the government shutdown accentuated his caution about cutting interest rates further.“I lean more to the: when it’s foggy, let’s just be a little careful and slow down,” he said.The survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that employers announced 153,074 job cuts last month, compared with 55,597 in October 2024. It said US firms announced the termination of 1.09m roles during the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts in 2024.

The Stoxx Europe 600 closed 0.7% lower, with tech stocks suffering the heaviest losses, and the Dax in Germany fell 1.3%.Beauchamp said: “If the supreme court rolls back some of the tariffs then inflationary worries will subside to an extent, though this is a topic that will not come to fruition for weeks.”Tech valuations have ballooned, and fears of a bubble loom large. “In the US, most of the big tech beasts have reported earnings but there is still lingering concerns about those lofty valuations and the mind-boggling sums of cash being invested into the AI dream,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company is offering customers a replacement seat post that can be self-installed.The recall follows a 2023 voluntary pullback of more than 2 million of Peloton’s original model bikes, which were recalled over a similar seat post issue.The company’s shares, down 18.1% so far this year, dropped 6.5% in New York on Thursday.Peloton has been cutting costs and reducing headcount under a turnaround effort, while raising prices for its products to help offset higher expenses tied to Donald Trump’s tariffs.In August, the company said it would reduce its global workforce by 6% and warned that the latest tariffs were expected to dent its 2026 free cash flow by about $65m.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The most Batmanian felt he could achieve was to slow the advance of the chainsaws and tractors.But the director-general of Brazil’s forest service feels there could be a chance at the Cop30 climate summit in Belém,Brazil, next week, not just of an even fight, but perhaps a victory. There is one condition: world governments must rally behind an initiative being launched by the host nation – the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF).“Before, I always felt we could keep the game close but we could never win,” he said. “But this is a gamechanger.”The TFFF is the biggest and boldest plan yet to staunch the loss of tropical forests that are a pillar of climate stability. Its success depends on buy-in from governments and financial institutions that until now have directed their funds towards destruction.Championed by Brazil’s globally respected environment minister,Marina Silva, and drawn up with advice from the World Bank, London financial consultants and several governments,the TFFF aims to disrupt the financial logic for deforestationby raising $125bn (£95bn), investing it in bonds, and paying out the returns as a reward for countries and communities that conserve their standing forests.View image in fullscreenBrazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, attends a plenary session at the Cop30 climate summit.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APSo far, only Brazil and Indonesia have announced investments in the scheme. The World Bank has agreed to host the facility. Several countries have murmured positively, but not yet committed any money. The UK hasmade clearit will not contribute at this stage. There will need to be greater momentum at Cop30 if the plan is to get off the ground.Governments and companies have repeatedly promised – and failed – to deal with the problem of deforestation. The last big push was at Cop26 in Glasgow when world leaders and financial institutions signed up to a commitment for zero deforestation by 2030. Since then the loss of forests has accelerated, largely because banks and treasuries are pouring money into land clearance, according tothe latest annual assessment of global forest health.TFFF will be different, say proponents, primarily because it hopes to be bigger than anything that has come before. Brazil wants to secure $25bn in investments from world governments, and leverage that fund in the bond markets to secure another $100bn from private financial institutions. This will be invested, like an endowment fund, with annual returns that will be used to reward tropical forest nations for good behaviour.If the full $125bn is secured, this would generate an estimated $800m per year to tropical forest nations, so long as the conditions for forest conservation are met.For Brazil, home to the world’s biggest tropical forests, the finance ministry calculates this would be 26 times more than it currently receives from the Amazon Fund, which, until now, has been the most advanced and generous forest financing mechanism.Brazilian finance ministry officials, who have spent the past 18 months working on this project, say the TFFF would be a step-change. “There is no way I would get that amount of money if I asked Oslo or Berlin,” said João Paulo de Resende, the undersecretary for fiscal and economic affairs, who has been working on this project for 18 months. He said the payments would also be less vulnerable to political mood swings. The former US president Joe Biden for example, promised $500m for the Amazon Fund in 2023, but only sought a 10th of that amount from the US Congress, which then gave him nothing.View image in fullscreenPrince William, left, and Keir Starmer arrive in Belém to attend the Cop30 conference. The UK has said it will not contribute to the fund at this stage.Photograph: Ben Stansall/APUnlike the Amazon Fund, the money would pay for standing forests. In a radical departure, it would also earmark 20% of disbursements as direct payments for Indigenous and other traditional forest communities.The UN secretary-general, António Guterres,told the Guardianthis was a positive development because Indigenous communities have been shown to preserve biodiversity and protect carbon sinks. “It is absolutely fundamental,” he said, “to invest in those who are the best guardians of nature. And the best guardians of nature are precisely the Indigenous communities.”There is no question of the need to increase financial support for forest conservation. The Amazon is one of the world’s most important climate stabilisers, yet it is degrading toa point of no return.The core problem for the forest – and almost all natural habitats – is that global markets value it more highly dead than alive. Brazil’s proposal aims to shift that logic.Currently, the benefits of standing forests – temperature reduction, water transport, carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat, living laboratory, psychological wellbeing and more – have largely been taken for granted by industrial capitalism. Financial incentives are instead geared towards clearing the land for monocultures of cattle, soy or other crops that can be easily commodified. Land speculation drives destruction because the price of a property registers a manifold increase once trees have been cut and burned.Making such activity illegal can slow the loss, as Batmanian has seen over his long career, but enforcement ebbs and flows with different governments, while financial pressures relentlessly encourage deforestation. Carbon credit markets were supposed to rebalance this, but most schemes have failed. Meanwhile, fire, drought and farm expansion are weakening the capacity of this natural carbon sink.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The knowledge, practices and legal status of Brazil’s Indigenous people make them ideal guardians of the rainforest.Photograph: Adriano Machado/ReutersTFFF aims to mobilise money to reverse the course of this battle.Indigenous groups and longtime environmentalists in Brazil have been involved in the planning of the TFFF. Carlos Rittl, of WildlifeConservationSociety, said the policy had the potential to be transformational for Indigenous territories and would also have considerable benefits for central Africa.He said: “We have been waiting for so long for something like this. The TFFF can be a turning point to prevent a tipping point in the Amazon and other regions.”The most innovative, and controversial, feature of TFFF is how it plans to secure finance. Rather than go cap in hand to rich countries for grants, it asks for investments that should be repaid in the future. It is not tied to the UN process, so both the global south and north are asked to invest. The seed funds are from governments.As TFFF’s money is considered an investment rather than a donation, it hopes to secure funds from the Middle East and China, as well as traditional donor nations in Europe, North America and the far east.The political winds are not favourable. The US, which helped draw up TFFF plans during the Biden administration, has gone silent under Donald Trump. Another early backer, France, is in turmoil. China – aBricsally of Brazil – has so far been noncommittal. Brazil’s diplomats and foreign ministry officials say there is strong interest from other countries and are calling on other governments to shore up support. Nobody expects the full $25bn seed-fund target to be committed at Cop30, but for the plan to work, it needs to make a strong start.The loudest criticism of the scheme is that it is too vulnerable to the gyrations of financial markets and insufficiently transparent about risk. The TFFF plans to invest in bonds in developing nations that have historically been prone to fluctuations.The era of fine speeches and good intentions is over. Brazil’s Cop30 will be about action | Luiz Inácio Lula da SilvaRead moreResende acknowledges that in some years the facility might not pay out if there are steep market falls similar to those caused by the 2020 Covid epidemic or the 2008-09 financial crisis. But he said the risks had been carefully assessed by the ministry, two UK consultancies, theWorld Bank, one rating agency, a US financial company, and advisers in half a dozen nations.He said the four to one leverage ratio was small compared with international financial institutions. Risk would be low because the fund would not invest in stocks, but national and corporate bonds, with no more than a 4% holding in any asset. Modelling, he said, showed that investing countries would get their money back and more, while there would be a far bigger incentive to protect forests.According to Resende’s calculations, 6m hectares (15m acres) of tropical forest are lost every year, which is equivalent to 1.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide – or the entire annual emissions of Russia. That is worth $140bn at EU carbon prices.“If TFFF is responsible for a 20% reduction in deforestation, then we repay the money in one year,” Resende said. “It is a small risk with an enormous return. There is no better cost benefit than this anywhere in the world.”Cop30 will show how much the world is ready to invest in that idea.Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilClimate crisisDeforestationAmericasConservationTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We still think rates are on a gradual path downwards, but we need to be sure that inflation is on track to return to our 2% target before we cut them again,” he said.Borrowing costs have been cut five times since Labour came to power in July 2024, easing pressure on households and businesses, with thelast reduction made in August. Meanwhile, inflation isrunning at 3.8%– almost twice the Bank’s 2% target.In her 26 November fiscal statement the chancelloris expected to increase taxes, potentially slowing the economy, alongside measures takingaction against the rising cost of living.Reeves welcomed the Bank’s updated forecast showing inflation falling back at a faster-than-anticipated rate. “At the budget later this month I will take the fair choices that are necessary to build the strong foundations for our economy so we can continue to cut waiting lists, cut the national debt and cut the cost of living,” she said.After the vote to hold, which was closer than the City expected, Bailey suggested the MPC would have an “opportunity to consider the budget” before its 18 December meeting. Financial markets shifted after the vote to indicate an almost 60% chance of a quarter-point reduction in rates next month.Economists said tax increases could encourage Threadneedle Street to take action. “There is a plausible case for even weaker demand, hence pushing inflation lower from 2026,” said Janet Mui, the head of market analysis at the wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin.“[We will] only get more clarity post-budget, and governor Bailey’s vote will be crucial. Overall, markets believe the BoE has opened the door for a rate cut in December and has priced in that happening.”Five members of the MPC voted to keep rates unchanged at 4%, including Bailey, while a minority of four pushed for a quarter-point reduction.Expressing growing concern over the strength of the economy, the Bank said unemployment was poised to climb to a higher peak above 5% early next year – from 4.8% now – amid subdued hiring demand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It forecast the rate would fall back to about 2.5% next year, before returning to its 2% target over the course of 2027.In the minutes of its decision the MPC said that speculation over Reeves’s budget had probably contributed to weakness in the economy in recent months, while households had kept a lid on spending amid heightened pressures on living costs.It also found weaker exports to the US and disruption to Britain’s manufacturing base linked to the Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack had pulled down output in the third quarter, forecasting a weaker growth rate of 0.2%.The Bank forecast GDP growth would slow from 1.5% this year to 1.2% in 2026, before picking up to 1.6% in 2027 and 1.8% in 2028.However, policymakers warned that inflationary pressures could continue to weigh on households and businesses. Huw Pill, the Bank’s chief economist, said there were signs that the UK could be suffering from “intrinsic inflation persistence” because workers and businesses were responding to current rates of inflation by demanding higher pay settlements and raising their prices.But Bailey said the risk of inflation becoming entrenched at high levels was diminishing as a risk, and signalled “if disinflation becomes more clearly established in the period ahead” he would vote for a cut.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesBank of EnglandRachel ReevesBudget 2025BudgetEconomicsMonetary policy committeenewsShareReuse this content"

The plant, called Project One, is designed to turbocharge European plastic production. Petrochemical facilities emit particulate matter as a result of their operations.Plastic production has increased more than 200-fold since 1950 and is expected to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060, driven largely by single-use plastics usedfor packaging and drink and food containers.Tatiana Luján, of Client Earth, who is leading the case, said new evidence showed that in addition to the risks to life, the carbon emissions of Project One would vastly exceed Ineos’s own estimates.Ineos’s assessment found that projected direct annual carbon emissions would be 655,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), roughly the same as Eritrea’s output. But lawyers say the company failed to calculate full lifecycle emissions.A report by Data Desk submitted to the court estimates the full supply chain emissions footprint of Project One could reach 3.8m tonnes of CO2e each year, around five times higher than stated in Ineos’s environmental impact assessment.Luján said: “We know categorically that we need no more plastic-producing infrastructure globally. Yet right here in Europe, authorities are bending over backwards to enable the biggest plastics facility on the continent yet.“Project One has a shiny image, but its story is founded on fossil fuels. The gas supply chain is riddled with injustice and huge emissions and this is currently flying under the radar. Meanwhile, experts have detailed a projected local impact that people in Belgium are not being made aware of.”Since the legal battle began, courts around the world have clarified the inclusion of so-called scope 3 emissions in environmental impact assessments. These are emissions that do not happen on-site but would not be created if the facility did not exist.Luján added: “Recent rulings on how authorities need to tally up the real impact of industrial developments change the prospects of this legal challenge.This is the first time a court will weigh in on scope 3 and plastics. That makes it a crucial case.”Ineos told the Guardian they had not been officially notified of the appeal, or received the appeal so were unable to comment in detail on the arguments. “We are disappointed that the NGOs have once again chosen to take legal action, despite our invitation to them to engage in dialogue about their concerns. It is also regrettable that the legal certainty of investments in the renewal of industry in Europe is repeatedly being undermined. This is happening in a context where our European manufacturing industry is heading for further deindustrialisation, due to a lack of protection against rising imports from regions that are not subject to strict environmental regulations.”They added that they remain fully committed to the project: “the most environmentally friendly steam cracker in Europe, with carbon emissions less than half those of the most efficient European installations.”Explore more on these topicsIneosGreenhouse gas emissionsPlasticsPollutionBelgiumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He was flown to Essex County, New Jersey, where he is being held pending extradition to Miami, Vega said.It was unclear why Brown was taken to New Jersey first or how long he had been in Dubai, although he has posted several times on social media over the past few months from there.According to an arrest warrant detailing the 16 May shooting, Brown is accused of grabbing a handgun from a security staffer after the boxing match and firing two shots at a man he had gotten into a fistfight with earlier. The victim, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, told investigators one of the bullets grazed his neck.It was unclear from court documents whether Brown has an attorney. It also was not immediately known when Brown might be returned to Miami.A second-degree attempted murder charge carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence and up to a $10,000 fine in event of a conviction.Brown, who spent 12 years in theNFL, was an All-Pro wide receiver who last played in 2021 for Tampa Bay but spent most of his career with Pittsburgh. For his career, Brown had 928 receptions for more than 12,000 yards and 83 touchdowns.Brown has dealt with several legal problems over the years. He previously had been accused of battery of a moving truck driver, several domestic violence charges, failure to pay child support and other incidents.During a 2021 game with Tampa Bayagainst the New York Jets, Brown took off his jersey, shoulder pads and gloves and ran off the field, leading to his release by the Buccaneers and effectively ending his football career.Explore more on these topicsNFLMiamiUS sportsTampa Bay BuccaneersPittsburgh SteelersShareReuse this content"

Marshawn was a beloved teammate and member of our organization. Our thoughts and prayers regarding Marshawn are with his girlfriend Catalina and his family,” the team said in a statement.According to the Frisco police department, Kneeland appeared to have taken his own life after a late-night vehicle pursuit and multi-agency search. Officers said Kneeland fled on foot after a crash on southbound Dallas Parkway on Wednesday night and was later located at 1.31am.

I watched him fight his way from a hopeful kid at Western Michigan with a dream to being a respected professional for the Dallas Cowboys,” Perzley wrote in a statement.“Marshawn poured his heart into every snap, every practice, and every moment on the field. To lose someone with his talent, spirit, and goodness is a pain I can hardly put into words. My heart aches for his family, his teammates, and everyone who loved him, and I hope they feel the support of the entire football community during this unimaginable time.”Western Michigan coach Lance Taylor also issued a statement: “My heart is absolutely broken over the loss of Marshawn Kneeland. Marshawn was so much more than an incredible football player – he was a remarkable young man who meant so much to our program and to me personally. His leadership, energy, and smile were infectious, and he left a lasting impact on everyone in our program. Having coached him during my first season here, we developed a special bond that went far beyond football. His passion for life and his teammates were unmatched. Our entire Bronco Football family is devastated, and we send our deepest prayers to his family, teammates, and all who loved him. Marshawn will forever be a part of the Bronco brotherhood.”The Cowboys selected Kneeland out of Western Michigan in the second-round of the 2024 draft. His mother, Wendy,died shortly before he was drafted.“It was definitely tough,” Kneeland said of his mother’s death. “I just managed it. She helped me a lot in my younger years getting into football. I always had the dream. I always told her, ‘I’m going to the NFL’ and I made it.”View image in fullscreenMarshawn Kneeland (centre) after recovering a blocked punt for a touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals on MNF.Photograph: Richard Rodriguez/APKneeland played in 11 games in his rookie season, but had taken on a more prominent role in 2025.

If it wasn’t so bleak, or so profoundly unsettling. But then, this is Birmingham, so there does have to be some gallows humour buried in there.Either way an hour before kick-off on the streets outside Villa Park it became clear that the 700 police officers present were being asked to keep apart three distinct, and equally energetic factions: pro-Palestine, pro-Israeli and pro YouTubers.Maatsen and Malen help Aston Villa avoid more controversy in win over Maccabi Tel AvivRead moreAt times it was tempting to ask which of these groups represented the greater danger to the public, out there kettled into their designated spaces on Witton and Trinity Roads, the YouTubers acting as a kind of mobile cavalry between encampments, tangling with police lines, pressing the global cause of the content warrior. Would we see the first UK riot shield charges against teenagers with GoPros, subscriber-base war on the streets, fully weaponised clickbait?So yes, you could have almost played it for laughs. If it wasn’t so fraught, tense and redolent of wider horrors at one remove. Opposite the Doug Ellis Stand there was something unavoidably disturbing an hour before kick-off in the sight of 30 or 40 pro-Israel … demonstrators? Not exactly. Old age pensioners? Mainly – being retained within a caged playground for their own safety.It will of course be overplayed in some parts as an act of oppression, because everything must now be overplayed. Clearly the police had decided this was the easiest way to maintain control of a febrile moment. It seemed to work. But still, the basic optics of placing these people inside a steel cage was undeniably strange. We’ve found you a camp. You’ll be safe here.Otherwise the atmosphere on the streets before Aston Villa vMaccabi Tel Avivwas tense, noisy, confusing and, beneath it all, undeniably depressing. The crowd milled and shifted, carrying with it a sense of wariness and rage at one remove. So this is what living inside the internet is going to feel like.View image in fullscreen‘The basic optics were undeniably strange’ when pro-Israeli protesters were escorted by police to a caged playground nearby the stadium.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianThere has never been a sporting occasion quite like this, perhaps the most un-football football match ever staged in England, a groaning platter of geopolitics with a tiny little sprig of sport dusted across the top.Arguably this was the most notable non-football match since Dynamo Kyiv’s Stalin-era tour of England, a series of games that began in a spirit of goodwill then quickly became fraught; and which crystallised George Orwell’s dislike of international sport, his dismissal of such occasions as “war minus the shooting”.Orwell was sniffing out something that would turn out to be undeniably true. Although we have now moved this on. These days sport is war plus the shooting, a PR megaphone for hard power, marched about the place in a headlock by every despot and opportunist with an army at his back.War and proxy-war follows the World Cup around as a natural next step. Earlier this week Fifa’s presidential popinjay Gianni Infantino revealed details of his new football peace prize, parroting the usual platitudes about empowering the peace-makers (who are also, as it happens, a very powerful bunch of war-makers).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The banning of the Maccabi fans from this game has always been couched as related solely to fears of Israeli hooliganism. It obviously isn’t that, and it’s OK to say this because no one here is blind to the reality. The ban exists because a cross-border ethnic and religious war is being waged between irrevocably opposed sides.So there were no Maccabi fans in the stadium as a room temperature game endedin a 2-0 victory for Aston Villa. There were none outside either, although a number of British supporters had made the trip. Two hours before kick-off a young woman called Emily walked down Trinity Road holding an Israeli flag, accompanied only by a hyped, rubbernecking police cordon, and was met with some isolated shouts of “Death, death to the IDF”.Is it OK to shout about death? She was warned under the police’s special crowd control powers, told to leave the area for 48 hours, and left cheerfully enough.View image in fullscreenPro-Palestinian protesters outside Villa Park before Aston Villa’s Europa League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianIn the main pro-Palestine camp on Trinity Road there were speeches, some calling for calm and tolerance, while also condemning the violent actions of Israel’s army in response to the violent actions of 7 October. Those present dispersed peaceably after kick-off. This was legitimate protest, expressed within the boundaries of free speech. The many banners about Zionists being unwelcome in the area, less so. Is this OK? Would it be acceptable in relation to any other group?Otherwise the policing was robust, backed by dogs, drones and horses draped in Christmassy lights. There were some scuffles between fans and police, who seemed to mistake people with tickets for ground-invaders. A YouTuber called Young Bob was detained for refusing to stop broadcasting near to the main pro-Palestine camp.At one point a man with a union flag tied around his shoulders was prevented from entering the ground (“You can’t go in wearing that”). Whatever your feelings about flags, which are in the end just bits of coloured cloth, it is undeniably a curiosity that this one should be such an object of provocation. But then, Britain is a strange country.By the end there was sense of relief at the absence of serious flashpoints and flare-ups. The centre held, the lines were maintained. With any luck Birmingham will now get though the night unscathed. But the depth of feeling here was undeniably real, undeniably visceral, and undeniably strange.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivanalysisShareReuse this content"

There were no immediate reports of any injuries and Spoelstra was not home when the fire started.Miami-Dade County fire officials said the blaze was reported around 4.30am. Spoelstra and the Heat played in Denver on Wednesday night and their charter flight back toMiamidid not land until 5.11am.Spoelstra arrived at the home shortly after the plane landed, with several fire crews working to contain the blaze.Video showed him pacingas he watched crews fighting the flames. Smoke was still rising over the property more than three hours after the first fire trucks arrived, but officials said the blaze had been contained.Fire officials said more than 20 units responded to the fire, fighting it on the ground and in the air. The fire did not spread to any neighboring properties.“Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded with over 20 units – including a hazardous materials response – to combat this fire,” Miami-Dade battalion chief Victoria Byrd said.“We found fire that was as tall as the trees. Our units came in and did an excellent job ... due to the privacy wall and a lot of the tree cover, it was very difficult to access, with only one point of entry. The men and women from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue were able to extinguish this fire and do the best job they could.”Property records show Spoelstra bought the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home in December 2023 for $6.6m. Local TV reports said he had been renovating the property for a year, and the work had recently been completed.Spoelstra has been Heat’s coach since 2008 and led the team to theNBAchampionship in 2012 and 2013.Explore more on these topicsMiami HeatMiamiUS sportsNBABasketballnewsShareReuse this content"

I need to win this weekend, next weekend and all the final races. That’s my goal.”He had, however, been given a spur by his control at the very front of the field in Mexico. A salutary reminder that the McLaren is still very much at the front of the field for all that Red Bull have made great strides over recent races.“When I have a weekend like last weekend, I can prove to myself that I can dominate,” he said. “That is a nice thought because it is nice to prove to myself what I am capable of and what I can achieve. It was a small achievement of a bigger puzzle. There is a much bigger picture in mind.”Verstappen, who had all but given up hopes of winning a fifth title this season at the midway point, has been re-energised by the improvements to his car that have allowed Red Bull to unlock its potential and provide a stable and balanced platform to the Dutchman’s liking.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen plots his next move for Red Bull.Photograph: Sebastião Moreira/EPAHe has won three of the five races since the Dutch GP, an achievement he believed had been an extraordinary turnaround.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Luís Diaz, whose combativeness is sorely missed by Liverpool, scored two, but he took the aggression too far when his challenge on Achraf Hakimi led to a first-half red card. That meant the second half became a test of defensive credentials that Bayern passed. “I also want us to enjoy it when we have to defend,” said Kompany. He was by no means his club’s first-choice as coach in the summer of 2024 – relegation from the Premier League with Burnley had damaged his reputation. But in Bavaria, the noise from the boardroom has been quelled – for now – by the brilliance of his team’s play.Pafos make history. A familiar face – and hairstyle – played 90 minutes as David Luiz marshalled the defence for Pafos’s defeat of Villarreal. The 38-year-old, the defensive lion of Chelsea’s 2012Champions Leaguewin, is the oldest outfield player in this season’s competition. When the Cypriot club were formed on 10 June 2014, David Luiz was in the process of negotiating a move from Chelsea to PSG. The scoring hero for Pafos this week, coached by Juan Carlos Carcedo, a longtime assistant to Unai Emery, was Derrick Luckassen, David Luiz’s defensive partner. Luckassen is the older brother of Brian Brobbey, Sunderland’s No 9. The assist came via Ken Sema, once of Watford, who is part of a Pafos squad from across the football spectrum. “As a first-time manager, it’s my greatest victory,” said Caredo; it was Pafos’s first-ever group stage win, too.Qarabag and Club Brugge denied. Perhaps the format’s relative lack of jeopardy encourages smaller teams to attack supposedly elite opposition – whatever the case, it makes for great entertainment. Both Qarabag,who gave Chelsea a fright in Baku, and Club Brugge,who drew 3-3 with Barcelonain the best match of the week, supplied the extended group stage with legitimacy via entertainment. Gurban Gurbanov has been in charge of Qarabag since 2008 – a period in which Chelsea have had 14 “permanent” managers. His team ravaged Chelsea’s defence, with Jorrel Hato suffering a rotten night. Meanwhile, Brugge repeatedly pierced Hansi Flick’s high-line, high-wire act. It took Lamine Yamal’s habitual brilliance, and a video assistant coming to the rescue of Wojciech Szczęsny as Brugge’s “winner” was ruled out, to save Barça. Brugge coach Nicky Hayen is winning admirers; he was in charge of Haverfordwest County in the League of Wales three years ago.Player of the weekBradley shuts down Vinícius and shows Liverpool he can be right-back for future | Nick AmesRead moreThere were plenty of contenders for this award. Brugge’s Carlos Forbs got two goals and an assist against Barcelona, Galatasaray’s Victor Osimhen scored a brilliant hat-trick against Ajax, whileArsenal’s 15-year-old midfielder Max Dowmanbecame the competition’s youngest ever player. But this week’s award belongs to a defender – although not Tottenham’s Micky van de Ven, despitehis breathtaking solo goal against Copenhagen. The award instead goes to Liverpool’sConor Bradley,who first made his mark a year ago with a crunching tackle on Kylian Mbappé. On Tuesday it was Vinícius Júnior whowas locked down by the Northern Irishman, who clearly reserves his best for Real Madrid. Bradley’s bite took place as Trent Alexander-Arnold, booed all evening by the Anfield crowd, was sat on the Madrid bench until the latter stages. Thibaut Courtois, in Madrid’s goal, was a contender for player of the week, too.They said it“Some players are not happy to be substituted, they don’t react well, and we sort these things out in the locker room.” Ivan Juric, Atalanta’s coach, plays down the ferocious touchline altercation with Ademola Lookman after the player was subbed off during the team’s 1-0 win at Marseille. While Atalanta’s players celebrated at full-time, Juric and Lookman resumed their heated discussion. “We all know these situations, we’ve all had them as players, as coaches, they happen in the heat of the moment,” Juric added.The pundit’s chair“As Virgil is captain I think that is your opportunity to go and lead the players and that is what I was saying. That happens in football and I think the response has been great from Virgil and the team.” Awkward for Wayne Rooney, as Virgil van Dijk confronts him in Amazon Prime’s post-game show. That came afterRooney had been criticalof the defender’s leadership and body language on his BBC podcast. Point made, Van Dijk signed off with a “we move on” and an embrace with Rooney.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

John Heitinga, the latest Ajax youth product to struggle to revive the club’s former glories, was fired on Thursday. Benfica’s loss to Bayer Leverkusen saw José Mourinho revert to type. He blamed “a referee who, unfortunately, I know well and I know doesn’t have much affection for me”. Mourinho’s return to Lisbon may not last long, either.Enzo Maresca drew criticism for Chelsea’s performance in Baku: his squad cost £1.6bn compared to Qarabag’s £21m. A defeat of Barcelona at the Bridge would help his cause.

But just as she looked poised to seize the first set, Sabalenka found her best self, saving the break points with two service winners, then responding from advantage down with three aces in a row.Gauff, though, stuck with her, holding under pressure to secure a tiebreak and earning its first mini-break. But again, Sabalenka responded well to pressure, fighting back to snaffle the set before dominating the second, breaking twice to lead 4-0 before closing out the match to send the champion home.Share"

But while the Milan midfielder has just recovered from an injury suffered during his most recent time with the national team, Weston McKennie’s absence is a bit more surprising.Reyna and Scally, both of Borussia Mönchengladbach, are among a 25-player squad named by manager Mauricio Pochettino for two friendlies: against Paraguay on 15 November at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, and against Uruguay at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on 18 November.USMNT’s Pochettino admits he misses Premier League and would like to return in futureRead moreThis window is the second to last before Pochettino names his roster for the 2026 World Cup, and the last meeting of the national team until March. The squad will be missing a number of regulars aside from Pulisic and McKennie: Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards has been dealing with a knock, Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Malik Tillman is out having just made his return from injury, while Marseille winger Tim Weah and Fulham left-back Antonee Robinson remain sidelined with their own ailments. In their place are some interesting names who have often been on the fringes of national team contention.Here’s the full USMNT roster by position, along with some brief thoughts on each group:GoalkeepersRoman Celentano(FC Cincinnati),Matt Freese(New York City FC),Jonathan Klinsmann(Cesena),Patrick Schulte(Columbus Crew)Freese is the most experienced of this bunch and now seems the odds-on favorite to start at the World Cup, with New England Revolution goalkeeper Turner not called in this time around. Turner was the US starter in 2022 but Pochettino has mostly stuck to this rotation of goalkeepers, with Freese garnering the most time in recent friendlies.DefendersMax Arfsten(Columbus Crew),Sergiño Dest(PSV Eindhoven),Alex Freeman(Orlando City),Mark McKenzie(Toulouse FC),Tim Ream(Charlotte FC),Miles Robinson(FC Cincinnati),Joe Scally(Borussia Mönchengladbach),John Tolkin(Holstein Kiel),Auston Trusty(Celtic)Robinson’s recovery from an offseason knee operation has continued to hold him out of significant action for Fulham. His ommission means his absence from the national team will have extended to a full calendar year. Arfsten has been Pochettino’s favored option for left-back (or left wingback if playing with three center-backs), but he’ll face some competition from Tolkin, who returns to the national team for the first time since this summer’s Gold Cup. Scally’s return as an option at right-back is also notable – he hasn’t been in a US squad since March’s Nations League finals.Keep an eye on who Pochettino goes with at center-back in the absence of Richards. McKenzie, Ream and Miles Robinson have all seen significant time in the position, with Trusty called in to provide another option for the group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pulisic suffered a hamstring injury last time out for the US, which he is only now recovered from. Weah suffered a thigh injury for Marseille on 26 October, so his absence is somewhat expected.The bigger surprise exclusion is McKennie, who has started Juventus’ last three Serie A games. That will be the major talking point of this camp, along with one name whoisin this group: Reyna, who like Scally last appeared for the US in the Concacaf Nations League finals. On his day, Reyna is one of the most talented and creative members of the US player pool, but struggles with injuries, form, minutes at club level, and persistent questions about his attitude have plagued him. Reyna has played just 131 competitive minutes for ‘Gladbach this season after an offseason move from Dortmund in search of playing time.ForwardsBrenden Aaronson(Leeds United),Folarin Balogun(AS Monaco),Diego Luna(Real Salt Lake),Ricardo Pepi(PSV Eindhoven),Haji Wright(Coventry City)Pepi returns to the squad for the first time in a year, having suffered a knee injury at the end of 2024. He will seek to stake a claim as an option at striker for the US after Balogun impressed with goals in the team’s most recent friendlies. Pepi has scored three times in eight appearances for PSV this season, with the most recent coming this past weekend.

Minimum of fuss. The team from Italy’s capital did, nonetheless, meet favourable opposition when placing theirEuropa Leaguebid back on track. There was a glaring gulf in quality between Roma and a Rangers side that has now lost a club record seven European games in a row.To their credit,Rangersat least huffed and puffed during a second half when capitulation felt the more likely option. However, the game was settled as a contest by then. Rangers remain rooted to the bottom of the Europa League, which should constitute an embarrassment to a club of this standing. Roma have eyes once more on making proper impact. Their only regret here was in not delivering a scoreline appropriately depicting men against boys.Europa League: Midtjylland dispatch Celtic as Nottingham Forest draw blankRead moreAmazingly, this marked only Roma’s second European joust with Scottish opposition since Fairs Cup business with Hibernian in 1961. The previous one, against Dundee United 23 years later, became overshadowed (to put it mildly) by the bribing of a referee. Back then, Scottish clubs could compete with the best in Europe. This season has seen the co-efficient plunge to a level that will soon have huge ramifications.Danny Röhl’s main quality so far as the Rangers support are concerned is that he is not Russell Martin. The latter’s ghastly spell as the head coach lasted 123 days in the early part of this season. Röhl, the new man at the helm, has shown promise albeit within a tiny sample size. The dugouts witnessed a generation game; Röhl is 36, his opposite number Gian Piero Gasperini is 67.Another element was far more striking as the teams lined up. Rangers’ glaring lack of height against the Italians looked ominous. This point was proven within 13 minutes as Bryan Cristante comfortably flicked on a corner at the near post. At the back, Matías Soulé burst forward to knock Roma in front. A Roma team minus the injured Evan Ferguson and Paulo Dybala, who have been criticised for bluntness despite reasonable results in this campaign, were delighted with their early advantage.View image in fullscreenMatías Soulé gives Roma a 13th minute lead.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersRangers should have levelled matters instantly. Instead, Youssef Chermiti screwed his shot wide after a mix-up in the Roma defence. Chermiti’s £8m purchase from Everton has piled pressure on the Rangers transfer hierarchy. He has at least the physical attributes to be an effective centre forward but appears unwilling or unable to use them.Roma dominated first-half possession thereafter. They doubled their lead through Lorenzo Pellegrini, whose curling shot into the bottom corner of Jack Butland’s net arrived after a lay off from Artem Dovbyk. Rangers will bemoan the fact Pellegrini stood in blissful isolation but it was a gorgeous finish. Ibrox, typically a raucous place on European nights, had been silenced nine minutes before the break. Even the boos which met the half-time whistle were timid; Rangers were simply in the process of being outclassed.The second period began against a curious backdrop. Those Rangers fans turned their attentions for the latest time towards the club’s chief executive, Patrick Stewart, and sporting director, Kevin Thelwell. Two banners, clearly sinister in tone, depicted the pair with targets on their faces. One wonders what the Rangers chairman makes of all this. After all, Andrew Cavenagh enjoyed an anonymous life as a successful businessman in the United States before fronting a takeover of this club. Paying punters have not turned on Cavenagh yet but there is a mutinous mood in the air. It is one which is easy to understand; Rangers’ leadership is wholly unconvincing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This actually triggered Rangers’ finest spell of the game, in which their substitute Thelo Aasgaard fired just wide. It was, however, difficult to determine Roma’s remaining attacking motivation until Zeki Celik was presented with a chance all of a yard out which he somehow hit up and on to the underside of the crossbar.That was it as far as meaningful opportunity was concerned. The raft of substitutions from both teams meant this game closed more in the fashion of a pre-season friendly than serious contest. This of course suited Roma fine. There was cause to ponder how on earth Rangers, finalists in this competition in 2022 and worthy of the quarter-finals a season ago, reached the point of making up the numbers.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueRangersRomamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Hoops’ hopes of prolonging theirEuropa Leaguecampaign into the knockout stages suffered a major blow as the Danes hammered in three goals in eight first-half minutes.The teenage substitute Callum Osmand won a late penalty which Reo Hatate converted, but the 19-year-old was then taken off on a stretcher in tears after suffering what appeared to be a hamstring injury on a horrible evening for the Scottish champions.Matías Soulé and Lorenzo Pellegrini on target as Roma outclass RangersRead moreCeltic actually had the first shot on goal after just 25 seconds, with Johnny Kenny firing straight at home keeper Elias Rafn Olafsson. It was Celtic’s only effort on target for the next 80 minutes. They were quickly under the pump. The former Rangers right-back Kevin Mbabu was denied twice by Kasper Schmeichel and Mads Bech Sørensen guided Osorio’s free-kick over the crossbar. The hosts came even closer when Philip Billing dummied a low cross for Cho Gue-sung, who forced a point-blank save from Schmeichel, with Anthony Ralston taking the rebound right in the face.Schmeichel, back on home soil a day after his 39th birthday, was at full stretch to tip a 20-yard volley from Pedro Bravo wide. But he could only hold back the tide for so long and the dam finally burst following the resulting corner. Celtic cleared the initial cross but Mikel Gogorza reached the byline again and his chip across goal was nodded in by Martin Erlic.Within two minutes,Midtjyllanddoubled their lead when Arne Engels and Ralston let Gogorza squirm in between them and whip a low drive past Schmeichel. It was three by half-time from a Sørensen long throw, the exciting Guinea-Bissau forward Djú collecting the second ball and curling his 18th goal of the season inside the far post.O’Neill threw on Osmand at half-time and the 19-year-old earned his side a penalty when he was brought down by Erlic. But Hatate’s spot-kick could not mask what was a chastening evening for Celtic, while Osmand’s late injury dampened the mood even further.“It was a tough evening, there’s no question about it,” said interim manager O’Neill.“We conceded two goals within a minute or 90 seconds of each other and the game goes away from you very, very quickly. They score a third and it’s a long way back. The goals that we conceded weren’t good. But in terms of European football, they’re a very fine side, there’s no question about it.”Nottingham Forestremain unbeaten away from home in the Europa League after they battled to a goalless draw withSturm Grazat the Merkur Arena. Sean Dyche also continued his undefeated start in Europe since he took over at Forest and ensured they took a point back to England after their2-0 victory over Portoin their last game in the competition.Forest spurned a golden opportunity to make their early dominance count when Morgan Gibbs-White had a first-half penalty saved by Oliver Christensen after Maurice Malone had a goal ruled out for offside.The second half turned into a scrappy stop-start affair as both sides failed to register a shot on target after the interval but Nicolás Domínguez was denied the winner in stoppage time by the crossbar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forest controlled the early proceedings in Austria and almost had the opener but Ryan Yates had a close-range header cleared off the line by Malic in the 17th minute.Sturm Graz thought they had taken the lead before the half-hour mark with their first foray forward. Otar Kiteishvili’s run put the Forest defence on the back foot and his strike was parried by John Victor into the path of Malone who tapped into an empty net but was marginally offside.Forest were given a chance to open the scoring from the penalty spot after Williams struck the ball off the hand of Emanuel Aiwu. Gibbs-White assumed the responsibility but his spot-kick was stopped by Christensen who went low to his left to keep it out.Dyche brought Gibbs-White off for the defender Murillo with 13 minutes to play as Forest set their stall out for a point away in Europe. Forest almost snatched victory at the end when Domínguez let rip with a firecracker outside the box but he was denied by the crossbar.Afterwards, Dyche expressed frustration that Forest could not take their chances. “Other than the penalty, the chances we had from set-pieces, some of those final moments where we just didn’t capitalise,” he said. “There were some really good performances.

So he was mightily relieved with the ease that his side dispatched AZ as an outstanding performance from Ismaïla Sarr reignited theirConference Leaguecampaign.The Senegal forward scored twice after Maxence Lacroix had given Palace the lead, even if Jean-Philppe Mateta endured one of his off-nights in front of goal as he missed an early penalty and several other gilt-edged chances. But with a testing trip to face Strasbourg – who are owned by the same company as Chelsea and rated like Palace as one of the favourites to win this competition – in their next match, only victory here would have sufficed and they showed a growing maturity given their inexperience at this level to get past youthful but talented opponents.“We looked surprised with AZ’s intensity at the start but then we started to dominate with our physicality,” said Glasner, whose side are ninth in the standings after three matches. “Winning is the most important thing in sport because you get so much confidence from it.”Matías Soulé and Lorenzo Pellegrini on target as Roma outclass RangersRead moreAfter being demoted to this competition from the Europa League by Uefa in the summer, Palace’s sense of injustice has been fuelled by this week’s fiasco over thescheduling of their Carabao Cup quarter-finalagainst Arsenal. The potential implications of having to play five matches in the space of 11 days in December due to that and their European commitments made this game even more important after a surprisehome defeat by the Cypriot side Larnacalast time out. With that in mind, Glasner made only one change fromPalace’s win over Brentfordon Saturday as Will Hughes replaced Daichi Kamada in midfield, while Adam Wharton was back on the bench after illness.AZ’s productive academy has made them European regulars in recent years and were knocked out by Tottenham in the last-16 of the Europa League in March despite winning the first leg at home. Around 1,600 of their supporters had marched through Croydon town centre before kick-off, with former Spurs striker Troy Parrott leading the line for the Dutch side who appeared more intent on attacking than Palace’s previous opponents in this competition.View image in fullscreenSven Mijnans rallies the visiting supporters after pulling one back.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersKees Smit – a flame-haired midfielder who was voted player of the tournament at the European Under-19 Championships in the summer – impressed throughout but it was Palace that seized control early on. A volley from Sarr that emanated from a long Jefferson Lerma throw struck the post and Sarr won a penalty moments later after being taken out by AZ goalkeeper Rome-Jayden Owusu-Oduro. The video assistant referee had to overturn an incorrect offside call but Mateta could not take advantage as his weak penalty was easily saved.Owusu-Oduro stretched to tip Sarr’s header on to the post two minutes later before Hughes hit the crossbar on the follow-up with a delicious dipping volley. A technical delay with the VAR meant Palace were forced to wait even longer for confirmation they had finally taken the lead. Lacroix lashed a shot into the net after Marc Guéhi’s cushioned header following another long throw, with the powers that be eventually deciding that the offside flag had again gone up incorrectly. Sarr made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time when another set piece caused chaos in the AZ penalty area after Guéhi won the initial header.Smit served warning that the visitors were still a threat when he was inches away from beating Dean Henderson at the start of the second half. Palace were guilty of surrendering possession high up the pitch to allow AZ to pull one back, with the captain, Sven Mijnans, sweeping home after Daniel Muñoz’s poor clearance. But a calm finish from Sarr restored the two-goal advantage within seconds after Mateta did brilliantly to play him through, only for the Frenchman to fluff his lines when a similar opportunity presented itself to him moments later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Isak Jensen could have made it a tense finish but somehow he headed wide from two yards out in stoppage time. Palace’s biggest test as the season progresses is likely to be how they cope with the incessant schedule of playing twice a week given Glasner’s reluctance to rotate his first-choice side. “I am a little bit tired but I’m happy to play games,” admitted Lacroix, who made his 18th appearance of the season. “If I can help the team, it’s perfect for me.”He will hope that this win will go a long way towards helping to seal a place in the knockout stages of this competition before Palace’s hectic December begins.Explore more on these topicsConference LeagueCrystal PalaceAZ Alkmaarmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The head coach sparked a major sideshow in October when hedid not select Bellinghamfor the friendly with Wales and the qualifier against Latvia.Bellingham was not in prime physical condition having returned to the Real Madrid squad after shoulder surgery only a couple of weeks before Tuchel’s announcement. It was nonetheless a bombshell call given Bellingham’s ability and status, with Tuchel doubling down on it when he said hemight have excluded himeven if he had been 100% fit.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Tuchel wanted to reward the players who ignited his tenure in September with thewin over Serbiain Belgrade – plus the homevictory over Andorra– when Bellingham was unavailable. He named the same initial squad, the injuries to Tino Livramento and Noni Madueke not withstanding, and the themes were faith and continuity; an attempt to build spirit and momentum. Inevitably, though, the move was interpreted as a slight on Bellingham, who had wanted and perhaps expected to be included.Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City’s Phil Foden to push for England recallRead moreThe Bellingham situation has stalked Tuchel and it is the main story in advance of his squad announcement. England face Serbia at Wembley next Thursday and Albania in Tirana three days later, havingguaranteed their place at the finalswith six qualifying wins out of six.The October camp featured convincing victoriesover Walesand Latvia and a part of the drama around Bellingham has taken in the notion of Tuchel holding his line about avoiding unenforced changes when things have gone well. Another detail is that there is only one more camp, next March, before Tuchel names his squad for the finals.It feels as if Tuchel has made his point about what is important and Bellingham will be expected to embrace the collective; the competition that the manager has repeatedly said is on. Tuchel has plenty of options in the No 10 position on top of Bellingham – namely Morgan Rogers, Eberechi Eze, Morgan Gibbs-White, Cole Palmerand Phil Foden. Palmer is injured and Foden was overlooked in October.There is an opinion in Spain that the Madrid manager, Xabi Alonso, brought Bellingham back into his starting XI too soon when he played him in the derby against Atlético on 27 September, which Real lost 5-2. Alonso promptly returned him to the bench for Madrid’s following two games which led into the October international window.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wolves want Edwards to succeed Vítor Pereira but after Gary O’Neil pulled out of advanced talks on Monday, Boro dismissed Wolves’s attempt to lure Edwards on Thursday afternoon.Edwards joined Boro in the summer on a three-year contract until 2028 and the club are adamant they want to keep him after leading them to third in the division. Wolves were hoping to tempt Edwards to swap a promotion charge for a relegation battle, with the Molineux club bottom of the Premier League after claiming just two points from their opening 10 matches.Wolves and particularly their executive chair, Jeff Shi, are longstanding admirers of Edwards, who previously played and coached at the club. Edwards also had a short spell in caretaker charge in 2016, shortly after Fosun, Wolves’ owners, bought the club. Wolves were willing to pay Boro compensation to extract Edwards from his contract.Boro are reluctant for Wolves’s interest in Edwards to descend into a saga and have acted quickly in an attempt to prevent the situation escalating.Edwards’s Boro side earned a stoppage-time 1-1 draw at Leicester on Tuesday and host Birmingham on Saturday. The 42-year-old former Forest Green Rovers, Luton and Watford manager will hold a pre-match press conference on Friday, with his future likely to dominate the discourse. After Tuesday’s draw, Edwards said of the links: “I’ve not paid any attention to it all myself. I’m just concentrating on my job here at Middlesbrough.”Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

It is understood there is no sense within Chelsea that Maresca gambled with his selection against Qarabag, rather that he has implemented a smart policy during the past two seasons that will aid player availability in the long run.Chelsea, who have changed their starting XI more than any other Premier League side this season, did not have a proper pre-season aftergoing all the way at last summer’s Club World Cupand have been hit by injuries to key players. Pedro Neto, Cole Palmer, Levi Colwill and Benoît Badiashile were unavailable against Qarabag and Maresca has said that Moisés Caicedo, Enzo Fernández and João Pedro have been playing with knocks.Maresca looked to manage his team’s workload by starting Caicedo and Fernández on the bench against Qarabag. The plan had to be scotched when Roméo Lavia was forced off with a thigh injury in the eighth minute. Caicedo was introduced and will be expected to start again when Chelsea, who flew back to London in the early hours of Thursday morning, host Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday.The 5,000-mile round trip to Azerbaijan presented complications for Chelsea. They arrived in Baku in the early hours of Wednesday morning and decided to stay on UK time because of the quick turnaround. However, there was no suggestion that the world champions did not take Qarabag seriously. Maresca had experience with Marc Cucurella and Reece James in the full-back positions, João Pedro lasting 71 minutes at No 10 and Robert Sánchez in goal.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca in Baku on Wednesday. He is said to work closesly with Chelsea’s five sporting directors over signings and squad rotation.Photograph: Aziz Karimov/ReutersIt became a difficult night for certain squad players. Jorrel Hato, the 19-year-old centre-back, had a poor game and Maresca removed the young, inexperienced trio of Andrey Santos, Tyrique George and Jamie Gittens at half-time.However, there is a recognition at Chelsea that their more inexperienced players will only adapt to Maresca’s demands if they are given regular opportunities. Gittens and Hato joined last summer and Santos, who arrived in January 2023, is in his first season as a first-team squad regular.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Indeed it would count against Maresca were he to chase short-term results by compromising the fitness of key players. The club’s strategy is to stay patient both in victory and defeat. His rotation will not alter that view.Such rotation aims to ensure players can perform at peak level at crucial moments. Maresca’s careful usage of James has kept the captain injury-free for a long period. The Italian is trying to work in a similar way with Wesley Fofana and Lavia.Results have been mixed for Maresca, who is coaching in the Champions League for the first time, when he rings the changes. Chelsea drew with Brentford when they rested players before visiting Bayern Munich in September. Equally they beat Ajax, Lincoln and Wolves when playing weakened sides.Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

He tells me that in the past 10 years the city has turned into a “magnet for dreamers, doers and visionaries, a launchpad where ideas take flight, where connections spark movements, where legacies are born”.I nod sagely, pretending to know what that means before clicking the X in the top right of the YouTube tab. The man in question is in fact the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, encouraging me and other leaders of industry to pay lots of money to attend the America Business Forum. The website tells me “America Business Forum comes to the United States for the first time” – which begs the question where they’ve held it previously. I’m no chief executive, I don’t keep a diary, but I’d have put America right up there as a location to hold a forum on American business.Joe Cole: ‘Anything which generates the money you get in football means the parasites come’Read moreIf you’re one of the first people to read this, well you could just about get a ticket, otherwise it’s too late – missed the chance to see the guy who set up WeWork tell us the wifi password, or see Rafa Nadal tell me how to grow my self-improvement podcast. The $10,000 early bird Diamond package “for those who lead change and want to be at the center of everything” was already sold out anyway. It’s tiring enough being the centre of my own existence, let aloneeverything.What in the Micky van de Ven does this have to do with sport anyway? Well, this was where the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino,announced his new big ideathis week: the “Fifa Peace Prize – Football Unites the World”.Gianni is on stage alongside one of the hosts; we are treated to a stirring montage of the last World Cup. “Qatar 2022: the most questioned World Cup in history,” begins the voiceover. “A tournament surrounded by doubt. Debate. And the weight of the world’s eyes, but when the whistle blew something changed. The noise turned into emotion, the controversy into connection. Under pressure,Gianni Infantinostood at the centre leading with resolve – proving that leadership isn’t about avoiding the storm, it’s about standing tall within it and as the world watched. The same World Cup became the most emotional, the most unifying, the most human of them all.”The room breaks out into healthy applause. That is certainly one review of Qatar 2022. Others might want to add a little more nuance.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino says he will reveal the first winner of his Fifa Peace Prize at the World Cup draw in Washington DC on 5 December.Photograph: Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images for America Business ForumAnyway on to theFifa“I Can’t Believe It’s Not The Nobel Peace Prize” peace prize.“Our motto in Fifa is that football or soccer unites and that it brings people together from the entire planet,” Infantino said. “When we see what is happening in our world today, which is a very divided world, we need to find more occasions to bring people together, because when these people come together, they speak to each other, they understand each other. We believe that peace in the world is something which is so important.“We have to support it because it’s about unity and we have to support anyone who is doing something special. So we thought we have to bring to life the Fifa peace prize. The first edition will be happening this year with the awarding on the 5th of December in Washington DC on the occasion of the draw for the World Cup, because we will have a global audience with 1 billion people watching the draw. This is the right platform to award somebody who has done so much or is doing so much for peace, because we need that. Football helps a little bit, but then we need leaders who push it into the goal.”Well now, does anyone know anyone who might in the market for a global peace prize? Anyone? Bueller? Anyone? Can I shock you? I like peace.Infantino went on to praise Donald Trump: “As far as I understand, president Trump was elected, in the USA, quite clearly elected, and when you are in such a great democracy as the United States you should first of all respect the results of the election,” says the man who –checks notes– has stood unopposed in Fifa elections twice, about the man –checks other notes– whose supporters mounted an insurrection against the results of an election. Where do you even start?

And while we’re on peace, has he given back his order of friendship medal from Vladimir Putin? And while we’re on Qatar, why has Fifaignored its own recommendationsand ruled out paying compensation to migrant workers who were harmed in Qatar? There are other questions.But it’s more extraordinary how any of this is happening. For good or bad, why is the guy who runs football preaching about fair elections and doling out peace prizes?Sometimes it is difficult to reconcile this game of perfect simplicity with its place in the world. In the past week it has delivered some moments of total beauty. Van de Ven powering past the whole of FC Copenhagen, Dan Burn turning his forehead into the outside of Roberto Carlos’s left foot,Hakan Calhanoglu lacing it to Piotr Zielinski, have prompted all manner of involuntary noises from this sofa. Without their brilliance, does football have this money, this influence? They shouldn’t be connected.How do we get from Neil Harris praising the lads for beating Brighton Under-21s in the Vertu Trophy to the Fifa president taking part in the Gaza peace talks in Egypt? What a weird ecosystem. Something as inconsequential as football probably shouldn’t have this level of importance – unless of course it brings about world peace.

As they made their way to the stadium, officers directed them to hold their protest in a caged basketball court.More than 700 police officers were in attendance, along with police dogs, police horses and a drone unit. A section 60 was also in place in parts of Birmingham, allowing officers to stop and search without the need to have reasonable grounds.West Midlands police said three people were arrested for racially aggravated offences and one for a breach of the peace. A man, 21, was also arrested for failing to comply with an order to remove a face mask and a boy, 17, for failing to comply with a dispersal order.The pro-Palestine protest outside Villa Park drew large numbers, with speakers including local independent MP Ayoub Khan, who told demonstrators “we will continue in our plight and in our fight to support the Palestinians who are being massacred”.Signs were also put up around the stadium which read: “No war games allowed. Zionists not welcome.” In videos posted online, protesters are heard chanting: “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Death to the IDF”.The Guardian also overheard an officer discussing the presence of members of the far-right and saw people swearing and gesturing at pro-Palestine demonstrators.1:06Protests outside Villa Park before match against Maccabi Tel-Aviv – videoUsman Rafiq, a 43-year-old GP and his wife, Uma Hani, a 40-year-old dentist, attended the protest with their three children.

Keir Starmer said the decision was wrong and opposition leader Kemi Badenoch branded it a “national disgrace”.The tension before the match led some schools to close early, Birmingham city council confirmed, with council staff working or travelling near the stadium asked to explore alternative arrangements.Policealso urged people to avoid the area where possible.Counter-demonstrator Jill Chant, 76, said she was shocked by the ban and came to the stadium to “protest against the antisemitism and the banning of Israelis from coming to Birmingham”. Her husband, Steven Chant, 79, wore a Maccabi shirt and said he believed the ban was “nothing to do with football, it’s all to do with sectarian politics – to be precise antisemitism”.Eran Hendler, 57, a hotelier from Tel Aviv and a Maccabi fan, described the ban on fans as “very strange” and said that decisions should be made for the majority, not an “extreme” minority.Hendler, who said he had felt safe in Birmingham, said: “Even to go to local competitions in Israel, in England, you can see that there are some extreme people who are not coming to watch the game, they are coming to make a mess.

He’s always working, you see him out there at the end of training, he’s always working to add to his game. I think he’s ­hungry and he’s an exciting player. That’s what I suppose I want to see on Saturday.“Marcus is someone I’ve met a couple of times out of camp in the last period. I think I want all the players to feel supported on the journey. It’s rare that anybody’s journey just goes in one direction and stays that way. Players always have bumps and their own corners to turn, that’s always part of the nature of it and I think the coaching team is there supporting our players.Quick GuideEngland team to face FijiShowM Smith (Harlequins); T Freeman (Northampton), O Lawrence (Bath), F Dingwall (Northampton), I Feyi-Waboso (Exeter); F Smith (Northampton), A Mitchell (Northampton); E Genge (Bristol, co-captain), L Cowan-Dickie (Sale), J Heyes (Leicester), A Coles (Northampton), O Chessum (Leicester ), G Pepper (Bath), B Earl (Saracens), C Cunningham-South (Harlequins).Replacements: J George (Saracens), F Baxter (Harlequins), A Opoku-Fordjour (Sale), M Itoje (Saracens, co-captain), T Curry (Sale ), H Pollock (Northampton), B Spencer (Bath), H Arundell (Bath).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Whereas a player is always selected for their club, sometimes that’s not quite the case here and the role changes. That produces challenges for us and in the environment because they all want to play, but I’d much rather it that way than the other way.”England scored four tries against the Wallabies but were only 10-7 up at half-time and it took Henry Pollock’s moment of magic to lift a decidedly flat ­Twickenham crowd after the interval. Borthwick lamented England’s failure to finish off tries having worked themselves into promising positions but believes his decision to recall both Smiths can sharpen his side’s attacking potency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think you see again we’ve got pace and power on the edges. I’m really hopeful there that we’ll see Marcus in space in unstructured opportunities, which I think everybody in the stadium is going to be excited when that ball comes into Marcus’s hand in a bit of space. Last week we had some of those opportunities, the players had a great attitude in some difficult conditions to go and take those opportunities in unstructured situations. Unfortunately, we didn’t convert them.”Borthwick explained his decision to omit Itoje from the starting lineup was due to an injury sustained by the captain against the Wallabies that prevented him from taking part in training until Thursday.The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, had urged Borthwick to rest Itoje at some point during the autumn on the back of an ­­exhausting season in which he led the Lions against the Wallabies and exceeded the mandatory game limit but the England head coach insisted he was not obliged to rest his captain.“Maro had a little knock, again nothing to any great extent, but it meant he couldn’t train the first half of the week,” said Borthwick. “I felt the right thing to do was to prioritise the combination that were training for the full week. That’s why I made the decision to put Maro on the bench. Player welfare is always paramount in my thoughts. We always work towards that.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamFiji rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The series moves to the Gabba on Saturday for the fifth and final match that Australia must win to square the ledger.Patel, the player of the match, probed with his deadly accurate left-arm offspinners that he sent down like darts. “In these conditions bowling wicket to wicket was the most important thing,” Patel said.Australia’s captain, Mitch Marsh (30), and his opening partner, Matt Short (25), played cameos at the top of the order to set up the run chase. “I thought walking off the ground that 167 was par on that wicket. India provided us with challenges with the bat,” Marsh said. “Fair play to India. They are a world-class team.”View image in fullscreenPlayer of the match Axar Patel.Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPAWith 91 runs needed from the last 10 overs, it was set up for Tim David to launch a typical assault, but he fell to a short ball by Shivam Dube, who had earlier picked up Marsh.Australia received a boost for the clash with Glenn Maxwell returning from a wrist injury, but it was not the superstar finisher’s night. Chakravarthy cleaned him up for just two.Maxwell had not played since mid-September after he injured a wrist in the lead-up to last month’s T20 series against New Zealand.When Washington Sundar (3-3) took two wickets in two deliveries with his offspin, including Marcus Stoinis, the match was India’s.Earlier, Australia fought back to restrict India to 8-167 after the visitors appeared to be on track for a huge total. The seamer Nathan Ellis (3-21) and the leg-spinner Adam Zampa (3-45) struck key blows after India were 2-121 and cruising at the end of 14 overs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a national team you are desperate to coach the players. You feel empty because after the second game you cannot have communication and you cannot keep working on improving things.”There will be significant pressure on Pochettino as the US host a men’s World Cup for the first time since 1994. But he believes the sport – which he said his bosses have told him to call “soccer” to avoid confusion with American football – has a healthy future in the US. He said that is partly thanks to his compatriot, Lionel Messi, who joined MLS’s Inter Miami in 2023.“I think players like Messi are helping the kids, not only when the kids want to play basketball or American football or baseball, they now want to play also soccer,” Pochettino said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brothers on Three, a new documentary about the team out this week, begins with scenes of wild joy from Houston, Texas in 2022, when the Black Knights beat St Mary’s, from California, to win their first US college title.And yet director Sean Mullin’s film is shot through with loss.There are losses, of course, on the field.Mullin and writer-producer Brian Anthony are West Point grads, rugby players too. They set out to follow their successors through the 2022-23 season, as they defended their title under captain and prop Larry Williams,2022 US player of the year. Things started well, with seven wins in a row. But then Navy, time-honored foes, beat Army 27-14. After that, Mullin’s cameras followed Coach Matt Sherman and his team as the wheels came off.‘Fight like heck’: US Eagles seek World Cup spot amid MLR turmoilRead more“I’ve been told that West Point rugby players get promoted to general at a much higher rate than their classmates,” Williams says, in the final film. “After winning that national championship. I thought I knew why, but I didn’t.“I realized that being a good leader isn’t about how much you win, it’s how you handle loss.”In one raw scene, in a film made behind doors normally closed, Williams is shown failing in that challenge. After a heavy defeat at Lindenwood in Missouri, in a locker room littered with mud and torn tape, Sherman asks his captain to speak. Williams searches for words that just won’t come.“I got nothing,” he mumbles.By the end of the movie, the team has lost its national crown — to Navy — and its captain, Williams suffering a bad ankle injury.After Lindenwood, Mullin also captures striking film of Conor Fay, blindside flanker and team poet (charged with composing odes for the bus and the bar), ear ripped and bloodied, gore leaching onto his shirt. Later, in the second of three punishing defeats by Navy, Fay makes a tackle and falls in evident pain.“Another fuckin’ knee,” Sherman exclaims, off camera. “Jesus.”Nobody said rugby, or West Point, was easy. But as the academy is an academic and physical pressure cooker, channeling brutal training and strenuous classroom standards, so Mullin and Anthony capture how West Point rugby takes tropes familiar from the world game — close bonds of brotherhood (or sisterhood), sometimes regrettable behavior, usually regrettable singing on the bus, pain shared and dealt in turn — and presents each in fierce relief.There are considerable ups, including an unlikely play-off win over Davenport and the exuberance of branch night, when fourth years, “firsties”, learn in what form of arms they will serve. There are considerable downs. The final defeat in the playoffs — by fuckin’ Navy, again — is dealt with quickly, as if just to get it done.Rugby is only a game. But what a game. Mullin shows why so many love it. There is pure adrenalin, raucous laughter and even ragged beauty in close-ups of tackles and kicks, rucks and mauls, straining scrums and leaping lineouts, pre-match huddles ending in shouts of “Brothers on Three!”View image in fullscreenThe West Point team salutes before a home game.Photograph: Courtesy of Brothers on ThreeBut Mullin’s film also looks beyond the field — where loss returns to the frame.Like Mullin, Ian Weikel graduated West Point in 1997. After 9/11, Mullin served at Ground Zero. Weikel went to Iraq. Mullin’s film includes footage from Weikel’s time in-country, explaining how to survive a convoy in the war of the IED. On 18 April 2006, in Balad, Weikel’s vehicle struck such a roadside bomb. He waskilled. He was 31.In other old footage, under the hum and crackle of old VHS, Weikel holds his infant son, Jonathan, or reads books for his boy to listen to when his father goes away to fight. There is footage of Weikel’s funeral at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, horses pulling the coffin on its artillery caisson. Over more VHS, of Weikel making a tackle at West Point, his widow speaks to camera.“Rugby meant so much to Ian,” Wendy Green says. “When I first met him, he said, ‘You gotta come to my rugby game. And I was like, ‘What is rugby?’ I went and I remember him coming to the sideline to me, sticking his tongue out and he just looked like this adorable puppy covered head to toe with mud and dirt. I was just smitten. I was like, ‘Okay, I love rugby.’ We fell in love.”Love runs through Mullin’s film too.Twenty-one Army rugby playershave died in service of their country. In the very first scenes of Brothers on Three, of the great night in Houston in ‘22, a big, bearded old player in Army cap and t-shirt congratulates hooker Matthew Meehan, shouting the name of the hooker in his own West Point team.“I’m class of ‘02,” the veteran says, beaming, showing a tattooed arm. “Jimmy Gurbiszwas killed in Iraq in ‘05. You left that jersey better than when you found it, brother.”Which is where I come in. In 2002, Gurbisz was part of a West Point team that toured to London, where they played against my club. Years later, from New York, I wrote apieceand then abookabout that team, about what happened to them in the wars after 9/11. Writing the book, I got to know the big, bearded veteran in Mullin’s movie: it’s Bryan Phillips, my opposite number in the second row 23 years ago. I met Mullin and Anthony too. On sidelines and in banqueting halls, at memorials, in screening rooms, we talked. And now, in the early scenes of their finished film, I’m there, onscreen, helping with the set-up: telling American audiences what this strange game is and why so many cadets love it and each other so much.So I can’t claim to be an impartial reviewer. Not even close. I was present for a ceremony that now forms one of the most poignant scenes in the film: the scattering of the ashes of Clint Olearnick, another ‘02 player, gone too young, on the West Point field on a blazing fall day. Mullin and his crew capture the silent contemplation of team-mates saying farewell to their brother. Clint’s widow, Diane, and daughter, Zosha, share in the bonds of his team.View image in fullscreenMichael Mahan discusses his career as West Point rugby coach.Photograph: Courtesy of Brothers on ThreeAnd yet, one great loss looms over all of Brothers on Three.Michael Mahangraduated West Point in 1970, commanded troops, made lieutenant colonel, came back up the Hudson to teach. He never played rugby but ended up coaching it, for16 seasonsall told, seeing the martial sport — “war minus the shooting”,saidGeorge Orwell — as the perfect vehicle to teach future leaders in combat.Last summer, at 76, Mahan died. His funeral was in Massachusetts. Old players came from all corners of America. Shots were fired over the grave.Mullin and Anthony dedicate their film to Mahan, giving him first and last words. Over the end credits, he explains his role in helping set up Women’s Army Rugby (WAR), a thriving varsity program. Next Friday, 14 November, his old players will gather again at West Point, for a screening of Brothers on Three and, next day, during the big game against Navy, the unveiling of a memorial statue.For everyone else, Brothers on Threepremieres in Los Angeles on Thursday, then plays at selected cinemas across the US.Martin Pengelly writes about rugby in the US atThe National MaulExplore more on these topicsRugby unionCollege sportsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The word went viral on social media and is often used to express people’s frustrations with, and distrust of, AI chatbots and platforms.Also a term of disapproval, the word “glaze” has gained traction this year, meaning to praise or flatter someone excessively or undeservedly.Another is “aura farming” – described as the deliberate cultivation of a distinctive and charismatic persona – essentially the art of looking cool.The term was popular with gamers but reached a much larger audience this year after the widely shared “boat kid” video that started a dance trend popular with celebrities including the American football player Travis Kelce.The owners of the biggest global technology companies, informally known as tech bros, were nicknamed the “broligarchy” after their high-profile attendance at Donald Trump’s inauguration, with the word also earning a place on the list.A rise in the use of the term “Henry”, an acronym for “high earner, not rich yet” was also named by Collins.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It signals a major shift in software development, where AI is making coding more accessible.“The seamless integration of human creativity and machine intelligence demonstrates how natural language is fundamentally changing our interaction with computers.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologyLanguageArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Alistof more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.Billions of dollars havepouredinto neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of awristbandthat allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.The wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released apaperlast month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.Advocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.Sceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.From a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram(EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.Some AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Apaperpublished in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Otherworksuggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.The hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example,saysAI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.The current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in theirinfancy– and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”Explore more on these topicsUnescoUnited NationsArtificial intelligence (AI)NeuroscienceComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It has now been nearly two years since the game was announced, and more than 12 years since the release of Grand Theft Auto V.“Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026,” reads Rockstar Games’s statement on X. “We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.”The long-anticipated game stars a romantically entwined pair of criminals named Jason and Lucia in Rockstar’s sun-bleached version of Miami, Vice City, and the wider Florida-like state of Leonida. It has been development at Rockstar North in Edinburgh, with assistance from the company’s other studios in New York and worldwide, since 2018. Its original release window was late 2025.It has been hoped that GTA VI would revive an ailing games industry, which has seen a contraction after a Covid-era boom. According to game publisher Take-Two’s most recent financial reports, its predecessor Grand Theft Auto V has generated $8.6bn since its 2013 release. Rockstar’s last game, the critically acclaimed Red Dead Redemption 2, was released in 2018 and reached $725m in sales over its opening weekend.Players, meanwhile, have had a very long time to look forward to Rockstar’s latest: even by the standards of the video games industry, where six-year development periods for blockbuster games are not unusual, the more than 12-year wait for Grand Theft Auto VI has been extensive.Explore more on these topicsGrand Theft Auto VIGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Probably not.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“If they start rolling out features that look more like they’re becoming a social media company than an online gaming company, then we will seek to capture them.”Theregime rulescreated by the government stipulate that services that have the primary purpose of enabling users to play online games with others are not age‑restricted social media platforms.My chilling week on Roblox: sexually assaulted and shat on as a child avatar roaming the online worldRead moreBut some critics suggested this is too limited for platforms that merge gameplay and social interaction. Niusha Shafiabady, an associate professor of information technology at Australian Catholic University, believes Roblox should be included in the ban.She pointed to the way the platform allows players to create content and interact. “It’s exactly like a contained social media platform,” she said.The independent MP Nicolette Boele urged the government to reconsider. “If the government’s plan bans some apps but leaves platforms like Roblox – described as a ‘paedophile hellscape’ – untouched, then we’re not protecting kids, we’re driving them into more dangerous, less regulated spaces,” she said.A spokesperson for the communications minister, Anika Wells, said the decision not to include Roblox under the teen social media ban did not mean it was exempt from its responsibilities under the Online Safety Act.A spokesperson for eSafety said it “has been able to extract important safety commitments from Roblox that will protect children from a range of harms including online grooming and sexual coercion”.By the end of the year, eSafety said Robloxwill be rolling outage-assurance technologies, not allowing adults to contact children without specific parental consent and making accounts private by default for those under 16.“After a child aged under 16 has gone through age estimation and has chat enabled, they will be unable to chat with adults,” the spokesperson said. “Parental controls will also be introduced to allow parents to disable chat for 13- to 15-year-old users, on top of existing protections for under 13s.”The agency has enforcement powers if companies such as Roblox do not comply with codes and standards for child safety, including penalties of up to $49.5m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said while Roblox had committed to stronger safeguards, “we as parents must still be vigilant to protect our children online”.“The eSafety commissioner and the government have a responsibility to do everything they can to keep our kids safe from the growing threat of online predators,” she said.A Roblox spokesperson said the platform was “committed to leading in safety through rigorous policies that go above and beyond what other platforms do”.“We use AI to check for violative content before a game is published, we do not allow users to share images or videos in chat, and we use advanced text filters designed to stop kids from sharing personal information,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRobloxAustralian politicsIndependentsAustralian GreensGamesSocial mediaChild protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

Shame it’s not here for longMatthew ReynoldsThu 6 Nov 2025 05.40 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 05.42 ESTShareAfter years of collaborations with Disney on Marvel and Star Wars, it’s finally happened: The Simpsons have arrived in Fortnite. Whereas most of these crossovers comprise themed skins and emotes, this is a complete takeover, with an entire stylised map based on Springfield to explore. It’s a smart way of introducing American TV’s longest-running sitcom to a younger audience – especially withnews of a second movie on the way– but for millennials, this is the culmination of a year-long campaign to catch our attention, if previous collabs with Power Rangers, Scream and Mortal Kombat are anything to go by.Though this could have been a quick ploy for those who grew up on a diet of afterschool BBC Two repeats to open their wallets, it’s no lazy cash-in. The familiar sights of Springfield you’d expect are here: there’s the Simpsons home on Evergreen Terrace, the sloping lawns of Burns Manor, and a town square with Moe’s Tavern and a statue of Jebediah Springfield, detachable head and all. Towards the edge of the map is the nuclear power plant, pumping cartoon steam into the sky, featuring meltdowns that you can avert by tapping a control console to the tune of “eeny, meeny, miny, moe”. Cletus’s farm and a Slurp factory (the game’s spin on Duff – no beer on tap here) sit on the corners of the island, and every match starts with a charming recreation of the show’s intro, complete with parting clouds, title card and iconic theme song, before you thank Otto as you leave the battle bus and descend on to the map.View image in fullscreenExcellent … Burns Manor in Fortnite’s The Simpsons season.Photograph: Epic GamesWe’ve had virtual depictions of Springfield before (though not for a while – the most recent were Tapped Out in 2012 andLEGO Dimensionsin 2015), but never rendered with this level of detail. Playing is like stepping into the animation. Springfield is on the smaller side as far as Fortnite maps go, and while it’s mostly as you’d imagine it, there is the odd quirk: the Hollywood-style Springfield sign is in the middle, not overlooking the town, and surely Springfield Gorge, centerpiece of memorable episode Bart the Daredevil, isn’t this close to the residential streets where Homer, Marge and Ned Flanders live.No matter: Springfield’s geography has always been a mystery, and what counts is that this dense recreation is a joy to explore. The secret to Fortnite’s map design over the years is its knack for making good use of the space between larger landmarks, and here it’s an opportunity to cram in references for longtime Simpsons fans to uncover, whether it’s stumbling upon a 33 cents storeor the forever-burning tire yard. Exploration is interrupted by optional quests with fun cameos, where a set of car keys can lead to a joyride at Homer’s behest, or picking up a ringing payphone results in a prank call to Moe’s. Encountering boss characters such as Krusty, who appear across the map, see Nelson briefly appear to let out his telltale “Ha ha!” upon their demise.There’s a lot packed in; after a dozen or so matches, I’m still making new discoveries. If there’s a fault, it’s that the map has to be played in competitive settings, the storm circle ever closing in and moving you on; I wish there was a way to explore slowly without the battle royale setup. Though Fortnite’s vibrant pop-culture collabs are always best approached as playgrounds and not digital museums, I’d like an exception to be made here, especially for new or lapsed players drawn in by the update. If that’s you, here are a few things you can do to survive long enough to enjoy it: play the less frantic “zero build” mode,turn on “visualise sound effects” in the settings menu to show player positions on-screen, and remember, there’s no shame in landing in the quieter spots of the map and letting others pick each other off first. Some of the best references are off the beaten path, after all.The Simpsons collaboration is a month-long pause between fuller seasons, and ends on 29 November. It’ll be a shame to see such a brilliant tribute disappear, and though old maps have returned before – the very first Fortnite chapter did in 2023,breaking concurrent player records– most disappear for good. But if one series has staying power, it’s The Simpsons. Here’s hoping for a movie-style comeback.Fortnite’sThe Simpsonsseason is out now until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsGamesThe SimpsonsFortniteAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They need not only immediate relief but long-term justiceThu 6 Nov 2025 13.53 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 14.29 ESTShareWhat future is there for Palestinians in Gaza? The announcement of the ceasefire brought profound relief, shaded by an equally deep sense of trepidation. Almost a month later, the picturelooks bleaker. The Israeli offensive abated, Hamas has returned the surviving hostages and the remains of some of those who have died, and Israel has released some Palestinian detainees and the remains of others.But more than 200 Palestinians, including children, have reportedly died in strikes that Israel says are in response to Hamas attacks. Thousands of bodies are still believed to be trapped beneath the ruins ­– debris which, it is estimated, would take a fleet of more than a hundred lorriesseven years to shift. Aid is flowing again, but remains wholly inadequate, with NGOs warning that Israel’s new registration system isobstructing delivery. Israeli demolitions continue in the half of Gaza that its forces still hold. Unicefwarnedthis week that the education system – in so far as it survives after two years of war and the destruction of more than 90% of school and university buildings – is on the brink of collapse. New babies are bornliterally in the rubble, to mothers who have neither homes nor working hospitals.Fears about maintaining the ceasefire have not disappeared. Mediators are discussing apotential dealto give Hamas fighters safe passage out of Israeli-held Rafah if they surrender their arms, in the hope of resolving a possible flashpoint. But a senior Qatari diplomat, Majed al-Ansari, pointed to a deeper risk when hespoke to the Guardianlast week: that Gaza slides towards a limbo of “no war, no peace”, in which deaths continue and reconstruction cannot occur.The ceasefire agreement was reached by deferring all the difficult questions. But the US is keen to press ahead with aUN security council resolutionmandating the establishment of an international stabilisation force. That will require agreement on multiple difficult issues: the force’s mandate and composition – Israel has rejected a role for Turkish troops – and its relationship with a Palestinian civil police force; US military leadership; details of Israeli military withdrawal, and of what happens to Hamas weapons and fighters.Donald Trump does not want “his” ceasefire to disintegrate and has long hoped to expand the Abraham accords of his first term, normalising relations between Israel and more Arab states. That appears unlikelywithout stepstowards a better deal for Palestinians. Notably, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, will make arare visit to the USlater this month.But though much of what happens in the world is now dictated by the whims of the US president, it would be wrong to see the ceasefire as a random gift from Mr Trump. It reflected the growing international outrage at a genocidal war, led by the public, with governments dragged along behind. Gaza has now slipped back down the agenda. Germany was quick to suggest thatit would lift restrictionson arms exports to Israel which it applied only in August.Israelstill resists allowing international journaliststo enter Gaza. Public attention must be maintained to sustain Mr Trump’s interest, persuade him to press Israel to comply with the existing agreement, and ensure that further steps do not utterly betray Palestinians. Only sustained pressure can hope to bring anything approaching justice and lasting peace to the region. Palestinians need not only food, but a future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We need to keep calling it outThu 6 Nov 2025 12.22 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.38 ESTSharePack your bags and flee, infidels: New York City has fallen to a cabal of socialist jihadists. WithZohran Mamdanito become the city’s first Muslim mayor, many are celebrating the democratic socialist’s historic win. Billionaires, Islamophobes and Republicans, however, are in the throes of hysteria. But what’s new? The New York mayoral race has been marred by bigotry so unhinged it’s almost impossible to parody.Far-right activist and unofficial Trump adviser Laura Loomerposted on X, for example, that “there will be another 9/11 in NYC” under Mamdani. New York City councilmember Vickie Paladino called the 34-year-old a “known jihadist terrorist”. Actor Debra Messing, meanwhile, has been having a Mamdani-inducedmeltdownon Instagram, posting story after story about how the puppy-eyed politician is a threat to civilization. Sherecently posted: “In Judaism and Christianity, we are commanded to speak the truth. In Islam, they are commanded to lie if it means spreading Islam … Now, take a look at Mamdani … He’s revealing their goal: mass conversion.”In an era of ever-diminishing bipartisanship, Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreementZohran MamdaniMamdani’s goal, as he has made almost comically clear, is actually affordable mass transit and housing. One of the reasons his campaign was so successful is that it stayed laser-focused on affordability. However, Mamdani has addressed the attacks against him on a number of occasions, noting how common it is for Muslims to be branded as terrorists. And, it’s not just Muslims, I should note. Islamophobes don’t tend to differentiate between a Muslim of Indian descent who was born in Uganda, like Mamdani, and a Palestinian atheist like me. They don’t care if you’re a Christian Arab or even aSikh. We’re all the same to them: brown barbarians.The incoming mayor has also called out how just how normalized Islamophobia is on both sides of the aisle. A couple of weeks ago Mamdani released asix-minute videoaddressed to Muslim New Yorkers in which he talked about how Andrew Cuomo “laughed and agreed when a radio show host said that I would cheer another 9/11”. He talked about how outgoing mayor Eric Adams said Mamdani and his followers wanted to “burn churches”. And he stated: “To be Muslim in New York is to expect indignity. But indignity does not make us distinct – there are many New Yorkers who face it. It is the tolerance of that indignity that does. In an era of ever-diminishing bipartisanship, Islamophobia has emerged as one of the few areas of agreement.”Amen to that. Islamophobia is so normalized that’s it’s not even seen as bigotry by many but, as conservative commentator and former Fox News host Megyn Kelly recently put it, “a sensible position”. It’s so normalized that trafficking in Islamophobia is not career-ending, but often career-elevating. Making breathtakingly racist comments about Muslims certainlydidn’t stop Randy Finefrom winning a special election earlier this year to represent Florida’s sixth district in Congress. Fine, by the way, is now leading a push to investigate Mamdani’s path to US citizenship in an attempt todenaturalize and deport him.And Islamophobia hasn’t hurt the career ofShaun Maguire, a partner at the influential venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. In July, Maguire, who has a well-documented history of making inflammatory statements, posted on X that Mamdani “comes from a culture that lies about everything. It’s literally a virtue to lie if it advances his Islamist agenda. The West will learn this lesson the hard way.” Sequoia didn’t take action against him, citing a policy of “institutional neutrality”. In the end, the only person to lose their job was Sequoia’s female COO. Sumaiya Balbale, a practising Muslim quit after Maguire’s comments;the Financial Times reportedthat she felt her position was untenable.In the US, Muslims make up onlyabout 1%of the adult population. Media coverage, therefore,disproportionately affectspeople’s views of Muslims and support for anti-Muslim policies. And there is a huge body ofresearchdemonstrating the extent to which the mainstream media in the US has dehumanized Muslims. One2018 studyby Middlebury researchers, for example, found that Muslims were the most negatively portrayed minority in America, “principally due to reporting on foreign conflict zones”.The reason that someone like Cuomo was so comfortable insinuating that Mamdani was a terrorist sympathizer throughout the election is because the media has embedded the idea that all Muslims are terrorists. A 2019 analysis media coverage found that between2008 and 2015terror attacks carried out by Muslims received more than 350% more coverage in the US media than terror attacks committed by non-Muslims. That’s even though attacks by non-Muslims (largely white supremacists) were more prevalent during that timeframe.Mamdani refused to compromise on his values – and was rewarded for it | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreThe mainstream media’s peddling of Islamophobia doesn’t just help politicians run racist campaigns; it helps them pass racist policies. There’s a direct link between the dehumanization of Muslims in the mainstream media and Trump’s Muslim ban. A direct link between decades of the media portraying Muslims as terrorists and US complicity in thegenocide in Gaza. While it’s easy to call out the Laura Loomers of the world and their crass Islamophobia, it’s respectable Islamophobia that’s more insidious. The framing of newspaper headlines; the choice of which stories to cover; the way in which prestigiousWall Street Journaland New York Times columnists will casuallycompare Arabs to bugs and insects.The New York mayoral election may be over now, but the racism andIslamophobiaunderpinning it aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. However, Mamdani’s victory does provide a glimmer of hope. The first step in solving a problem is addressing it. And Mamdani has been steadfast in calling out Islamophobia and forcing people to confront it. During his victory speech, Mamdani mentioned the Islamophobic attacks against him once again, and rejected the cynical attempts by his detractors to pit Jews against Muslims.“[W]e will build a city hall that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of antisemitism,” Mamdani said. “Where the more than 1 million Muslims know that they belong – not just in the five boroughs of this city, but in the halls of power. No more willNew Yorkbe a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.”Inshallah.Explore more on these topicsIslamophobiaOpinionIslamReligionZohran MamdaniUS politicsNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

The ruling upheldlaws in 27 states, all of them passed since 2021, which banned the treatment outright; according to theHuman Rights Campaign, about 40% of trans minors live in states where treatment for them is against the law. Now, the Trump administration seems to be looking to cut off access to care for the other 60% of those kids.Ina proposed ruleleaked to NPR, the administration plans to ban gender-affirming care for minors from being covered by Medicaid or by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or Chip. In a second, more sweepingproposed rule, the Trump administration looks to ban hospitals, clinics and providers from receiving any Medicaid or Medicare reimbursements at all if their practice provides transition-related pediatric care.If enacted, the orders – which NPR reports are scheduled for a rollout in early November – would dramatically reduce the number of providers able to treat trans teens, even in states where the care remains legal. Unable to keep their practices financially viable without reimbursements for care provided to Medicare andMedicaidrecipients, the majority of medical professionals currently treating trans kids with puberty blockers, hormones or affirming forms of psychotherapy would be forced to stop providing such treatment. The result would be a back-door ban on transition-related care for minors nationwide: even in states that have not passed laws banning the care, like the one upheld in Skrmetti, trans teens and their families – even those are able to pay for the care – would not be able to find a doctor willing to help them.The exclusion of Planned Parenthood from Medicaid means that clinics are shutting their doors even in Democratic-controlled statesThe move is remarkably similar to one that the Trump administration and their allies have pursued with respect to abortion access. After the supreme court’s 2022 Dobbs decision allowed states to ban abortion, Republicans placed a provision in last summer’s budget reconciliation bill that excluded Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, from receiving Medicaid reimbursements; the ban was laterallowed to proceedby an appeals court. Abortions themselves are already almost entirely banned from Medicaid reimbursement; the bill went further, as the Trump administration’s proposed order on gender-affirming care does, by saying that no practice that provides such treatment can receive Medicaid reimbursements for any care that they give.The exclusion of Planned Parenthood from Medicaid means that clinics areshuttingtheirdoorseven in Democratic-controlled states where the procedure remains legal, making it much, much more difficult for women to end their pregnancies and restricting access to the care nationwide.Technically, neither of these moves bans the targeted care: under the proposed trans care rules, and under the current Planned Parenthood Medicaid ban, none of the disfavored medical care is technically illegal under federal law, and states retain the option of allowing it. But just because something is technically legal does not mean that it is actually accessible: both of these policies function to place the medical care that gives these groups dignity, safety and control over their own lives out of their reach.The proposed exclusion of youth gender-affirming care providers from Medicaid and Medicare, and the continuing exclusion of abortion providers from Medicaid, point to one of the Trump administration’s more perverse strategies for punishing disfavored groups and accumulating power: the weaponization of the welfare state.Medicare and Medicaid were implemented to provide dignity and compassion to the nation’s elderly and impoverished. However flawed and partial these programs are their actual implementation, they are based on the principle that the state can improve the lives of its citizens, that it can catch those who fall prey to age or poverty, and recognize their membership in the American community with care. Above all, such welfare programs are tools of equality: they give Americans a degree of the dignity and freedom that are prerequisites to democratic citizenship. They prevent the kind of inequality that makes a farce of pretenses to republican government.Now, with the exclusion of certain kinds of care from these programs, the Trump regime has inverted Medicare and Medicaid into handmaids of inequality, wielded to degrade, humiliate, marginalize and punish certain Americans on the basis of their sex and gender.The US supreme court appears ready to nullify the Voting Rights Act | Moira DoneganRead moreIt is a playbook that the Republican right is using more and more. Under John Roberts, the supreme court has long been a fan of using statutes and constitutional amendments that were meant to mitigate racial inequality – like the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th amendment – for ends opposite to those of the lawmakers’. This is why it is on the basis of a scurrilous claim of racial discrimination against white and Asian students that the court could bar race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and universities that are meant to more fairly distribute educational opportunities among Black youth. And it is why this spring, in a 14th amendment race discrimination case brought by “non-African-American” (read: white) voters inLouisiana, the court will almost certainly gut what remains of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.The Trump administration has followed the court’s lead, subverting civil rights laws meant to curb inequality in order to entrench it instead. Of particular note is the Trump administration’s weaponization of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act against colleges and universities where students have staged pro-Palestinian and anti-genocide protests. The Trump administration has sought to marginalize pro-Palestinian speech and punish schools that do not crack down on it withfalse allegationsof antisemitism leveled at these universities under the civil rights law. Using these lawsuits and threats of withdrawals of federal funding, the Trump administration has been able to not only ensure crackdowns on disfavored minorities, but ensure muchbroader changesat many targeted institutions to hiring, curriculum and admissions policies.The welfare state, and the civil rights legal regime, have long been targets of the right; now, they have become their perverse tools, paths that the far right takes into Americans’ personal lives and most essential institutions in order to enforce a narrow, prescriptive and exclusive set of cultural values, namely white supremacy, sexism and a virulent transphobia. Those of us on the left will have to grapple both with the future of the welfare state and with the role of civil rights laws in a post-Trump world: as potent as these tools have been for ensuring a degree of dignity for Americans, they have also proved potent avenues for oppressing them.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS healthcareOpinionUS MedicareMedicaidTrump administrationAbortionTransgenderGendercommentShareReuse this content"

That era appears overThu 6 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.43 ESTShareIn October,millions ralliedacross America to remind Donald Trump that this nation obeys no kings. Last week, however, a scene worthy of Versailles unfolded: While Trump built his$300m ballroom, the US prepared to face widespread hunger.With Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) funding scheduled torun drydue to the government shutdown, the Trump administration not only refused to prevent the crisis – itfought in courtto deprive 42 million Snap recipients of their grocery money. Thankfully, a federal judge ruled against the government andorderedthat Snap payments proceed. On Monday, the administration said it wouldfund just halfof recipients’ typical benefits. And2.4 millionpeople soon risk losing their benefits nonetheless, as the$186bnSnap cuts in Trump’s benighted budget bill begintaking effect.America has always faced hunger, yet its leaders have long shown some responsibility to help poor people meet their most basic nutritional needs. That even this small measure of decency is seemingly a thing of the past signals the dawn of an unprecedented era of cruelty.Snap, or food stamps, is one of the core provisions of the nation’s frayed social safety net. Over12%of the population receives Snap benefits to buy groceries, and the program is available only to those whose net household income lands them at or below thefederal poverty line. For a family of four, that’s just$32,150per year.While top Republicans have insisted that safety net programs are abused by healthy young men who prefer playingvideo gamesto holding down a job, most Snap recipients are excluded from the workforce by age or ability – approximately 40% of recipients arechildren, while another 30% are over 60 years old or have adisability. Many of the remaining able-bodied and working-aged Snap recipientswork, as even a full-time job offers no guarantee of lifting a household out of eligibility. Walmart and McDonald’s supersize their profits in part by offering wages so low that, as of 2020, both companies ranked among the topemployersof Snap recipients.Since the shutdown began last month, the Trump administration hascontortedmilitary budgets to fund service members’ salaries, and accepted apossibly illegal$130mdonation,reportedly from the Republican megadonor Timothy Mellon, to bump the payroll stores. But despite sitting on a $5bn Snap contingency fund,the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) insistedthat it lacked the authority to use this cash.It’s a patently disingenuous argument. Just weeks ago, the agency’s websitefeatureda shutdown plan outlining its intention to use the emergency chest to keep Snap afloat. But the information was scrubbed from the site, as, in hopes ofpressuringDemocrats to end the shutdown, Republicans decided to play a game of chicken that jeopardized 42 million people’s ability to eat. On Tuesday, 25 statessuedthe USDA to force the agency to fund Snap. The Rhode Island district court judge John J McConnell Jr saw through the government’s flimsy claim andorderedon Friday that the USDA tap its contingency cash.The White House budget office issued no immediatecommentto the New York Times on this setback in its efforts to deprive Americans of food. However, the president did post somestriking photosof his all-marble Lincoln bathroom renovation to Truth Social.The ruling, and the administration’s Monday announcement, are sure to offer some relief to Snap users. But for those targeted by Trump’s cuts to the program, hunger still looms. Most refugees, asylum seekers, human trafficking survivors, and other non-green card-holding legal immigrants are set tolose their payments. If they turn to food pantries – newly stripped by the Trump regime of$500min federal funding – they’ll find that even these venues of last resort arebucklingunder rising need. Snap’s work requirements will also now apply to groupspreviously exemptfrom them, including unhoused people, veterans, and young adults who’ve aged out of foster care.The idea that people out-of-work do not deserve to eat runs contrary to the original purpose of food stamps, which werefirst introducedduring the mass unemployment of the Great Depression. As late as the early 1970s, the simple moral mandate to feed the hungry carried a degree of bipartisan cachet. John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnsoninauguratedthe modern food stamps program, but Richard Nixon expanded it, and evenvowedto “put an end to hunger in America.”Under Ronald Reagan, however, Republican antipathy towards food stamps took on itsnow familiar form. Reagan named food stamps among the misbegotten spoils of his infamouswelfare queen, andwarnedof “strapping young bucks” using the program to buy T-bone steaks. Hetosseda million recipients from the rolls his first year in office.Today, Reagan-style demonization of the poor lives on inNewsmax segmentsthatfalselyclaim most Snap recipients are immigrants, and in viral but entirely fictionalAI-generated videosof Black women raging about losing their benefits. Concerns about luxury purchases have also persisted. In 2015, Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin,signed offon a measure that attempted to prevent Snap users from buying shellfish. Heaven forbid a low-income family cook shrimp scampi.Decades of punitive and dehumanizing deeds and rhetoric have apparently convinced the Trump administration that it can condemn millions of Americans to hunger without facing devastating political consequences. However, as the White House attempted to abandon the nation it’s tasked with safekeeping, other institutions and individuals rallied to help their communities fend off hunger.VirginiaandDelawaregovernors Glenn Youngkin and Matt Meyer promised that their states would fund Snap benefits for residents throughout November. Many other states pledged emergencysupportto food banks. And in local Facebook groups, strangers paired off as “grocery buddies”, with one helping the other buy food.Still, emergency measures and good deeds are not a long-term solution, particularly for those whose benefits are on the chopping block. As Joel Berg, CEO of the non-profit Hunger Free America,wrote for the Nationthis week, progressives should push for a full slate of social and financial reforms to ensure that Americans are able not just to “get by but actually get ahead”. Until then, far too many Americans will continue to live on a precipice, their next meal determined by White House whims.Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and a contributor to theWashington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS federal government shutdown 2025US federal government shutdownsFood banksFood povertycommentShareReuse this content"

AcrossTikTok,Instagramand X, his ads have racked up tens of millions of views, turning his charismatic potential into an electoral earthquake that has shaken the foundations of the Democratic party. Many politicians on both sides of the Atlantic will be asking: what is his secret formula?For me, the answer is clear. Since I was only 14, I’ve been an online leftwing commentator, building a platform of more than 700,000 followers on Instagram with no money or institutional backing. On social media, radicalism isn’t a potential liability – it’s your strongest selling point. This is a reality that the most adept politicians – from Mamdani toDonald Trump– understand very well. Above all else, what matters online is your authenticity and commitment to standing by the things you believe in, no matter how many outraged headlines they may produce.When the New York Post criticised Mamdani for being toosupportive of Palestinian human rights, it might have thought this would be his undoing. But screenshots of their headlines were used by me and many others to rally support online, where standing up for Palestine is a badge of honour and sensationalist smears from the billionaire-owned press only serve to validate a person’s position as a defender of the voiceless.Mamdani’s victory is a rebuke to the failed strategies of the Democratic party | Moira DoneganRead moreMamdani’s team has produced more than a few hit ads, featuring him interviewing ordinary people on the street, celebrating withNew York Knicks fansafter a basketball game and shopping at a bodega. No matter the given backdrop, Mamdani was always surrounded by ordinary people going about their lives, as he draws out the joy in every day, relatable moments.Mamdani’s social media success is also built on an army of unofficial supporters in the background, pumping out thousands of TikTok edits, funny tweets and hit memes that disarmed many of the attack lines in the mainstream press. Young people filmed themselves smiling on the streets ofNew Yorkwith captions such as “visiting the Islamic people’s republic of NY” alongside trending Arabic songs. Crucially, none of these trends would have been so popular had Mamdani not excited a wave of new voters through his central policies of rent freezes, free buses and support for the Palestinian people.And in the UK, there’s evidence this message might be catching on in the form of the new Green party leader, Zack Polanski. An ad starring Polanskiwalking through the streets of Leeds, talking about wealth inequality and “the politics of hope”, recently amassed some12m views on X.He also knows how to cultivate his online audience, hosting an array of leftwing internet personalities on his new podcast,Bold Politics, and taking progressive stances on everything from Palestine to nationalising the water companies.All of this poses problems for those in the centre. You can’t, as many hope, have the Mamdani “social media strategy” without Mamdani’s appealing socialist politics. Technocratic policies such as freezing personal tax thresholds aren’t going to cut through on social media. And while many in the centre might argue that eye-catching, social-media-friendly policies are often divisive and unfeasible, perhaps the most unrealistic thing of all in an age of extreme inequality and collapsing living standards is more business as usual.The right certainly seems to think so. Trump’s rhetorical style and bellicose tweets may be charismatic on their own, but Republicans know they can’t exist without the radical, authoritarian policies that come with it. The online right both amplifies and, interestingly, generates policy ideas. Rightwing politicians have happily utilised the informal ecosystem of social media communities and creators, adopting policies from online grassroots conservative movements, no matter how conspiratorial or outlandish they may seem at the time. After all, the idea that the UK should have atotal freeze on all non-essential immigration– legal or otherwise – was once just a fantasy of the online, fringe right; today it is the policy of the party leading the polls in Britain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s a question of who will change it.” Today, Mamdani becomes one of those people.People are so fed up with the status quo that they opt for anything but continuity. ButDemocratsand most democratic parties worldwide have shied away from offering real alternatives. This has pushed voters into the arms of the extreme right, even fascist forces. Mamdani set out to break their monopoly over visions for a different future – and won a resounding and historic victory. The last time this many voters turned out to vote for a mayor in New York City was in 1969.Democrats everywhere have a lot to learn from Mamdani’s astounding success. Centering his campaign on making life affordable again, Mamdani won because he offered hope. He won because he demonstrated that democratic representatives can stand up for their constituents’ most basic material interests. This restores democracy’s promise. As fascist movements gain ground globally, his victory provides something desperately needed: the beginning of an antifascist economic program that can win back people who have lost faith in democracy itself.Mamdani’s playbook is deceptively simple: ensure all New Yorkers can afford essentials. A rent freeze on stabilized apartments paired with building 200,000 new affordable units. Free bus rides. Universal childcare from six weeks to five years. Pilot programs for city-run grocery stores in food deserts. Higher taxes on millionaires and corporations to pay for it all. That is the platform that mobilized a record-number of canvassers to knock on doors for Mamdani and propel him to victory.It’s clear why Zohran Mamdani is leading in the New York mayoral race | Margaret SullivanRead moreCritics dismiss this as pie-in-the-sky socialism. But what they’re really objecting to is more fundamental: the idea that democratic governments should guarantee people’s basic needs, even if it means intervening in markets. What I call economics of essentials recognizes that housing, food, transportation and childcare aren’t ordinary commodities. When their prices surge, they trigger redistribution shocks that push vulnerable people to society’s margins.New research I’veconductedwith colleagues reveals which prices matter most for inequality. We found that a small set of essential sectors – energy, food and agriculture, healthcare, chemicals, housing and wholesale trade – have a disproportionate capacity to trigger redistribution when prices surge.The poorer you are, the more you spend on basics. When prices of essentials jump, the bottom income decile experiences much higher inflation impacts than the top decile. A petroleum price shock hits the poorest Americans with a 54% higher increase in inflation than for the wealthiest 10%. For farms and food products, the gap is starker still at 126%.Meanwhile, as weshowin our research the profit windfall delivered by price explosions in essentials goes predominantly to the rich. For the case of record fossil fuel profits in 2022 brought about by a spike in oil and gas prices, 50% went to the richest 1%, only 1% to the bottom 50%.Guaranteeing affordable prices of essentials, as Mamdani pledged, tackles inequality without pitting one group against another. There’s no conflict between unemployed and low-wage workers, people in working-class jobs and underpaid professionals, different racial or religious communities. Public services like free buses and childcare are accessible to all. It’s based on universality rather than exclusion – an economic agenda that unites people rather than dividing them into competing groups.Public options for essentials are a form of price stabilization benefiting everyone, not just direct users. Our research shows substantial overlap between sectors that matter most for inflation and inequality. Policies preventing price shocks in essential sectors serve double duty: containing inflation risks while preventing sudden inequality increases. This is in direct contrast with conventional monetary policy – raising interest rates – which actively exacerbates inequality through higher debt costs for the poor and suppressed wage growth.During the 2024 campaign, Joe Biden denounced corporate price gouging in his State of the Union speech, then did nothing. Kamala Harris proposed a federal ban on price gouging by food suppliers, then backed away under pressure from the same quarters now attacking Mamdani. This equivocation opened the door for Trump’s return. When Democrats offer no solutions to existential crises, voters conclude the system can’t help them. The far right does name their suffering, even if the solutions are lies wrapped in bigotry.Mamdani’s agenda treats affordability of essentials as democratic obligation, not market efficiency. The rent freeze doesn’t pretend markets will solve the housing crisis alone. The pilot grocery stores don’t assume private retailers will serve communities they have written off as unprofitable. Free transit doesn’t wait for philanthropy.This is antifascist economics – not opposing any particular party, but addressing the material conditions that make fascism appealing. It’s a program restoring universal dignity rather than fueling divides and blaming scapegoats for the crisis. Democratic parties everywhere face versions of the choice American Democrats confronted in 2024: equivocate on bold economic intervention and watch voters embrace authoritarians, or fight for policies that materially improve lives.Strategic price interventions to protect people’s basic needs, public options for essentials, aggressive investment in affordable housing and childcare – these are democracy insurance. They demonstrate that democratic governments can deliver tangible improvements. They offer hope for a livable life, the most powerful antidote to fascist despair.It’s about reinstating democratic representatives’ basic responsibility: ensuring constituents can meet fundamental needs by all means necessary – including challenging the laws of free markets. This democratization of economic policy, putting essentials before profits, can counter extreme-rightwing threats not only in New York but in democracies worldwide.If that sounds radical in 2025, it speaks to how far we’ve drifted from democracy’s core promise. The cost of inaction is measured not just in economic insecurity, but in the space created for authoritarianism to flourish. We’ve seen how this story ends. The question now is whether we’ll learn from history – or watch it repeat itself.Mamdani’s victory is a much-needed step in the right direction.Isabella Weber is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and author of a forthcoming book on antifascist economicsExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionDemocratsNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

Well before the result was called on Tuesday night, weeks of reliable surveys had already suggested his victory inNew York City’s mayoral race, by a nine-point margin over former New York governorAndrew Cuomo, would be a foregone conclusion ⁠– an extraordinary finish for a man unknown to the vast majority of New Yorkers when he launched his run just over a year ago. The campaign that followed was one of the greatest in American history.True as it may be that both Cuomo and incumbent mayorEric Adamswere deeply flawed candidates marred by scandal, it was by no means inevitable that Mamdani would be the leading candidate against them. ⁠As recently as February, Mamdani was polling at 1% in the Democratic primary, well behind a slew of challengers with more name recognition, moreexperienceand deeper roots in city politics. They were defeated by an ever-growing army of volunteers ⁠– 90,000 by the summer ⁠– led substantially by organizers from the Democratic Socialists of America. Early in the campaign, it was a given to many commentators that anopenly leftist campaignfor the mayorship of the world’s financial capital would face impossible headwinds. In Tuesday night’svictory speech, Mamdani opened with a quote from Eugene Debs. Perexit pollingfrom CNN, nearly one in four New Yorkers who went to the polls described themselves as socialists.A note to politicians hoping to emulate Mamdani’s social media strategy: without the right policies, it’s pointless | Rohan SathyamoorthyRead moreAs contested as the definition of socialism remains, Mamdanioffered up a version of itNew York’s voters clearly liked. Free buses, free childcare, higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations ⁠– the critical test now of course, as we are being reminded hourly by those who hope he fails ⁠– will bewhether he can actually deliveron these things and more.Fortunately, Mamdani’s campaign has also given us some reason to suspect, beyond his bright and blazing charisma, that he might have the makings of a hard-nosed administrator. Threading the needle on policing, meetings with the business community, taking in new ideas on housing, all while retaining the support and enthusiasm of a progressive base ⁠– all of this was a preview of the balancing act Mamdani will have to do if he wants to succeed where recent progressive mayors and a long line of frustratedNew YorkCity reformers haven’t.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani after taking the stage to speak after winning the Democratic primary for mayor at an election night watch party in Long Island City, New York, on 25 June.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianWhatever he manages to accomplish as mayor, much of potentially national significance can be learned from his candidacy alone.

But the very same can be said about cities such as Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Detroit ⁠– among the swing-state urban areas where maximizing Democratic turnout and vote share is critical to winning both state races and the electoral college. Last year,Donald Trumpmade gainsinallthreeon his way to very narrowly winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan ⁠and the presidency ⁠– thanks in large part to increases in support from working-class minorities and young men.Mamdani’s mayoral race was marred by unhinged Islamophobia. It’s not going away soon | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBoth are constituencies where Mamdani rapidly and remarkablybuilt strengthover the course of the year ⁠– beating Cuomo by nearly 40 points with men under 30 and by double digits in some minority neighborhoods Cuomo had initially won during the primary. One of the firstpieces of mediahis campaign released was a video of Mamdani doing man-on-the-street videos asking young people, people of color, and immigrants why they either did or didn’t votefor Trump.The answers given ⁠–affordability,Gaza, distrust in the system – were obviously the ones the campaign wanted viewers to hear. But the video’s approach, treating voters to be won with an openness and friendly curiosity rather than hostility or pontifications from on high, was instructive. It demonstrated ⁠– performed, perhaps ⁠– a willingness to listen and learn lacking among moderate pundits and Democrats already making pronouncements that what Mamdani has been able to accomplish tells us nothing whatsoever about what Democrats elsewhere might.That attitude is reflective of the confidence and self-satisfaction that blinded New York’s politicos to the viability of Mamdani’s campaign to begin with ⁠– a disposition leading Democrats and their operatives refuse to be shaken from even now, a full decade into Trump’s ongoing exposure of the cracks in the Democratic electoral coalition. It’s often suggested that the main force ailing party leadership is gerontocracy ⁠– that Democrats such as Chuck Schumer, whorefused to endorse Mamdanias the Democratic nominee, are simply too old and personally embittered to recognize talents like Mamdani, pass the torch on to them and embrace new ideas. But this isn’t even half the story. Mamdani was the only serious candidate in this race.View image in fullscreenAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Zohran Mamdani and Bernie Sanders wave to the crowd at the end of a campaign rally at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York, on 26 October.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianHis most significant rivals, Cuomo and Adams, have both faced criminal investigations over their conduct in office, and Cuomoresignedin disgrace in 2021. Despite this, out of sheer timidity and careerism, Democratic leaders around the city and around the country, many of them not especially elderly, embraced the two anyway. So too did a bipartisan front of elites. “The coalition opposing Zohran Mamdani,” Jacobin’s Luke Savagewrites, “has spanned the New York Post to the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. It now also includes the Trump White House and Elon Musk, to say nothing of Bill Ackman, Michael Bloomberg, real estate tycoon Ronald Lauder, and thewider constellation of plutocratswho’ve pumped more than $40m in outside money into the campaign in addition to the more than $12m spent by the Cuomo campaign directly.”Zohran Mamdani’s biggest threat is not Donald Trump, it’s the Democratic old guard | Emma BrockesRead moreThose expenditures didn’t work. And neither did identity politics ⁠– reliably the last refuge of centrists who, of course, also condemn identitarianism from progressives and the right when it suits them. Adams tried to crown Mamdani “king of the gentrifiers” a few weeks ago; less amusingly, the nonstop effort to label Mamdani a threat toJewish New Yorkersfor his stances on Gaza failed so totally that it might encourage other Democratic candidates to be more critical of Israel.Against all odds and despite increasingly desperate and despicableslightsagainsthis faithin the last weeks of the campaign, Mamdani will be mayor ⁠– which unfortunately means the attacks against him and the city he will run will only get worse in the months and years ahead. The president has openlycontemplatedsending troops into New York City; already, he is using the policy levers available to him to upend the city’s governance however he can. In all probability, a grand showdown is coming. We have ample reason already to look to Mamdani for inspiration. From here on out, millions of Americans, in New York and beyond, will be looking to him for leadership.Osita Nwanevu is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionNew YorkUS politicsDemocratsAndrew CuomoEric AdamsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Street by street, practically building by building, you could index New Yorkers’ support for Mamdani or Andrew Cuomo to the probable amount of rent they were paying. A middle-income precinct on the Upper West Side, for example, showed up as a small island of Mamdani voters in a sea of Cuomo-voting wealthier neighbourhoods. Solid lower-income support for Mamdani in modest midtown gave way to the incredible banking wealth of Tribeca and its majority support of Cuomo.Allowing for large anomalies – Staten Island, a middle- to lower-income part of the city, voted heavily for Cuomo, as did lower-income Hassidic neighbourhoods in Brooklyn and Queens – the message of the huge turnout for Mamdani in the US’s most expensive city seemed to be one of affordability; even of a referendum on capitalism as we know it. And so the most pressing question became: was it a crank result from an unrepresentative city, or the beginning of a new political wave?The night’s countrywide election patterns indicated a swing away fromDonald Trumpto the Democrats, which, of course, doesn’t mean that Mamdani’s Democratic socialism is anything the US at large will be willing to buy. Still, the move to the left was sharp enough to return Democrats to some traditionally very Republican areas, including two Democrats voted on to a public service commission in Georgia; the first Democratic female governor voted into office in New Jersey; and a new Democratic governor elected in Virginia. In New York City itself, the swing away from Trump, a mere 12 months after his support surged during the 2024 presidential election, was significant. His endorsement of Cuomo, running as an independent, made no apparent difference whatsoever.It should be said that Cuomo was a terrible candidate, trailing sexual misconduct allegations – all of which he denies – and a record as New York’s governor that foundered horribly during the pandemic. It should also be pointed out that Mamdani didn’t simply beat Cuomo; he galvanised New Yorkers into the highest mayoral election turnout since the 1960s, indicating an electorate voting for him rather than against his opponent.1:08'A historic moment': New Yorkers react to Zohran Mamdani's victory – videoHow, then, does the 34-year-old look as a potential leader beyond the very particular ecosystem of New York City, where, at times, it is possible to believe that a tub of margarine promising lower rents, higher minimum wage and fairer taxes might win out over a traditional political adversary? On this question, aspects of Mamdani’s identity – exploited by Cuomo and Trump to racist effect – might actually run in his favour. Mamdani’s age and eloquence obviously flatter him in relation to Trump, but it’s his background that stands out as a decisive advantage.In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Mamdani promised working-class New Yorkers: “We will fight for you, because we are you.” This is a great piece of rhetoric, but let’s be honest: Mamdani has the social and cultural capital of someone who grew up in an affluent family in a wealthy part of Manhattan, with one parent who went to Harvard and became a successful film-maker and the other who is a professor at Columbia. And while the mayor-elect went to an academically selective state high school in the city, he attended a private liberal arts college in Maine thatnow charges $91,000 a yearin tuition and living costs.I don’t mention any of this to be snide. Mamdani sells a political message further to the left than any successful American politician has dared to in recent memory, but he doesn’t sound like an outsider. In fact, he sounds as smooth and polished and – can we say it – arrogant as any mainstream political contender.He has neither Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s scrappy, up-from-her-bootstraps energy, nor can he be played for laughs on Saturday Night Live like Bernie Sanders – who, during the 2016 election cycle, Larry David mercilessly if affectionately skewered as a hopeless crank. Even Trump’scharacterisation of Mamdani as a communist– the kind of absurd, inflationary claim the president is accustomed to throwing out and having his supporters swallow whole – withers under the slightest scrutiny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mamdani’s push for a $30 minimum wage sounds like standard political aspiration. He has promised to make buses in New York free – as they were during Covid without the city falling to communism. (On which subject: when the Staten Island ferry went from fare-charging to free in 1997, New York’s commuters didn’t receive it as a communist gesture.) And his promise to increase taxes on those earning more than $1m a year is substantially more generous to affluent earners than anything Rachel Reeves – also not a communist! – is threatening in the forthcoming budget.The election results this week suggest Mamdani as an effective, inspiring force against the corruptions of Trump. But while you can imagine him, years in the future, going toe to toe with JD Vance in a televised presidential debate, his real enemies may be closer to home. To advance beyond New York politics, it’s not just theRepublicanshe’ll have to beat, but the Chuck Schumer- and Nancy Pelosi-era gatekeepers of the Democratic old guard – who I suspect may find him even more threatening and obnoxious than Trump.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 6 November 2025.

Incidentally, 1990 was the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the global authority on climate change science – released its First Assessment Report confirming the threat of human-caused global warming. As scientists all over the world prepare the IPCC’s Seventh Assessment Report, we do so knowing that our work is still being overshadowed by politics. Despite all the well-intentioned half-measures, the truth is that the world is still disastrously off track to limit dangerous climate change.In the avalanche of technical reports released beforeCop30, the World Meteorological Organization stated that CO2concentrations reached a record high of 423.9 parts per million in 2024, with the growth rate from 2023 to 2024 surging by the largest yearly increase since modern measurements began in 1957. The latest figures from Global Carbon Project show that 90% of total global CO2emissions in 2024 were generated from the burning of fossil fuels, with the remaining 10% coming from land-use changes including deforestation and wildfires.While the growth in fossil CO2emissions in 2024 was driven by increases in gas and oil – together accounting for just over half of global emissions – the burning of coal reached a record high, accounting for 41%. Despite Cop28’s global stocktake calling on all nations to contribute to “transitioning away from fossil fuels”, collectively there are still plans to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5C, with the continued extraction of gas rationalised as a lower emission intensity “transition fuel”.Instead of focusing on economic incentives to encourage the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, climate policies are heavily reliant on feelgood “nature positive” solutions that aim to neutralise carbon emissions by essentially planting trees instead of reducing industrial emissions. While the protection, expansion and rehabilitation of natural carbon sinks like forests and wetlands is an inherently good thing to do, researchers have shown that there is not enough land to meet the global goal of net zero emissions using nature-based solutions alone.Climate change IS in fact bad and IS getting worse! Who knew!? | First Dog on the MoonRead moreApproximately 1bn hectares – an area larger than the United States of America – is needed to achieve net zero pledges. More than 40% of this land would need to be converted from existing uses like food production to carbon sequestration projects by 2060 at an unprecedented rate.And even if this regenerative utopia could be realised, we know that forests take time to mature and can burn down so cannot be thought of as a quick or permanent carbon storage solution, especially in a rapidly shifting climate. As extreme heat and aridity engulfs more of the planet, these well-intentioned efforts could literally go up in smoke.The science tells us that about half of the total CO2emitted each year remains in the atmosphere, while the rest is absorbed by oceans and the Earth’s land ecosystems. As the planet warms, these natural carbon sinks are becoming less effective at absorbing CO2, meaning that more carbon accumulates in the atmosphere, further exacerbating global warming. Pushing the mitigation burden on to the land sector simply relieves the fossil fuel industry of the pressure to reduce emissions any time soon.Achieving net zero by 2050 requires carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which currently relies almost exclusively on land-based measures to soak up excess carbon from the atmosphere. Polluters can simply buy carbon credits to offset their emissions and continue on with business as usual. Meanwhile, the energy imbalance caused by the burning of fossil fuels continues to further destabilise the Earth’s climate. Essentially we are adding more carbon debt to our planetary credit card, leaving future generations with an unpayable liability.To limit the magnitude and the duration of overshoot of the Paris Agreement temperature goals, ultimately the world needs to go well beyond the neutralising effect of net zero and begin to drawdown cumulative historical emissions to achieve “net negative emissions”.According to the Global Carbon Project’s latest numbers, vegetation-based CDR is currently absorbing the equivalent of about 5% of annual fossil carbon dioxide emissions, while technology-based CDR accounts for only about one-millionth of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuels. More generous industry estimates sit around 0.1% of total global emissions. At the risk of sounding like a heretic, the political distortion of net zero is an insidious loophole that distracts from the scientific imperative to eliminate the primary cause of our overheating planet – fossil fuels.While this scientific reality should dominate discussions at Cop30, history tells us that polite incrementalism and political kowtowing will prevail. Vague statements of future ambition will continue to delay the urgent need for concrete immediate action. Until our leaders have the courage to put a price on carbon to bring the era of fossil fuels to a definitive end, we are adding more and more carbon to the atmosphere, compounding the physical catastrophe now unfolding all around us.The dilemma we face is simple: genuinely respond to the scientific reality of our predicament or endure the consequences of this profound moral failure for centuries to come.Dr Joëlle Gergis is an award-winning climate scientist and writer from the University of Melbourne.

Watching my kids play felt like time had folded in on itselfShadi Khan SaifIt struck me how something so simple – wood, coins and powder – could hold so much joyThu 6 Nov 2025 15.02 ESTFirst published on Thu 6 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTShareMy first retail job in Australia was selling perfumes and garments at a department store, where I met many amazing people of all ages and backgrounds. But I never was a “brand-conscious” buyer, and I couldn’t afford to shop there once I left the place without my staff discount.So, on a recent stroll through some of Melbourne’s thrift shops, I came across an old carrom board. It was sitting in the corner behind a stack of lamps and half-broken toys – the wood faded, the net pockets a little torn and the striker missing. Most people would’ve walked right past it. But for me that board was like a doorway back to my childhood.There’s something special about op-shops. They’re not just stores; they’re treasure chests of forgotten stories. For just $10, I brought home a piece of my past.For anyone who doesn’t know, carrom is a tabletop game played on a square wooden board – somewhere between billiards and table shuffleboard – that’s hugely popular across south Asia. Players sit on the floor or low stools, flicking small wooden discs called “carrom men” into corner pockets using a heavier striker. There’s a red queen at the centre, worth the most points, and the aim is to sink your pieces before your opponent does.Carrom was how we learned patience, teamwork and how to laugh at our mistakesBut carrom is more than just a pastime, it’s part of the social fabric of the region, played by children and grandparents alike – often with the same battered board that has lasted for decades.The moment I touched that board I could feel the smooth powder on my fingertips, just like the one we had at home growing up. Ours sat permanently in the living room, balanced on a table that was slightly too small. My cousins and I would crowd around it for hours, legs crossed, arguing over fouls and cheering when someone pocketed the queen.The sound of a striker hitting the coins –tok, tok, tok– was the soundtrack of our summer evenings. Sometimes the electricity would go out, as it often did in Karachi, and we’d light candles to keep playing by the flickering light. Carrom was how we learned patience, teamwork and how to laugh at our mistakes. It was how cousins became friends and neighbours became family. Every game ended with good-natured teasing, a few mock fights and someone calling for “just one more round”.Mahjong modernised: automatic tables are bringing a new generation to the centuries-old gameRead moreWhen I wasn’t playing carrom, I was probably at the arcade near our street. Those machines were glowing worlds of sound and colour: Street Fighter, Metal Slug, Tekken. We’d save up coins or, if we were broke, use metal washers that could trick the machine into giving us a few extra minutes of play. Some kids swapped tokens, others borrowed or traded. I took it a step further by trading unwanted tokens for all sorts of foreign coins the kids had tried at the machines, to grow my vintage coin collection.The weekend I brought the carrom board home, my kids were curious – they’d never seen anything like it. At first they were clumsy, flicking the striker too hard and sending it flying off the board. But soon they got the hang of it. The living room filled with laughter and shouts of victory, the same energy I remembered from years ago. For once, no one was glued to a screen.It struck me how something so simple – wood, coins and powder – could hold so much joy. Watching my kids play, I felt like time had folded in on itself. The same game that filled my childhood days in Karachi was now echoing in our Melbourne home.Perhaps that’s the quiet magic of op-shops. They connect the past and present in ways you don’t expect. Every object on those shelves has lived another life; a wedding dress worn once, a dinner set passed down through generations, a collection of books donated after someone’s move. When you buy something from an op-shop, you’re not just recycling – you’re keeping someone’s story going.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionBoard gamesFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

On the other, no big parties could mean greater corporate influenceThu 6 Nov 2025 11.22 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 14.18 ESTSharePolitics as we have known it in Britain for more than a century seems to be falling apart. Only six years ago, atthe 2019 election, the Conservatives and Labour got 76% of the vote between them, coming first and second in both votes and seats, as they have at every general election since 1922. Yet in most opinion polls now, the two parties around which politics is usually arranged at Westminster, in the media, and in the minds of millions of voters, activists and party donors have acombined supportof less than 40%.Not only has Reform UK surged well past them, Labour and the Tories are no longer consistently ahead of the Greens andLiberal Democrats– and sometimes level with them, or even narrowly behind. With an inexperienced, hard-right populist party dominating, and an equally unprecedented four-way battle to be Reform’s main challenger, British politics appears to be assuming a strange and volatile new shape.Yet so far only the electoral consequences of this are being widely considered. These may be both explosive and almost impossible to predict. The website Electoral Calculus, which converts poll ratings into general election forecasts,currently reckonsthat Reform will win between 170 and 426 seats, Labour between 33 and 243, the Tories between 14 and 200, the Lib Dems between 29 and 93, and the Greens between 7 and 70. Every party’s gains or losses could be hugely magnified or minimised by an electoral system not designed for such multiparty competition.Electoral Calculus also predicts a dizzying range of results for the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and Your Party, Zarah Sultana and Jeremy Corbyn’s half-built political vehicle. With a painful budget due from the government this month, Labour’s deep unpopularity, the source of much of the present instability, may well worsen, at least in the short term. Given many voters’ abhorrence of Reform, which party, or parties, will form our next government could remain unclear right up until the latest possible election date, July 2029, and possibly for days of fraught negotiations afterwards.But all this fascinating, in some ways frightening, electoral uncertainty means that the wider possible effects of the fragmentation have been little explored. If it continues, little in the once stable and predictable world of British politics may remain as it was.All or most safe parliamentary seats could disappear, and with them long Commons careers. Experienced ministers and veteran rebels may become even more rare. Swing voters – easy to identify in battles between two parties – may be replaced by a multitude of still more fickle electoral groups, chased by half a dozen parties. Meanwhile, party heartlands may crumble, old loyalties overcome by dynamic-seeming new choices. In London, my home borough of Hackney has been controlled by a party other than Labour for only three years of its 60-year history, yet its mayoralty is increasingly expected to be captured by the Greens at next May’s elections.If parties no longer have dependable long-term support, and therefore a regular presence and leverage in local councils, parliament or government, then donations may dwindle. National structures may become unaffordable, mass memberships and networks of loyal activists a thing of the past. And the whole process may become a vicious circle: if parties don’t seem to be solid institutions with clear prospects any more, then why make a lasting commitment to them, as a voter, donor, volunteer or politician?In 2013, when the disintegration was in its early stages, the Irish political scientist Peter Mair wrote inhis book Ruling The Void: “The age of party democracy has passed. Although the parties themselves remain, they have become so disconnected from the wider society, and pursue a form of competition that is so lacking in meaning, that they no longer seem capable of sustaining democracy in its present form.”That may be too gloomy. It’s possible that a fragmented, more unstable politics will be more responsive to voters, and offer more choice. In Britain, the latter is already happening, with the political spectrum widening to include everything from Nigel Farage’s reactionary national rescue plan to Zack Polanski’s radical green populism. Politics could also become less complacent, corrupt and susceptible to lobbying: ministers and MPs whose careers are shorter would be less worth bribing and manipulating. They might even be more humble.If, as seems likely, the results of the next general election are more unfair than ever before, in the link between votes and seats won by each party, then the case for proportional representation may finally become irresistible. And even if that doesn’t happen – Britain has a way of avoiding logical constitutional reforms, as shown by the continuation of the House of Lords – two-party politics could be replaced by a culture of coalition government, as in much of Europe, with Labour and the Tories no longer able to win Commons majorities. For anyone disillusioned with what their duopoly has done to Britain, a more diverse and fluid politics may seem very appealing – or at least, a risk worth taking.However, a less entrenched political class could mean that other disliked and powerful, yet unelected and more permanent interests, such as big corporations and Whitehall, gain more influence. There is also a danger that a faster-changing, more multiparty politics will simply accelerate the current disillusionment cycle, with voters working their way through an ever-lengthening menu of choices, faster and faster, without ever feeling sated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then, unusually, there were two general elections, and in both Labour and the Tories won lower shares of the vote than for decades. The Liberals, the SNP and the racist National Front all significantly increased their support. But this messier, more pluralist politics didn’t last long. Instead, in 1975, Margaret Thatcher captured the Tory leadership and began making politics narrower than ever. Somewhere on today’s crowded electoral battlefield, our next overlord may be waiting for their moment.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourConservativesReform UKLiberal DemocratsGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s why a new UK law banning it is so vitalClare McGlynnStrangulation during sex damages young women’s brain health and breeds deep gender inequality. But the real test will be its enforcementThu 6 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 10.10 ESTShareThis week marks a turning point in the UK’s approach to violent porn. The government has announced it will makepublishing or possessingpornographic depictions of strangulation or suffocation – often known as “choking” – illegal. This bold move could transform the porn that appears on porn sites and social media platforms.Strangulation in porn was once niche.Indeed,studiesinvestigating the content of porn 20 years ago found hardly any instances of it.Yet anindependent review of pornographyreleased this year found that it was rife on the most popular porn sites. This summer the children’s commissionerreleased a reportrevealing that 58% of young people had seen strangulation in pornography, even though only 6% had searched for it. As renowned porn producer Erika Lustputs it, strangulation has become the “alpha and omega” of “any porn scene”.This matters because the more porn we watch, the more strangulation we see – and the more likely we are to strangle someone during sexual activity. This is not speculative –studies of male studentsshow precisely this link. Porn is today’s sex education: in arecent surveyby LadBible, 70% of young men said that porn was their first exposure to sex.We see this playing out in young people’s lives. Reports suggest that between one-third andone-halfof young people have experienced being choked or strangled during sex. And it’s a gendered practice: mostly men strangling, and women and sexual minorities being strangled.Pornography is not, of course, the only influencing factor. Popular culture reinforces and reproduces these messages of it being normal and harmless, with supposedly humorous memes and hashtags, such as#chokemedaddy; as well as popular songs such as Jack Harlow’sLovin on Mereferring to choking as “vanilla”. There’s also a far darker underbelly, with the manosphere normalising and encouraging it, characterising it as ultra-masculine.This all matters because of the serious risks and harms of strangulation. We’velong knownthat strangulation may cause unconsciousness, sore throats, dizziness, bloodshot eyes, incontinence and even strokes. But what is also now emerging is the adverse impact on the functioning of young women’s brains.Medical research withMRI scansandblood testsis finding that frequent sexual strangulation is impairs brain functioning, which can affect information processing and concentration. This is worrying at any time, but especially for younger people whose brains are still developing.And it’s vital to emphasise that these risks are not specific to non-consensual acts. Consent does not protect you from brain damage. These studies must not be dismissed as “sex-negative” or a “moral panic” (unless you don’t care about brain damage in young women).Even more worrying is that these are hidden harms – difficult to detect, and largely unknown. Young women are largely unaware of the serious risks of strangulation, meaning they can’t freely consent to them. Many men are also strangling without awareness of the real risks to their partners – and to themselves if it all goes badly wrong. The commonassumptionis that this is a safe practice. This is why we also need to increase public awareness of the harms of sexual strangulation, as the#Breathlesscampaign has done in Australia.This is all to explain why action to reduce the prevalence and normalisation of sexual strangulation is urgent. The government’s proposed new law means that under theOnline Safety Act 2023, porn platforms and social media such as X will have to proactively detect and remove this content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But adopting a law is just the first step – it must be implemented and enforced. So all eyes will now be on the regulator, Ofcom. Will it prioritise this issue and force platforms to act? Unfortunately, the omens are not good. Rape porn is already illegal, but it remains common on mainstream porn platforms and X.This new law is a watershed moment. It acknowledges that mainstream porn has real consequences and that strangulation is inherently harmful. It’s the start of a fightback against the mainstream porn shaping our lives in profoundly damaging ways.Clare McGlynn is a professor of law at Durham University and author of Exposed: The Rise of Extreme Porn and How We Fight Back (out in 2026)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You have to open your eyes – please.”Winkleman is hardly a shrinking violet at the best of times, but in this case, her theatrics were justified. The episode in question – which saw poor, diehard Faithful Mark Bonnar banished from the castle after a dramatic deadlocked vote – marked the moment Celebrity Traitors officially produced the worst-performing group of Faithfuls in British Traitors’ history.Until this season, the latest a Traitor had ever been caught was episode six, in the first series, when Alyssa was exposed by her fellow Traitor Amanda. And back then, they all had the excuse that the game was new. This lot has had three seasons of examples, playbooks, and round tables to study, and they’re still floundering.Of course, they’re not totally useless – they did finally manage to weed outJonathan Rosslast week, seven episodes in, but then immediately counterbalanced it by banishing another Faithful (Kate Garraway) the following day.So, why are this year’s Faithfuls so utterly shambolic? As aveteran of the game(I was one of the Traitors on season two, before being backstabbed by my own teammate, Harry, just before the finish line), allow me to posit a few ideas.She might have been voted most useless player by her fellow contestants, but it was our dearly departed Kate who actually summed it up best, in the latest episode. “You get bedazzled by the great personalities around you,” she said, “which makes your head spin.”Indeed, the Faithfuls are suffering from a potentially fatal case of celebrity goggles. Instead of getting down to the brass tacks and analysing people’s behaviour,they are analysing personas, allowing their votes to be swayed by preconceived notions of who their fellow contestants are.Which is whyAlan Carris able to giggle his way through every round table, sweat through his shirt, forget he has a shield, and everyone swats it away with a proverbial, “Oh, that’s just Alan!” He’s so funny and lovable that he’s getting away with murder – literally.It is also why much of the justification for Stephen Fry being unceremoniously banished was the repeated idea that he’s a “genius” and a “big dog”, so would make a good Traitor. Not once, though, did Stephen ever exhibit even the slightest hint of perfidy.The same could be said for Niko Omilana, who was the first to be banished from the castle, largely based on the fact that he’s a prankster by trade. The Faithfuls are not looking at what people are doing; they’re looking at who they are.Another glaring issue is that the Faithfuls aren’t working together. Ultimately, Traitors is a team sport, which means that every Faithful needs allies, not just good instincts.This celebrity cast, though, seems allergic to forming cliques. Faithfuls win when they trust each other and when they share information. Take Nick Mohammed. He’s clearly clever and perceptive, but for a while, he fell into the classic trap of thinking that being right is enough. You can have all the correct theories in the world, but if you can’t convince the group to vote your way, you lose. Once he decided to bring Joe Marler on side, the momentum started to shift, but it may be too little, too late.That’s exactly what happened to Jaz on my season – he clocked both me and Harry as Traitors, but he didn’t build strong enough relationships to make his vote count. You can’t just play the game in your head; you have to play it in the room.And then there’s the money – or rather, the lack of it. In the civilian version, people come into the castle with raw hunger. You want to win because that pot of money could change your life. I went in wanting to buy a house. Others wanted to pay off debts or support their families. It hurts when you’re banished or betrayed because there’s that extra layer of personal grief of losing a life-changing amount of money that comes with walking out of the castle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you told these celebrities their careers were on the line instead of a cheque for charity, the castle would be chaos.The Faithfuls might have made some glaring errors, but we should also give some well-deserved credit to this year’s Traitors. Cat Burns, in particular, has played a blinder by lying low and stabbing Jonathan in the back at the perfect juncture. Alan, by his own admission, has taken the opposite tack and “pole vaulted” over the radar, but still has not managed to catch much heat.But Jonathan has been my favourite by far. From the very start, when he told Alan to say a few words at Paloma Faith’s funeral (knowing full well Alan had murdered her in cold blood), he has been the pantomime villain of the piece. He’s the kind of Traitor I love to watch, pushing the game forward and stirring things up.I’m probably biased, because I see a lot of myself in him – the devious Traitor who somehow manages to get away with it, despite being so blindingly obvious. When I was a Traitor, I also wanted to be machiavellian and perform. Like Jonathan, I’d get called out again and again and still somehow survive the round table.For all my moaning, you can’t quite count out the Faithfuls just yet. As it stands, Joe and Nick are finally on to Alan and Cat, so the tide might just be turning in the Faithfuls’ favour. There’s still plenty of time for the Traitors to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.Paul Gorton was a contestant on BBC reality showThe Traitorsin January 2024.

Farage waits in the wings if notThu 6 Nov 2025 01.15 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 08.08 ESTShareIt may not feel that way, but these are pivotal weeks in modern British, and perhaps also modern European, politics. I do not know whether the ink is yet dry on the final draft of Rachel Reeves’s 26 November budget, let alone know what measures it will contain. But I do know that this budget matters more than any other in recent times.Reeves would not havemade her Downing Street speechon Tuesday simply to trail a business-as-usual package. The inevitable inference is that she plans a moment of enforced but necessary departure from tradition. The outcome, whether success or failure, will surely reshape politics for years to come.The heart of the story on 26 November, although emphatically not the whole of the story, should be income tax. Income tax is key to the public finances and to the redistribution of wealth by the state. It will always be the principal embodiment of Oliver Wendell Holmes junior’stotemic dictumthat “taxes are the price we pay for a civilised society”. But no chancellor has raised theincome tax base ratesince Labour’s Denis Healey raised it from 33% to 35% in 1975 (he then cut the rate in 1977 and 1978, but we don’t hear so much about that).That 50-year arc is no historic accident. The past five decades have been the Margaret Thatcher-defined years of lower personal taxes, privatisation and state cutting. In those years, income tax has become totemic in another way, as the embodiment of the possessive individualism unleashed by the state’s tactical withdrawal from the work of civilisation strengthening and nation sustaining. Today, the base rate is 20%. The direct consequence of this is the broken Britain that Reeves is struggling to mend.If Reeves raises income tax in three weeks’ time – which I devoutly hope she will, among many other radical tax changes and balancing reforms – there will be some almighty rows. The Thatcherite true believers will be scandalised. The press will be at its most sanctimonious.LabourMPs in marginal seats will be scared. We should not underestimate the power of all this. Middle-class voters would have to tighten their belts.At the same time, it is important to hold the line about why this is so necessary. Any rise in income tax will inevitably be widely depicted by its enemies as proof of the Labour government’s economic management failure. But the far more fundamental historical failure will be that of Thatcherism. It cannot be said too often that cutting the state and reducing personal taxes have created the problems that Reeves is tasked with fixing. Either way, it is a massive moment.This does not mean that the answer is to return to the big government statism of the pre-Thatcher era. Absolutely not. The old smokestack Britain was badly broken too, and Thatcher was elected three times for some understandable reasons. There is no going back. The answer, if our weakened politics can rise to the occasion, can only be a new and rebalancing settlement.The question facing Reeves is how far the departure should be fundamental and how far a fudge. Common sense – and Reeves’s record – suggests it will be a mix, since not even a strong government, which this one is not, can advance on all fronts simultaneously. Get ready for compromises and trade-offs. But don’t reflexively make the best the enemy of the good, although some will.Labour has made things far more difficult for itself by its extraordinary failure to see that what is now unavoidable in November 2025 was also unavoidable in July 2024 – and to have failed to make this the centrepiece of its election story to the voters. Even so, if ever there was a moment when Danton’s call forde l’audace, encore de l’audace, toujours de l’audace(“audacity, more audacity, ever more audacity”) applied in our statecraft, it is now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first is whether necessary rises in personal taxes can be clearly buttressed by other measures that directly reduce the cost of living for low and middle earners (the wider lesson from Zohran Mamdani’sNew York victory, perhaps). The second is whether the Labour party is capable of reforming the public sector, including the welfare system, education and the health service, and controlling costs. Failure to do this, remember, was what eventually brought Labour down in the 1970s and opened the door to Thatcher. Much will depend on the unions, which learn few lessons.Whatever the outcome, this is a moment pregnant with political risk as well as opportunity. The state is dysfunctional – the humiliating news of anotherincorrectly released prisoneron Wednesday seeps seamlessly into other simmering doubts. Labour is unpopular. Politicians are mistrusted. For Reeves to bet the farm on the apparent conviction that voters are prepared to pay higher taxes for better public services in such circumstances will seem bold to some, folly to others, and both to many. The budget could all go horribly wrong, economically and politically.It may be tempting to see this week’s US contests andlast week’s Dutch electionsas a sign that opinion is changing. But it is a stretch to say a narrow victory for Dutch centrists over the anti-migrant populist Geert Wilders gives Reeves permission to raise personal taxes in parts of Britain. A grimmer conclusion is that, when populists win power, they cannot deliver, so are replaced by centrist technocrats, who can’t deliver either, leading to a swing back to the populists. If thatgloomy analysis, floated by the Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman this week, is indeed the new paradigm, Reeves may take some bold and necessary risks in the budget, but they will not save Labour from Nigel Farage.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionRachel ReevesTax and spendingLabourBudgetcommentShareReuse this content"

I have convened world leaders in the days leading up to the conference so that we can all commit to acting with the urgency the climate crisis demands.If we fail to move beyond speeches into real action, our societies will lose faith – not only in the Cops, but in multilateralism and international politics more broadly. That is why I have summoned leaders to the Amazon: to make this the “Cop of truth”, the moment we demonstrate the seriousness of our shared commitment to the planet.Humanity has shown its ability to overcome great challenges when it acts together and is guided by science. We protected the ozone layer. The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic proved that the world can act decisively when there is courage and political will.Brazil hosted theEarth Summit in 1992. We approved the conventions on climate, biodiversity and desertification, and adopted principles that defined a new paradigm for preserving our planet and our humanity. Over the past 33 years, these gatherings have produced important agreements and targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions – from ending deforestation by 2030 to tripling renewable energy capacity.More than three decades later, the world returns to Brazil to confront climate change. It is no coincidence thatCop30takes place in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. This is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness the reality of the Amazon. We want the world to see the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region. Cops cannot be mere showcases of good ideas or annual gatherings for negotiators. They must be moments of contact with reality and of effective action to tackle climate change.To confront this crisis together, we need resources. And we must recognise that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities remains the non-negotiable foundation of any climate pact. That is why the global south demands greater access to resources – not out of charity, but justice. Rich countries have benefited the most from the carbon-based economy. They must now rise to their responsibilities, not only by making commitments but by honouring their debts.Brazil is doing its part. In only two years, we have alreadyhalved deforestation in the Amazon, showing that concrete climate action is possible.In Belém, we will launch an innovative initiative to preserve forests: the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF). It is innovative because it operates as an investment fund, not a donation mechanism. The TFFF will reward those who keep their forests standing and those who invest in the fund. A genuine win-win approach to tackling climate change. Leading by example, Brazil has announced aninvestment of $1bn in the TFFF, and we expect equally ambitious announcements from other countries.We also set an example bybecoming the second countryto present a new nationally determined contribution (NDC).Brazil has committed to reducing its emissionsfrom 59% to 67%, covering all greenhouse gases and all sectors of the economy. In this spirit, we call on all countries to present equally ambitious NDCs and to implement them effectively.The energy transition is fundamental to meeting Brazil’s NDC. Our energy matrix is among the cleanest in the world, with 88% of our electricity coming from renewable sources. We are a leader in biofuels and are advancing in wind, solar and green hydrogen energy.Redirecting revenues from oil production to finance a just, orderly and equitable energy transition will be essential. Over time, oil companies worldwide, including Brazil’s Petrobras, will transform into energy companies, because a growth model based on fossil fuels cannot last.People must be at the centre of political decisions about climate and the energy transition. We must recognise that the most vulnerable sectors of our society are the most affected by the impacts of climate change, which is why just transition and adaptation plans must aim to combat inequality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In response, we will launch in Belém a declaration on hunger, poverty and climate. Our commitment to fight global warming must be directly linked to the fight against hunger.It is also fundamental that we advance the reform of global governance. Today, multilateralism suffers from the paralysis of the UN security council. Created to preserve peace, it has failed to prevent wars. It is our duty, therefore, to fight for the reform of this institution. At Cop30, we will advocate for the creation of a UN climate change council linked to the general assembly. It would be a new governance structure with the force and legitimacy to ensure that countries deliver on their promises, and an effective step toward reversing the current paralysis of the multilateral system.At every climate conference, we hear many promises but see too few real commitments. The era of declarations of good intentions has ended: the time for action plans has arrived.

Manhood is right there knocking on their door, and these tow-headed, big-eyed boys open it and for a time there is one foot in, one foot out, trying out this new space, going back into the comfort of the old. Back and forth.It’s a vexing time. Some boys are more like men, some boys are more like babies. They vary massively in size and adult masculinity. Hormones surge, or may yet be a year away. At about the same time, they are leaving the top of the heap at primary school, where they know everyone and everyone knows them, and they go to the bottom of the heap at high school, a daunting experience for everyone, girls too.Then, experts say, boys start test-driving their masculinity, performing it for their peers, looking for approval. By the time they are 14, some things have been set. Identities are formed, behaviours emerge, risk-taking grows. Some boys will deal with these new pressures and feelings dysfunctionally, and this is the minority of boys who will start behaving with what is now widely known as toxic masculinity.Boys who cling to stereotypically ‘manly’ traits are more likely to hurt others – but they are in the minority, study findsRead moreIn a landmark survey of 1,400 adolescents aged 14-18 that seeks to establish what it means to be a boy/man in Australia today, the news about these particular boys is grim – it’s no surprise that the segment of the boy population who hold harmful and rigid ideas about hegemonic masculinity are not doing so well. They are lonely, most likely have been victimised themselves, and mentally unwell. It’s important to note again that this is a minority of boys doing badly. On most measures, as many studies show,boys are across the board still doing betterthan girls and gender diverse people.There are some hopeful statistics about boys in general, and it’s good to focus on these. The first is very gratifying and suggests that online influencers like Andrew Tate have a much, much smaller impact on teen thinking than the alarm bells and media attention might otherwise suggest. According to the data, less than a quarter of boys said social media and online influencers had a big impact on their ideas of masculinity, while 59% said parents were very impactful.There is the comforting news that many boys report being happy to continue showing their vulnerability as they head into the adult world, feel at ease comforting friends and are happy to talk openly about their problems. The other lovely statistic is that 96% of adolescent boys believe in gender equality, which means ideally we have the raw clay to make something good of this next generation. Sadly it comes with the statistic that only 17% of boys will intervene or speak up when witnessing sexist comments towards women and girls. Attitudes and action do not match up. Boys are scared of boys too.The authorTim Winton wrote in a speechabout boys and men and toxic masculinity some years ago (and remains eloquently relevant today):Boys need help. And, yes, men need fixing – I’m mindful of that. Males arrive in our community on the coattails of an almost endless chain of unexamined privilege. I don’t deny that for a second. But patriarchy is bondage for boys, too. It disfigures them. Even if they’re the last to notice. Even if they profit from it.Youthful ideals certainly don’t match adult realities either. As if we needed reminding, earlier this weekanother landmark studyfound, yet again, that women make 76c for every dollar men make and still unfairly carry the domestic burden.Will these boys who say they believe in gender equality believe in it so much when they enter those adult systems and find they really, really work in their favour? Or will they forget? Patriarchy awaits, and it’s hard for many men to see that systems and institutions that seem like they are working very much in their favour can be bad for them.And so, we return to hope, placing it in the next generation of young boys who say they want to live in a world where boys and girls are equal. Will they be able to make a manifest difference when they emerge into that world? No pressure, lads.Layla’s final year of school was disrupted by floods and fires. The toll of climate disasters on children is only getting worseRead moreMeanwhile, perhaps we could switch focus to the constant refrain that has been reverberating around this space forever: where are the good male models? We need good male role models! Good men to step up, intervene, demonstrate good behaviour and good allyship. We hear it again and again.Could this in itself be a problem, this rigid focus on a masculine solution to the rigid masculinity problem? It perpetuates the foregrounding of masculinity and says something salient about how important everyone thinks it is for men to teach boys how to be men. Why? And is it working?Another pleasing statistic from this survey is that the boys who did not subscribe to harmful ideas of rigid masculinity were influenced by their fathers more than social media and their mates. That tracks and, yes, good male role models are important of course. But a close second in influence were their mothers so, guess what, women can teach boys how to be decent too.Could that be a better key? Not that we want to give women more work, obviously, or suggest that men don’t have to do it – it’s about tweaking the messaging we all can give boys.So what does it mean to be a boy/man? Ultimately it means the same thing that it means to be a girl/woman, or anyone on the gender spectrum. That you are no better or worse than anyone else regardless of your biology. That you have the distinct ability to reflect on and laugh at your existence. That you should be free and safe to be whoever you want to be. It’s what it means to be human.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionGenderParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

Or did the faithfuls just play really – I mean sensationally, phenomenally, mindbogglingly badly? We will argue over this on social media feeds galore, but either way the winner of the first – but surely not the last – series of The Celebrity Traitors is the treacherous Alan Carr. When first anointed by that collection of cloaks, cuffs and curt instructions we have come to know as presenter Claudia Winkleman, we thought he wouldn’t last an hour. Nor did he. “I feel sick. I’ve got a sweating problem and can’t keep a secret.” He also cannot whisper or remember whether he’s won a shield. Surrounded, however, by some of the daftest players of the game since records began (2022 here, 2021 in its native Netherlands), he made it through, having grown into the role with terrifying ease. He finished with a flourish, bursting into semi-crocodile tears about how hard it had been for him to bear the murderous burden. The two surviving faithfuls, Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga, rushed to comfort him (“It’s been tearing me apart!”). At home, Paloma Faith raises her face to the heavens and screams.The Celebrity Traitors final – as it happenedRead moreAt the start of the final, there had been five surviving competitors of the original 19. After one last group mission, involving a steam train, £20,000 in padlocked caskets, keys and clues dispersed throughout the carriages, and two chain-wrapped coffins (“I took the lead a bit there,” says Joe Marler of the unwrapping. “Because I was happy to lose a finger”), they assembled for their last round table. Cat and Alan cast their votes for David, despite the historian’s impressive record of reasoning himself to every wrong conclusion possible. I remain firm in my belief that David would have made the world’s greatest traitor, but as a faithful he was catastrophic. He did manage to vote for Cat at the table, however, and she was correctly banished at last.View image in fullscreenGet off the Traitors Express! … the last mission.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryNow we are four. I can hardly bear to write about what happened next. Nick … had a moment. A moment when he doubted Joe. One of the greatest love stories of our or any age, between the hugest man and the tiniest man on television, the rugby player and the puzzlemaster, staggered under the blow as Nick turned over his final slate to reveal his best buddy’s name. Joe did not reel – he is not built for it – but if he could, he would have. “But I love you,” Nick said, hopelessly.Joe went, Nick and David thought they were safe and after some business throwing pouches into a fire, the three agreed to end the game. As the sole surviving traitor, Alan was declared the winner and took the entire £87,500 prize pot for the children’s cancer charity Neuroblastoma UK. But the most important thing is that when Claudia led the five to a reunion on the castle steps, Joe forgave Nick instantly.I shall, along with the more than 13 million other viewers, miss them all. (Apart from Lucy Beaumont, who never got a chance to do much, and Clare Balding, who never apologised for bungling the Trojan horse challenge.) I shall miss the bitter fury of Ruth Codd, the Shakespearean sorrow of Mark Bonnar, the utter inability of Kate Garraway to take things anything other than personally. I shall miss Tom Daley’s suspicion of long words, Tameka Empson and Joe Wilkinson’s wit, Paloma’s sheer presence, Charlotte Church as the distillation of everything that remains good in this fallen world, Jonathan Ross as television’s last remaining showman, sweet Niko Omilana and the relentless avuncularity of Stephen Fry, along with all the finalists themselves. Above all I shall miss the grace and elegance of Celia Imrie, so exquisitely regal even when screaming down a well or farting in a shack. As the figure under Winkleman’s hair made clear on many occasions, you were, largely, awful at the game. But you were great, great entertainment.The Celebrity Traitors is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

If only more film-makers had managed to channel her warm, sharp charmPeter BradshawThu 6 Nov 2025 18.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 18.57 ESTSharePauline Collins was the smart, funny, cherubically sexy female actor in the 1970s who became a recognisable star on both sides of the Atlantic in the smash hit British TV show Upstairs, Downstairs, the Downton Abbey of its day.View image in fullscreenCollins in Upstairs, Downstairs.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockShe played Sarah, the pert-yet-vulnerable parlour maid with a dodgy past, who has a relationship with the handsome chauffeur Thomas, played by Collins’s real-life husband, John Alderton. It was a TV marriage that the public loved and which carried on into spinoff shows Thomas and Sarah and No, Honestly.But her moment of greatness came on the big screen as Shirley Valentine: the liberating, naughty-but-nice adventure that paved the way for Calendar Girls and the Mamma Mia! movies: a buoyant, funny, sunshine-y comedy with a wonderful role for a mature female lead, broaching the subject of female sexuality that was not governed by the usual male ideas about demure youth. Collins’s Shirley Valentine prefigured the new debate about perimenopause and women who won’t resign themselves to invisibility.It originated from Collins playing the lead role of a lifetime in Willy Russell’s 1986 stage play: Shirley Valentine, the yearning and unexpectedly sensual everywoman heroine of an escapist midlife comedy.The trailer for Shirley Valentine.Collins became the toast of London’s West End and Broadway and was then triumphantly cast in the smash-hit film version – very much following the similar stage-to-screen journey of Julie Walters in Russell’s 1980 play, Educating Rita.Collins’s Shirley is a down-to-earth scouse housewife who is bored with life in her 40s in a boring, unimaginative country with boring, unimaginative people. So when she wins the chance at a free holiday in Greece, she grabs it with both hands and – to the amazement of the dull British holidaymaker she’s gone with – stays on once it’s over to experience the real thing outside the tourist compound, which means a gloriously sexy escapade with the roguish local, Costas, played with an outrageous moustache and accent by Tom Conti.Cheeky, confiding Shirley is always breaking the fourth wall to tell us what she’s thinking and it got big laughs in cinemas all over the UK when Costas tells her that he loves her stretch marks and she says to us: “Aren’t men full of shit?”View image in fullscreenA scene from Shirley Valentine.Photograph: Bob Penn/Paramount/Kobal/ShutterstockAfter Valentine, Pauline Collins continued to have a vibrant career on the stage and on TV, including parts on Dr Who, but she was less well served by the movies where there didn’t seem to be a writer in the league of Russell who could give her a real starring role.She was in Roland Joffé’s passable Calcutta-set drama, City of Joy, in 1992 and starred as a British missionary and Japanese prisoner of war in Bruce Beresford’s Paradise Road in 1997. In Rodrigo García’s trans drama, 2011’s Albert Nobbs, Collins returned, in a way, to the Upstairs, Downstairs world in which she played a below-stairs housekeeper.But she found herself repeatedly cast in condescending and syrupy silver-years entertainments about old people, which were not worthy of her, such as care-home dramas Mrs Caldicot’s Cabbage War and Quartet, as well as ropey French-set film The Time of Their Lives with Joan Collins.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins, Gemma Jones and Woody Allen shooting You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger.Photograph: MEDIAPRO/AllstarWoody Allen did give her a real comedy role (albeit a small one) in his You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger, in which she played the dodgy fortune teller alluded to by the title.But in the movies, Shirley Valentine gave her a tremendous moment in the sun.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsComedyUpstairs DownstairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Build That Wall (1999)Aimee Mann has had hits and acclaim from critics and her peers, but the sense that she’s slightly undervalued still clings. A song as deceptive as Build That Wall might explain why: on the surface it seems straightforward and easy-on-the-ear, but beneath its mellow, mellifluous surface lurk stinging lyrics and real emotional force.19. ’Til Tuesday – (Believed You Were) Lucky (1988)View image in fullscreenMann (right) in ‘Til Tuesday, with Robert Holmes, in 1985.Photograph: John Kisch Archive/Getty ImagesA song Mann and bandmate Jules Shear co-created about their collapsed romantic relationship, though with Mann handling the lyrics alone. (Believed You Were) Lucky couches its regret – which curdles into something sharper in the sweary final chorus – in a lush arrangement and autumnal pop melody.18. Stupid Thing (1993)Mann’s solo debut, Whatever, was also a first production gig for Jon Brion, later to become famed for his work with everyone from Fiona Apple to Frank Ocean. You can hear his influence in the thick blanket of organ that opens Stupid Thing, a marvellously weary dismissal of an ex.17. Labrador (2012)Not everything on the bright-hued, pop-facing Charmer – an album heavy on synth and jangling guitar – is great: its mid-tempo pace can make the songs seem samey. But when it works, it really works. Labrador is funny but fatalistic, a masterclass in compact, unflashy but hugely affecting songwriting.16. You Don’t Have the Room (2021)Initially intended for a musical version of Susanna Kaysen’s memoir (and subsequent movie) Girl, Interrupted, which was abandoned when Covid hit, the Queens of the Summer Hotel album had Mann dealing in contemplative songs with lush orchestration. Here, the lyrics are bitter, the melody is exquisite.15. Video (2005)View image in fullscreenPerforming in London in 2005.Photograph: Hayley Madden/RedfernsA concept album about an alcoholic boxer returning to the US from the Vietnam war, The Forgotten Arm was audibly recorded live, and its songs work perfectly when isolated from the overarching concept. You don’t need to know the story to fall for the sad sigh of Video, its melancholy amplified by the watery-sounding guitars.14. ’Til Tuesday – The Other End (of the Telescope) (1988)Mann collaborated with Elvis Costello for The Other End (of the Telescope), a pairing that makes perfect sense: both have a spiky, cynical vein to their writing. Mann came up with the waltz-time music, Costello the lyrics: both recorded versions, although the lusher ’Til Tuesday take might edge it.13. Stuck in the Past (2017)The “saddest, slowest, most acoustic” of Mann’s albums, Mental Illness is also among the most beautiful, and Stuck in the Past sums up its charms: a simple but lovely song, subtly arranged, which breezes by so sweetly that you scarcely notice how downcast and regretful its lyrics are.View image in fullscreenIn 1996.Photograph: Lawrence K Ho/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images12. Wise Up (1999)Written for Jerry Maguire – it appeared on the soundtrack album despite being cut from the film – Wise Up found its perfect cinematic home in a singalong scene in Magnolia. Its fatalistic lyrics crash against its wonderful arrangement: orchestral and lush, even epic, at least by Mann standards.11. I’ve Had It (1993)Presumably informed by ’Til Tuesday’s demise – memories of the excitement of starting a band contrasting with later disillusionment – I’ve Had It is all about pared-back subtlety (check the understated musical Springsteen reference), focusing attention on Mann’s fabulously careworn vocal. What an enchanting song.10. Choice in the Matter (1995)I’m With Stupid, her second solo album, was something of a bid for a broader audience, featuring moments inspired by Beck, but Choice in the Matter is straight-ahead distorted guitar alt-rock. No matter: melodies this effortless-sounding don’t need much in the way of voguish sonic trickery. Its failure to become a hit single is baffling.9. It’s Not (2002)A depiction of depression that scrupulously avoids the standard rock pitfalls of overdramatising or perversely glamorising the subject, instead portraying inner torment in strikingly mundane terms: like a TV broadcast that’s been interrupted, like being unable to press a car’s accelerator when the lights change. Fabulous melody, too.8. ’Til Tuesday – Voices Carry (1985)Her old band ’Til Tuesday’s commercial breakthrough remains Mann’s biggest hit, going Top 10 in the US. Its booming sound is so redolent of its era that it’s gone past dated and become nostalgically charming, but there’s a smart, pointed song bristling away beneath the mid-80s gloss.7. Suicide Is Murder (2021)The bleak heart of Queens of the Summer Hotel, Suicide is Murder marries a classic early 70s singer-songwriter sound to a lyric that’s flinty, cynical and utterly compelling, grabbing you from its opening line: “Picture yourself there in the snow, turning blue – get used to that being you.”6. Driving Sideways (1999)Plucked from demos for Mann’s third album, Bachelor No 2, and debuted on the Magnolia soundtrack, Driving Sideways seems informed by Largo, the west Hollywood club where she developed the album’s material. There’s a relaxed, late-night-at-the-bar feel to its mood, and the perfect chorus defies an audience not to join in.5. That’s Just What You Are (1994)Another should-have-been-a-hit, That’s Just What You Are conceals simmering venom beneath a loping breakbeat, shimmering guitars, breezy tune and gorgeous harmonies by Squeeze’s Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook: “You’re like a sleepwalking man, it’s a danger to wake you / Even when it’s apparent where your actions will take you.”4. Goose Snow Cone (2017)View image in fullscreenMann and friend in 2007.Photograph: Dan Tuffs/Getty ImagesA latter-day Mann classic, a sweet acoustic meditation on homesickness, inspired by seeing a photo of a friend’s cat while on tour. Warning: avoid the video – which involves a sick pet, visits to the vet etc – if you’re feeling emotionally fragile (tryMann’s stark performance of the track on Laterinstead).3. 4th of July (1993)The album cover of Whatever may have depicted Mann as Doc Marten-clad and grunge-adjacent, but its contents told a different story. This was the slow-burning sound of a mature, considered, masterful songwriter, apparently uninterested in passing fashion: why would she be, when she could write songs as good as this?2. Red Vines (2000)For Bachelor No 2, Mann took control, placing herself in charge of everything from production to release. Its contents, and sales, offered vindication: if Red Vines’ lyrics sound battered by her music industry experience (“I’ll be on the sidelines, with my hands tied”), the surefootedness of the song speaks of new confidence.1. Save Me (1999)Director Paul Thomas Anderson compared Mann’s musical contributions to his film Magnolia to Simon and Garfunkel’s songs for The Graduate. He’s right, in that, like Mrs Robinson et al, Mann’s songs were integral to the film, but took on their own life thereafter. You certainly don’t need to know Magnolia to love the Oscar-nominated Save Me, which perfectly encapsulates Mann’s songwriting. Beautiful but low-key, its gentle arrangement – pattering percussion, sweetly wheezing accordion – has huge emotional impact: a sucker-punch delivered in cashmere gloves. Its subject, former boyfriend Dave Foley, noted with relief that he was her only ex “Aimee’s ever written a positive song about”.Aimee Mann’s US tourstarts on 28 NovemberExplore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockIndiefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And then I think some executive buckled, so it became “fight the Empire”. It was filmed after the first Trump incumbency, when there was another president, so it wasn’t overtly connected to the America that is now.When I performed that speech, I was filmed by about 200 cameras so they could make a hologram. I was alone in a huge studio, no director or crew inthe room with me. There was a “God” mic – somebody spoke to me remotely saying, “We’ll do that again”. It was quite scary.What can you tell us about the upcoming adaptation of Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility?bumble1We’ve just finished shooting it, and the one thing an actor does not see is the film. It was filmed by the really lovely Georgia Oakley, who is very assured. And we filmed in these beautifulhouses around Britain, including in Dorset, Knebworth and Devonshire. The scale was thrilling. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a carriage with four horses. Although the truth of swanning about in posh houses is that you’re 13 hours in a corset and wigs, but I’m sure the outcome will be well worth it.The best part of anyHarry Potter filmwas watching you and thelate Richard Griffithson screen together.How much did you enjoy the experience, and how did you prepare for those scenes with each other?sesposito01Richard was the most elegant, artistic and talented man. He had the most mellifluous handwriting and once sent me a note to say, “Will you join me for lunch?” in sort of gothic lettering. He spoke non-stop. On set he was always telling me and the two boys, Harry [Melling, who played Dudley Dursley] and Daniel [Radcliffe, Harry Potter] interesting anecdotes and facts.He had fantastic general knowledge so we would sit in thrall to him.View image in fullscreenRichard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon), Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley) and Shaw (Aunt Petunia) in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007).Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarYou gave a beautifully nuanced performance[as Mrs Croft] in the Jane Austen drama Persuasion(1995), when you spoke about voyages with your husband, and said you never felt afraid as long as you were together. You looked into the distance as if having genuine memories.It was very touching. How muchwas preparationand how muchwas spontaneous?IrishstewforteaThe director,Roger Michell, who is also now departed prematurely, had said no wigs and no lighting except candlelight. He really wanted to get the experience of what it was like in the early part of the 19th century. He’d asked me to read a book about maritime life which opened up for me a world beyond the pages of Jane Austen’s book, including illegitimacy and prostitution. These things Austen never wrote about, but very often her characters are touched by this sort of thing.Mrs Croft is in love with the admiral, went on board with him and would have slept in a hammock, at a time when most women married in order to get a roof over their head. Your happiness was not necessarily the priority. Mrs Croftdidmake her happiness a priority, and the result was she had a much more interesting life, but she would have seen terrible things.Roger would only do three takes, so I knew I had to really play that moment as intensely as I could.I saw your amazing performance ofMedeaon Broadwayin 2002. It must have been so emotionally demanding. How could you do it again night after night?vjanewindsorI met one of the chorus members three years later, who said: “I’m not over it yet.” It started in Dublin, and then a year later came to London, followed by Washington DC, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and then Broadway. It had been running for over two years when we finished it in Paris. Actors’cars were being towed away in London because they never got home. We only had summer clothes, and now it was winter. We all just got stranded on Broadway, which was bonding for the group.The preparation of it was to try to take the zenith of what the situation was,dare to look at it and dare to stay sympathetic to everybody in the story. You must never judge any of these people. We went running as a group before the show, which meant we spent time together, and each night we played a very silly ball game, which unified us all and was an alternative to the content of the play.You have playedmythic characters and deeply human ones. Do you feel myth helps us understand humanity? Or does humanity make myth resonate?TVbydayI think myth is a way of dealing with the incomprehensible. The Greeks were very clever, putting logic on one side of an argumentand logic on the other. And the two points of viewmeet and clash. And somewhere in the middle, a truth emerges, for that evening.You made me laugh so hard inLondon Assurance(2010) at the Nationaland you seem to slipeasily betweencomedy and drama. Do you find it easier to perform in one or the other?Ozwriter22Comedy connects us as it’s about rupturing the norm. The best comedy is probably in our families where we understand the norms, but it isn’t easy to play. The night before a comedy, I always sleep badly, because you have to catch the wave on the day, and you have to hope that the moment lands correctly. Nearly all drama has comedy and tragedy in it. The difference is that in comedy the characters override their circumstances, but in tragedy they are overpowered by them.View image in fullscreenFiona Shaw as Lady Gay Spanker in London Assurance.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianYou’ve played some wildly disparate characters, but always slipped into their skin utterly convincingly. Were there any you found particularly hard, and if so, how did you approach it?What were your hardest roles?Seawitch3I find them all hard. But even if the person you’re playing is quite far away from you, there is often something about them that you recognise. Sometimes you find your way into the character through the language, sometimes you find it through the costume. Sometimes you find it through worrying about it all night, and sometimes you have to just abandon yourself to it. I found Electra hard, as it had no humour, and I found Mistress Millamant hard as it was too near me at the time.I try to approach each character in a different way, which has always made the experience like a first time. I try to start knowing nothing so I find a new way into the new territory, but of course, in the end, you look in the mirror, and it is always you.I really enjoyed your recent performance inHot Milk. I wondered how you prepare yourself for playing a character like Rose, making her sympathetic, while still so corrosive in her daughter’s life.Buffalo666I really liked Rose. I loved that she likes literature. The story hints at ambiguity as to why she cannot walk – but sometimes she can. She has a functional neurological disorder, which I did some investigation into and it’s a very upsetting ailment, the source of which is hard to identify. It may be that one’s neurological misfirings are connected to an emotional past. For the sake of the story, that was the case, but in fact it is as varied as the people who suffer from it. But Rose doesn’t know she has that, and certainly doesn’t know that anything is connected to her past or her history. So very often, what you’re playing is what the character doesn’t know.View image in fullscreenEmma Mackey and Fiona Shaw in Hot Milk.Photograph: Nikos Nikolopoulos/MubiOf course, she’s a terrible woman, but you can’t play anything from that point of view. She is blind to the effect she has on her daughter. All she knows is that she wants to get better. She’s benign and blind. Perhaps that’s what most of us are.You are the perfect gang boss/mafia leader/secret service head honcho. Your face says: “I’m going to kill with my intellect, but if you’re still around after that I’ll send one of my people round to finish you off.” Do you agree?I’m sure you’re lovely butI’d be a little bit scared by you in real life, sorry!AmongstTheWavesOh dear! I’m so not scary. But maybe when infused with intention, my features can be. I am in life sometimes quite scatty so maybe it’s redemptive for me to play very intelligent, organised characters. I try to play interesting people so I never judge them. Don’t be scared – come and say hello!At university, a lecturer showed us a tape of you performingThe Waste Land, and it blew me away. Is your heart always there in the poetry, even in a big-budget production?HamesJoyceMy heart is always in the language, because the clues to everything are there in the choice of words. The sound of the word usually has a hinterland of many more meanings than just the word. Poetry is the refined version of language, or the moment that has been captured.View image in fullscreenFiona Shaw performs The Waste Land in 1987.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhen people boil down to what they really want to say, it’s often poetic. They get down to very old words at the moment of intensity. So I am always looking for the poetry, even in scripts, and it’s usually in one line which sticks out, which I call the “plumb line”. And that line is your key.I love listening to audiobooks read by you. You performedAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland so brilliantly, and many others too. What is reading an audiobook like for you?Sunshine2000I loved reading Alice in Wonderland because I put everybody I knew into it – my friends and other actors. So I did the caterpillar as Alan Rickman, and the Red Queen was Geraldine McEwan. I read the The Mill on the Floss, too, and it always seems a privilege to sit and speak literature – but it takes days and days.What was it like working withTerrence Malickon Tree of Life?PunCrockEverything Terrence Malick says and does is different. He left a message on my answering machine, which said, “I wonder, would you come and help me with my film?” We went out for breakfast. He said, “Well, what are you going to have?” I said, “I’m going to have scrambled eggs.” He said, “I think I’ll have scrambled eggs too,” like it was the most exotic choice in the world.One of his extraordinary approaches was to say “Would you like to do this scene indoors or outdoors?” These are questions you’re never asked by a film-maker. He only used natural light, so you could either do the scene inside, by a window, or you could perform it on the street.He takes about three years to edit the film. I had heard from the producer about two years into this that I was probably one of the main characters, but by the time the film came out, I was nearly gone. He builds this huge edifice, and he takes most things away. He unbuilds films.Park Avenueis in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewFiona ShawinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Shame it’s not here for longMatthew ReynoldsThu 6 Nov 2025 05.40 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 05.42 ESTShareAfter years of collaborations with Disney on Marvel and Star Wars, it’s finally happened: The Simpsons have arrived in Fortnite. Whereas most of these crossovers comprise themed skins and emotes, this is a complete takeover, with an entire stylised map based on Springfield to explore. It’s a smart way of introducing American TV’s longest-running sitcom to a younger audience – especially withnews of a second movie on the way– but for millennials, this is the culmination of a year-long campaign to catch our attention, if previous collabs with Power Rangers, Scream and Mortal Kombat are anything to go by.Though this could have been a quick ploy for those who grew up on a diet of afterschool BBC Two repeats to open their wallets, it’s no lazy cash-in. The familiar sights of Springfield you’d expect are here: there’s the Simpsons home on Evergreen Terrace, the sloping lawns of Burns Manor, and a town square with Moe’s Tavern and a statue of Jebediah Springfield, detachable head and all. Towards the edge of the map is the nuclear power plant, pumping cartoon steam into the sky, featuring meltdowns that you can avert by tapping a control console to the tune of “eeny, meeny, miny, moe”. Cletus’s farm and a Slurp factory (the game’s spin on Duff – no beer on tap here) sit on the corners of the island, and every match starts with a charming recreation of the show’s intro, complete with parting clouds, title card and iconic theme song, before you thank Otto as you leave the battle bus and descend on to the map.View image in fullscreenExcellent … Burns Manor in Fortnite’s The Simpsons season.Photograph: Epic GamesWe’ve had virtual depictions of Springfield before (though not for a while – the most recent were Tapped Out in 2012 andLEGO Dimensionsin 2015), but never rendered with this level of detail. Playing is like stepping into the animation. Springfield is on the smaller side as far as Fortnite maps go, and while it’s mostly as you’d imagine it, there is the odd quirk: the Hollywood-style Springfield sign is in the middle, not overlooking the town, and surely Springfield Gorge, centerpiece of memorable episode Bart the Daredevil, isn’t this close to the residential streets where Homer, Marge and Ned Flanders live.No matter: Springfield’s geography has always been a mystery, and what counts is that this dense recreation is a joy to explore. The secret to Fortnite’s map design over the years is its knack for making good use of the space between larger landmarks, and here it’s an opportunity to cram in references for longtime Simpsons fans to uncover, whether it’s stumbling upon a 33 cents storeor the forever-burning tire yard. Exploration is interrupted by optional quests with fun cameos, where a set of car keys can lead to a joyride at Homer’s behest, or picking up a ringing payphone results in a prank call to Moe’s. Encountering boss characters such as Krusty, who appear across the map, see Nelson briefly appear to let out his telltale “Ha ha!” upon their demise.There’s a lot packed in; after a dozen or so matches, I’m still making new discoveries. If there’s a fault, it’s that the map has to be played in competitive settings, the storm circle ever closing in and moving you on; I wish there was a way to explore slowly without the battle royale setup. Though Fortnite’s vibrant pop-culture collabs are always best approached as playgrounds and not digital museums, I’d like an exception to be made here, especially for new or lapsed players drawn in by the update. If that’s you, here are a few things you can do to survive long enough to enjoy it: play the less frantic “zero build” mode,turn on “visualise sound effects” in the settings menu to show player positions on-screen, and remember, there’s no shame in landing in the quieter spots of the map and letting others pick each other off first. Some of the best references are off the beaten path, after all.The Simpsons collaboration is a month-long pause between fuller seasons, and ends on 29 November. It’ll be a shame to see such a brilliant tribute disappear, and though old maps have returned before – the very first Fortnite chapter did in 2023,breaking concurrent player records– most disappear for good. But if one series has staying power, it’s The Simpsons. Here’s hoping for a movie-style comeback.Fortnite’sThe Simpsonsseason is out now until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsGamesThe SimpsonsFortniteAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But here are the one-star shockers I’d downgrade – Peter BradshawStuart HeritageThu 6 Nov 2025 05.02 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.40 ESTShareIf you get a secret thrill from readingbad reviews, this week has basically been your Christmas. This is when the embargo dropped forRyan Murphy’s newKim Kardashian-starring Hulu legal drama All’s Fair, and hoo boy. Lucy Mangan’szero-star extravaganzawas a classic of the form, starting with the line “I did not know it was still possible to make television this bad,” and only getting more despairing from there.Share your zero-star cultural disastersRead moreBut then something incredible happened. More All’s Fair reviews started popping up, and they were just as scathing. Every last one of them, without exception, absolutely hated it. In his zero-star review, the Times’s Ben Dowellobservedthat the show felt like it had been written “by a toddler who couldn’t write ‘bum’ on a wall”. USA Today’s Kelly Lawlerwrote: “It’s so stilted, artificial and awkward not even a glass of wine and leftover Halloween candy can make it remotely enjoyable to view.” The Wrapsaid: “One wonders if Murphy is engaged in some sort of social experiment to see if he can get away with making the most transparently terrible show on Disney’s dime.” In his one-star review (comparatively a rave), the Telegraph’s Ed Powercalledthe show a “disaster zone of soapy plotting and reeking dialogue”.For over 24 hours, All’s Fair had to endure a zero% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That has crept up a little now (almost entirely thanks to a vaguely positive review fromDeciderthat seems to have been written with a gun to the back of the reviewer’s head) and now stands at a majestic 6%. Do you have any idea how hard that is to achieve? For comparison, evenMilf Manor– an actual reality show that really exists and is exactly what you think it is – managed to claw 14% from reviewers. Not for nothing is All’s Fair destined to go down as one of the worst shows in history.And the thing you need to understand is that reviewers really don’t want to give anything zero stars. This isn’t necessarily because they’re kindhearted folk who like to see the best in everything, but a zero-star rating basically represents a warped kind of achievement. Everyone knows that truly bad shows get two stars because that’s the score you give something if you can’t summon the energy to care about it. But zero stars? Well, that has to be spectacular.I have to admit that, as much as I trust the judgement of my peers, I did briefly wonder whether there was an agenda at play. Perhaps the reviewers were being snobby about the participation of Kardashian, or maybe they were attempting to clip Murphy’s wings a little. But then I actually watched All’s Fair and, no, they all basically were spot on.All’s Fair review – Kim Kardashian’s divorce drama is fascinatingly, existentially terribleRead moreEverything about All’s Fair, on both a micro- and macro-level, is terrible. The scripts are terrible. The performances are terrible. The grotesque demonstrations of wealth porn are terrible. Everything is both far bigger and far flatter than it needs to be. All’s Fair is the Kansas of television.You know about the premise, of course, because you’ve greedily lapped up every stinking review with the same amount of glee that I have. All’s Fair is about a team of divorce lawyers who are all so extremely rich that their faces stopped moving a decade and a half ago and also they have to wear clown outfits for some reason. Their jobs ostensibly involve getting the best settlements for their clients, but in reality revolve around saying things without a trace of subtext in a manner that suggests they are actually reading them from a too-small napkin located 100ft away in a rainstorm. It’s less a drama and more a malfunctioning proof of concept for a haunted TikTok filter specifically designed to give you nightmares.There is so much wasted talent here –Naomi Wattsis in it, for God’s sake!Glenn Closeis in it! – that you will find yourself developing theories about why it is so horrible to sit through. My current one is that all the good actors had to make their performances operatically large as a deliberate counterpoint to Kardashian’s central performance, which is so relentlessly listless and monotone that it just sort of sits there like a fart cloud at an all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet.The Guardian has only ever published 15 zero-star reviews. Here they all areRead moreYou will also find yourself wondering if this is supposed to be a joke that we are meant to be in on. It certainly feels that way sometimes. Kate Berlant is in it, and she’s usually funny. The outfits are genuinely hilarious; at various points during the same episode Sarah Paulson wears a shoulder-width bowtie and Niecy Nash-Betts wears a hat that makes it look like she has a little orange bus on her head. There is even a wedding scene where the rings are so comically outsized that the bride and groom basically have to hoopla them on to each other’s fingers. That’s funny, right?But despite this there’s a weird sense that, no, this is all the result of ineptitude and misplaced aspiration, and none of the show’s 26 credited producers, co-producers and executive producers possess the ability to discern just how bad a thing this actually is. We had it right first time. All’s Fair’s Rotten Tomatoesscoreis now 6% too many.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionKim KardashianRyan MurphyGlenn CloseNaomi WattsTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, the 26-year-old Mississippi guitar hero is bringing the blues back into the spotlight – and taking it to the top of the box officeThu 6 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTShareFounded in 1848, Clarksdale, Mississippi, soon earned the title “the Golden Buckle on the Cotton Belt”, a place where enslaved Africans and their descendants picked cotton by the tonne. But mechanisation in the 1960s changed things. Today, the small city’s median household income is $35,210, with 40% of the populace living below the poverty line. And 80% of Clarksdale’s 14,400 residents are African American. Just another left-behind town in the poorest state in the Union? This is how Clarksdale appears to many outsiders.Or it did until one of the biggest movies of 2025 opened with the words: “Clarksdale, Mississippi – October 16, 1932”. Why was Ryan Coogler’sSinnersset in Clarksdale? Because this forgotten settlement is also a blues mecca. The crossroads where Robert Johnson supposedly “sold his soul to the devil” is here. Bessie Smith, shattered after a car crash on Highway 61, drew her last breath in Clarksdale. WC Handy, Muddy Waters, Robert Nighthawk, Junior Parker, Ike Turner and Sam Cooke are just a handful of the celebrated blues and R&B musicians who were either born or based themselves in Clarksdale at some point across the 20th century. Now, after decades of neglect, Clarksdale is using its musical heritage to re-establish its place on the map – and one of the city’s native sons, Christone “Kingfish” Ingram, is bringing the blues back to the centre of American culture.“The blues has been marginalised for a long time,” says Ingram, “seen as old folks’ music. But I’m noticing people are responding to blues. They’re tired of what I call artificial music. And I’m fortunate to be riding that wave.”With his debut album, Kingfish, in 2019, the then 20-year-old Ingram immediately raced to the top of the US blues album charts. Two years later, his sophomore effort 662 (named after Clarksdale’s area code) followed suit and won him his first Grammy. The Rolling Stones invited Ingram to open their 2022 Hyde Park concert in London. But 2025 has been his biggest year yet: as well as his latest album, Hard Road, which finds him demonstrating a soulful bent alongside deep blues, he both appeared in and contributed to the soundtrack ofSinners. “Kingfish emerged as a fully formed star,” says Cerys Matthews, host of Radio 2’s Blues Show, “a songwriting, guitar-toting, blues hero for the new generation.”“Its cool that people like my music,” says Ingram, “but I try not to let the fame thing go to my head. My aim is to sing and play the blues well. It’s like Nina Simone said: ‘Blues is our truth. And I want to share those truths.’”Shy and softly spoken, Ingram might not appear star material at first glance, but his music commands attention: he sings songs that convey lived authority while his guitar playing blends elements of BB King’s blue notes with Jimi Hendrix’s fierce dynamics and Prince’s funky pulse. “From an early age I loved singing, joining in making music in church,” he says. “It came natural, like breathing.”Ingram was born into music, singing in a gospel choir from an early age while his mother, Princess Pride, was related to Charley Pride, the pioneering African American country singer. When he was five, his father sat Ingram down to watch a documentary on Muddy Waters then, noting his son’s interest, took him to Clarksdale’s Delta Blues Museum (which, fittingly, opened in 1999, the year of Ingram’s birth).Here, Ingram engaged with a music education programme and excelled. Aged 14, the teen (who an instructor at the Delta Blues Museum had nicknamed “Kingfish” after a character from the 1950s sitcom Amos ’n’ Andy), was taken to the White House as part of a group of young Mississippi blues musicians. He got to play for Michelle Obama. “I got the same feeling from meeting her as I did when I met BB King,” says Ingram.View image in fullscreenMississippi goddam … Christone “Kingfish” Ingram.Photograph: Jen RosensteinBeing based in Clarksdale proved a boon for the youngster – live music thrived as blues tourism increased and Morgan Freeman, another Mississippi native, opened a blues club, Ground Zero, in the city. Not that life was easy: Ingram’s parents’ divorce found Princess, Christone and his brother “essentially homeless. We were scuffling between cheap hotels, just trying to hold it together. It wasn’t for that long but, when you don’t have a home to go to, it feels like for ever.”Hard times pushed Ingram to focus on music, although at school his classmates found his tastes odd. “Everyone was into rap and R&B and, while I didn’t get bullied, they would ask me: ‘Do you really like that old music?’ I’d tell them: ‘Yeah, I do. You should check it out.’ Maybe they now are!” He laughs and adds: “I learned a lot in church as a child – my mom’s side of the family are all church people and gospel is a great teacher.”Local musicians – “the elders” at the Blues Museum – encouraged him too, and he became involved in the local scene: “Bass was my first instrument and I got work playing bass in bands when I was still a kid – I was learning in the clubs at night and learning other stuff in school during the day!”Roger Stolle, a blues entrepreneur whose enthusiasm and vision has helped revitalise Clarksdale as a popular destination on the music highway that runs from Nashville to New Orleans, sees Kingfish as a continuation of a long tradition. “The first time I saw Chris he was 11 years old. There’s this kid playing whatever the songs required like he was some old, experienced bluesman.” Stolle adds: “I’ve got to give credit to Kingfish’s mom Princess – she got him to gigs on time and was always at the door to the club or juke joint late at night keeping trouble away from him.”“She was everything: the bodyguard, the manager, the handler,” Ingram says of his mother, who died aged 49 in 2019. She left her son in good hands with professional management and signed to Alligator Records, the premier US blues label.Bruce Iglauer, Alligator’s founder, recalls first experiencing 14-year-old Ingram at a Mississippi blues festival and thinking “he overplayed, like young guys often do”. But when Ingram played the Chicago blues festival four years later, Iglauer reconsidered. “It was an amazing performance,” he recalls. “He knew the right notes to play to impact the audience and tell the story. If I closed my eyes I wasn’t hearing a teenager, I was hearing a very mature musician.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His debut album features Been Here Before (his grandmother having told him “he’d been here before”) while 662’s Too Young to Remember finds him stating: “When you see me play my guitar, you’re looking back a hundred years.” An old soul? So it seems. “I was mentored by older people who helped me with my songwriting and playing,” says Ingram. “And I didn’t want to sing the same old ‘My baby left me’ stuff. Blues allows me plenty of scope to write on all kinds of things.”Another Life Goes By on 662 cries out for change against racism, police brutality and violence and Mississippi Mix finds Big KRIT (“A great local rapper”) dropping rhymes while Kingfish plays stinging blues licks. “Blues isn’t just a guy with a guitar,” says Ingram, “it’s a feeling, and rap can be blues. See, blues is the foundation of so much American music – jazz and soul and rock and rap – but people tend to narrow it down to a guy with a guitar. I might be a guy with a guitar but it’s more than just this.”Jazz and blues through the camera lens – in picturesRead moreSpeaking of guys with guitars, 89-year-old blues great Buddy Guy has mentored Ingram since he was teenager. “Being with Mr Guy is like being with my grandfather – he shares a lot of wisdom.” Fittingly, Sinners finishes with Guy and Ingram playing together, the veteran and the newbie of African American blues providing the film with both a coda and a sense of continuity. “Sinners was a blast,” says Ingram. “It feels like that movie came out at the right time; blues and struggle and Clarksdale.”If the Kingfish has travelled a long way from Mississippi’s juke joints, he’s determined to take his contemporaries with him, recently launching his own label, Red Zero Records. “There’s always been talent playing blues,” says Ingram, “but often they got the wrong deal – or no deal – so with Red Zero I want to help get them heard.“Blues today ain’t just me, no sir,” says Ingram. “Plenty of us are out there.”Hard Road is released on Red Zero Records.

We hope you will remember her at the height of her powers; so joyful and full of energy; and give us the space and privacy to contemplate a life without her.”Collins had taken the role of Shirley Valentine in the stage version in London’s West End and New York’s Broadway before appearing in the film adaptation alongside Tom Conti.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with her husband, John Alderton, in 1973 in an episode of Upstairs, Downstairs.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockBorn in Exmouth, Devon, in 1940, Collins was raised near Liverpool and started out as a teacher. She switched to acting and after appearing as Samantha Briggs in Doctor Who in 1967 she was offered another 39 episodes but turned them down.In a2012 interview with the Guardian, Collins said the opportunity felt “like a prison sentence”. “Maybe it would have given me a profile early in my career but then I would have missed so many things,” she said.Her TV credits also include the UK’s first medical soap, Emergency Ward 10. There followed one series of No, Honestly, in which she and Alderton played a married couple.In 2005, Collins starred as Miss Flite in the BBC’s adaptation of Bleak House. In 2013 she appeared in Quartet, Dustin Hoffman’s directing debut, playing a former opera singer diagnosed with dementia.On being offered the role, Collins told the Guardian at the time: “Surprises. That’s what I love about this business. Even at my age you can get surprises. I thought he [Hoffman] doesn’t even know me.”Collins’s film credits include City of Joy alongside Patrick Swayze, Paradise Road and Mrs Caldicot’s Cabbage War, in which she appeared alongside her husband.View image in fullscreenPauline Collins with Patrick Swayze in the 1992 film City of Joy.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockAlderton said: “Pauline Collins was a remarkable star. I had the great good fortune to have worked with her more than any other actor in our many TV series, films and West End stage shows together and watched her genius at close quarters.“What I saw was not only her brilliant range of diverse characters but her magic of bringing out the best in all of the people she worked with. She wanted everyone to be special and she did this by never saying ‘look at me’. It’s no wonder that she was voted the nation’s sweetheart in the 1970s.“She will always be remembered for Shirley Valentine, not only for her Oscar nomination or the film itself, but for clean-sweeping all seven awards when she portrayed her on Broadway in the stage play, in which she played every character herself. But her greatest performance was as my wife and mother to our beautiful children.”Dame Joanna Lumley, who acted alongside Collins in Shirley Valentine, also paid tribute to the “unforgettable” actor.She said: “We only shared one afternoon, filming a scene for Shirley Valentine, but in that short time I could see at once why she became a blazing star.“The blend of truthfulness and soulful naivety with impeccable comic timing and mischief made her unforgettable.”Russell T Davies, who worked with the actor on the 2006 Doctor Who episode Tooth and Claw, wrote on Instagram: “It was such an honour to have her on set, I was in awe … Oh she was salty and wonderful, and the finest of actors.“As for Shirley Valentine, as writer Matthew Todd says today: ‘Says more about UK life at that time than any history book ever could.’ A true star. And she’d laugh at that.”The actor James Dreyfus wrote on X: “Had the enormous pleasure to briefly, but memorably, share the screen with this remarkable actress. RIP Pauline Collins.”The author Morris Bright wrote on X: “I’ve led a little life & even that will be over pretty soon. I’ve allowed myself to lead this little life when inside me there was much more. She couldn’t have given us more. Shirley Valentine star Pauline Collins has died at 85.

The script is from John Logan, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter behind Gladiator, The Aviator and Hugo.The central role will be played by Jaafar Jackson, the singer’s real-life nephew, while Oscar nomineeColman Domingowill play Joe Jackson and other roles filled in by actors includingMiles Teller, Nia Long and Laura Harrier.“Michael’s life was complicated,” British producer Graham King said about the project. “As a film-maker, I look to humanise but not sanitise and present the most compelling, unbiased story I can capture in a single feature film and let the audience decide how they feel after watching it. Michael clearly remains an impactful, culturally relevant artist with a life and legacy worth exploring.”Allegations of sexual assault against Jackson were resurfaced in Dan Reed’s 2019 docuseriesLeaving Neverland, which included interviews with two accusers who claimed he had abused them as children. Reedreportedlyread a draft of the Michael script and called it “startlingly disingenuous” after it allegedly discredited both accusers.“Jackson is only ever seen caring for children with childhood cancer, or dancing with a little girl in a wheelchair, or tucking up multiple little boys, mostly his nephews, at sleepovers,” he said.Earlier this year Domingo spoke about the Jackson family and their embrace of the project at an event in Venice.Michael Jackson’s daughter Paris criticises ‘sugar-coated’ biopic about her fatherRead more“They’re very much in support of our film,” Domingosaidof Jackson’s children Paris and Prince. “I’m excited to be here at amfAR tonight with Paris. It feels like that’s a nice way for us to be together.”But Paris quicklydeniedany involvement on Instagram, writing: “Don’t be telling people I was ‘helpful’ on the set of a movie I had zero percent involvement in lol that is so weird. I read one of the first drafts of the script and gave my notes about what was dishonest/didn’t sit right with me and when they didn’t address it I moved on with my life. Not my monkeys not my circus. God bless and god speed.”She added: “A big reason why I haven’t said anything up until this point is because I know a lot of you guys are gonna be happy with it. A big section, the film panders to a very specific section of my dad’s fandom that still lives in the fantasy, and they’re gonna be happy with it.”Michael carries a reported budget of $155m and comes out in the wake of disappointing box office returns forthis year’s Bruce Springsteen biopic, which has only made $31m since its release last month.Michael is scheduled to be released in cinemas in April 2026Explore more on these topicsBiopicsMichael JacksonPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Yet actors including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Sean Bean have pushed back against the profession, with some suggesting they interrupt their creativity.Speaking toLas Culturistas podcastto promote the release of Die My Love, in which she plays a woman who becomes increasingly disturbed after the birth of her child, Lawrence said: “We did not have [an intimacy coordinator], or maybe we did but we didn’t really … I felt really safe with Rob.”She continued: “He is not pervy and very in love with [partner] Suki [Waterhouse]. We mostly were just talking about our kids and relationships. There was never any weird, like, ‘Does he think I like him?’”“If there was a little bit of that I would probably have an intimacy coordinator. A lot of male actors get offended if you don’t want to fuck them, and then the punishment starts. He was not like that.”Earlier this week, industry website IMDb officially recognised intimacy coordinators, alongside 11 other professional credits including choreography, craft services, and puppetry, and announced that crew members would now be billed as such. They were previously grouped under the “additional crew” section.Yet intimacy coordinators face continued press suggesting they need not be industry standard, with high-profile actors rejecting their involvement. Lawrence’s rationale echoes that of Aniston, who said she rejected the interventions of an intimacy coordinator when working with Jon Hamm on scenes for The Morning Show.View image in fullscreen‘Such a gentleman’ … Jon Hamm and Jennifer Aniston on The Morning Show.Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy“Jon was such a gentleman, always – I mean every move, every cut, ‘You OK?’” she recalled. “It was also very choreographed. That’s the beauty of [director] Mimi [Leder] and our gorgeous editor, the music and lighting. So, you don’t prepare.”Aniston continued, “They said, ‘Where someone asks you if you’re OK,’ and I’m like, ‘Please, this is awkward enough!’ We’re seasoned – we can figure this one out. And we had Mimi there.”Despite its numerous scenes of sexual activity and frequent nudity, Anora – Sean Baker’s multiple Oscar-winner about the affair between a sex worker and a Russian oligarch’s son – proceeded to shoot without an intimacy coordinator.Mikey Madison, the star of the film, said she and her co-star Mark Eydelshteyn “decided it would be best to just keep it small.“My character is a sex worker, and I had seen Sean’s films and know his dedication to authenticity. I was ready for it. As an actress, I approached it as a job.”Her comments met with a backlash from intimacy coordinators, as didthose of Paltrow, who earlier this year said that working on the forthcoming Marty Supreme, which is her first leading role in a film since 2010, was her first experience of the relatively new profession, which she “did not know existed”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can step a little bit back.’ I don’t know how it is for kids who are starting out, but … if someone is like, ‘OK, and then he’s going to put his handhere,’  I would feel, as an artist, very stifled by that.”Speaking on a panel shortly after these comments were published, former Channel 4 drama head Caroline Hollick called them “irresponsible” and flagged that most of those speaking out against intimacy coordinators were sufficiently famous as to command their own power and protection on set.View image in fullscreen‘We decided it would be best to just keep it small’ … Mark Eydelshteyn and Mikey Madison in Anora.Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy“Every now and then an actor makes a comment over whether they like intimacy coordinators or not,” said Hollick. “Gwyneth Paltrow said she grew up in a time when [people in Hollywood] ‘took our kit off and got on with it’. As a powerful woman in Hollywood acting with a man much younger than her, well I’m sure [Chalamet] is chill but I thought it was quite an irresponsible thing to say.”Michael Douglas, meanwhile, said he felt the primary burden of responsibility when shooting heterosexual sex scenes fell on the male actor, rather than a third party.“In my experience, you take responsibility as the man to make sure the woman is comfortable, you talk it through,” he said. “You say, ‘OK, I’m gonna touch you here if that’s all right’. It’s very slow but looks like it’s happening organically, which is hopefully what good acting looks like.”Explore more on these topicsJennifer LawrenceFilm industry#MeToo movementGenderRobert PattinsonnewsShareReuse this content"

His portrayal of the crank who killed the US president in 1881 takes his mastery to the next levelJack SealeThu 6 Nov 2025 03.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Nov 2025 12.27 ESTShare‘My name,” says Charles Guiteau (Matthew Macfadyen), the anti-hero of punchy four-part historical miniseries Death by Lightning, “will be known one day all across this country!” Guiteau was, until now, wrong. He tried to insert himself into history by assassinating the US president, James Garfield, in 1881 – but Garfield was only four months into his tenure, so all Guiteau did by shooting him was turn them both into difficult pub quiz answers.Death by Lightning pays careful tribute to Garfield, a quietly extraordinary statesman, but its focus is Guiteau and, if this show is a hit, he might finally get his wish. If so, it’ll be because Charles Guiteau has become a byword for the sort of pitiable crank thatMatthew Macfadyenplays better than anyone else on television.Wild of eye, sporting a beard that is somehow pointy and scraggly, and forever adjusting his old clothes, Guiteau is a fantasist, a liar and a serial non-payer of bills who has no skills or vocation beyond relentless self-promotion. You can almost smell his desperation as he pings from one humiliation to the next: a bank manager instantly refuses him the loan he needs for his ill-conceived plan to found a newspaper; Guiteau’s snooty brother-in-law (Ben Miles) correctly tells his kind wife Franny (Paula Malcomson) that her brother is a parasite who will never repay her faith. Female company eludes him even when he spends five years in a free love commune, because he was too annoying for any of the women to have sex with him.He is running out of eccentric scams when he happens upon a crowd gathered outside the 1880 Republican party convention in Chicago. As Garfield becomes the Republican nominee and then the 20th president, Guiteau’s greatest and last obsession will be his quest to become Garfield’s trusted acolyte and, perhaps, his friend.Macfadyen has obviously been cast on the back of his portrayal of greasy climber Tom Wambsgans inSuccession, but here he takes his mastery of grasping losers to another level. Wambsgans accepted every Faustian bargain going to achieve wealth and status; Guiteau has not even received the offer. Macfadyen nails everything, from his maniacal joy when he briefly thinks he’s winning, to his strangled guffaw of disbelief when he’s rejected. He’s mostly comic but his one substantial meeting with Garfield, which he spends weeks angling for, is agonisingly tragic, as Guiteau opens up his soul to reveal nothing inside. Macfadyen is brilliant in every awful moment.View image in fullscreenProgressive president … Michael Shannon as James Garfield.Photograph: Larry Horricks/NetflixThe lesser of the series’ parallel narratives stars Michael Shannon as Garfield, who gives a candidate endorsement speech at that 1880 convention that is so rousing, he wins the Republican nomination despite not being on the ballot. By sticking to his principles and convening directly with the electorate – his campaign features him inviting citizens to his front porch for a chat – Garfield becomes president. His programme of progressive reforms horrifies the corrupt Republican elite, who move to protect their financial interests and are willing to burn the party to the ground if it means they can rule over the ashes.Here is where Death by Lightning has the most fun, with Shea Whigham as cocky, bullying plunderer Roscoe Conkling, and Nick Offerman perfectly cast as Chester Arthur, a violent, vomiting stovepipe of a man who is sworn in as Garfield’s vice-president because of the political necessity of getting the fat-cat New York faction on side. Offerman is terrifically funny when Arthur is a roaring boor (his drunken catchphrase: “Music! Fighting! Sausages!”), then suddenly affectingly vulnerable as we glimpse the man inside the monster. Arthur is the product of a system that preys on people who grow tired of punching up, offering rewards if they sell their principles and punch down instead. Arthur can’t drink enough to blot out this shame.The show struggles to find a similar narrative for Garfield, who is considered and self-aware to a fault, which doesn’t give Shannon much to chew on. In its desire to get the story done in under four hours, Death by Lightning also resorts to some hasty character transitions and a fair chunk of heavily expositional dialogue, while its female characters are rarely heard above the din of flawed men. Everyone is in Guiteau’s shadow: when he’s not on screen we’re waiting for him to return, to see what horrible self-inflicted defeat he will suffer next.The last of those is at the gallows, which he sees as an opportunity to stun the gathered crowd with his oratory, one last time. He dies on his arse, then dies. We know the name now, but Macfadyen’s performance is what we’ll really remember.Death by Lightning is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionMatthew MacfadyenSuccessionreviewsShareReuse this content"

There he found, floating in the shallow waters, a vast sirenian,Hydrodamalisgigas,nine feet long and soon to be known as Steller’s sea cow. Having made it through the winter, largely by eating the sea cows, the following August Steller and the remaining survivors of the Great Northern Expedition left the island. Within 30 years, Steller’s sea cow was hunted to extinction.Having described these events, Finnish author Iida Turpeinen’s debut novel goes on to describe the lives of other historical figures, each of whom are touched in some way by the sea cow, now reduced to bones. There is Hampus Furuhjelm, governor of Alaska, in search of a complete skeleton, and his sister Constance, who finds peace and intellectual autonomy among her taxidermy collection. Later, there’s Hilda Olson, a scientific illustrator, and John Grönvall, specialist in the reconstruction of birds’ eggs, who is tasked with preparing a sea cow’s relics for exhibition.Other things beyond the sea cow connect these characters. Both Steller and Olson long to be remembered through the scientific naming of species, although it’s only Steller, his desire playing out through the acquisition of specimens rather than the gentler process of illustration, who gets his wish. Steller and Grönvall are both embroiled in the murkiness of scientific collection which, no matter how it might further our understanding, necessarily entails destruction on one scale or another, while both Constance and Olson find their intellects – and consequently their potential contributions – dismissed because of their sex. And in the background, throughout, there is the slowly dawning scientific understanding both that the extinction of species is possible, and that it can be driven by human action.Ideas are raised and then let go – it’s like being on a gallery tour led by a guide who is constantly aware of the timeBy any metric – temporal, geographical, intellectual – this is a huge tract of ground to cover, but Turpeinen does so apparently without effort. She writes in a flowing present tense, moving seamlessly from one character to another, drawing us gently but firmly onwards. Emotional detail is astutely rendered, although in rather broad strokes – Steller’s social inferiority to his ship’s officers, for example, and his frustration when they ignore his request for the time necessary to do his work: “what a laughable scientist he is, examining the new world from his cabin, where all he can do is imagine the contents of these islands”. The result is a book that is almost hypnotically readable; it’s been much garlanded in Finland and it’s easy to see why.There’s a downside, though, to so much smoothness. The section on Hampus and Constance Furuhjelm, which also follows Hampus’s wife Anna, feels unfocused. Moving between the three of them, it’s unclear where the story lies, perhaps because the material provided by real lives often refuses to coalesce. The sea cow’s bones are the thread that ties this story to the others, but Hampus has bigger things on his mind and Anna doesn’t seem to even notice them. The solution might be to give more space to imagined inner lives and desires – Constance in particular feels like an opportunity offered then dismissed – but that would have meant lingering here, with these people, when the novel has somewhere else to be.Hilda Olson, too, goes past quickly. The same could be said of ideas, which are raised and then let go. When her employer gives his sea cow skeleton to a colleague, the two of them have dinner to celebrate – but “they too have their differences: von Nordmann believes that in order to fully understand an animal one must examine it alive… but Bonsdorff shakes his head. The oxygen flowing through an animal’s cells does not change its structure.” Here it seems we might be arriving at a nub, but then, as soon as the thought has been put forwards, we’re moved along again. The culpability of science and its practitioners in the extinction of species – and by extension the tendency humans have to hide their destruction behind ideas of progress – lingers without ever quite coming into focus. It’s rather like being on a gallery tour led by a guide who is constantly aware of the time.Perhaps this is unfair. Beasts of the Sea is undeniably very good – interesting; thoughtful; beautifully written. It’s only that I had the sense that it, too, wanted something more. When Steller rows out to observe a sea cow, it doesn’t seem enough. “He must get closer, see its organs and its bones, he must measure it ... Only by penetrating the surface can he understand the true nature of the sea cow.” I, too, would have liked time to see a little deeper.Beasts of the Sea by Iida Turpeinen, translated by David Hackston, is published by MacLehose (£16.99).

Without him, though, it might have been harder to take this film’s rather redundant, laborious dramatic gestures and its macho-sensitive narcissism. Even with Day-Lewis, in fact, there are tricky moments in the dialogue, and at the end of each of the two big speeches you might imagine a drama teacher saying: “… and … scene!”Yet Day-Lewis’s instinctive command of the moment and address to the camera – that fascinating theatricality and artifice visible in even his most realist performances – make him endlessly watchable. He is supposed to be playing a former army sergeant here. I’d put his rank higher than that. It is a movie that Day-Lewis co-wrote with his son Ronan, who also directs. It’s about a father coming to terms with his neglect of his son. We must make of that what we will.Day-Lewis plays Ray, a man living an ascetic, hermit existence in a remote forest hut somewhere near the coast in Britain in the late 1990s, radiating angry integrity and self-reliance, and cultivating the anemones that his father also used to grow. Watching this, I realised how much I want to see Day-Lewis play Timon of Athens.Out of the blue, Ray’s brother Jem (played by Sean Bean) shows up on a mission to ask Ray to go home to his wife Nessa (Samantha Morton) and teen son Brian (Samuel Bottomley) – though this is the family Ray left long ago, with whom Jem has actually been living as husband and father, to Ray’s seething rage.‘Handbags at dawn’: Daniel Day-Lewis discusses his method acting conflict with Brian CoxRead moreBrian has followed his dad by joining the army and is in deep trouble for violent brawling. He needs to reconnect with his dad, and both father and son (and brother) need to expunge their toxic masculinity and hurt. Ray must come to terms with the abuse done to him, and must talk about why he was forced out of the army after his last tour of duty in Northern Ireland, many years before. When we hear about those terrible events during the Troubles, though, it is a bit of a cheat. It’s made clear that Ray really isn’t guilty of anything that we might consider culpable – and yet Day-Lewis sells it magnificently. He can’t help looking like an exiled emperor.This is a movie with, in the Scots phrase, no small opinion of itself; a movie of big scenes, big performances, big images, epiphanies and hallucinations. Not all of them work, but the presence of Day-Lewis settles and moors it.Anemone is in UK and Irish cinemas from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDaniel Day-LewisPeriod and historical filmsSamantha MortonSean BeanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Music itself mysteriously exalts and redeems the community, and I mean it as the highest possible praise when I say that The Choral reminds me ofVictoria Wood’s musical That Day We Sang, about the recording of Purcell’s Nymphs and Shepherds byManchester Children’s Choir.‘I’ve played a lot of sneery bastards’: Roger Allam on bad singing, big paydays and Elgar’s level of ‘gitacity’Read moreThe film is about men in a fictional Yorkshire town during the first world war who are variously too old or too young to fight, and the women who have to deal with the menfolk’s repressed emotions and their own. The place is upended by the arrival of Dr Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes) who is to be the choirmaster, directing the music society’s annual production; he scandalises some with the fact that he once lived in Germany and has a scholar’s love of that country’s literature and music – as well as the fact that he is a bachelor who had a close friendship with another young man now serving overseas.German composers such as Bach, Beethoven and Handel being unacceptable, Dr Guthrie proposes to his ragtag crew of amateurs a radical new production of Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius, its theme of death being the more heartwrenching in the circumstances. He gets permission from Elgar himself for this performance, though not his daringly interpretive new variations.The humour is delivered with the same conviction and discreetly weighted force as the sadness, and the same goes for this film’s determinedly unbowdlerised view of sex; just when you thought this was a picturesque movie, Bennett gives us the question of a young disabled soldier having to learn to masturbate with the other hand now that he only has one arm, and having to persuade his now ex-sweetheart to do it for him. Perhaps this is Bennett’s late style: a wintry, comic acknowledgment of mortality.The Choral is out on 7 November in the UK, 25 December in the US and 1 January in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAlan BennettNicholas HytnerRalph FiennesEdward ElgarPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He is part of an exploited itinerant labour force in the early 20th century who cleared woodland wildernesses, built bridges and made way for the American railroad. He lives a quasi-hobo existence but is possessed of a passionate, unspoken inner life to which this fine movie gives expression. His emotional life is the tree that falls in the forest without making a sound.Greg Kwedar has adaptedthe 2011 novella by Denis Johnson; the director is Clint Bentley, and they have created a lovely looking, deeply felt film, clearly absorbing the influences of Terrence Malick in some of the low camera positions, sunset-hour compositions, narrative voiceovers, and epiphanically revealed glories of the American landscape. There is also something of the early work of David Gordon Green, a film-makeronce considered an heir to Malick.Edgerton’s Robert is a man who grew up an orphan in Idaho, stoically accepting his hardship and his loneliness, working a brutally tough job. He is also the haunted witness to a racist assault on a Chinese labourer (although the film effaces what in the original novella was his complicity in this). He is quietly astonished by the miracle of meeting and marrying Gladys (Felicity Jones), having a baby with her and being exalted by happiness, but heartsick at having to leave for long periods of time to support them.On the job, he works with taciturn, weatherbeaten men whose own histories seem as unreadably blank as the trees they cut down. And yet the film shows how Robert savours, or is startled and appalled, by the revelations of their personalities. William H Macy is talkative old-timer Arn, who is in charge of the alarmingly unsafe explosives, and Paul Schneider is the strangely jabbering “Apostle Frank”.Robert sees a heartstopping fate for both men, and is also transfigured by the beauty of all that surrounds him, while troubled by the sense that he is despoiling it. He can see a future in which he is one of the silent drifter caste who do nothing but saw down trees. And above all he is stricken by the absence of his wife and child – a pain that runs concurrently with his joy at periodically seeing them again. He and Gladys have plans to open a little sawmill: perhaps it would be best to quit his wandering life and do it now while there is still time.The later sequences in the big city show that part of the mystery of any life is how very short it is, how it can be telescoped into a fleeting series of remembered moments; Edgerton transmits all this with sympathy and grace.Train Dreams is in cinemas from 7 November and on Netflix from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsJoel EdgertonFelicity JonesPeriod and historical filmsWilliam H.

After a long break and an auditorium emptied for a medical emergency, the comic is performing to the handful of punters prepared to wait until well after 11 o’clock for the show’s closing moments. Helm perches on the bar. His diehards semi-circle around him. No other crowd on his tour will get this intimate an experience – and the laughs (more so than they were in the main theatre) are accordingly uproarious.No doubt Helm would prefer his show to have proceeded without an ambulance call for a sick audience member. But it allows him to build a rapport, and deliver a memorable experience, that otherwise hadn’t looked likely. The show’s first three-quarters find the 45-year-old grumping at his audience as usual, recalling being bullied in childhood and touching on the struggles with depression he has chronicledin earlier shows. He relates too his search for a house and his career drift sincehis sitcom Uncleended in 2017.This stuff is conspicuously meandering, unedited and not packed with laughs, with compensation coming in the form of Helm’s emotional honesty and sense of his own ridiculousness – or squalor, as per one routine about his relationship with his “fleshlight”. It’s also elevated by intermittent rock songs by the gravel-voiced metalhead, from opening singalong Dump the Motherfucker to a closer that takes devil-worshipping to a lewd new level.At its best, the show has the captivating idiosyncrasy that comes when an act does their own thing and no one else’s – see Helm roaring his Nosferatu song (about being sucked dry by a vampire – or is it a sex toy?) while bedecked in a pair of fairy-lit butterfly wings. Then come those unforeseen closing stages, a storytelling session for two dozen stragglers out in the foyer, when – off stage, unbowed, just for us – he’s even more enjoyable still.Touring until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The backroom of Arnold Wesker’s Italian restaurant inThe Kitchenis one such bubbling space, as is Lynn Nottage’s Pennsylvania sandwich shop inClyde’s. Hannah Doran’s Papatango prize-winning play, which takes place in a butcher’s shop, joins the ranks.Like in Nottage’s play, the formidable owner, Paula (Jackie Clune), tends to employ ex-prisoners. This brings the notion of new beginnings but also turbulent pasts and narrowed choices. Doran’s Brooklyn establishment manifests the hopes and disappointments of the nation’s underclass. It is essentially a dissection of the American dream, beginning with 4July celebrations when the Italian-American meat store receives a massive order.View image in fullscreenHigh-pressure … Ash Hunter as Billy, Marcello Cruz as JD and Eugene McCoy as David in The Meat Kings! (Inc) of Brooklyn Heights.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJD (Marcello Cruz) is a gifted apprentice butcher and immigrant from Mexico who needs this job to stay in the country. Billy (Ash Hunter) is a less industrious apprentice of mixed American and Dominican heritage. Head butcher David (Eugene McCoy) is a former Wall Street worker with a history of addiction. Newbie and former convict T (Mithra Malek) is Billy’s cousin, drafted in as an extra pair of hands.Alliances form as they set about preparing the patties and cuts of meat on Mona Camille’s stainless steel set, but so do enmities. Billy and JD are pitted against each other (there is only room for one apprentice here) while Paula – rather generic in her mix of ballsiness and kindness – is under financial pressure, like her crew, and notices the books do not add up.Directed by George Turvey, the characters have some good banter and tensions that pull some of them back into criminality as a mode of survival. Billy’s trajectory involves a seriously ill mother and highlights the lack of safety net for those who can’t afford health insurance in the US. But his growing desperation combines with a bigger sense of inadequacy to render him one-dimensionally villainous by the end.A more convincing tenderness grows between T and JD. The latter is the most rounded character, believing in the American dream and betrayed by Trump’s administration. His plotline brings a harrowing scene featuring ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement), followed by an impassioned monologue about immigration by Paula. Not every character is as well developed and the drama at times seems led by plot. But this is a vigorous first play, beautifully performed, alive and energetic, by a playwright of promise.AtPark theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesreviewsShareReuse this content"

He has just headlined his first arena tour – which sold out. In an industry as ageist asAustralian music, it’s a remarkable career trajectory; there’s been no sudden revival of interest, nor a belated rediscovery of his vast catalogue. Slowly, over a career spanning 50 years, Kelly has become ubiquitous.Rita Wrote a Letter: Paul Kelly’s sequel to How to Make Gravy is an affectionate goodbye to JoeRead moreOverfamiliarity comes at a price. There are people who have never listened to Kelly who appear to loudly resent his success. Much of the pushback seems to stem from the annual celebration of How to Make Gravy, Kelly’sChristmas perennial-from-prison. They never want to hear another word from Joe, the fuck-up who was already the subject of what is now probably Kelly’s second-most famous song, To Her Door.Seventy is the title of Kelly’s 30th studio album, themed around ageing, regrets and reflections on how the world will keep turning long after we’re gone. The Magpies – a song based on a Denis Glover poem which Kelly first recorded on his album Thirteen Ways to Look at Birds – will keep on quardle-oodle-ardling. And Joe’s ghost is still taunting Rita from beyond the grave. The more things change, the more they stay the same.This is a traditional Kelly album of classic folk-rock arrangements and elegantly crafted lyrics. The band is present: guitarists Ashley Naylor and nephew Dan Kelly, drummer Peter Luscombe, bassist Bill McDonald and Cameron Bruce on keyboards.

That may be difficult in the case ofRita Wrote a Letter, given that it’s the third instalment in the Trilogy of Joe, but it’s hooked to such a sturdy melody that it’s hard to argue; give it a couple of listens and it sticks like glue. It’s keeping good company: these 13 songs (including the bookends Tell Us a Story, parts one and two) are warm, memorable and easy to like.Of course, mortality stalks Seventy. The Body Keeps the Score tells how time and bad habits catch up with all of us; on I’m Not Afraid of the Dark, Kelly looks the grim reaper in the eye: “An old man thinks he’s still a lad / Sad songs never make me sad”. Speaking of being a lad, Kelly is still sex-mad, raging against the dying of the light on Made for Me, with Barnard cooing alongside him.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: EMISeventy comes almost exactly a year after Kelly’s last album, Fever Longing Still.

Her songs, mostly, are misty-eyed ruminations on puppy love and its ensuing devastation; they yearn for a redamancy that feels both fated and vexingly out of reach. You can imagine Harriette Pilbeam’s mille-feuille harmonies soundtracking a high school prom dappled with a disco ball’s refractive glimmer, or picture her fleecy guitars over a montage of light teenage debauchery. These are tracks prefabbed for telegraphing big feelings; everyone knows the outsize melodrama of a first, second or 20th crush.Liquorice, the title of Pilbeam’s potent third album, winks at her 2018 breakout EP, Sugar and Spice. That formative work was a candy blast of dreampop, emphasis on pop – indebted as much to Carly Rae Jepsen as Cocteau Twins, whose co-founder Robin Guthrie ended up providing a remix of Pilbeam’s single Sure. Liquorice, meanwhile, is more mature and less immediately palatable, eschewing the fairyfloss hooks of Pilbeam’s earlier work.Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers: ‘We don’t want to be the biggest band in the world. It’s just fun playing with our besties’Read moreAt its best, the record attempts to dismantle the grand romance on which Pilbeam cut her teeth. On Liquorice’s dizzyingfirst single, Lose It Again, the rush of new love cedes to motion sickness as she pillories a distant suitor’s “convoluted poetry” – as close to a snarl as her honeyed vocals will allow. The propulsive poison pen letter Wonder strikes an even crueller note to a similarly unavailable beau. “I want you to wonder til the sky is red / I want you to hang on every word I said,” Pilbeam sings, relishing not reciprocated affection but mutual misery. These are welcome flashes of depravity which lance otherwise earnest declarations of desire and devotion.The romance of the music industry, too, has soured. On her 2022 sophomore record, Giving the World Away, written during lockdown, Pilbeam interrogated her vocation with startling anxiety: the portrait of a fêted ingenue whose relationship with art and ambition has become brittle with time. Named after the feeling of nostalgia for something never experienced, Liquorice opener Anemoia plays like a lament to Pilbeam’s thwarted dreams. “Maybe the world you want has to slip away,” she elegises over throbbing synths.The track ends on an unexpected wink: “Secretly you were happier all along.” But happiness comes atthe expense of experimentation. Giving the World Away was a big swing that saw Pilbeam expand her sound – inflected by disco, electroclash and new wave – and work with bona fide hitmakers including Dan Nigro, the pop guru behind much of Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan’s output. Liquorice, in contrast, feels more restrained by design: a retreat into the references which have long coloured Pilbeam’s music. You can hear Dolores O’Riordan’s wounded yodel on Only One Laughing, or the deafening deluge of My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive across Liquorice’s production, so cavernous it can threaten to subsume Pilbeam’s voice entirely.For an artist so influenced by shoegaze, Pilbeam’s attention has always been fixed towards the heavens. Throughout her career, she haskissed the stars,stared into the sun,watched the cloudsandwrung meaning from the moon. Again and again, she has turned to the firmament for divine guidance, retribution and absolution from love and its consequences.Ninajirachi: I Love My Computer review – a surprisingly moving tribute to 2010s EDMRead moreDespite her best efforts, though, Liquorice finds Pilbeam unable to totally resist the lures of infatuation. Lyrically, the album often edges towards giddy abandon. “Lost control of myself / Again and again,” she sings on Carousel, giving in to the centrifugal force of a reckless romance. On the title track, “I surrender myself to you”; elsewhere, on Part That Bleeds, there’s a “surrender to curiosity”. At times, her capitulation to love’s stupefying force can sound frustratingly opaque. “You’re falling in love with me / falling in love,” she deadpans like an amorous hypnotist on Sage, skirting the line between awestruck and anaesthetised. The droning entry Anchor is particularly inert, never quite progressing beyond its metaphor tethering a doomed dalliance to oceanic depths.When Pilbeam eventually ascends skywards again, the result is thrilling. Stuck – the album’s closer and its best track – rockets headlong into a crush so intense it’s downright degrading. “I’m still stuck with these pathetic dreams,” she laments, her vocals diaphanous above catapulting guitars that thud like a heartbeat. It’s classic Hatchie: she’s embarrassed and enchanted, impossibly captivating in the face of it all. Cue the credits.Liquorice by Hatchie is out now (Secretly Canadian)Explore more on these topicsMusicAustralian musicPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

By the time he made Quaranta and Scaring the Hoes, however, he was in serious trouble: “blackout drunk” when recording the latter, “in pain all the time, throwing up and shit” during the making of the former. By the time of the interview, he’d been to rehab and got sober: ostensibly a happy ending, but Brown struck a note of caution. “I’ve seen so many artists get sober,” he said. “And their musicsucks.”Even the track listing of Stardust suggests this is an album made under very different conditions to its predecessors. The post-rehab positivity of song titles Lift You Up and 1L0v3myL1f3! isn’t intended ironically. Apparently written from the perspective of an invented character called Dusty Star, a “90s-era pop star” who nonetheless sounds remarkably likeDanny Brown, the lyrics contain appealingly chaotic swagger, eclectic reference points – at one juncture, he goes from Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World to Winona Ryder’s 2001 shoplifting charge in the space of two lines – and evidently heartfelt advice: “You’ve only got one life so stick to your goals.” There are moments that look back to a past when the songs’ protagonist had, as guest Angel Prost puts it in one of a number of spoken-word interjections: “You resign yourself to delinquency, quirkifying your life.” Elsewhere, What You See offers a lengthy, rueful apology for past behaviour, quoting Outkast’s Ms Jackson along the way.But Brown’s rhymes are nowhere near as conflicted as those on Quaranta, an album on which even the wildest boasts were immediately undercut by expressions of loneliness and torment. And the supporting cast on Stardust – 12 of the 14 tracks have guest stars – skews far more heavily towards names from the hyperpop underground and various other niche electronic hinterlands than it does to hip-hop: Frost Children, 8485, Underscores, Jane Remover et al.This isn’t entirely uncharted territory for Brown – his 2013 album Old was liberally sprinkled with production credits for maximalist electronic auteur Rustie and he’s talked about his regret that he never got to work withSophie– but the results are remarkably arresting. There are moments where Stardust sounds more poppy and obviously hook-laden than Brown has ever done before. You could just about imagine the house-influenced Copycats or the 8485 feature Flowers on the radio, were it not for Brown’s nasal, yowling voice: powerful, perfect for adding a snotty edge to his hugely entertaining brand of cartoonish threats and brags – “I ponder going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” – but very much an acquired taste.Equally, however, Stardust is more than capable of dealing in bracingly confrontational blare. 1999 is a painfully trebly, glitching chiptune at a gabber-like pace. For 1l0v3myl1f3!, his newfound positivity is backed by a beat that sounds like someone playing an old happy hardcore track on a turntable with a knackered stylus and occasionally dips into half-speed drops that, while electronic, have something of a metal song about them.Occasionally, the switch between pop mode and chaos happens mid-track. The End features not just Zheani, a corpse-paintedformer model from Australia best known for her 2023 track Bring Wet Cunt, but ta Ukrainka, the latter an example of Brown’s ability to find collaborators in the farthest reaches of the internet: she’s a Polish indie-pop artist who seems to be quite obscure even in the universe of Polish indie-pop. Her sweetly mellifluous voice acts as a foil to Brown’s warp-speed flow, in much the same way as the backing track’s pillowy synths and gentle piano figures smooth out the ferocious drum’n’bass break. Then, midway through, the whole thing erupts, Brown’s vocal fighting with a nightmarish mass of chattering sampled voices.It’s one of a number of moments that might provoke a sharp intake of breath on the part of the listener, which is presumably the point. “I made it here against the odds, now I do it all for you,” he swaggers on closer All4U. He sounds like a man who knows he’s beaten not just his demons, but his fears: a demonstration that Brown’s edge has not been dulled by sobriety as he worried it might.This week Alexis listened toLankum – Ghost TownA cover of the Specials’ classic that begins as if Lankum thought the original was too upbeat for its own good, then midway through transforms itself into … a banging dance track.

The German composer was dead before the clarinet as we know it today was established, butMartin Fröst, his playing as silkily eloquent as ever, makes the short but sweet selection on this recording very much his own.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Martin Fröst: BACH.Photograph: Sony ClassicalThere’s an intimate feel to the whole thing, which was recorded at Fröst’s studio in the Swedish countryside, with the fellow musicians sleeping over. The tone is set by the aria from the Goldberg Variations, with a hint of a jazz sensibility thanks to Sebastián Dubé’s bass, Fröst’s melody seamless on top. Fröst duets with his viola player brother Göran on two Inventions, and with himself, double-tracked, on the G major Sinfonia; fair enough, few others would be able to keep up. Yet though this is lightning fast, it still holds to the quiet, unassuming mood.Jonas Nordberg’s theorbo helps the Air on the G String to skirt cliche, and it’s almost startling whenAnastasia Kobekinaleaves the baroque cello lines behind and busts out Gounod’s full-toned Ave Maria melody, Fröst rippling through Bach’s Prelude in C below. Things finally get a little schmaltzy when Fröst is joined by Benny Andersson for a wistfully reverb-heavy version of the Largo from the Keyboard Concerto No 5. Yes, even Abba too turns to Bach in the end.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

He has a way with suspensions – crunchy enough for resolution to break through like sunlight, but strictly PG-rated compared with the harmonic adventures of his contemporaries. His music is as unfashionably essential as a five-pack of M&S briefs, asineffably English as queueing.From two royal weddings and a coronation to choir rehearsals, school assemblies and carol services across the UK and North America, British composerJohn Rutterhas dominated the anglophone choral scene for six decades. At 80, he is in a league of his own: a niche national treasure, even referred to as “the composer who owns Christmas”.St Paul’s was packed for this concert featuring the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Bach Choir with Rutter himself conducting. The cathedral’s magnificent dome makes for an acoustic in which coughing ricochets like gunfire, but this cross-generational audience sat through the long programme in rapt silence. The dome can also wreak havoc for the unsuspecting performer, of course – but it was no match for Rutter. He simply worked with its foibles, inserting minute pauses to allow chords to bloom and leaving its extraordinary reverberation to take over at the end of each number.Two large-scale works for chorus and orchestra by Rutter sandwiched Vaughan Williams’ Symphony No 5, in which the rougher edges of VW’s pastoral modernism were smoothed to a high shine, the RPO’s strings expensively blended, the climaxes irresistibly majestic and topped by gleaming brass. The world premiere of Rutter’s I’ll Make Me a World showcased miraculous diction from the Bach Choir and the RPO’s flair for musical code-switching, as baritone Jonathan Brown and mezzo Melanie Marshall led the way through gentle references to African American spirituals, blues and gospel.Rutter’s 2015 cantata The Gift of Life, setting a range of religious texts including verses of his own, offered a subtly different compendium: tender melodies and snazzy syncopations, Broadway-ready orchestral introductions and sopranos illuminating the texture’s upper reaches. It was polished, predictable and visibly enjoyed by the musicians on stage – unmistakably the work of a master craftsman.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

She clutches a hand drum, beating out a rhythm that draws the crowd to its feet. As people surge forward, stamping and whirling around the square, the singing intensifies and the drum’s relentless thud deepens. Thefestival of Sustarìahas begun.Southern toe of Italy map and Sicily“Sustarìa is a word in the dialect of Lago,” says Cristina Muto, who co-founded the festival in summer 2020. “It is a creative restlessness, which doesn’t let you sit still.” We’re speaking at a drinks party the evening before the annual event, on a terrace overlooking Lago’s clay-tiled roofs, when her brother Daniele appears with a jug of local wine in hand. “Welcome to Lagos Angeles, Calabrifornia,” he winks, pouring me a cup.View image in fullscreen‘Creative restlessness’ … The festival of Sustarìa, in Lago.Lago is a hilltop village in the province of Cosenza, overlooking the Mediterranean. It’s surrounded by sprawling olive groves and small plots where families cultivate figs, chestnuts and local grains. Cristina and Daniele were born and raised in this grey-stoned hamlet, a medieval outpost of the Kingdom of the Lombards. Although their pride in Lago is palpable, few of the Laghitani I meet live here all year round. Like many young people from southern Italy, they have left in search of opportunities that are scarce in Calabria.The Sustaria festival puts a spotlight on Calabria’s ancient agrarian and cultural heritageIt’s against this backdrop that Cristina co-founded Sustarìa. “The trend is longstanding and severe,” she tells me, “but people still live here, and there are communities that thrive despite the problems. If more people stay or return, things will get better.” By spotlighting the allure of the region’s heritage, she hopes to play a part in this.With agriculture historically shaping Calabria’s economy and its inhabitants’ daily lives, many traditions have agrarian roots. The dance that erupted on the festival’s first night was thetarantella. It features distinctive footwork, with dancers kicking their heels rapidly. “It’s a dance of the field workers,” Cristina says. “Some say it began as a way to sweat out venom from spider bites during harvests; others say tired workers in need of a creative outlet danced slowly and just with their feet, and over time the pace and range of movement increased.”View image in fullscreenOlive groves at Agriturismo Cupiglione which offers guest rooms close to LagoThe vocals on display that night told of another aspect of the region’s history: its frequent colonisation. Calabria was variously conquered by Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Normans, Arabs, Lombards and Bourbons. The folk songs we heard were replete with Greek scales and Arabic cadences, a melting pot of Mediterranean timbres.After the concert, the crowd migrated to a field by a small waterfall on the outskirts of Lago for dinner featuring regional dishes:rosamarina(the pescatarian version ofnduja, known as “Calabrian caviar” made from tiny fish); fried courgette flowers;cipollarossa di Tropea(red onions from the popular beachtown of Tropea); andpecorinocrotonese, a sheep’s cheese from the Crotone province.Over dinner I spoke with two other festival organisers, Claudia and her husband Alberto. Claudia, a Lago native, returned permanently, after a career in aerospace engineering, to run the B&BAgriturismo Cupiglionewith Alberto. Nestled in woodland a few kilometres from Lago, Cupiglione was founded 25 years ago by Claudia’s parents as a restaurant with guest rooms. After closing during the pandemic, it was renovated and reopened in 2023 as a B&B with seven rooms for up to 18 guests (doubles from €40). The change in direction paid off, and Cupiglione has since welcomed hundreds of visitors to the area, evenly split between Italian and international travellers.During my stay, I’m lodging in a house on the edge of Lago, thanks to the Sustarìa team. Hospitality runs deep during the festival; organisers open up their homes and those of their relatives to anyone who enquires through social media. Other options abound during the festival and year-round, including B&Bs such as Cupiglione andA Casa di Ely(doubles from €60), a short walk from where I stayed.View image in fullscreenA musician playing the zampogna, an ancient form of bagpipes.Photograph: Valentina ProcopioThe following afternoon, I return to the field beforeaperitivi, where I meet up with Cristina, who explains the growth of her initiative: “Initially, it was just locals who came to Sustarìa, but then people from other parts of Italy and even other countries started coming. Every year it grows.” This year, there are nearly 600 people in attendance.Eric, a Londoner studying in Zurich, is one such international guest. Eric also attendedFelici & Conflenti, a festival in late July hosted by friends of the Sustarìa team, which focuses on preserving and reviving the region’s ancient music. It has held 11 editions over as many years, each one featuring a winter and summer instalment, to which more people flock each year. It takes place in Conflenti, a small inland village nestled at the foot of the Reventino mountain, at the confluence of two small rivers (hence its name).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I stroll over, and catch sight of someone playing thezampogna,which looks like a set of bagpipes improvised from foraged materials, and is truly ancient – it counts the Roman emperor Nero among its historical admirers.Initially, it was just locals who came to Sustarìa, but then people from other parts of Italy and even other countries started comingThe next morning, we head to the hilltop town of Fiumefreddo Bruzio, a short drive from Lago and officially recognised as one of “Italy’s most beautiful villages”. Clinging to the western slopes of the Apennines, this medieval village offers panoramic views of the swelling coastline, which traces the Tyrrhenian Sea. Its narrow, meandering streets are lined with squat houses made of the local grey stone, quarried from the surrounding mountains. We wander around Il castello della Valle,a sprawling 13th-century Norman castle partly destroyed by Napoleonic troops, but retaining a splendidportale Rinascimentale–or Renaissance gate – still in excellent condition.View image in fullscreenCastello della Valle in Fiumefreddo Bruzio, one of ‘Italy’s most beautiful villages’.Photograph: Yuriy Brykaylo/AlamyAt Palazzo Rossi, on the edge of town, we take a seat at a cafe and sip local craft beer as we admire the view of the active volcano Mount Stromboli, across the water.“You should see it in the winter,” Cristina says. “The air is cooler, so it becomes even clearer. Everything here is completely different in the winter, but most people don’t see it as visitors come mainly in the summer,” she adds with a note of regret.The sun starts to sink into the horizon. In the square, a band starts setting up for an evening gig. A waiter brings over a plate of bread and olives to our table, on the house. “Things are quieter but not empty. There are almost as many events as in summer. And you get to see how the locals live during the rest of the year.” Cristina tears off a piece of bread. “And, of course, the hospitality never changes – people are always welcomed with open arms.”Sustarìa will return to Lago for its sixth instalment on 1-3 August 2026.

Autumn feels like the true social season of the year: the guest bedroom (for which we have an informal booking system) is full through to the end of the year, and suddenly every weekend and many weekday evenings are wrapped around company. Even if it’s just dinner at home for house guests, the rhythm has changed.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When it’s just us for dinner, anything goes – it is very relaxed and informal, and the emphasis is on ease of execution and speed of service. For a dinner party, meanwhile, we go all out: trips to the butcher and speciality deli, and as much time in the kitchen as is needed. But cooking for, and indeed with, house guests falls somewhere delightfully in between: cosy and welcoming, elevated but not exhausting. The kind of food that says: you’re here, you matter, let’s linger.This autumn, we’ve been turning to the sort of recipes that hit that sweet spot. Rukmini Iyer’sroast red pepper and tomato orecchiette, topped with pistachios and ricotta, is an easy win – full of colour and comfort, but smart enough for guests. On chillier evenings, a pot of Felicity Cloake’svegetable tagine, fragrant with saffron, squash, olives and prunes, practically cooks itself while you pour the wine and set the table.View image in fullscreenEasy breakfast … Honey and Co’s sesame and pine nut air fryer granola.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian.And, for the kind of meal that asks very little of you, meaning it’s just perfect for the last night of a long weekend, we love Gill Meller’schicken, paprika and tomato stew(pictured top), one of those dishes that comes out of the oven bubbling and ready to serve straight from the pan.In the mornings, when houseguests drift into the kitchen in their slippers, there’s nothing better than a batch ofgranola: crunchy, gently sweet and endlessly adaptable, it’s the kind of thing you can make ahead and keep in a jar, ready for slow breakfasts and second cups of coffee. And, of course, when there are guests around, it’s never a bad idea to havea good, breakfast-friendly loaf cakekicking around.This kind of cooking isn’t about showmanship, it’s about care. The dishes are forgiving, happy to wait a little, and they make space for friends to join in the cooking, to help set the table, for stories, laughter and another glass of wine. The tablecloth might not be ironed, the chairs might not match, but there’s a warmth that makes everything glow, and that makes us not mind all of the laundry that comes with operating a free bed-and-breakfast.My week in foodView image in fullscreenMake it at home … Mandy Yin’s spicy glass noodle and prawn salad.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian.Autumn reading (and eating)|Our cookbook of the season isMandy Yin’s Simply Malaysian, a cuisine that, until now, has rather intimidated us.

Right.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Similarly, Maureen Robinson, who worked in whisky for more than 45 years, was inducted into theWhisky Magazine Hall of Fame as recently as 2020. “There are also more women studying Stem subjects [science, technology, engineering and mathematics], which is usually a requirement in roles such as distilling and blending.”Support from within the industry is crucial to these women’s success, which is where theOurWhisky Foundationcomes in: this non-profit, established in March 2022 byBecky Paskin, supports women working in whisky internationally, and has the backing of the wider industry. Its dedicated editorial output (managed byaward-winning drinks writer Millie Milliken) is a bulletin for women’s wins in the industry.On the consumer side of things, are we seeing more women there, too? A few months ago, pop divaSabrina Carpenter was namedas the new face of Johnnie Walker, which, though it received a mixed reception from industry professionals, made something very clear: brands are targeting a female audience right at the nascence of their drinking habits, to secure the whisky drinkers of the future. (I doubt many 60-year-old old-school whisky collectors will be scrambling for the Johnnie Walker because Carpenter put her name to it, but I might be wrong.) That audience is growing, too: women now make up36% of whisky drinkers, up fromjust 15% in the 1990s. I asked Fikayo Ifaturoti, founder ofCellar Atelier, a wine and spirits consultancy, if she’s noticed an uptake in her female clientele: “I’ve seen women’s engagement deepen, but whisky still feels like ‘the other room’: admired by many, yet seldom invited into their collections,” she says. “For many men, whisky has long carried generational meaning – a father passing down a bottle, a toast at milestones – but women are often written out of that narrative.”Distillery experiences, for example, which tend to be built around clay shooting or fishing, rarely imagine how other audiences, especially women, wish to engage. “Why do we see special editions for Father’s Day, say, but not for Mother’s Day?” Ifaturoti asks. “The next frontier is the marketplace, and to craft experiences with women in mind as well as men.”Four whiskies defined by womenLaphroaig 10-Year-Old Single Malt Whisky£31 (on offer; 70cl) Waitrose, 40%.

Just reach for a lid and let the steam do its workBen LippettThu 6 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareSo, hear me out: the best baked eggs don’t ever hit the oven … When testing these recipes, I found that simply adding a lid creates a steamy environment to cook the top of the eggs, delivering a gently cooked, perfectly poached egg with a tender white and a warm, runny yolk. The intense, dry heat of the oven is much more aggressive than steam, and has a tendency to dry everything out and overcook the yolk. I’ve given you two sauces as a jumping-off point, but get creative. One is a super-simple turmeric coconut curry, while the merguez ragu is a riff on eggs in purgatory, or, to the likes of you and me, eggs baked in spicy tomato sauce.Turmeric coconut curry baked eggs (pictured above)Prep10 minCook55 minServes2Olive oil1 onion,peeled and finely choppedFine sea salt2 garlic cloves,peeled and finely chopped10g fresh ginger,peeled and finely chopped1 tbsp ground turmeric½ tbsp cumin seeds6-8 curry leaves200ml coconut milk400g tin chickpeasA few basil leaves, plus extra to serve4 eggs2 green finger chillies, finely sliced, to serveSet a 25cm heavy cast-iron pot or frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add a shot of olive oil, toss in the onion and a pinch of salt, and cook for five to six minutes, until the onion is starting to crisp and caramelise. Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric, cumin seeds and curry leaves, leave to sizzle, stirring occasionally, for three to four minutes, then tip in the coconut milk and the chickpeas and their tin liquid. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and leave it to tick over for 30-35 minutes, until thickened and deep yellow in colour. Season with salt, then stir in the basil leaves.Use the back of a spoon to create four little pockets in the sauce, then crack an egg into each. Sprinkle the top of each egg with a little salt, then cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low heat for two to three minutes, until the whites are set and the yolks just warm. Take off the heat, finish with a few extra basil leaves and thinly sliced finger chillies, and serve.Merguez ragu and pickled peppers baked eggsView image in fullscreenBen Lippett’s merguez ragu and pickled peppers baked eggs.Prep10 minCook45 minServes2Olive oil2 merguez-style lamb sausages1 tbsp harissa1 tsp cumin seeds2 garlic cloves,peeled and thinly sliced400g good-quality tinned tomatoesFine sea salt4 eggs1 handful pickled peppers,roughly chopped1 small handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped3 tbsp thick Greek yoghurt1 lemon,cut into wedges, to serveSet a 25cm heavy cast-iron pot or frying pan on a medium heat. Add two tablespoons of olive oil and, once it’s warm, remove the skins from the sausages and pinch small amounts of the meat into the pan, almost like little meatballs. Turn down the heat, then slowly brown the sausagemeat so it renders out all that spicy, flavour-packed fat. Roll the merguez pieces around the pan as they cook, so they colour on all sides.Once browned, add the harissa, cumin seeds and sliced garlic to the pan, turn up the heat to medium and cook, stirring, for three to four minutes, until the mix smells fragrant and the garlic has lost its raw edge. Tip in the tomatoes, season with salt and bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat to low and leave to blip away for 20 minutes.

It was Deptford market in the late 2000s: a reliably chaotic, noisy morass of jostling bodies, the wafted smell of sweating burger onions and a vast section where the “stalls” generally comprised gatherings of orphaned trainers, boxy VHS players and other random house-clearance items dumped on to lengths of tarpaulin. I was an eager but gastronomically green 25-year-old in my first proper flatshare and this ragtag locus of trade became an early site of core dining memories. I thoughtfully appraised very ordinary vegetables, channelling Rick Stein inGascony; bought warm, hectically seeded granary loaves from the Percy Ingle bakery; ate average pub Thai, better kerbside rotisserie chicken; and generally tried, with limited success, to ignore the creeping sense that I had settled in a part of town that wanted for some structure or culinary vitality.It was this atmosphere of cultural nascence into which the Deptford Projecttrundled. Predominantly housed on a former railway yard in the midst of redevelopment, this cafe, cultural hub and outdoor cinema was located around a decommissioned 1960s commuter train, boldly redecorated and reimagined by designerMorag Myerscough: a becalmed, brightly daubed piece of rolling stock that, between 2008 and 2014, jutted out into the high street like a glitch in the urban matrix. Though it sounds, I know, like an unforgivable cliche of “gritty” hipsterdom, the Deptford Project had a ramshackle edge, a palpable community ethos, genuinely affordable prices and a charming streak of weirdness (the toilet, if memory serves, was an eternally freezing garden shed turned into a shrine to Elvis).An umami-boosting lick of Marmite turns it into a soothing, early winter warmer, and a repository for new-season leeks.I do not remember a great deal about the menu of homemade cakes, sandwiches and brunch plates purportedly featuring eggs laid by the cafe’s own free-range hens. But what I do remember is the homity pie: a hulking great wedge of pastry with a crumbly, butter-rich shortness, generously filled with soft hunks of potato suspended in a set, sweetly lactic cheese and leek sauce. Homity was, to my vegetarian option-averse sensibilities, a total revelation; quiche mistranslated by a rugged, carb-addicted farmhand. And while it has a certain homespun, cosy-jumpered old-fashionedness – boosted by its association with the Devon land girls who supposedly invented it, as well asCranks, the pioneering vegetarian restaurant chain that popularised it – I think an umami-boosting lick of Marmite turns it into an intensely soothing, early winter warmer, and repository for new-season leeks.Serve with winter tomatoes or sharply dressed salad leaves. Above all, savour the fact that this expression of thrifty, comfort-forward resourcefulness works just as well in a contemporary home kitchen as it did in a train carriage cafe in credit-crunched, transitional Deptford.Marmite and leek homity pieServes6320g sheet shortcrust pastry(shop-bought is fine)20g unsalted butterOlive oil1 medium onion, peeled and chopped1 leek, washed, trimmed and finely slicedSalt and black pepper2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped600gfloury potatoes, peeled and quartered100g baby spinach leaves2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped1 tsp grated nutmeg1 tsp English mustard1 heaped tbsp Marmite200g grated hard cheese(mature cheddar, gruyere or, even better, a mixture of the two)150ml double creamBegin by rolling out the pastry so that it can be pressed into the base of a 20cm springform tin or greased pie dish, with any excess trimmed off and saved for another use. Heat the butter and a generous glug of olive oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed saucepan or wok. Add the chopped onion and leek, and season thoroughly, before frying over a low to medium heat for 10 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further five minutes.Meanwhile, boil the potatoes in salted water for about 10 minutes, until tender, then drain and add to the softened onion mix. Fold in the spinach leaves, spring onions, nutmeg, mustard, Marmite, 150g of the grated cheese and the double cream. Stir thoroughly to combine.Pour the cheese-and-potato mixture into the pastry-lined dish, level, then grate the remaining 50g cheese on top. Bake in the middle of a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 40 minutes, until golden and bubbling. Leave the pie to cool and set for at least 20 minutes, then turn out on to a plate and slice into thick wedges.Picky, by Jimi Famurewa, is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £20.
