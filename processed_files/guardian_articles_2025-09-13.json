Inside the plot to bring down the prime ministerWith his government mired in scandal, an operation to dethrone Starmer is now under wayPippa CrerarandJessica ElgotSat 13 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 04.25 EDTShareThere has been a joke going aroundLabourMPs over the past week about three envelopes in Soviet Russia. “Whenever you run into trouble, open them in order,” the instructions go. Envelope one says: “Blame your predecessor.” So he does – and it works. The party officials are satisfied. A year later, problems arise again. He opens envelope two. It says: “Restructure the organisation.”He does a big reshuffle, changes some titles, and again buys himself some time. Finally, another crisis comes. He opens envelope three. It says: “Prepare three envelopes.”The problem forKeir Starmeris that the MPs sharing the joke believe he has already opened his first two. It is becoming increasingly hard to find anybody in the Labour party who will argue that things are going anything other than disastrously for the government.They fear that attempts to deal with the multiple difficulties faced by the prime minister over the past year – many of them self-inflicted errors such as thewinter fuel dutydecision, the freebies row and the handling of welfare cuts – have instead unleashed more chaos.The most recent example of this is thesacking of Peter Mandelson. When ministers warned that his scandal-ridden history indicated he was more of a risk than an asset – even when the security services allegedly shared concerns – Starmer went ahead and appointed him.View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson, who Starmer defended at PMQs.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThen, even though Mandelson had warned publicly that more “embarrassing” emails from him to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were about to be published, Starmer defended him at prime minister’s questions.With his political judgment repeatedly questioned, Labour people turn to his “vision” for Britain. The problem is they can’t identify what the prime minister really believes in. Allies say he doesn’t like the “V word” and has made no secret of being a distinctly non-ideological politician.Instead, he believes the government should demonstrate change by making a material difference to people’s lives, through schools, the NHS, the immigration system and the economy, even if that is in relatively slow, incremental steps.“It’s hopeless,” one minister said. “Too many people feel the country is in decline and the only route back is big, radical solutions. We’re doing lots of good stuff but it barely gets noticed. It just doesn’t hit the mark.”The question being asked in the tea rooms and bars and corridors of Westminster is whether Starmer is up to the task of finding the solutions the country needs. And, increasingly, the conclusion reached among MPs is: “No.”There are, of course, those in government and close to Starmer who urge calm. One veteran party figure said: “I don’t know what they’re all panicking about. Keir is sitting on a massive majority and it’s more than three years until the next election. They’ve got time to turn things around.”But the doubt has set in. Not just that Starmer has shown a lack of political judgment, ideological vision, or – especially when compared with the charisma of Nigel Farage – personality. But that he never had it in the first place.No governing party as far back as the 1980s has seen itspolling fall so farin its first year in power. And with the rise of Reform UK, Labour MPs worry that time is running out.The question of ‘how’It is not unusual or surprising for MPs to grumble about their party leaders – nor to discuss how they might theoretically get rid of them and replace them with somebody else.But this time it appears to be more than just idle gossip. The Guardian has spoken to MPs, ministers – including at cabinet level – and party officials who claim that below-the-radar operations to oust the prime minister are already in place.“The conversation has moved on from ‘if’. Now it’s about ‘who’ and ‘how’,” one MP involved in plotting said. The summer recess, when the government vacated the public arena and allowed Reform UK to shape the narrative, crystallised the need for a change.“Before then, there were quite a lot of people saying we’ve got to make it work. We came back after the summer, the mood had significantly hardened,” one MP said.“People in their constituencies have been getting terrible feedback. Farage has been everywhere. The mood was: this has been a fucking disaster. We’ve been given nothing to do. The government just cleared the pitch.”View image in fullscreenMorgan McSweeney: a lightning rod for MPs’ anger.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockOthers have been reflecting on the timing, with the general view that next May’s local elections – with Wales and dozens of councils in the north of England at risk of falling to Reform, and Scotland staying in the hands of the SNP – are a moment of particular peril for Starmer.But some don’t believe Starmer can survive even that long. After Downing Street’s leaden-footed response to the Mandelson row, furious MPs turned their ire on Morgan McSweeney, the No 10 chief of staff. But for most he is just a lightning rod for all their anger and disappointment.“I’m not even sure Starmer can survive until May,” one Blair-era cabinet minister said. “The mood is dire. The message from pretty much across the board was that one more major issue like Rayner/Peter and the dam would burst. But this is the Labour party so we shall see.”Labour is not known for regicide. Unlike the Conservatives, there is no 1922 Committee to write to, nor a device that prompts a confidence vote. The Labour party, ironically, acts more like a gentleman’s club. If a vote of confidence is called and carried, a leader might be expected to do the honourable thing and resign. But Jeremy Corbyn did not resign when 80% of his MPs did not back him.Over the summer recess, some ambitious MPs from the new intake met up away from Westminster to discuss the dire state of the polls. Many of them have long careers close to or within Labour, and know well the particular difficulties of the party’s leadership system when it comes to the prospect of removing an unpopular leader.Under the party rules, unless there is a vacancy, potential challengers need the support of at least 20% of MPs – meaning there is a threshold of 80 to trigger a contest. Starmer would automatically be on the ballot if he wished.Alternatively, if Starmer’s personal approval rating doesn’t improve, his praetorian guard – potentially including McSweeney – could advise him it was time to stand down for the sake of the country, although they would also be putting themselves out of a job.The question of ‘who’Even for those MPs who feel they have answered the “how” part of the equation, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the “who”. “If we learnt one thing from the Tories, it should be that you must have a plan before you act. I don’t think there is a perfect candidate in the current cabinet,” said one MP.With Angela Rayner forced to stand down from government and a future comeback looking uncertain, the bookies’ favourite is, at least for now, firmly out of the picture. As the figure to whom the party would almost certainly have turned, her departure offers Starmer a lifeline.Other names on the soft left of the party that get thrown into the mix include Ed Miliband, who MPs say has not ruled out a comeback, and Louise Haigh, the sacked transport secretary known to be a formidable organiser.On the right of the party, some MPs remain loyal to Wes Streeting as a future leader. “He has 10 times the charisma,” one said. “But I don’t know what his path is without some kind of deal with the left to prevent a contest. He could have done with Angela, maybe. But I don’t know what that really looks like now.”Allies claim that private polling of the membership is more encouraging for Streeting than might be expected. He is understood to have always been McSweeney’s preferred choice as a successor, and the two men are close. But he alsoalmost lost his seatat the general election, over Gaza.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, who is running for the deputy leadership, and Shabana Mahmood, the impressive new home secretary, also have ambitions that could yet be thwarted by a left-leaning membership. Neither has a leadership operation in place, although Phillipson will presumably build one for the deputy race and some MPs are already acting as outriders for Mahmood.The one name, however, that has attracted more and more warmth over recent months is that ofAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester. MPs have shared data showing he is the only Labour politician with a net positive rating from the public. A third of the UK sees him favourably which is the political equivalent of a rave review.Burnham also reaches across the party. The Guardian has spoken to individuals in both the centrist Labour Growth Group of MPs and in the Socialist Campaign Group who have all come to the conclusion that he is the only option.He has backed Mainstream, a new network set up to change Labour’s direction, and which will inevitably be seen as a vehicle that could be quickly transformed into a leadership operation if needed. When asked by the Guardian last week, Burnham did not rule out the possibility of running in a future leadership contest with the network’s support.Burnham is not an MP and therefore is not eligible to run but this is not an insurmountable problem. Senior Labour party figures revealed that an existing Manchester MP who is in ill health is ready to stand down, causing a byelection – the party leadership is likely to do everything it can to block it.View image in fullscreenAndy Burnham: ‘ready to come back’.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA MediaOne Burnham ally said: “Andy is ready to come back but it needs to be asap. He needs to be in place before the May elections in order to be ready. He also needs to be upfront about why he wants to come back and challenge the leadership to defy the party’s wishes.”But even among those who think Starmer has to go there is still uncertainty about the wisdom of such a move. “There’s a calculation that needs to be made,” one cabinet minister said. “We might get a boost if we put in place a different leader and they quickly get a grip. But there’s a danger that we’re basically saying to the country that we’re the same as the Tories.”Could ‘doing better’ save Starmer?So what can Starmer do about it? His allies say he is deeply frustrated that, having spent the summer thinking about how to improve government delivery and reshape the narrative, his efforts have been so spectacularly undermined by all the “noise and nonsense” of recent days.“Frankly, it has been derailed by a deputy prime minister who wasn’t able to get her tax affairs in order or her story straight, and the serial lies and deceit of Peter Mandelson,” a source close to Starmer said.“No one is oblivious to the scale of the challenge or the need to be better, least of all Keir. We know it’s a difficult time and MPs are worried about their own majorities. We’re more aware than anyone that things are very febrile.”They insisted that Starmer, as a decent, sensible, pragmatic leader was “uniquely well placed” to take on Nigel Farage’s rightwing populists and their exploitation of grievance and narrative of failure.“We need an antidote to Farage and Trump, not our own version of it. The antidote is delivering change and making lives better. He knows he needs to do that. And he knows we need to do better,” one said.But even before the May local elections there are dangerous flashpoints for the prime minister. While rising public concern over small boat crossings and the potential for tax rises in the budget were always going to be difficult challenges, with the existing mood of the party, either could now bring him down.And yet even among the small handful of people who are actively plotting Starmer’s downfall, there is a fear that even a shiny new leader would be overcome by the deep systemic challenges facing the country, and help usher in the age of Farage.“This government is adrift – bobbing like a tiny cork on waves it does not have the courage to battle,” said one government insider. “But even Thatcher and Blair would be struggling right now. The mix of global issues, economic disaster zone, public services crisis and immigration is a truly horrendous cocktail.”"

Are there other solutions?Kaamil AhmedSat 13 Sep 2025 06.01 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 06.02 EDTShareIt was a year in to driving his daughter to school in his new electric vehicle that Phil Bellamy discovered she dreaded the 10-minute daily ride – it made her feel sick in a way no other car did.As the driver, Bellamy had no problems with the car but his teenage daughters struggled with sickness every time they entered the vehicle.Research has shownthis is an issue – people who did not usually havemotion sicknessin a conventional car found that they did in EVs.For Bellamy, 51, his family’s aversion to riding in his car made him wonder at the cause. He tried changing his driving style and even buying a different car but found the issues persisted. His daughters now refuse to travel with him, if possible.“If we’re going on a journey, they’re absolutely taking travel sickness tablets immediately. They’re not even considering coming in the car without them,” he says.Bellamy enjoys driving his electric car, which is quieter and smoother compared with the vibrations of a traditional combustion engine car, but hopes manufacturers will consider how to address the concerns of passengers who are affected by motion sickness.The causes of sickness could include the relatively quick acceleration of EVs compared to fuel vehicles, their regenerative braking systems and a lack of sensory triggers such as engine noise and vibrations when travelling in a car.Research carried out in China, a big producer of electric cars, found that EVs were associated with more severe motion sickness symptoms than fuel vehicles.Atiah Chayne, a content creator from London,posted on TikTokabout her experiences of car sickness in EVs this summer when she booked Ubers to take her out.Why do I get car sick and my boyfriend doesn’t? I asked expertsRead moreChayne says “extreme nausea” kicked in very quickly and stopped immediately after she left the vehicle, but it took her a while to realise it happened only in EVs. She now avoids using Ubers as it’s difficult to find one that is not an EV.Chayne says: “It usually started quickly soon after we moved off. I’d say it got really bad one minute into the journey. I would put the windows down and go on my phone to distract myself,” she says. “The sickness was constantly there throughout the whole journey. If your Uber is 20 minutes away from your destination, you’re counting down the minutes until you get out.”John Golding, a professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster in London, says motion sickness specifically affects passengers because it is, in large part, related to being able to anticipate changes in movement.While drivers have control of the car’s movement, passengers do not – especially those in the back seat – and he thinks this could become more of an issue with the potential introduction of self-driving cars.He says the car industry is aware of motion sickness issues for some people in EVs and is looking at ways to help passengers anticipate changes in movement,such as vibrations in the car seatthat warn the passenger when the car is turning.Golding says people can also either take motion sickness medication or make behavioural changes. “The simplest thing is to sit in the front to get a view. Avoid moving your head too much, don’t look at your phone or start reading; that makes things much worse. If you can get some fresh air, that will help,” he says.View image in fullscreenBackseat passengers have no control over the car’s movements.Photograph: Bsip Sa/AlamyHow to cope with motion sicknessExperts andthe NHS suggestbehavioural changes, medication and acupressure bands could help.Sit at the frontKnowing what’s going on around you is the best way to avoid motion sickness. It allows you to see and anticipate what will happen next, while in the back the view just flashes past, says Golding.Try motion sickness medicationsThese come in the form of patches or tablets that can be bought from pharmacies and help control how your brain and body react to movement. They should be takenbefore travelling.WearacupressurebandsThese are thought to work for some, though research suggests probably through a placebo effect. “Placebo effects can be very, very strong. If they work for an individual, don’t knock it,”Golding says.Listen to a 100hz soundfor a minute.Researchfrom Japan’s Nagoya University suggests the vibrations at this frequency could help by stimulating a part of the inner ear that detects gravity and acceleration.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringEthical and green livingGreenhouse gas emissionsSelf-driving carsTravel and transportHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But as the band finished the US leg of their long-awaited reunion tour last weekend, it was clear:Oasishas finally taken over America.View image in fullscreenLiam (left) and Noel Gallagher of Oasis play their second sold-out night at the Rose Bowl.Photograph: Rich Polk/Variety/Getty ImagesIn the days leading up to the two sold-out shows, it felt like the entire city was obsessed. Coffee shops and bars were full of people in Oasis T-shirts, bucket hats and little round sunglasses. On social media feeds, there was an abundance of memes aboutnewly minted Anglophilesand jokeT-shirtssaying “I made it home from Oasis at the Rose Bowl.” A headline inVariety read: “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend.”That all might come as a surprise to those who were in the US in the 1990s. Yes, everyone knows Wonderwall, and the bandhas sold 7 million albums here. But by comparison,Nirvana has sold more than 27 millionin the US; even Gin Blossomshave sold 10 million, and you probably need a second to remember who they are.“I had a feeling they’d never take to us,” Liam latersaid of the US. It was a matter of contrast, as theNew York Timespointed out: they had a top-10 song and No 2 album, but it was nothing like the legendary stature they achieved at home. In the pre-2025 US, it was easy to perceive Oasis as part of a parade of 90s rockers with a few big hits.But in 2025, things have been very different. The US tour, with stadium dates in the Chicago, New York and LA areas, sold out in an hour. Huge billboards showcased Liam and Noel’s faces. There were pop-up exhibitions and pre-show parties. The LA shows drew a flock of celebrities, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kristen Stewart to Doug Emhoff, husband of Kamala Harris. Even Mark Zuckerberg, whose circuitry was just coming online in the 90s, was there.They made an unforgettable concert a religious experiencean Oasis fanAnd these fans were not just there for Wonderwall; nor were many of them even born when the band took off. On Sunday, the last night of the US tour, energy was pulsing through the Rose Bowl as the crowd formed long lines in the field around the stadium, slowly filing in. The queues for merchandise – $50 T-shirts and $25 posters – snaked so far beyond the barriers that it was difficult to tell where one line ended and the next began. But it was unclear why anyone would need the gear, given that nearly everyone seemed to be wearing it already.The mood in the stands was jubilant, as strangers chatted to each other before erupting into cheers at the sight of the Gallaghers walking onstage. For the next two hours, the crowd was on their feet, singing at the top of their lungs and dancing in front of their seats. The night before, Noel had dedicated a song to a woman in the crowd who had spent the whole night in tears; given the feeling in the stadium, it was easy to see why. And that sense of community was not limited to LA. “Best concert I’ve been to EVER. I’m 59, have seen a lot of shows,and [sic] I was completely blown away,” wrote one fan on Reddit of the Chicago show. “The crowd … people I’ve never met from Texas to Wisconsin where I was standing… were like brothers. They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience.”View image in fullscreenThe Rose Bowl crowd.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersBut LA – or Pasadena, or wherever the fuck we were, to paraphrase Liam – was, in many ways, an appropriate place to end the reunion tour. It’s the city where the band performed a notoriously disastrous, drug-fueled concert in 1994. A roadie reportedly put the wrong setlist in front of some members, so that “they were all playing different songs at the same time,” Jason Rhodes, a guitar tech, toldRolling Stone. In the aftermath, Noel left town and headed north to San Francisco to see Melissa Lim, a woman he had met earlier in the tour. “I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band,” she told theSan Francisco Chronicle in 2016. She helped convince him not to quit – the subject of the song Talk Tonight, which Oasis played last weekend. This time, Lim herself was in attendance: “30 years and worth the wait,” sheposted on Instagram.Do you remember the first time? Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go awayRead moreBut what happened over those 30 years that transformed the American perception of Oasis from merely a successful band into genuine rock icons? The music writerLizzy Goodmanpoints to the Gallagher brothers’unfiltered, brashpersonas – a balm for gen Zers who “have grown up in a world where everyone everywhere is afraid of saying or posting or retweeting the wrong thing”. Meanwhile, the passage of time has proven that the songs aretimeless, and the band is a reminder of “a more innocent, obnoxious, fun time, when the world didn’t feel so trapped in fear”. That might explain the sense of overflowing joy at the Rose Bowl last weekend: at a time when every day seems to bring a new horror and more brutal division, it offered a rare chance to embrace camaraderie.The US tour began with something akin to a threat from the band: “America. Oasis is coming. You have one last chance to prove that you loved us all along.”Maybe we finally have.Explore more on these topicsOasisLos AngelesLiam GallagherNoel GallagherWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That culture was everywhere before feminismRebecca SolnitFeminism exposed the ubiquity of child abuse, rape, sexual harassment and domestic violence – and helped fight that cultureSat 13 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareIwas there. I kept the receipts. I remember how normalized the sexual exploitation of teenage girls and even tweens by adult men was, how it showed up in movies, in the tales of rock stars and “baby groupies”, in counterculture and mainstream culture, how normalized rape, exploitation, grooming, objectification, commodification was.The last Woody Allen movie I ever saw was Manhattan,in which he cast himself as more or less himself, a dweeb in his mid-40s, dating a high school student played by Mariel Hemingway. She was my age, 17, and I was only too familiar with creeps, and the movie creeped me out, even though it was only long afterward that I read that she said he was at the timepressuring herto get sexually involved with him in real life.As the Epstein case shows, Trump’s Maga faithful care about only one kind of sex-crime victim | Emma BrockesRead moreManhattan came out in 1979; two years earlier Roman Polanski, on the pretext that he was taking photographs for French Vogue, got a 13-year-old girl to come alone to a house, where he drugged and raped her vaginally and anally. The probation officer assigned to himwrote: “There was some indication that circumstances were provocative, that there was some permissiveness by the mother,” and “that the victim was not only physically mature, but willing”. In her own account, the girl had said no repeatedly and even pretended to have an asthma attack to try to dissuade him, but the probation officer was of his era and only too willing to blame a drugged child. That was normal then.Movies of the 1970s normalized all this. Jodie Foster was 12 when she played a prostitute in Taxi Driver. In Pretty Baby, an 11-year-old Brooke Shields played another prostitute in quaint New Orleans whose virginity is auctioned off, and who appears nude in some scenes, as she did in a Playboy Magazine special “sugar and spice” issue at age 10. In Milos Forman’s 1971 Taking Off, the runaway 15-year-old daughter of the protagonist reappears with a rock star boyfriend. Groupie culture included more than a few children sleeping with rock stars; Interview Magazine recounts of one prominent groupie that she “lost her virginity at age 12 to Spirit guitarist Randy California. For a time, she was involved with Iggy Pop, who glorified their relationship in his 1996 songLook Away. I slept with Sable when she was 13 / Her parents were too rich to do anything.”It was the 70s in which the soft-focus color photographs of nude and semi-clad pubescent girls of David Hamilton were normalized as coffee table books and posters. By the 1990s, Jock Sturges’s black-and-white photographs of similar slender white girls shot in a nudist colony in the midst of puberty launched controversies. While he defended them with bland notions of high art and edenic life without shame, a former student of his made asemi-documentaryfilm about the sexual relationship she had with him when she was 14 and he was her art teacher, in the 1970s.Later on, when Brooke Shields tried to stop Gary Gross’s nude images of her at age 10 from circulating, as the Guardianreportedin 2009, “Gross’s lawyers argued that his photographs could not further damage Shields’s reputation because, since they were taken, she had made a profitable career “as a young vamp and a harlot, a seasoned sexual veteran, a provocative child-woman, an erotic and sensual sex symbol, the Lolita of her generation”. The judge concurred and, while praising the pictures’ “sultry, sensual appeal”, ruled that Gross was not a pornographer: “They have no erotic appeal except to possibly perverse minds.”That’s what the 1980s were like too. As an adult Molly Ringwaldwroteof the John Hughes teen movies in which she starred back then, “I’m a little embarrassed to say that it took even longer for me to fully comprehend the scene late in Sixteen Candles, when the dreamboat, Jake, essentially trades his drunk girlfriend, Caroline, to the Geek, to satisfy the latter’s sexual urges, in return for Samantha’s underwear. The Geek takes Polaroids with Caroline to have proof of his conquest; when she wakes up in the morning with someone she doesn’t know, he asks her if she ‘enjoyed it.’” That this was rape was not clear to Ringwald, as she says, or to audiences. In 1984, Rolling Stones bass player Bill Wyman, who was 47, began having a relationship with a child he met, claiming “she was a woman at thirteen”. Much later in her life, she advocated for raising Britain’s age of consent from 16 to 18,saying,“You are still a child – even at 16.”Before what got called the sexual revolution, prudery and propriety regarded girls and young women as the property of fathers and future husbands, and not besmirching the purity that was part of their value was at least grounds for saying no. The sexual revolution removed this barrier and when I was a teenager in the 1970s the general idea was that sex was good and everyone should have it, and so I started getting hit on by counterculture dudes when I was 12 or 13, as did my female peers. Everything meant yes; nothing meant no; almost no one aided girls who wanted to avoid these guys; we were on our own and had to become escape artists. In the alternative school I went to in the mid-1970s, in a nice suburb, 13-year-old girls were dating adult drug dealers, a 14-year-old showed off a ring from her middle-aged fiancee, and a 15-year-old got pregnant from a sailor on a nearby base and decided to have the baby. No adults seemed concerned.It was still a misogynist culture; sex was still framed largely in terms of male needs. One more striking piece of 1970s culture was the sexual ethos of the counterculture terrorists who kidnapped Patti Hearst in 1974: that it was “comradely” to meet the needs of others, and thus the women in the Symbionese Liberation Army were always supposed to say yes to the men, to meet the latter’s needs, never mind their own. So much for liberation.Founded in 1978, NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, was an organization of adult men actively campaigning for legalizing sex with male children, and was only gradually driven underground. Straight men didn’t need a special organization to advocate for them; the whole culture did. It was the Playboy Philosophy, it was Hollywood and rock’n’roll, cheesy art like David Hamilton’s, and sniggers and excuses.I write all this because the just-released 2003Jeffrey Epsteinbirthday album is a late relic of that culture, as is Donald Trump’s attitude toward women. Trump was often seen at Epstein’s events, packed with very young female models, at a time when models were sent out to mingle with affluent men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one, a photograph of three people holding a giant check to Epstein, with Trump’s signature (presumably not real), describing Epstein selling a “fully depreciated” woman whose name is redacted to Trump for $22,500. Depreciated is a real-estate term; the joke seems to be that somehow a woman has lost some of her value, but is still saleable as property, livestock, chattel or whatever term you use when you turn humans into property.In the other, a drawing of Epstein in 1983 approaching girl children with balloons and candy clearly recognizes him as a groomer; the other half of the pictures shows him in 2003 in a recliner being serviced by four young women or girls, two in thong bikini bottoms, one with Epstein’s initials tattooed on her butt cheek. It’s clear whoever contributed these suggestive pages to the Epstein album knew of his sexual appetite for young girls, and that a great many others did as well.What happened between the 1970s I’ve described and the present is feminism: feminism that insisted that women were people endowed with rights, that sex, as distinct from rape, had to be something both parties desired, that consent had to be active and conscious, that all human interactions involve power and that the vast power differential between adult men and children meant that no such consent was possible.It was feminism that exposed the ubiquity of child abuse, rape, sexual harassment and domestic violence, that denormalized these abuses that were so much part of patriarchal society. And still are, far too much, but the dismissive, permissive attitude of the past is past, at least in mainstream culture.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Though interior designers can work with generous budgets, the savvy ones also know how to spot great design in unlikely places (hello, B&Q).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you don’t have the budget for a full renovation, but still want to add a little design nous to your home, some help is at hand. We asked a range of experts in the interiors world for the pieces they’ve got their eye on – all of them less than £100.Classic desk lampView image in fullscreen£89 at Selfridges£89 at EndThe Apex desk clip lamp is simple, stylish and practical. Designed by the London-based product and furniture designer John Tree, it is inspired by the classic banker’s lamp. It’s perfect on my desk, but the timeless design means it also works in a bedroom or living room. It has a fun, folded steel shade that can be rotated 360 degrees, so you can direct light where you need it. Mine is emerald green, but it comes in pink, oyster and black, too.Dominic Myland, managing director, Mylands PaintsStainless steel coffee cup comboView image in fullscreen£40 at Love ÉcruCoffee is an essential part of my morning ritual, and the vessel I drink it from matters as much as the coffee itself, which is why I love these Venice mirror cups with saucer and spoon. I like their simplicity, the clean silhouette, the geometry of the cup, the way the spoon slots into the saucer: these elements all speak to considered design. There’s something subtly retro about them – late 70s, early 80s, a period I return to time and again for my own designs. They feel utilitarian but decorative, and the scale is just right – compact but not precious.Lee Broom,product designerAn extremely forgiving cactusView image in fullscreen£39.99 at Happy House PlantsWhen assimilated into interior design, hanging plants deliver a significant aesthetic impact while providing great value for money. Cacti are extremely forgiving, from my experience, in terms of maintenance and longevity. ThisRhisalisparadoxa,or chain cactus, native to tropical rainforests of Central and South America, is a winner. Characterised by cascading chains of vibrant green stems, it thrives in the UK and has the capacity to create a living curtain of greenery.Great for creating zones, adding texture and visual interest, a hanging plant is an invaluable tool for layering within a scheme; a pot of exuberant leafiness can often enhance an awkward corner. Plus plants actually improve air quality and the living environment, which is a double win!Edwina Boase,interior designerand consultantHand-painted ceramic wine coolerView image in fullscreen£65 at Lamp LondonI’m always drawn to splatter-glazed ceramics – there’s something so joyful and spontaneous about their painterly finish. This hand-painted Splatterware wine cooler comes in the dreamiest shade of butter yellow. It’s practical but also poetic, keeping your wine perfectly chilled while acting as a striking centrepiece. It’s a piece you’ll reach for time and again, whether for a simple supper for two or for a dinner party that gives summer vibes right through the winter.Carly Allison, head of brand and product,Fired Earth1970s-style rattan chairView image in fullscreen£74.99 at B&QGrowing up in the 70s, I fell I love with a beautiful peacock chair in my friend’s house. It was huge and had that glamorous, bohemian vibe that summed up the decade. Those curves and that natural texture made me feel as if I was sitting in something really special. Roll on a good few years and that retro style is now popping up everywhere, and I’ve found the perfect modern-day match.This real (no faux plastic here) rattan chair has the most gorgeous petal-shaped back, giving a subtle nod to those statement pieces of the past. As perfect in the garden as at the dining table, it has a designer look at a high-street price. For me it’s a slice of 70s nostalgia reimagined for my home today.Emma Morton-Turner,interiorstylist andfounder ofInside StylistsAn intriguing decorative boxView image in fullscreen£50 at LibertyIntriguing and secretive, designer boxes are the sort of things one can never have enough of in an elegant home. Whether or not one collects them, they evoke memories of travel and craftsmanship, and spark curiosity about what might be hidden inside. They may be small, but they are detailed and refined objects, with so much to say about your taste and home. This Piper striped circus box by Doing Goods, crafted from gold-tone brass, wood and red resin, makes an eye-catching addition to any dressing table.Tommaso Franchi,founder and director,Tomèf DesignBeautiful Italian espresso machineView image in fullscreen£65 at Alessi£65 at SelfridgesAs an interior designer, I believe even the smallest objects can elevate a space, and the Alessi Pulcina espresso coffee maker is a perfect example. With its sculptural, almost architectural form, this isn’t just a coffee maker – it’s a design statement. Crafted by Michele De Lucchi, the Pulcina blends form and function flawlessly, making it as much at home on a curated kitchen shelf as it is in use on a stovetop.Alicia Meireles,creative director,Own LondonAn instant impact table runnerView image in fullscreen£81 at Lisa CortiI love dressing tables so much that I have a dedicated tablecloth wardrobe filled with market-found fabrics, memorable napkins I’ve collected over the years and runners that add instant impact. One of my go-to brands is Lisa Corti, a small Italian label that blends bold colour and traditional craftsmanship. With its striking blue-and-white stripes and block-printed florals, this table runner brings me joy by transforming a simple setting into something special.Laura Jackson, co-founder,Glassette, and creator ofThe Art of Hostingskip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This hand-blown glassware is inspired by the sun-soaked vibrancy of the Florida city, full of sherbet pinks, citrus brights and that dreamy, hazy light. This Miami Darling glass, which comes in eight foot colours, feels like a small piece of functional art: equally at home on my desk, in the kitchen ready for a sunset cocktail, or even as a bud vase. It has a playful silhouette and brilliant colour that instantly lifts the mood – the kind of object that makes everyday rituals feel a little more special.Damla Turgut, founder and creative director,Otto Tiles & DesignHandmade butter dishView image in fullscreenFrom £52 at Peter Bowen ArtBread and butter always feels like home to me. With most of my school holidays spent in Ireland, memories of freshly baked soda bread and salty Irish butter will stay with me for ever. These days, weekend breakfasts with the family still involve fresh bread and, of course, butter. Presentation is as important as the contents, so a beautifully handmade receptacle, like this pottery butter dish with lid, in either a speckled finish or block colour, does the trick. It has a familiar, nostalgic feel that elevates the moment and carries on the tradition of a simple pleasure, bringing comfort and delight, time after time.Tori Murphy, textile designerCeramic diffuser to create a soothing aromaView image in fullscreen£45 at Oliver BonasI’ve learned that the way you experience a space is not based solely on how it looks, but on how it makes you feel. This can be massively affected by fragrance. Different aromas can set the tone for your home and add that extra layer of joy or nostalgia. I love to change my home’s scent depending on the season or my mood, and this ceramic electric diffuser does the job beautifully. Sculptural and contemporary, it is designed to mist and infuse our spaces with soothing oil scents.My favourites includeGrapefruit & Mandarin, which feels light and fresh, for misting during the day. Then, for a dinner with friends, something deeper –Geranium & Basilor Teakwood & Tobacco fromPF Candle Company(trust me – it’s delicious). Before bed, I add a few drops of something calming, such as peppermint, tea tree or lavender (Starter essential oil gift set).Mo Mason-Jones, interior designer,Flint LondonFor more, read our guide tothe best diffusersHome and away jewellery caseView image in fullscreen£85 at DaisyI am obsessed with my checkerboard Shrimps x Daisy jewellery case. It’s a great print, used in Shrimps’ ready-to-wear collection, and is always open on my chest of drawers, on a piece of natural linen, next to books and framed photographs. It’s a great pop of colour andthemost useful piece. I’m forgetful, so having one spot where I take off my jewellery every night is so helpful. It is also great for travelling: lots of compartments for earrings, rings and necklaces, so nothing gets tangled up. Just zip it up and off you go.Natalie Sytner, founder,Bettina CeramicaElegant metal side tablesView image in fullscreenFrom £69.99 at Zara HomeI keep coming back to these aged metal auxiliary tables, which I have bought for myself and numerous clients. Chic, versatile, affordable and useful, they are available in two sizes, and work well as a pair. They’re lightweight and sit beautifully indoors and out. Elegant of silhouette, they add the right touch of sophistication to a living room, balcony or bathroom corner. Use to hold your evening glass of wine, a potted geranium or favourite scented candle.Sophie Rowell, interior designer and founder,Côte de FolkWavy vase that makes a great focal pointView image in fullscreen£35.99 at Zara HomeThe Wavy Ceramic Vase x Collagerie is a statement piece that instantly caught my eye. Designed for Zara Home by fashion gurus and Collagerie founders Lucinda Chambers and Serena Hood, its unique shape makes a great focal point and chic addition to any table – and at £35.99, it’s a bargain. Whether it’s left empty or filled with simple foliage or flowers, it is one of those pieces that just pulls everything together.Lee Thornley,founder ofBert & MaytilesBeautiful yet functional oil pourersView image in fullscreen£35 each at Emily Paul Ceramics on InstagramI always keep an eye out for beautiful yet functional kitchen objects. I found a pair of contemporaryhand-thrown oil pourersat theKiln Roomsfestival recently. They’re perfect: simple, refined, beautiful objects, handmade in the UK. In neutral tones, finished in a soft flecked-cream glaze, they work in almost any kitchen setting. They’re subtle too (I don’t like having labels on show in the kitchen), lovely to look at and wonderful to hold, which is important, because they get daily use.Louise Willocks,managing director,The Modern HouseandInigoSide table as hero pieceView image in fullscreen£99 at MadeThis bright blue Logan side table is a perfect hero piece. The cemented design, painted to mimic a tiled surface, adds texture and charm, while its cheerful colour brings a burst of happiness that will brighten up grey autumn days. While designed for indoor and outdoor use, it really shines as an indoor addition. I’m a big fan of side tables in bathrooms, and this one would be perfect by the bath, providing a practical surface for your essentials.Clare Gaskin, director,Clare Gaskin interior design studioExplore more on these topicsInteriorsThe FilterHomesDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Marchers were arrested for a range of offences, including affray, violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage.The crowds were addressed by Elon Musk, who dialled in via video link and spoke of “the rapidly increasing erosion of Britain”, beforecalling for the dissolution of the UK parliament.The French far-right politician Éric Zemmour was also invited to speak. He told protesters they were subject to “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture”, adding that “you and we are being colonised by our former colonies”.The huge turnout meant attenders could not be contained within Whitehall, the endpoint of the march, where the rally was being held. The swelling numbers resulted in clashes with police with the Met saying officers “faced unacceptable violence” after being “assaulted with kicks and punches. Bottles, flares and other projectiles were thrown.”1:19Aerial footage shows scale of 'unite the kingdom' rally – videoAbout 5,000 counter-protesters from trade unions and anti-fascist groups marched in a separate route in central London.Large crowds displaying union jack and St George flags had been drifting into central London since the early morning in anticipation of the rally.Shortly before 1pm, people began marching across Westminster Bridge. The crowd, which was largely white, sang “Keir Starmer’s a wanker” to the tune of Seven Nation Army and broke into chants of “Tommy”, “Whose street? Our street” and “England”. Some also held signs in support of Tommy Robinson.On the approach to Whitehall, stalls sold books co-authored by Robinson titled “Manifesto: Free Speech, Real Democracy, Peaceful Disobedience” and “Mohammed’s Koran: Why Muslims Kill for Islam”.One elderly woman in a wheelchair, who travelled to attend from Merseyside with her son, held a sign with Charlie Kirk’s face on it with the words: “God bless, never forget”.“I’m British through and through; this is our capital,” she said. “I had to be here today for our country.”Her son added: “I feel our country is being inundated with the ideology which is trying to suppress and suppress us and I just want our country back.”The pair said they were “followers of Tommy Robinson and what he stands for”, adding the “establishment just want him out”. They denied it was a far-right event, saying their attendance was a “patriotic visit”.The mother said when she was a child in Liverpool, she “lived amongst neighbours from Africa, Pakistan; we were all one. It’s not about race, this is the government just overcrowding our country.”Carol took the coach from south Wales to attend the rally. She said she was there because “we need to unite the kingdom basically, it just seems to be so divided. We just need to come together, all of us.” Elaborating on this, she said: “It seems to be one half can say ‘I do what I want’, and the other half have to watch everything they do.”She held a sign that read “Change my mind: RIP Charlie”, referencing Kirk’s open-invitation college campus debates. She said she “probably picked up on him about a year ago” after he came up on her social media feed.When asked what she thought of Robinson’s involvement in the rally, she said: “When I first heard of him in 2017, the consensus and opinion around him was that he’s a bad un.” Since then, “having looked more into what he does”, she said: “He’s doing really well. He’s changed a lot of minds.”Whitehall quickly became so full that it was closed to marchers before the first speakers even took to the stage, leaving thousands stuck on Westminster Bridge and in Parliament Square.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People stood on bus stops and portable toilets to get a better view of the stage.One man waved a sign saying: “Why are white people despised when our tax money pays for everything?” Another had a placard that said: “Call centres: speak English.”The rally began with music. Members of the Destiny Church in New Zealand performed a traditional haka dance for the protesters, which was followed by a song with the lyrics “Making the west look like the Middle East”. They then displayed the flags of the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State and Palestine to boos from the crowd, before tearing each of them in half to loud cheers.Robinson then took to the stage and said “Britain has finally awoken” and that “this is never going away”. He claimed that British courts ruled that the rights of undocumented migrants supersede those of the “local community”, referring to Epping council’s failed case against the Home Office.“They told the world that Somalians, Afghanis, Pakistanis, all of them, their rights supersede yours – the British public, the people that built this nation.”He then played a video that included images of convicted members of a grooming gang followed by a video of a white woman crying.Elon Musk, speaking by video link, told the crowd: “I think there’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration.”“A failure by the government to protect innocent people including children who are getting gang-raped. It’s unreal the government has failed in its duty to protect its citizens, which is a fundamental duty of government.”Zemmour, who came in fourth place in the first round of the 2022 French presidential election, told the crowd in French, which was translated for the audience, that the “freedom of our peoples is in danger”.At the anti-fascist march, the MP Diane Abbott told a crowd that Tommy Robinson’s allies “are some of the most anti-women forces in society”.She said: “They are trying to drag women into their project, they are claiming that they are protecting women, but they are some of the most anti-women forces in society – they oppose equal pay, they oppose action against discrimination, they belittle sexual harassment as banter.“So we are here to stand together, we are here to fight, and we are here in the certainty that we will defeat the fascists.”A Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said police faced a “wholly unacceptable” level of violence. He said an investigation had begun and the force was working to identify suspects involved in disorder.He added: “There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence. They confronted officers, engaging in physical and verbal abuse and making a determined effort to breach cordons in place to keep everyone safe.“The violence they faced was wholly unacceptable. Twenty-six officers were injured, including four seriously – among them broken teeth, a possible broken nose, a concussion, a prolapsed disc and a head injury.”Explore more on these topicsProtestFar rightTommy RobinsonLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

He is now tasked with finding a private sector solution for Thames and preventing Britain’s biggest and most troubled water company from collapsing into state ownership.That presents a potential conflict of interest, as the 40-year-oldstill owns a multimillion-pound stake in Hakluytand is entitled to receive dividends from the Mayfair company. A No 10 source said Chandra had no personal involvement with Thames when at Hakluyt and made all the relevant declarations as part of his appointment.In the spring Chandra intervened in last-ditch talks to persuade the US private equity group KKR to buy Thames Water, including speaking to KKR’s co-founder Henry Kravis.Several politically connected Hakluyt employees have also been advising Thames, including a former speechwriter to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and Rishi Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff.The revelation underlines Hakluyt’s reach, as well as the revolving door between business and politics. The company, which was founded by former MI6 officers, claims to have advised almost half of the FTSE 100 and more than three-quarters of the top 20 private equity groups.It is understood that Hakluyt has been working closely with Thames’s strategy director, Cathryn Ross, a former chief executive of the water regulator Ofwat, since 2023. Sources said Hakluyt had been paid more than £1m by Thames in that time.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer with Varun Chandra (far left) during an investment roundtable discussion with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (bottom right) at No 10 in November 2024.Photograph: Frank Augstein/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was hired to work on Project Samuel, Thames’s attempt to secure private sector capital to recapitalise and restructure, as well as contingency planning for the possibility that the utilities company has to enter the government’s special administration regime (SAR) – a form of temporary nationalisation.Hakluyt employees including Sunak’s former deputy chief of staff Will Tanner and Josh Platt, a former private secretary and speechwriter to chancellors Rachel Reeves and Jeremy Hunt, have worked on Thames in recent months, Westminster sources said.Sir Oliver Robbins, the Foreign Office permanent undersecretary and former Brexit negotiator, also worked on Thames in 2023 while he was employed at Hakluyt as head of corporate coverage for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Hakluyt is among a string of advisers that have been paid handsomely to advise Thames in recent years. The Guardian revealed that the water company spent at least £136m on the effort to secure emergency funding during the financial year to March 2025, including with the law firms Linklaters and Akin Gump.The Treasury is desperate to avoid Thames collapsing into state hands, and Reeveswrote to creditors of the company in Julyto say a “market-based solution” was her preference.Thames has argued that allowing it to enter SAR and imposing heavy losses on its lenders would have a chilling effect on the appetite for UK infrastructure, and drive up wider funding costs.Chandra’s efforts to convince KKR to buy Thames were futile as the private equity group walked away in June, blaming excessive risk and politicisation.That left only a rescue attempt by its lenders standing between Thames being renationalised.A disparate band of more than 100 creditors are trying to convince the government and Ofwat that they should be allowed to take over the company, which serves more than 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley and has debts of more than £20bn. In return they wantleniency from fines and penalties. They have also proposeddelivering fewer improvements to Thames’s tired water and sewerage network over the next five yearsthan had been agreed with Ofwat – but charging customers the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A Sikh community group said it had spoken to the woman and her family and that the words the attackers said were: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.”Police confirmed it was being treated as a racially aggravated attack and isolated incident.The attack took place off Tame Road, a short distance from the constituency office of Gurinder Singh Josan, MP for Smethwick.The MP said: “I understand the strength of feeling within the community this attack has generated. The community needs to allow the police to progress with the investigation.”Sarah Coombes, MP for West Bromwich including Oldbury, said the incident was “absolutely horrible”, adding that such “violence and hatred has no place in our society”.MP for Birmingham Edgbaston Preet Kaur Gill said she was deeply shocked by the attack and that constituents had been contacting her to express their fear.Gill said: “Our Sikh community and every community has the right to feel safe, respected, and valued. Racism and misogyny have no place in Oldbury, or anywhere in Britain.“The rise in overt racism recently is deeply concerning, and I will be working withWest Midlandspolice to ensure everything is being done to catch those responsible and to keep our community safe.”Jas Athwal, MP for Ilford South, said he knew of people who had become scared for their safety due to an increase in “racist rhetoric” in the UK over the summer,He said: “Let’s be clear, this attack is a result of the rising racial tensions in our country and now, a young woman has been left traumatised for life.”The MP said several Ilford South residents had told him they were deeply concerned about the safety of women and girls in the area. He added: “This attack demonstrates the deeply tragic and violent consequences of allowing this rhetoric to seep into mainstream dialogue.“It ends in brown and black people being verbally attacked, physically assaulted or in this case sexually assaulted – a crime rooted in misogyny and the assertion of power.”Other Labour MPs who have spoken on the incident include Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, representing Slough, who urged police to “take decisive action to deliver justice”, as well as MP for Tipton and Wednesbury Antonia Bance.West Midlands police said on Saturday that officers were continuing to investigate the case, with a number of positive lines of enquiry ongoing.Ch Supt Kim Madill, who leads local policing in the Sandwell area, said on Friday: “We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other inquiries well under way.“We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused, and I am speaking to people in the community today to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to identify and arrest those responsible.“Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols in the area.”Police said anyone with information could contact them via 101 quoting log 798 of 9 September.Explore more on these topicsWest MidlandsRaceCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, it is a scientific simulation – and for the first time a British pilot is among those training for the mission.Laura Marie, who was born in the UK and is now a pilot for a regional airline in the US, beat about 8,000 applicants to become one of six research volunteers who are preparing to spend 378 days inside the 158-sq-metre (1,700 sq ft) Mars Dune Alpha habitat at Nasa’s JohnsonSpaceCenter in Houston.“It’s such a huge opportunity,” Marie told the Guardian. “And then to come this far and be in the final crew selection and heading down to training very, very soon is extremely exciting.”While the four “primary” crew members – Ross Elder, Ellen Ellis, Matthew Montgomery and James Spicer – are expecting to enter the simulation on 19 October, Marie – who has a BA in philosophy and an MSc in aeronautics – is one of two “alternate” participants, ready to step in should any of the others drop out.Marie said: “I am going down there with the same kind of mindset that everyone is going down there, of it being the 378 days.”The second of three Chapea (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog) missions, the experience is designed to help inform crewed missions to the red planet itself. The idea is the simulations will enable the collection of data relating to the physical health, psychology and performance of humans undertaking such an endeavour, with Nasa saying it could also aid assessment of its space food system.As in the first mission, the new crew will be growing crops, carrying out robotic operations and conducting simulatedMarswalks, as well as testing technology designed for use on Mars, among other activities.“With science, you can’t just do something once,” said Marie.Life on Mars ‘absolutely exhilarating’: Nasa scientist’s year in a simulationRead moreMarie, who grew up in Devon and immigrated to the US in 2016, said she was inspired to apply after hearing about the first mission as it was in progress.“I always had an interest professionally in working withNasain some kind of capacity,” she said. “So everything kind of aligned. I saw that opportunity and I jumped for it.”However while the first missionended in the summer of 2024, Marie has not spoken to the crew involved, noting it is better for the data if team members are not influenced by the experiences of others.While training is set to start next week at the Johnson Space Center, Marie said she and the other team members had already spent time together as part of the rigorous and lengthy selection process.“I’m not worried about any of the crew dynamics. I would happily lock myself in a box with all of them,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I spend a lot of time outside,” Marie said, adding the lack of sensations such as wind in her hair or the smell of grass could be difficult.Another significant challenge will be the communication delays that are designed to mimic the lag astronauts would experience on Mars when contacting Earth.“There’s no live chat with mission control,” said Marie, noting that even on the international space station, astronauts can be in real-time contact with Earth.But there will also be downtime, with Marie revealing she will be packing a Rubik’s Cube. “I’m not just going to learn how to do it. I want to beat a record,” she said.While the new mission is only a simulation of the Martian landscape, Marie said she would jump at an opportunity to head to the red planet itself. Indeed Nasa is developing technologies to enable crewed missions to Mars in the 2030s.“One hundred per cent I would take that seat on that ride if it were ever offered to me,” Marie said. “I think the whole multi-planetary species, it’s where we’re heading.

The Italian rolled the dice and his team surrendered two points. “We try to win every game but know we won’t win every game,” he said, after victory was denied in the closing seconds.Brentford, despite changes of personnel and manager, remain motivated, dangerous. Keith Andrews’ team closely resembled the Thomas Frank era in the dedication and spirit they maintained to the last kick. After Moisés Caicedo’s pile-driving goal, Chelsea’s second, they kept going. Robert Sánchez was soon asked to make a scrabbling save from Dango Ouattara. That would not be the last of them.Tottenham humiliate 10-man West Ham to deepen gloom of home fansRead moreIn the 95th minute, Fábio Carvalho bundled home, Chelsea’s defenders allowing the substitute to tap in unmarked at the back post from a Kevin Schade long throw. “It’s a useful tool,” said Andrews of Brentford’s not-so-secret weapon. “Any coach should look to find advantages. It’s been here for numerous years, it’s not new to us. I felt there’s a little bit of snobbery in the game around scenarios like that, but if the big boys now do it then it seems to be accepted.”Chelsea’s initially unfamiliar lineup had stuttered. With Cole Palmer short of fitness, and Bayern Munich and Old Trafford to come, the loanee Facundo Buonanotte was handed the No 10 role, after a hat-trick in a behind-closed-doors fixture at Cobham. Brighton, his parent club, have never got to the bottom of the Argentinian’s talent. He lasted just 45 minutes at the Gtech. “He needs time,” said Maresca, seeking to calm the waters of a disappointing denouement. “It’s a shame but it happens,” he said. “Probably we could manage that moment of the game better.”Wesley Fofana at right-back when Reece James and Malo Gusto were both on the bench seemed a ploy to avert Brentford’s set-piece threat while Jorrel Hato standing in for Marc Cucurella at left-back was another experiment with disappointing results. A half-time rethink was required.Quick GuideKey statsShow• All six of the Premier League goals that Brentford’s Fábio Carvalho has scored have been in the 75th minute or later, witheach of his last four coming in the 89th minute or later.• Carvalho’s equaliser was the seventh goal Brentford have scored from a throw in the Premier League since the start of last season,atleast five more than any other side.Stats by OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maresca suggested this was all planned: “Always Fofana we plan 45 minutes for him. Hato is similar. Buonanotte the last period has not been great for him knowing he has to go somewhere. Overall they were OK. I think we deserve to win the game in the second half.”Within five minutes of his second-half arrival, Palmer volleyed in to level Schade’s opener but would rue two later misses. “Cole was not fit to play until the second half,” said Maresca.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer equalises for Chelsea after coming off the bench.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesIgor Thiago’s early booking was unhelpful for a Brentford striker who has led the division in what statistical wonks term high-intensity pressures in the final third but Chelsea still found him a wholly awkward customer. His partner, Schade, after missing a penalty at Sunderland, made no mistake when sent away by Jordan Henderson to slot past Sánchez. “Kevin’s pace is just sensational and he’s constantly growing in confidence,” said the approving Andrews.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thomas Tuchel was watching, given otherwise slim pickings, with just English two starters on either team of which Keane Lewis-Potter and Jamie Gittens are uncapped. Henderson gets through plenty of pointing, in lieu of the engine that once carried him through many kilometres of long-distance chasing. But the passing radar is retained, judging by that Schade goal. “What you have seen tonight is Jordan,” said Andrews. “He relishes the battle.”Emiliano Martínez denies Everton as Aston Villa’s scoreless run continuesRead moreMaresca’s half-time changes had Cucurella, James and Tyrique George replacing Hato, Fofana and Buonanotte as Chelsea eventually found some zip. Palmer’s rest lasted until the 55th minute. His goal, his first non-penalty Premier League one since January, was struck coolly, after João Pedro laid Enzo Fernández’s ball up. A second, in only his second game back after the Club World Cup, ought to have come in the 75th minute, but a side-footed slap from Pedro Neto’s pass did not deceive the commanding, outstanding Caoimhín Kelleher. Further rustiness was shown in a late scuff after Brentford’s equaliser.Still, Maresca’s gamble appeared to be coming off. Alejandro Garnacho, within six minutes of his Chelsea bow, had supplied the bullet from which Caicedo scored. Game over?

Mandelson is slippery, and impressed by money, so Jeffrey liked that.”The spheres of influence Epstein created, emails showed, relied simultaneously on access and gifts.Bloombergobtained a spreadsheet of expenses that in some cases appeared to sync with emails between Epstein and his former girlfriend and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier’s convicted sex-trafficking co-conspirator.One expense, dated 21 December 2005, showed a $35,000 watch for “DB” – the same day that Maxwell and Epstein discussed in emails giving Bill Clinton aide Doug Band an Audemars Piguet with the same value. Band has denied receiving any watch.In all, the emails include a spreadsheet itemizing nearly 2,000 gifts, luxury items and payments totaling $1.8m.But the questions about the source of Epstein’s wealth have never been fully resolved. He was worth nearly $600m at his death, thanks mostly to two wealthy billionaire clients – Victoria’s Secret founder Les Wexner and, later, Apollo Global Management co-founder Leon Black – as well as Johnson & Johnson heiress Elizabeth “Libet” Johnson, sister of former US ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson.Between his collection of lavish homes in New York, Palm Beach and Paris, two private Caribbean islands, two jets and helicopter, Epstein held nearly $380m in cash and investments, according to his estate.That wealth arrived suddenly. According to associates, until the end of the 90s, Epstein was living in a two-bedroom apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side close to the river. It was only when Maxwell arrived from London that his lifestyle was dramatically elevated.Epstein moved to a townhouse on 68th Street and later to a 28,000-sq-ft mansion on 71st Street, later transferred to him by Wexner in 2011.Steven Hoffenberg, a former business partner of Epstein convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, claimed that Maxwell’s father, disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell, introduced his daughter to Epstein in the late 1980s.A 2022 Miami Herald exposéshowed complex Maxwell family transactions passing through companies in Jersey, the British Virgin Islands and Panama that it called “a decades-long modus operandi of financial deception”.The president doth protest too much: Trump’s denial on Epstein is backfiringRead moreIn a 2013 corporate filing, Epstein described himself as “an experienced and successful financier and businessman”, an “entrepreneur who has built several highly profitable companies” and “one of the pioneers of derivative and option-based investing”.Of the more than $800m in revenue Wexner and Black brought in from 1999 to 2018, according to financial statements obtained by the New York Times, Epstein – who was neither a licensed tax attorney nor a certified public accountant – collected at least $490m in fees.According to Forbes, the two businessmen supplied close to 75% of Epstein’s fee income during that period. Court records from a 2022 case brought against one of Epstein’s banks, JPMorgan Chase, show that Epstein’s US Virgin Islands-based companies were his only “revenue-generating” companies from 1999 to his death in 2019. Under the territories’ economic development program, Epstein is estimated to have saved $300m in taxes between 1999 and 2018.A 2023reportby the then Senate finance committee chair, Ron Wyden, found Black paid Epstein $170m “for purported tax and estate planning advice”. Black has not been accused of wrongdoing. He said in a 2020 earnings call that he “deeply regretted” his association with Epstein. A report from global law firmDechertfound “no evidence that Black … was involved in any way with Epstein’s criminal activities”.Wexner claimedafter Epstein’s arrest in 2019 that Epstein had “misappropriated” more than $46m of his personal fortune and said in a letter to L Brand employees: “I know now that my trust in him was grossly misplaced and I deeply regret having ever crossed his path.”But by 2006, with Wexner’s patronage at an end, Epstein’s Financial Trust Company, which had generated $300m in fees, generated less than $5m over five years. His 2008 conviction dealt a further blow and he returned to New York to salvage his reputation and business.Epstein 50th birthday book: who is in it and what did they say?Read moreThe New York Times reportedlast week that despite internal red flags about suspicious cash withdrawals and transfers, JPMorgan Chase continued to consider Epstein a treasured customer with more than $200m in accounts. Perhaps more importantly, he unofficially served as a client developer for the private wealth management division.JPMorgan Chase has described its ties to Epstein as “a mistake”. Epstein introduced bank executives to some figures who would become clients, including Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and to global leaders, such as Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahu, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Emirati billionaire Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.Epstein received a $15m fee for smoothing the sale of a $1.3bn stake in Glenn Dubin’s $7bn Highbridge Capital Management hedge fund to the bank. Epstein’s connections were by then more valuable than his wealth.Epstein’s main connection to the bank was Jes Staley, later CEO of Barclays, who was found by UK regulators to havemisled themabout his ties to Epstein.Conspiracy theories that Epstein was blackmailing his wealthy connections, snaring them in honeytraps that included models brought into the US, including by Jean-Luc Brunel, founder of MC2 Model Management, who – like Epstein – died in prison while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges, have not come to fruition.But wherever the Epstein scandal goes next, and whomever else it brings down, Epstein moves like a zombie through the upper echelons of wealth and politics. “He operated a circle with many points of entry,” says the acquaintance, “but now he’s like a wrecking ball rolling across countries.”Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinThe super-richGhislaine MaxwellJP MorganSex traffickingPeter MandelsonBill ClintonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A review into alternative learning provision commissioned by the council found a catalogue of failings, and a report by Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission found “significant areas of weakness in the local area’s practice”. “Parents and carers are overwhelmingly condemning of the Send system in Bristol because of the experiences they have had,” the regulators said.A July 2022 article in the Bristolian, a self-proclaimed “scandal sheet”, published a leaked cache of emails and a spreadsheet of “combative” social media posts that showed officials in the council’s department for children, families and education department had collated examples of social media criticism by Smith and other parent carers.One official says they are “working hard to uncover some concrete evidence” and lists a number of examples of social media posts, as well as revealing they had been trawling personal photos of some of the members of the parent carer forum.In one line of the email, the official says: “External comms deduced this is [redacted] as image is the same as wedding photos on [redacted]’s personal Facebook site.”In another email, an official refers to Smith’s “duplicity”.She says: “It was personal, critical stuff … They were just so full of themselves. It’s almost like they had this little bubble where they thought they were really important.”The council conducted an internal “fact finding” mission in August 2022, which found there had been no “systematic monitoring” of social media – an exercise that Smith and others called a whitewash.After a vote by its children and young people policy committee, however, the council announced last month that it would commission an independent investigation into the “historic monitoring of the social media accounts of parents and carers of Send children”.Smith is critical of Rees, who was Labour mayor from 2016 to 2024 before the people of Bristol voted to abolish the mayoral system in favour of a committee system.She found him “vitriolic toward Send parents”, alleging he had “a real issue with anybody speaking out whatsoever”. Rees has been contacted for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because what’s going to happen to the support for your child?”Bailes said she took part in protests outside Bristol city hall to raise the profile of the crisis in Send provision in the city.“We took snippets of that and we put it on social media,” she says. “Our aim was to help the council help themselves. At at the time, there were 250 children without a school placement, so we put bunting up with with one triangle for each child that was missing a school placement outside city hall.“Prior to 2022 the parent carer forum wasn’t what it should have been. The council weren’t really working with them. We were trying to advocate for our children, advocate as an alliance. It just seemed to rub the council up the wrong way.”Bailes dismissed the council’s subsequent internal investigation as “patting themselves on the back, saying everything’s legal and above board”.A spokesperson for Bristol city council said: “The children and young people policy committee is committed to inclusion and transparency and has voted to conduct an independent review into historical social media use.“The council is also progressing with its Send and inclusion strategy, which includes investment in educational psychology services, the development of an inclusion and outreach service, and is spending over £40m to create new specialist places for children over the coming five years.”No timetable has been set for the independent investigation.Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsBristolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts reveal how applicants can get aheadSally WealeSat 13 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 08.22 EDTShareOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently told a US podcast that if he was graduating today, “I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history.”Altman, whose company developed and releasedChatGPTin November 2022, believes the transformative power of AI offers unprecedented opportunities for young people.Yes, there will be job displacement, but “this always happens,” says Altman, “and young people are the best at adapting to this.” New, more exciting jobs will emerge, full of greater possibilities.For UK sixth-formers and their families looking at universities, trying to make the best possible choices about what to study – and where – in the age of generative AI, Altman’s words may offer some comfort. But in a fast-changing environment, experts say there are steps students can take to ensure they are well placed both to make the most of their university experience and to emerge from their studies qualified for the jobs of the future.Dr Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, says that in many cases students will already be well versed in AI and ahead of the game. “What’s striking is the pace of change and adoption vastly outstrips the pace of academic institutions to respond. As a general truth, academic institutions are quite slow and considered and thoughtful about things. But actually this has gone from the launch of ChatGPT to ‘Should we ban it?’, to ‘OK, here are some concerns about exams’, to actually recognising it’s going to be a life skill that we have to teach in every course and that we want all our students to have equitable access to.“So it’s gone from zero to 100 in a very short space of time, and of course, the world of work is changing accordingly as well.”His advice to prospective students? “Be demanding. Ask the questions. I think there are some careers that are going to be very different … make sure that universities are adapting to that.”Students who are less familiar with AI should take time to learn about it and use it, whatever their chosen subject. Rogoyski says being able to use AI tools is now equivalent to being able to read and write, and it’s important “to be resourceful, adaptable, to spend time understanding what AI is capable of and what it can and can’t do”.He says: “It’s something you need to be able to understand no matter what course you do, and think about how it might impact your career. So read around, look at some of the speculation surrounding that.“Then I’d start thinking about what the university’s responses are and what support there is for integration of AI. Is my course, and is the university as a whole, on the front foot with regards to the use of AI?”There will be a lot of information online but Rogoyski recommends visiting universities to ask the academics who will be delivering your degree: “What is your strategy? What is your attitude? Am I going to get a degree that’s worth having, that will stand the test of time?”Dan Hawes, co-founder of specialist recruitment consultancy the Graduate Recruitment Bureau, is optimistic about the future for UK graduates and says the current slowdown in the jobs market is more to do with the economy than AI. “It’s still very hard to predict what jobs there will be in three to four years, but we think it’s going to put a premium on graduates,” he says. “They are the generation growing up with AI and employers are probably very interested in getting this new breed of talent into their organisations.“So for parents and sixth-formers deciding where to study, the first thing always to take note of is the employability of the graduates that are produced by certain universities.”For example, maths has consistently been the top degree his clients are looking for, and he thinks this is unlikely to change. “AI is not going to devalue the skills and knowledge you get from doing a maths degree,” he says.He agrees that AI is a concern for parents and those considering going to university, “but in the long term I think it’s going to be a good thing. It’s going to make people’s jobs more interesting, redesign their roles, create new jobs.”Elena Simperl, professor of computer science at King’s College London, where she co-directs the King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, advises students to look at the AI content right across a university, in all departments. “It is changing how we do things. It’s not just changing how we write emails and how we read documents and how we look for information,” she says.Students might wish to consider how they can set themselves up for a job working in AI. “DeepMind is proposing AI co-scientists, so entire automatic AI labs, to do research. So a university should train their students so that they can make the most out of these technologies,” she says. “It doesn’t really matter what they want to study at the university. They don’t have to study AI themselves, but they should go to a university where there is a broad expertise in AI, not just in a computer science department.”Prof Simperl says that the evidence so far suggests it is unlikely that entire jobs will completely disappear. “So we need to stop thinking about what jobs will be killed by AI and think about what tasks can AI help with. People who are able to use AI more will be at an advantage.”In the brave new world of AI, will it still be worth doing a degree like English literature or history? “Yes, if they’re well taught,” says Rogoyski. “They should be teaching you things that will last throughout your lifetime. The appreciation of literature, learning how to write well, learning how to think and how to communicate are enduring skills.“The way that you might use that degree in the future will undoubtedly change, but if it’s taught well, the lessons learned will see you through. If nothing else you’ll enjoy your downtime as our AI overlords take over all the work and we’ll have more time to read books while we’re all on universal basic income.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)University Guide 2026EmployabilityWork & careersUniversitiesHigher educationStudentsUniversity guidefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what to think aboutClearing has never been easier to navigate. So if you’ve changed your mind about courses, or your results are not what you expected, here’s how it worksTess ReidySat 13 Sep 2025 03.01 EDTShareFive years ago, predictions for the 2025 university admissions cycle were looking bleak for students. With a rising number of 18-year-olds in the UK, many assumed it would be a competitive scramble for places – but reality has unfolded rather differently.“This year, the demand just isn’t there,” says Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute. “International numbers are down, there’s spare capacity, and more universities – even very selective ones – are opening places through clearing.Studentsnow hold more power than expected.”According to Hillman, some Russell Group universities, long known for high entry tariffs, are dropping their offers substantially and picking up more students through clearing. “There is a real fear among less prestigious institutions that students who might have come to them are being pulled further up the chain.”Clearing is also being made easier by changes to the Ucas process. While the “Decline My Place” function – which allows students automatically to enter clearing – is not new, what is different this year is thatstudents can use it even if their offer is conditionalon obtaining certain grades. Previously, only those holding unconditional offers could release themselves into clearing.Katherine Lloyd Clark, associate director of student access, recruitment and admissions at the University of Exeter, says: “You can’t decline a conditional place until you’ve got your level 3 results, but from 1pm on 14 August, if your university hasn’t made a decision, or you’re still waiting on something like a GCSE result, you can call Ucas and request a release.” There is no button for this, so students will need to speak with a Ucas adviser and make sure they understand what it means.Clearing is not just for those who missed their grades. It is an option for students who have changed their mind, only recently decided they want to go to university, or done better than expected. The full application cycle is long and plans can also change.Just ask Amelia Shackleton. The 21-year-old from Grimsby was originally planning to study English but ended up accepting a place in motorsports engineering at the University of Derby through clearing. “I think schools can push you to stick with what you’re already doing,” she says. “But I got better grades than I expected, felt a sudden boost of confidence, and realised I could do something totally different. I’ve always loved motorsports, I just didn’t know engineering was an option for me.”First-year economics and finance Queen Mary University of London student, Latheeseni Puspanathan, is equally positive. “I thought I would be one of those people anxiously on the phone line waiting for hours to get a hold of someone to confirm my spot, but that was not the case at all,” she says. “The process was a lot quicker than I expected.”According to Ucas, 13.5% of students secured their place through clearing last year. Of those, more than two-thirds (67%) had already researched the university they eventually joined before August, a sign that students are becoming more strategic, using clearing as a targeted route rather than a last-minute fallback. To date, 62,070 students have found places via clearing this year.Hillman believes that although it is creating more uncertainty for institutions, this change in mindset is empowering. “Students should aim high with their initial picks,” he says. “That doesn’t always mean the most prestigious university, it means the best fit. But the reality is, more places are available at older, better-resourced institutions than in the past.”Indeed,research from Leeds Beckett Universityfound 41% of students say going through clearing helped them make a bold decision.Nevertheless, some caution is necessary. Helen Bower, chief marketing officer at Northumbria University, says more students using clearing is a good thing, but only if it is used carefully. Ask yourself what kind of university experience you want, she says. “It’s not just about entry requirements. It’s a head and heart decision. Go back to the shortlist you already had and revisit your options rather than starting from scratch.”Lloyd Clark echoes the need for a cautious approach. Making a change at this late stage requires certainty, she says. “Many universities make clearing offers verbally, but doing a ‘Decline My Place’ without a written guarantee or email confirming that a clearing place is available is risky.”This is why students cannot refer themselves for a clearing place via Ucas Hub until 1pm on results day, giving time to call around, weigh options and secure formal offers. If a university is putting pressure on students to confirm within an hour or two, Lloyd Clark urges applicants to pause. “The harder they sell, the more questions you should ask,” she says. Incentives such as money, discounts or freebies should be a warning sign. “You may want to ask why they are doing this.”There are practical considerations too, particularly around accommodation. Giving up a firm place might mean giving up guaranteed housing. Clearing applicants may need to source accommodation independently, and options can be limited.Still, for many, clearing unlocks unexpected new paths, and it is now easier than ever. Shackleton says you will not regret it. “Don’t just do a degree because it feels like the safe option,” she says. “Within hours, I had changed my mind, switched courses and gained so much confidence. It was surprisingly easy.”Explore more on these topicsClearingUniversity Guide 2026UniversitiesHigher educationStudentsA-levelsYoung peopleUniversity guidefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Your guide to getting the most out of student nightlifeThe social side of university is good for your mental health and friendship circle, so consider where you’d be happiest to hang outKate McCuskerSat 13 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareChoosing which university to attend based on social scene alone probably isn’t the wisest idea, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t rank high on your list of priorities. Not only are sticky dancefloors and blinding strobe lighting a sort of rite of passage, a good night out can foster the sense of connection and friendship that is key to a student’s wellbeing.“Three years minimum is a long time in your life, so you need to be happy in the environment you’re in,” says Joe Woodcock, head of community at discussion platform The Student Room. “Students who are not happy tend to be the ones that aren’t able to finish. Being a happy student is so important for getting the best out of your university education.”That doesn’t mean it’s all budget bottles of vodka and arguing about whose turn it is to pay for the Uber. History and politics student Joseph Thomas, 21, chose the University of York because the city’s nightlife seemed “a bit more down to earth and a bit less rowdy” than his second choice – Coventry’s University of Warwick. “A campus university was right for me because all the students are in one place.” His idea of a good time is playing communal Mario Kart on a projector and discussing music over a couple of pints with the universityalbum society.Similarly, Rachel Tong Ng, who has just graduated with a degree in business and management, chose Durham University over Manchester for its “more peaceful vibe”.“Durham has a collegiate system, which I’d researched before, so I think it was a lot easier to make friends,” says Ng, who preferred society events and on-campus sports team socials – both of which her chosen city had in abundance – to pubs and clubs.But don’t believe everything they tell you about gen Z, says Katie Kirwan, the head of brand at booking platform Design My Night – they’re as partial to a party as their predecessors – they’re just more discerning about where they choose to blow their student loan.“A couple of years ago we started covering a lot of nights based around musicians – so we had a ton of Taylor Swift nights, and we’ve seen a huge increase in searches for western-themed nights following the release of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album,” says Kirwan. “Britney [Spears] nights have also made a comeback. Nostalgia’s big: gen Z are now discovering all the bands that I used to listen to when I was their age.”Demand for activities-based nights out, including pottery painting and crafting, is also skyrocketing – with their fixed cost one of the main draws, says Kirwan. As well as a 14% increase in searches for “classes” in the past year on the platform, she’s seen a 43% increase in searches for “affordable” activities.The eye-watering cost of going out now means that the time-honoured student tradition of cramming into the communal kitchen for pre-drinks is alive and well. “A lot of us do most of our drinking before we go to the club,” says 19-year-old animation student Kami Thomas, who chose the University of Westminster so they could take advantage of London’s LGBTQ+ clubbing scene. They have also used holiday work to give their bank account some breathing room: “I knew I wanted to go to university in London, so I saved £3,000 over the summer so I could enjoy my first term.” Ng’s number one rule for affordable student socialising is setting a budget before she goes out, and refusing to overspend – even if that means one less drink.So which universities make the grade for their social scenes? “A city like Sheffield ticks all the boxes for diverse, great nightlife,” says Woodcock. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. The University of Sheffield’s student union is frequentlyranked best in the UK, while the city’s DIY music scenecontinues to thrive. “Places like Liverpool and Cardiff, which are cheaper than London and the south-east, also offer the best of both: a campus-centred social scene and city nightlife,” he adds.For live music, Kirwan recommends Leeds, which has “all the flavour of Manchester” with a cheaper cost of living. Ng, though, doesn’t think it matters where you go – provided you try to enjoy yourself as much as possible. “You only get the university experience once.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity guideUniversity Guide 2026UniversitiesHigher educationStudentsStudent experiencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We danced together for the rest of the night,then he walked me into town and bought me a milkshake.That was 58 years ago.View image in fullscreenRhonda and Keith in the early days of their relationshipHe was 16 and living with his father and three sisters, working in a retail furniture business. I was a nerd at school, expected to go on to teachers’ college, though I dearly wanted to be a nurse.We spent most weekends together going to the beach, watching the footy and hanging out with friends.He was always laughing and making me laugh.One day Keith took me to the crematorium to “meet his mum”. We sat on the grass beside her little plaque and he told me stories about his mother. He had his head on my lap and I started to cry, hearing how much he was missing her. He sat up and ran his fingers through his hair and we both laughed at the tears. I had never met anyone in my life who had shared something so personal and loving with me.That was the moment I fell in love, even though I was only 15.The moment I knew: crying over my ex, he comforted me without jealousy or judgmentRead moreWhen I was 16, I found out I was pregnant. I was sent away to an unmarried mother’s home and I gave up my son for adoption. There were no choices in those days; I didn’t get to talk to Keith about what we wanted. My father thought adoption was the best plan so I could finish my schooling and get on with my life. It was all clothed in secrecy.Years later, we found our son and I felt rewarded. Rob came into our lives when he was 25. He wanted to meet his mother, and he met two sisters and a father as well. We all noticed likenesses between Rob, Keith and the girls. It was an exciting time, charged with emotion and joy. It was such a rollercoaster for me and Keith. It brought up lots of unresolved grief from that lonely time in the home.Our wedding was a tiny and mostly sad affair when I was 18. My father had remarried just weeks before and my mother was upset and tearful. Keith and I couldn’t wait to get away to start a happier life together.Our first anniversary fell in August, just after my mother and father had died in previous months. We were living in a little flat and I was in my second year of nurse training. We had very little money, and couldn’t afford to go out to celebrate. Keith walked to the local shops and came back with a bottle of lemonade and two party whistles. We stood in our little kitchen, blowing our whistles and toasting each other with lemonade in plastic tumblers. Just us two; all we needed.View image in fullscreenRhonda and Keith renewing their vowsOur 25th wedding anniversary fell on a leap year. I sent Keith some flowers and a card asking him to marry me again. He asked me if we would have a honeymoon, and said he was in! This time around, we were surrounded by our family and dear friends. It was a wonderful time of reflection and celebration.It hasn’t been all roses – there is a lot of work and compromise that goes into a long marriage. But we have built a loving family. Our two adult girls are an amazing support, especially since Keith’s cancer battle. And Keith and I have both had wonderful careers in nursing.View image in fullscreenRhonda and Keith at his birthday partyNow that Keith has cancer, our lives are smaller and quieter. I’m spending more time writing; Keith and our girls are so proud of me having a book published. Keith and I still laugh most days (and cry others), even if it’s watching Michael McIntyre on YouTube just before we go to bed. He is my first and only love, and I am proud of the caring and giving man he has become.Rhonda McCoy is the author ofCrow(Ventura Press; $32.99)Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

All once possessed unassailable power – then were undermined, in some cases wiped out, by the march of new technology.“Speed and stealth and firepower,” the head of the Australian Submarine Agency, Jonathan Mead, told the Guardian two years ago of Australia’s forthcoming fleet of nuclear submarines. “The apex predator of the oceans.”But for how much longer?In the first quarter of the 21st century, nuclear submarines have proven a formidable force: essentially undetectable deadly attack weapons. Some also carry a vital “second-strike” deterrent effect: any attack on a country armed with nuclear-powered submarines is made with the knowledge that retaliation is certain – from a warship hidden beneath the waves.The lethal legacy of Aukus nuclear submarines will remain for millennia – and there’s no plan to deal with itRead moreBut a drumbeat of declarations – much of it speculative, but most of it from China, the very nation the Aukus pact was established to counter – report rapid developments in submarine-detection technologies: vast networks of acutely sensitivesonar arrays;quantum sensing; improved satellite tracking able to spot tiny perturbations in the ocean’s surface; technologies thatdetect minute disturbancesin the Earth’s magnetic field; real-time AI processing of vast reams of data.Could emerging technologies render the last opaque place on Earth – the oceans – transparent?It may not be so binary. The oceans may become, in parts, less impenetrable: key contested sea lanes and littoral areas may be intensely surveilled, while remote, deep trenches remain arcane.Forecasting a future conflict is fraught. But the consequences for Australia, having dedicated an extraordinary $368bn towards itsAukusnuclear submarine fleet, are immense: will the apex predator of today become the prey of tomorrow?One brutal assessment put it in stark terms: Australia’s fleet of nuclear-powered submarines may end up being “billion-dollar coffins”.Q&AWhat is Aukus pillar one?ShowPillar one of the Australia-UK-US (Aukus) agreement involves Australia being given the technology to command its own fleet of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. There are two stages:• First, Australia will buy between three and five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US, the first of these in 2032. But before any boat can be sold to Australia, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that the US relinquishing a submarine will not diminish its navy’s undersea capability. The US submarine fleet now has only three-quarters of the submarines it needs (49 boats of aforce-level goalof 66). And there are significant concerns the US cannot build enough submarines for its own needs, let alone any for Australia.• Second, by the “late 2030s”, according to the \"optimal pathway\" outlined in Australia’ssubmarine industry strategy, the UK will launch the first specifically designed and built Aukus submarine for Britain’s Royal Navy.The first Australian-built Aukus submarine, for the Royal Australian Navy, will be in the water “in the early 2040s”. Australia will build up to eight Aukus boats, with the final vessels launched in the 2060s.Each of Australia’s nuclear submarines is forecast to have a working life of about three decades. Australia will be responsible for securing and storing the nuclear waste from its submarines - including high-level nuclear waste and spent fuel (a weapons proliferation risk) - for thousands of years.Aukus is forecast to cost Australia up to A$368bn to the mid-2050s.Photograph: Colin Murty/AFPWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Underwater arms raceThere is anarms race under wayunderwater, dedicated to perfecting the technologies that can find submarines, and finding new ways to keep them hidden.Vast resources are being poured into improving detection technologies and developing new ones: drones, sonobuoys, satellites, magnetometers, quantum sensors. All seek to shrink the spaces where submarines can hide.Everything is being monitored: the tiniest disturbance in waves across vast stretches of ocean, fractionally altered sea temperatures, faint magnetic disturbances, bioluminescent trails – each could give a tiny clue to a submarine’s path. Combined, they could reveal precisely where it is.Allied to the extraordinary data-processing power of artificial intelligence, these present a formidable threat to submarines’ invisibility. AI programs are able to cut through the “noise” of masses of information, spotting unseen patterns or finding connections between disparate pieces of data, imperceptible to a human analyst.Much of the technological advancement is being driven byChina.Submarines, made of metal, cause tiny distortions in the Earth’s magnetic field as they move through the water, changes increasingly detectable to sophisticated magnetometers.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailLast year a research team fromShanghai Jiao Tong University reportedthe development of a new seabed sensor able to detect the faint electromagnetic waves generated by a rotating submarine propeller from nearly 20km away, about 10 times the previous detection range.And in a peer-reviewed study published in December, researchers in Xi’an claimed to have developed an airborne magnetometer that cantrack the persistent trace of a submarine’s magnetic wake.Quantum sensors, which can detect infinitesimally small perturbations in the environment at an atomic level, promise even greater sensitivity and accuracy.In April scientists from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said they had developed a drone-mounted quantum sensor system that could track submarines with pinpoint accuracy. They claim thecoherent population trappingatomic magnetometer is as sensitive as theMAD-XR systemused by Nato countries but far cheaper, and so able to be deployed at a massive scale.These are the technologies that are known about but, as Dr Anne-Marie Grisogono of Flinders University points out, if an adversary had a technology to accurately detect submarines, would it tell anyone?The arms race is, of course, accelerating on both sides – designers are working on counter-detection measures to make submarines ever more covert: anechoic tiles to defeat or confuse sonar; cooling systems to weaken detection by thermal imaging or infrared detection by satellites; “degaussing” submarines to reduce magnetic signatures; and using pump-jet propulsors to produce less wake.‘We should be asking bigger questions’Grisogono was a co-author of the 2020 reportTransparent Oceans, which argued that by the 2050s – as new Australian Aukus boats continued to be sent to sea – nuclear submarines “will be able to be detected in the world’s oceans because of the evolution of science and technology”.She told Guardian Australia this year: “The likelihood that the oceans will become transparent at some time is basically 100%, it’s just in what time frame.Aukus will cost Australia $368bn. What if there was a better, cheaper defence strategy?Read more“And they could become transparent much sooner. We’ve seen tremendous advances in artificial intelligence ... an accelerant for all of these detection technologies that we are seeing developed.”Grisogono argued that it may not be one technology that renders submarines detectable. She can envisage a future of “underwater meshes of networked sensors” using different technologies, all of which are expendable and none of which is critical to the network functioning.“It’s an adaptive mesh of cheap components, and importantly, it’s a distributed system, so you can’t really take it out,” she said. “You can lose quite a lot of them and still have a functioning network … and it’s cheap.“If your defensive system is really cheap and can take out really expensive assets from your opponent … the advantage is now to the defence, not to the attack.”Grisogono said Australia should use the opportunity before too much is committed to Aukus to re-evaluate its capacity, not to fight a war in 20 years but in 30, 40 or 50.“We should be asking bigger questions about our defence posture,” she said. “I think acquiring these nuclear-powered submarines really only makes sense if you’re wanting to contribute and join into much bigger conflicts in the region with the US.“Perhaps when the decision was first taken, the logic of Aukus might be defensible in some way. But does that still stand up now?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With each one about the size of a minibus, they can be deployed from warships or launched off the coast.The Guardian asked the defence minister, Richard Marles, whether the investmentwas a “hedge”against a future where crewed submarines were detectable.“We are very confident about Australia’s future submarines being fundamentally critical to Australia’s military capability,” Marles responded, saying the Ghost Sharks would “complement” crewed nuclear submarines.“While there’s a whole lot of advancements in technologies about detecting submarines, there’s also a lot of advancements in technologies around making submarines harder to detect, and we are really confident about … giving Australia a highly capable, long‑range submarine capability in the future.”Standing alongside the minister, Australia’s chief of navy, V Adm Mark Hammond, said he believed crewed submarines would grow more stealthy as efforts to detect them strengthened.“I’ve heard about ‘transparent oceans’ since I qualified in submarines 31 years ago, and nothing’s really changed: every advancement in detection capability is usually met by an advancement in encounter detection capability and increased stealth.”The land and the air were “completely transparent”, Hammond said, “and no one has stopped building ships and aircraft.”“My personal belief is that the undersea battle space will continue to be increasingly congested, increasingly contested – but ultimately that is the most opaque environment on the planet, and I believe that our allies and partners will continue to enjoy the capability advantage in that space.”Detectable equals destroyableAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.Prof Peter W Singer, a strategist at the New America thinktank, cites Arthur C Clarke’s famed third law.He tells the Guardian that the rapid pace of change across technological domains, accelerated by developments in AI, makes predicting future developments – especially beyond the span of a human or technological generation – increasingly fraught.Australia’s first Aukus submarines are scheduled to be in the water in the 2040s. They will still be under construction into the 2060s.“Twenty years is a very long time when it comes to technology … what’s a generation for undersea warfare: is it every 30 years? Every 15 years? Every 10 years? We’re talking about a pretty substantial period of time,” Singer says.An accelerating trend is “greater observation of the battlefield, and the worry that once stealthy systems might be detectable”.“If they’re detectable, they’re destroyable,” he says.Surface tension: could the promised Aukus nuclear submarines simply never be handed over to Australia?Read more“Military leaders around the world are wrestling with this – whether they are in the ADF, Nato, the US Navy, Marine Corps – there’s a trend where essentially the apex predators are looking around and wondering if they are now the prey.”The Marianas Trench – largely uncharted and reaching depths beyond human exploration – might remain unknowable, Singer says, but key sea lanes in the South China Sea could be intensely surveilled.He cites the cold war example of the GIUK Gap – naval choke points in the North Atlantic – which was populated by a battery of hydrophones designed to detect the passage of Soviet submarines.Singer predicts that undersea warfare of the future will not be a battle between crewed submarines but between hybrid fleets of new technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles, potentially working in concert with crewed subs. UUVs will be far cheaper and expendable in comparison with traditional submarines.The terrestrial equivalent is Ukraine’s revolutionary use ofcheap but lethal armed dronesto counter Russia’s invasion. Expendable drones worth a few hundred dollars a unit are taking out tanks that cost tens of millions, halting entire offensives.“The uncrewed systems are not all going to be like a pet on a leash, they’re going to be increasingly operating on their own,” Singer says.“So you may have some physically large systems that need to go long distances and carry massive payloads, but you may also have smaller systems, maybe with less range but, because they’re smaller, they’re cheaper, and you can essentially fill the battle space with them.”The upshot is a balancing act, Singer says – accepting that decision-makers have neither a perfect view of the future nor an unlimited budget.“I am not saying ‘don’t buy Virginia Class’ or ‘don’t buy Aukus’,” he says. “I think they do bring value. The question is how much of a bet do you want to make?”Explore more on these topicsAustralian militaryAukusWeapons technologyAustralian foreign policyOceansNuclear powerChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Lounging on a sofa one June evening at Butterworth’s, a bistro serving as the gastronomical centre of the Maga movement in Washington DC, the recently appointed British ambassador was being honoured with a plaque that indicated he was easing his way into the conservative circles around Donald Trump.The appointment of Mandelson, an architect of Tony Blair’s New Labour project in the 1990s, had not been without controversy. He was the first political ambassador to the United States in almost half a century and had twice resigned from Labour governments in the past over scandals (not to mention his past association with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein).So he would have to move quickly to replace the well-sourced expertise of his predecessor and build ties with a new administration that had upended all the rules of the traditional Washington establishment.Mandelson managed that by leaning into the heady conservative politics surrounding the US president, working old contacts in Trump’s circles of businessmen and courting the new media right. Surrounded by conservative journalists that evening, he said that, while the two leaders’ politics may differ, both Trump and UK prime minister Keir Starmer were riding the same political winds of upheaval.Both had received mandates, he said that eveningaccording to British media reports in the Times, from “angry people who felt they were being unheard by mainstream politics” and were “angry about the cost of living, angry about uncontrolled immigration and angry about uncontrolled woke culture spreading across institutions”.It was a textbook performance for the once-dubbed “Prince of Darkness” who was testing the lines between ambassadorial deference and open flattery. In public, a favourite adjective for Trump was neutral but weighty: “consequential”. In private, he tended away from criticism of the new administration, even as the White House leaned toward Vladimir Putin and flirted with authoritarian measures at home.His firing now amid new details of the Epstein scandal – one that theTrump administrationhas sought to outrun – plays out just days before Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom, when Starmer must seek to influence Trump over the war in Ukraine, continue negotiations over a US-UK trade deal, deflect concern over a potential UK recognition of Palestine, and more.“[Mandelson] has his own independent stature and status, and that was a good thing, but it carried risks, and now it’s gone wrong,” said Alexandra Hall Hall, a former British diplomat who resigned while serving as lead envoy for Brexit in the US in 2019. “And now it’s gone wrong on the worst possible topic at the worst possible time.”In Washington, the British ambassador’s Edwin Lutyens-designed residence, where Mandelson lived with his partner and “diplo-dog” Jock, hosted parties that saw an influx of the new conservative media elite in Washington. At a White House Correspondents’ Dinner co-hosted by the Daily Mail in June, new media influencers like Natalie Winters, seen as a protege of the rightwing firebrand Steve Bannon, rubbed shoulders with established journalists from across the media spectrum. It reflected the White House’s own inclusion of conservative bloggers among accredited correspondents as a counterweight to a perceived liberal bias among the media.At a celebration for King Charles’s birthday that month, Mandelson wryly inserted jokes about Trump as guests mingled among cigar and whiskey stations, drawing laughs as he recognised a leader “associated with grand ceremonies and golden aesthetics. So happy birthday, President Trump”.It is precisely what Mandelson was sent to Washington DC to do: charm the Maga faithful around Trump while bringing the political heft that would allow a UK envoy to negotiate in the name of the prime minister.He replaced Dame Karen Pierce, a veteran diplomat who was already a regular at Mar-a-Lago and one of the best-sourced foreign ambassadors in Trumpworld. Some, like Bannon, had rejected Mandelson as a “terrible choice” because of his past remarks about Trump and links to establishment politics in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His main success was the outlines of a US-UK trade deal, which was feted at an Oval Office meeting with Trump where Mandelson was complimented by Trump for his “beautiful accent” and given the floor in a rare show of deference to a foreign ambassador.The White House team around him laughed as he described Trump’s “typical 11th-hour intervention by you with your phone call demanding even more out of this deal than any of us expected”. He then channelled Winston Churchill as he added: “For us it is not the end, it’s the end of the beginning.”His absence will be noted as Trump arrives in the United Kingdom for the controversial state visit that Mandelson’s quick-found relationship with the US president could have helped to smooth.After the Oval Office meeting with Trump, Mandelson left with a souvenir – a handwritten note in Trump’s distinctive marker scrawl and unmistakeable signature.“Peter,” it read. “Great Job!”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a good-natured, sweet show that walks comfortably in contentious territoryRhik SamadderSat 13 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareIndian travelogue shows with British TV presenters are as predictable as they are popular. Here, let me sketch the formula on the back of this samosa. Take, I don’t know, Sue Barker and James Redmond. Whack them in front of the Taj Mahal, then in a tuk tuk. Let them eat pav bhaji. Earnest closeup, while regarding temple carvings. Shot of begging children, while they reflect on what a country of contrasts this is. Much saris and smiling. Close on moment of spiritual epiphany, which evaporates by the airport. It’s a hit!So I am unaroused by the prospect of Rob and Rylan’s Passage to India (Sunday 14 September, 9pm, BBC Two), the genesis of the three-part series being that Rob Rinder’s favouritenovel is the namesaketitle by EM Forster. Should we send Patrick Kielty to a Kyoto entertainment district because he likes Memoirs of a Geisha? Still, the pair won a Bafta for their previousjaunt around Italy, so I decide to give them a chance.A quip in the first episode wins me over. Rylan, overwhelmed by the noise of Delhi traffic, is flapping and squawking, and Rinder accuses him of sounding “like the headmistress of a school for excluded children”. I squawk at that.RinderandRylanare funnier than anyone who has previously attempted an Indian travelogue, with the possible exception ofRomesh Ranganathan. Clearly, there’s something about people whose names begin with R, and I should know.Their wits compliment each other like raita and mango chutney. Rinder loves classical music, fine art, history. His is a dry, wry whine, complaining about the indignity of having his ears de-waxed on camera, or being made to walk the streets barefoot. He describes Forster as the “Liza Minnelli of literature” to his travelling partner, who he’s horrified to learn hasn’t read the book before filming. (“I was inLA with Mariah Carey,” is the only excuse Rylan gives.)Rinder grounds the programme, getting misty-eyed at murals, murmuring explainers of why they’re doing any of this at all, all of which washes over Rylan; he’d be as happy at Geri Halliwell’s birthday, or MCing a corporate fruit cider launch. To square the imbalance, the show attempts to imply Rylan is busy doing logistical work off camera. He has many voiceovers along the lines of “While Rob’s admiring sculptures, I’ve tracked down a community spokesperson/organised a tour of the ghats/scored an invitation to a local puppeteering cooperative,” none of which I believe for a second.His karma could do with some repair. Presenting This Morning last month, Rylan naively complained about small boat migrants to the UK being given free iPads and four-star hotels, a comment for which Ofcom has received more than 700 complaints. He’s on safer ground here, hammering a running joke that Rinder is secretly in love with or trying to get off with him.View image in fullscreenPlaytime … Rob and Rylan’s Passage to India.Photograph: Jakob Borges/BBC/Rex TV/ Zinc MediaBanter notwithstanding, the show is at its best when the hosts discuss gay identity and their yearning for relationship.Their friendship has real heart under the ribbing. As working-class social climbers, there may be a subterranean identification between them and their subject. They too are riddled with contradictions. Rylan, who sells himself as sex-driven and supercilious, is actually kind and eccentric. He reveals he has built a life-sized railway station in his house, and can only go the toilet naked: “Can’t even have a sock.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It suggests that anxieties about the subcontinent’s colonial past largely arise from western guilt. (For what it’s worth, I’ve found this too – there’s a bizarre amount of fondness for the Brits in India.) With encouragement from a tailor, Rinder puts aside his worries about cultural appropriation and dons a turban. “I look like Martine McCutcheon with a thyroid problem.”Rob and Rylan’s passage doesn’t transcend travelogue tropes, but it does update them. They interview India’s first openly gay mainstream politician and Naveen Kumar, a Dalit rapper (the caste formerly known as untouchable) who uses his music to call out injustice. This is modern India, beyond holy cows and street sweepers. It remembers to have fun – there’s a king cobra, a brutal astrology reading, lavish parties with billionaires and royalty. It’s closer to EM Forster, but the novelist would have appreciated the phallic gags … and the attempt to change perceptions. A mildly spicy, very sweet treat.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherRylan ClarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Smoke swirls amid the gloom. Foul odours belch from the sulphurous earth. The landscape echoes to howls and grunts and screams. A great light has gone out and all that remains is confusion and fear. Everywhere coaches and managers, hunched under their doubts, scuttle hither and thither, desperately seeking a path through the wilderness.From his very first season at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola’s way of playing football has been dominant. The effectiveness of his philosophy was so obvious and so pervasive that there is not an elite manager now who has not in some way been influenced by his philosophy, even if they are not, as many are, overt disciples.‘Not good enough’: Haaland hits out at Manchester City’s form before derbyRead moreBut as the near-universal acceptance of his methods fractures, as other Premier League sides turn away from or adapt Pepism towards approaches based on counterattacking, set plays, players who run with the ball or a more direct style, the result is a profound uncertainty. Belief recedes to leave a wasteland of possibility.The environment is akin to England after the reliance on W-M and the winger was shattered by Hungary in 1953, or 19th-century Europe after scientific discoveries had provoked the crisis of faith. If none of the previous assumptions are true, if we cannot trust the old doctrine, how do we know what is right?This is the world that produced Charles Darwin and Friedrich Nietzsche and had Arthur Conan Doyle attending seances and believing in fairies, just as managers in the 50s started trialling strike pairings and back fours and had the Doncaster manager Peter Doherty assigning players with random numbers to spread confusion. Nobody knows what is true any more, and the consequence is a chaotic world of experimentation.That sense of uncertainty may help explain why this was a summer dominated by the striker carousel, as large numbers of clubs sought a classic No 9, or at least the modern interpretation of that: a big player with pace, technically accomplished and capable of running the channels, a complete centre-forward in the mould of Didier Drogba or Hernán Crespo. As faith goes, what could be more comforting than reducing football to its most fundamental act, scoring goals? Never mind the process: a striker who can guarantee 20 goals a season assures a side of at least some measure of achievement.Football has never known a moment quite like this before. Pepism is probably the most hegemonic style the world has known. It helped that he arrived just as background conditions were perfect for his style, as pitch technology improved to the point that first touches could be taken almost for granted, the liberalisation of the offside law increased the effective playing area and a crackdown on intimidatory tackling allowed technically gifted but diminutive midfielders to flourish.The game was ripe for Guardiola-style innovation, but his ideas spread as they did because football has never been as globalised, never been as scrutinised. There has never been such an agglomeration of the world’s best players at such a small array of clubs, nor such focus on them.View image in fullscreenComplete centre-forwards like Didier Drogba are back in vogue.Photograph: Scott Heavey/Action Images/ReutersFor 15 years or so, the world has accepted this is the most effective way to play. Even the hard-pressing of the German school and the Guardiola style, which could at one point reasonably be pitched as a way of playing based on regaining possession against a style that prioritised its retention, came in the end to an accommodation.Which raises one of the paradoxes of Pepism, which is that it is so diverse as to be almost indefinable. Certain fundamentals can be identified: pressing, a high line, the use of possession for control, a suspicion of dribbling and long-range shots, a preference for the low cut-back over the booming cross from deep, and a paranoia related to the height of the line about the danger of being countered against.But Guardiola is not a dogmatist in the way many of his followers are: he is flexible, forever innovating and tinkering. He likes a 3-2-5 defensive structure out of possession, but has achieved that in various ways over his career: one full-back overlaps, the other covers across; both full-backs push up, a central midfielder drops between the central defenders; a full-back inverts and tucks into midfield as the other covers across; the back four comprises central defenders but John Stones steps into midfield to create the second holder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although both have developed along their own paths, they offer a snapshot of where Pepism was at the moment they set out alone: Maresca comes from the days of control through possession; Arteta from the era of four central defenders across the back. A tactical assessment of the elite is like a vertical tasting of Pepism.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta’s use of four central defenders was picked up from Pep Guardiola.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAlthough Guardiola had previously worked with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robert Lewandowski, the signing of Erling Haaland, a pure striker who shows little interest in or capacity for engaging with the midfield, represents the greatest rupture. The creative tension between his demand for directness and Guardiola’s cautious instincts brought the treble but may underlie the present problems.The ostracism of Ederson andsignings of James Trafford and Gianluigi Donnarumma, neither of whom has the sweeping capabilities Guardiola has demanded of his goalkeepers, feel like another step towards orthodoxy (or, depending who actually authorised the signings, perhaps towards City’s post-Guardiola future). Just as politics undergraduates have become used to answering the question: “Was Karl Marx a Marxist?” it may soon seem reasonable to ask whether Guardiola is any longer a Pepist.But then Guardiola – paradoxically and in obvious contrast to his opposing manager on Sunday, theManchester Unitedmanager, Ruben Amorim – has always been a pragmatist. He has always been willing to tweak and adapt; evolution, arguably, is itself essential to Pepism, which is perhaps to conclude that Pepism is ultimately so mutable as to resemble Peronism, a vast array of competing ideas whose one defining principle is their origin in one man.And for now, afterCity’s two defeatsin their first three league games, that one man seems just as lost in the wilderness, just as baffled as to which path to take next, as everyone else.Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaInside footballManchester CityManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

With 40 minutes to play, the scores tied 10-10, and a spot in the semi-finals on the line, the New Zealand captain Ruahei Demant pulled her team into a huddle, while the Springboks trotted past them and in to the changing rooms at Sandy Park.The team talk, according to player-of-the-match Kaipo Olsen-Baker, was only three letters long: “AFD” which, Olsen-Baker just stopped herself from blurting out during a live TV interview afterwards, means “all fucking day”. They scored three tries in the next seven minutes play.New Zealand blitz South Africa after break to reach Women’s Rugby World Cup semisRead moreThe Red Roses may be the most successful team in any sport, but the question hanging over this past fortnight of the World Cup is whether they are the best in their own sport. They may be in the thick of one of the greatest winning streaks in history, with back-to-back runs of 30 consecutive victories either side of one solitary loss in six years, but, as the Black Ferns players will tell you, there are other ways to measure success than by the number of matches you have won in between the ones that matter most, or the world ranking points you totted up while doing it.That one defeat was, of course, in the last World Cup final, whenNew Zealand beat them by threeat Eden Park. You would guess the England players would swap a large part of the 60 wins recorded either side of it if they could change that one result.This may be England’s tournament, but it is New Zealand’s trophy. They have won it six times out of nine, and beat the Red Roses in the knockout rounds every time. They have not lost a World Cup knockout game since 1991. You can have as many WXV titles, and one-off Test wins as you want, but you can’t call yourselves the best in the world until you’ve beaten the Black Ferns in the World Cup.Not least because so many of New Zealand’s best players prefer to play Rugby Sevens between tournaments. Seven of their World Cup squad were busy playing on the Sevens circuit whenEngland beat them twice last year, including two of the star turns in their starting XV, Stacey Waaka and Jorja Miller.The steps are steep in women’s rugby, and the spaces between them as you move up the ladder of world rankings mean it can be a stretch for a lot of teams to even get close to the ones immediately above them. Which is why there have been so many one-sided games in this tournament, and also why so many teams have put all their energies into the one match they most want to win.But up there at the top, the gap between England and the three teams behind them – France, New Zealand, Canada – isn’t as wide as you might think from looking at the recent results between them. England can afford to concentrate on XVs year-round, Canada and New Zealand have concentrated their resources on their performances in this one tournament.View image in fullscreenNew Zealand perform the haka before their dominant victory.Photograph: Phil Mingo/PPAUK/ShutterstockSouth Africa pushed New Zealand harder than anyone expected in the first quarter-final, especially in the first half. Which figures. It was their World Cup final, and they had been preparing for this game for a fortnight. Their coach, Swys de Bruin, rested eight of his starting team from theirfinal pool game against Francelast week, and they had come equipped with a gameplan which had been designed entirely with New Zealand’s strengths and weaknesses in mind.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

South Africa didn’t give the Black Ferns an inch in the first half, when they relied on their scrum, maul and a series of inventive training-ground plays at the lineouts, which they stretched to include all 15 players in one moment, and shrank to two players in the next.They kept it high and tight as an army barber. Their back three refused to return any of New Zealand’s kicks, which meant they were starved of chances to cut loose in broken play. England, in particular, will have noticed that New Zealand struggled to defend South Africa’s maul.If the first half was a lesson in how to beat the Black Ferns, the second was a lesson in how they beat you. They were fast, accurate and intense, and made South Africa pay for every mistake. This New Zealand team have more in them. And they will need it to beat Canada in the semi-finals. But it’s hard to avoid the impression that if the Springboks had been watching, and waiting, for this match against the Black Ferns, the Black Ferns have been watching and waiting for that match against England in a fortnight’s time – and it doesn’t much matter who they have got to get by to do it.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025New Zealand women's rugby union teamCanada women's rugby union teamEngland women's rugby union teamAustralia women's rugby union teamSouth Africa women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Not only was the Englishman denied proper euphoria when claimingthe PGA Championship in 2020– those were Covid times – but he started this week depicting himselfwaking up in a pool of his own vomitafter qualifying for Europe’s Ryder Cup team.Hatton forms part of the European contingent who will fly to New York for a scouting mission as soon as this tournament ends. He may have a trophy for hand luggage and further partying in mind.His 64 was the standout round of day three on the West Course. He sits two behind the Frenchman Adrien Saddier and the resurgent Swede Alex Norén with 18 holes to play. Saddier and Norén are 15 under par.John Daly claims unwanted slice of golf history with record 19 on single holeRead more“We’ll be on a flight. I don’t know,” said Hatton when asked how he may mark success. “There’s a lot of golf left to play. All I want to do tomorrow is play well and give myself a chance.“Winning would mean a lot. When I last played here, in 2023, I finished second and had a putt on the last that I hoped would at least get me in a playoff. I holed it butRyan Fox went and birdied the last. It was still special to finish the week with a full grandstand on 18 and the support I’ve had this week has been amazing again.”Stumbles, surprising ones, from some of the favourites at the head of proceedings have opened this event right up. Ludvig Åberg slipped to a 73, Justin Rose a 76 and Hideki Matsuyama the same. Viktor Hovland’s 71 was excellent in context of his fellow illustrious names. Hovland is three from the lead. There are 18 players within six of Saddier and Norén. Harry Hall, Matt Fitzpatrick and Patrick Reed are notable at minus 10.Had Norén timed this run only slightly differently, he would be a Ryder Cup player rather than a vice-captain. The 43-year-old’swin at the British Masterslast month was his first for seven years on the DP World Tour. A member of the successful European team of 2018, Norén would have been a valuable Bethpage addition in this form.Rory McIlroy has produced 17 birdies in three rounds with his five under par total the consequence of big errors elsewhere. He has played the last two holes in an aggregate of four over par.

Fixed planes of movement. Positive metrics. Data victory. Safety in order. Strength through no joy. This is all good stuff. This is a matrix for winning at sport. This is how Mikel Arteta has transformedArsenalfrom a flapping bead curtain made up of fun guys and leftovers into a hugely impressive team. You can definitely come second in the league like this.But then there are other things, the need for a little blood and a little risk. Attack ships off the shoulder of Orion. Very positive underlying numbers in the first halfagainst Liverpool. All these moments will be lost if the moments are not also seized, if a little ragged edge doesn’t enter the programme too. Or in the case ofthis 3-0 defeat of Nottingham Forest, a little bit of unprocessed Gyökeres.Martín Zubimendi’s zest a bitter pill for Postecoglou as Arsenal batter ForestRead moreOn a sunny, drizzly, breezy day, Arsenal strolled through a game they might at other times have struggled to win with this degree of ease. Best of all they did so with some interesting notes of variation, most obviously in the shape of Viktor Gyökeres, who was blunt and a little rough at times, but by the end had some great numbers.Seven passes in 90 minutes. Four shots. One goal. Also: zero dribbles, zero crosses, zero key passers, zero all that stuff. You could quibble and ask for some fouls, but those will come. It felt, even before his goal, just the right kind of bluntness in a team where the challenge for Arteta has been to usher in more of those moments where the brakes slip, where the birds fly backwards through the sky.This was a very good game for him, sparked by a front-loaded selection, and made even better by the contrast between a first half that felt at times like the football equivalent of watching someone build a Lego replica of Paddington Station.The second half served up four key moments between minutes 45 and 51, perhaps even key moments in Arsenal’s season. They were up by that point, the goal was a sublime hip-high volley from Martin Zubimendi, which may sadly under the Arteta “magic moments” scale (Szoboszlai coefficient) have to be scrubbed from the record.The first of those acts was a hard, flat punt from David Raya that ended up skimming out of play, but was also Arsenal’s first long pass from the back. The second, 47 seconds into the half, was a beautifully simple goal. Riccardo Calafiori flighted another pass down that flank. Eberechi Eze took the ball with a lovely cushioned touch and squared it.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta’s Arsenal cruised through a game they might at other times have struggled to win with this degree of ease.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APIn fairness, Gyökeres had to that point spent much of the game running around a like a stray dog in the school playground at morning break. But he was in exactly the right place, doing just the right thing. He scored easily. The PA announcer got to scream “VIKTOR … VIKTOR … VIKTOR”. It was a goal Arsenal might not have scored previously, three passes, the sort of goal teams this good should just rack up as a matter of course.On 51 minutes, the third unusual thing happened and this was also good because it involved some chaos. Calafiori gave the ball away high upfield with no one behind him. A Forest cross hit Chris Wood in the chest and looped goalward. Raya made a brilliant save, pushing it on to the bar. From the loose ball Cristhian Mosquera made a forensic goal-saving tackle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe just let him do it. Take a chance. Allow individual brilliance to happen, this time in defence. Arsenal have not conceded a goal from open play with Mosquera on the pitch. Who knows what it means. But he is very good at tackles and blocks.It is worth dwelling on Gyökeres a little. On 58 minutes, he summoned up the fourth big thing, combining with Eze on the left, running across to the far right and whamming a shot on to the post from a narrow angle, a silly place to shoot from also a great place to shoot from because it is exactly that this team has needed.Forest were cautious. The question before the game had been how would the players cope with Ange Postecoglou’s free-form nose flute jazz. On this evidence: by sitting very deep in much the same way. But Arsenal did find a way to beat that low block. The full-backs strolled into midfield. Noni Madueke treated his full-back like a spilled yoghurt pot in aisle seven to be tactfully avoided.Best of all Gyökeres did that simple thing well. The greatest pre-criticism of his signing was that he is Not an Arteta Player. But this is a good thing. Arsenal already had plenty of those. Gyökeres has been called a donkey, but this is also good. They already have enough robot parcel delivery droids. Kai Havertz, underrated as a central striker, may come in for the more fine-margin games.

It came at the end of the women’s 10,000m, a roar that could have been heard on Mount Fuji, a vast outpouring of appreciation and pride.At the front of the pack, four contenders were whittled down to two before the Olympic and world champion, Beatrice Chebet, took off with Italy’s Nadia Battocletti in pursuit.

It will, you imagine, be the first of many. The British teamfinish fifth. Sunday will bring more drama. Within seven minutes, the finals of the women’s and men’s 100m will be run. It promises to be fast and furious.Oblique Seville, one of the favourites for the men’s 100m, made a start so shocking that the stadium commentator, Geoff Wightman, suggested he “came out of the blocks like he was towing a caravan”. He still qualified by running 9.93sec.His Jamaican compatriot, Kishane Thompson, ran 9.95 while appearing to jog the final 30m. He is the favourite for the final. Whilethe reigning Olympicand world champion, Noah Lyles, matched that time in his heat he had to work a lot harder. In the women’s 100m,the Olympic champion, Julien Alfred, looked insanely comfortable as she strolled home in 10.93, the quickest time in the heats.While there was a great atmosphere on the track, there has been a rather frosty one in the sprinting community. That is because in the buildup to these Championships, Gabby Thomas, the American who won200m gold in Paris last year, posted a comment on social media that sent tongues wagging. “Doping coaches should be banned for life from coaching in the sport,” she wrote. “Whether you were banned while competing as an athlete or caught distributing as a coach [for some, both],” she wrote. “Idc idc idc [I don’t care] … If you train under a coach who is known for doping … you are complicit.”Her message was directed at Dennis Mitchell, who is coaching the four American women 100m sprinters here, including Melissa Jefferson-Wooden, the favourite for gold, andSha’Carri Richardson, the reigning champion.Mitchell was a top sprinter who made perhaps the most preposterous excuse for failing a drugs test. It came in 1998 after he tested positive for excessive testosterone and blamed it on having drunk five beers and having sex with his wife four times. “It was her birthday,” he said. “The lady deserved a treat.”Mitchell was banned for two years. A decade later he testified under oath in the Balco investigation that he had received human growth hormone from his coach,Trevor Graham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Guardian has contacted a number of people in US track and field, including those who were in the room with the Telegraph. It goes without saying that his athletes deny any wrongdoing.But it is also the case Thomas, who is a Harvard graduate, has opened a legitimate discussion and split the sprinting community in two. After she posted her comments, the former Olympic and world 100m champion Justin Gatlin, who wastwice banned for doping offences, told her it would have been better for her to stay silent.“If she said it after Paris 24, it would have had more impact,” he said. “Makes it looks like you’re taking shots at someone like Melissa. It’s all about the timing. Melissa beat her twice, and is undefeated in the 100m. You should have taken a stance when you had the opportunity when you had the golden coin in your hand. It would have been better for her to be silent right now.”Whatever your view, one thing is clear. Come Sunday night, Jefferson-Wooden is likely to be on the podium. Richardson could be beside her. The crowd will roar. Mitchell will reflect on a job well done. Many in track and field will believe he should not be here at all.Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsNoah LylesnewsShareReuse this content"

Our writers set out the arguments on both sidesBryan Armen GrahamandDonald McRaeSat 13 Sep 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 04.31 EDTShareWhy Terence Crawford will beat Canelo ÁlvarezFor yearsBud Crawford’s name has been synonymous with patience. Denied mainstream recognition and opportunities against name-brand fighters, he kept beating everyone they put in front of him until he’d unified all four titles at junior welterweight. Then he did it again at welterweight with a dismantling of Errol Spence Jr so completeit cemented his placein boxing’s pound-for-pound S-tier alongside Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk. His gifts are obvious: the ability to switch seamlessly between stances, to read rhythms like sheet music, and to mete out punishment with icy composure once he’s cracked the code.Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stageRead moreCrawford’s scaling of two weight classes for this fight remains the 168lb elephant in the room. All but one of his 41 professional bouts took place at 147lb or below, while Canelo has been entrenched at 168 for nearly seven years and once captured a title at 175. On paper that is an enormous gap. But the leap may not be prohibitive. Crawford’s wiry frame has long suggested he could carry more weight – he’s actually a half-inch taller than Álvarez with a three-and-a-half-inch reach advantage – and reports from camp say he has done so without sacrificing quickness. Just as important, Canelo’s aura of near-invincibility has dimmed. He has not finished an opponent inside the distance in nearly four years. Against elusive opposition (Callum Smith, John Ryder, most recently William Scull), he has been content to bank rounds rather than impose himself. Against slick boxers (Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, Amir Khan for a while), he’s even looked ordinary. If the Mexican superstar is indeed in gentle decline, Crawford is precisely the kind of opponent capable of exposing it.Quick GuideCanelo Álvarez v Terence CrawfordShow•Canelo  v  Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answeredWhat's happening?Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.Where and when is the fight?The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.The main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ringwalks until after 12am ET (5am BST).What belts are on the line?Álvarez's undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.Where can I watch it?For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this magnitude will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers. The stream begins at 9pm ET, with undercard bouts leading into the main event.Netflix will offer commentary feeds in English and Spanish. Unlike traditional pay-per-view, which often costs US fans around $90, this one is included in a standard subscription.Who else is fighting?The first six undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm BST). The entire order of play is as follows:Preliminary card (Tudum, from 5.30pm ET/10.30pm BST)• Serhii Bohachuk v Brandon Adams, 10 rounds, middleweights• Ivan Dychko v Jermaine Franklin Jr, 10 rounds, heavyweights• Reito Tsutsumi v Javier Martinez, six rounds, super featherweights• Sultan Almohamed v Martin Caraballo, four rounds, super lightweights• Steven Nelson v Raiko Santana, 10 rounds, light heavyweights• Marco Verde v Sona Akale, six rounds, 162lb catchweightMain card (Netflix, from 8pm ET/1am BST on Sunday)• Callum Walsh v Fernando Vargas Jr, 10 rounds, junior middleweights• Christian Mbilli v Lester Martinez, 12 rounds, super middleweights• Mohammed Alakel v John Ornelas, 10 rounds, lightweights• Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford, 12 rounds, for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championshipWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Canelo’s vulnerabilities are not theoretical. Dmitry Bivol outworked him with straight punches and consistency, underlining his tendency to fight in bursts and give away stretches of rounds. Billy Joe Saunders and Caleb Plant both troubled him before wilting late. Even in victory, Canelo can drift, allowing opponents space to build momentum. Crawford thrives on hesitation. He forces fighters to second-guess, then punishes the pauses with sharp, accurate counters. If Canelo indulges in those lulls, Crawford will turn them into banked rounds and tilt the scorecards his way.Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answeredRead moreIt won’t be easy work. The first time Crawford is hit cleanly by Canelo will be the hardest he’s ever been hit in his life. And while the American has never been down or seriously hurt in a fight, it’s not as if he’s untouchable. Egidijus Kavaliauskas buckled his knees in 2019. Shawn Porter was competitive for the better part of nine rounds. Israil Madrimov had moments of success last year at 154. But those fights only reinforced Crawford’s defining trait: he adjusts midstream better than anyone in the sport. Once he solves the puzzle, he finishes the job. That’s why he strung together 11 straight stoppages before Madrimov – and why many consider him the most ruthless finisher in boxing. The danger he presents is cumulative. The jab grows more authoritative, the body work more telling and the counters sharper until resistance crumbles.Much has been made of the Vegas judges leaning Canelo’s way. Many felt Gennady Golovkin deserved the nod in their first fight,present company included. And the 114-114 card in the Mayweather fight was risible. It’s hard to imagine Crawford taking it out of their hands completely. But if his counters are sharper, his command of distance more telling and his punches more eye-catching, then he could follow the same path to victory that Sugar Ray Leonard took when he climbed to middleweight and outpointed Marvin Hagler in 1987.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford poses on the scale during Friday’s ceremonial weigh-in.Photograph: Candice Ward/Getty Images for NetflixThe weight may allow Canelo’s power to carry more consequence, especially early, but Crawford’s discipline will matter most. He will not allow himself to be trapped on the ropes or bullied into fighting at Canelo’s pace. Expect a competitive opening, then Crawford gradually asserting control with timing, angles and sharp counters that accumulate on the scorecards. Canelo will have moments, but Crawford’s rhythm and relentlessness will ensure they’re fewer and farther between as the fight goes on.The spectacle will be immense – Allegiant Stadium swollen with 70,000 fans, Netflix broadcasting to millions worldwide – but strip away the noise and this comes down to fundamentals. On Saturday night, I believe Crawford’s timing, adaptability and efficiency will carry him to a close but uncontroversial points win. Whether he gets the decision is another matter altogether.Bryan Armen GrahamWhy Canelo Álvarez will beat Terence CrawfordNext month it will be 20 years sinceSaúl “Canelo” Álvarezmade his professional debut in the historic old Mexican town of Tonalá on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Álvarez had turned 15 three months earlier and his fight purse was 800 pesos – the equivalent of $40.Years laterhe confidedthat “they actually only paid me half of that. The other half was in tickets. I gave all the tickets to my family so I came home with 400 pesos. It seemed a lot.”Álvarez has long been the richest fighter in boxing, with his earnings closing in on a billion dollars, but on Saturday night he will earn the most astronomical purse of his career in a manufactured contest. The greatTerence Crawfordis, essentially, a brilliant welterweight while Álvarez has even been a world champion at light-heavyweight. They will meet at super-middleweight, the natural home for Álvarez in his twilight years. He remains the undisputed world champion at 168lb while Crawford, whose last bout was an unconvincing first performance at 154, is jumping two weight divisions.Álvarez and Crawford face off in breathless blockbuster destined to break recordsRead moreYet their discrepancy in size is balanced by various factors which mean that, despite the contrived match-up, this fight is fueled by enough intrigue and uncertainty to offer it a legitimacy that could never be attached to the embarrassment of Jake Paulsharing the ring with a 58-year-old Mike Tysonin 2024’s equivalent of the most hyped scrap of the year.Álvarez and Crawford are exemplary fighters who carry gravitas and grit, style and substance. Crawford is a master boxer who fights with an ice-cold edge. He has the speed and movement to trouble Alvarez – especially as the Mexican is years past his prime. Alvarez, at 35, is actually the younger man as Crawford turns 38 next month. The Mexican has compiled a formidable 63-2-2 record but he is now a much slower and weathered version of his best self.Álvarez’s ring IQ is matched by his intelligence outside the ring and so it’s little surprise that he has chosen his recent opponents carefully. His courage and resolve have been indisputable against many outstanding fighters – from Shane Mosley and Floyd Mayweather Jr to Gennady Golovkin and Dmitry Bivol. But lately, rather than facing dangerous rivals like David Benavidez, who would have a serious chance of beating him, Álvarez has selected easier opponents.This strategic thinking is one of the reasons why it’s difficult to pick against him. Álvarez has great respect for Crawford’s blistering talent but he seems certain he will be too big and strong for the American.Crawford has a flawless 41-0 record but, in his last fight, which saw him move up to super-welterweight, helooked diminished against Israil Madrimov– who made just his 12th appearance in the professional ring. Madrimov is a solid fighter but it was a salutary night for Crawford. He won a unanimous decision but his supporters must have shuddered when wondering how he would negotiate another leap up two further weight classes, where Álvarez hits so much harder than Madrimov.View image in fullscreenSaúl “Canelo” Álvarez flexes for the crowd at Friday’s ceremonial weigh-in.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesÁlvarezlooked terrible in his last fight, a stinker in May against the lightly-regarded pacifist William Scull. But he is intensely motivated now and it seems telling that Álvarez has been sparring hard withJaron “Boots” Ennis, who would test Crawford at welterweight.Crawford is, technically, the world’s best boxer since Mayweather Jr. Álvarez was barely 23 whenhe was outboxed by Mayweather in 2013, but he also struggled during a split-decision win against Erislandy Lara, a slick southpaw who moved. Crawford epitomizes those three attributes far more convincingly than Lara.But it seems unlikely that Crawford will be able to put a real dent in Álvarez. His clinical punching will chip away at the Mexican’s granite chin but, eventually, the logic of size and space should prevail. Álvarez is so adept at shutting down distance that, when he eventually corners Crawford, his bulk and power will be sapping.Crawford is fiercely competitive and his instinct might be to stand and trade. That could be a terrible mistake. Instead, Crawford needs to stick and move in an attempt to expose this worn version of Álvarez. But boxing is an unforgiving business and Álvarez, so often favored by the judges in Vegas, will probably bludgeon his way to a points victory over the valiant, skilful but, ultimately, outgunned Crawford.Donald McRaeExplore more on these topicsBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezTerence CrawfordMexicoUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’ve got match-winners one to 11. There’s a lot of role clarity.“Nights like this are so special. Edgbaston is an amazing place to play. The atmosphere is always great and it felt like a home game tonight. I think the most special thing is playing with your mates and helping them succeed. There is an amazing spirit in this squad and I think we’re going to have a great night!”The final was a battle of T20 big boys – with bothSomersetand Hampshire on their 11th visit to Edgbaston – canny experienced campaigners. Smeed’s 94 off 58 balls had kept Somerset in the hunt to catch Hampshire’s 194 for six, even after Tom Kohler-Cadmore, in sparkling form, was bowled by an 88mph yorker by Sonny Baker – back in the limelight after his England debut. And even in the tricky middle overs as the runs dried up and the clock ticked down – with six overs to go, an imposing 76 were needed.Sean Dickson, in his last game for the club before moving to Glamorgan, was dropped by Scott Currie on seven, a lease of life that proved bad news for Hampshire as he and Smeed dragged Somerset to within 18 runs before Smeed crunched the ball to James Vince on the boundary. The pendulum might have swung, but Lewis Gregory’s sealed the deal with 18 in five balls and an over to spare, to bring Somerset their third Blast trophy – level with Hampshire and Leicestershire – and their second in three years. “We did it the hard way,” said Gregory – but no one minded, least of all the spectators roaring Blackbird in the stands.If Blast finals day hasn’t got the cachet it once had with the rise of the Hundred and franchise tournaments round the world, not to mention the scheduling squeeze, then no one at the ground had told the enthusiastic if occasionally dishevelled crowd, belting out a succession of stadium anthem specials, or the players whose despair, joy or fury was shown on the big screen, and who played entertaining cricket over 11 hours.View image in fullscreenToby Albert anchored Hampshire’s innings with a 48-ball 85.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersIt was the end of a difficult week for Hampshire, who were deducted eight points for an unfit pitch to put them in relegation danger in the County Championship, and learned that they would lose the services of their head coach, Adrian Birrell, after seven years at the club. It had looked their game to lose at the halfway stage after James Vince, with his usual casual rakishness, and Toby Albert, touch-perfect as befits the Blast’s leading run scorer in 2025, gave Hampshire a blazing start in a partnership of 97.They had both slotted fifties in their same over – Vince’s 46th in T20 Blast games – when Vince was caught. James Fuller followed soon afterwards but Albert pressed the accelerator, four times reversing his wrists and reaching the rope, a whirlwind of trick shots until Gregory finally sent him on his way for 85. Benny Howell kept up the momentum and Hampshire finished with the second highest score in Blast history.

Lynn moved from 78 to 108 in the space of one devastating over, sending Lloyd Pope into a Hollies Stand of ecstatic sombreros and swaying bananas with five successive sixes. He finished 108 not out, hitting every one of Hampshire’s 11 sixes to carry them to a six-wicket Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method win.Somerset romped to a 23-run victory in the first semi final, beating an underpoweredLancashire, with Jimmy Anderson but without England’s Luke Wood, Phil Salt, Jos Buttler and Saqib Mahmood, and the overseas players Ashton Turner (back in Australia) and Chris Green (at the Caribbean Premier League).Lancashire’s chase had hinged on Liam Livingstone, whose disbelief when the third umpire upheld the onfield lbw decision when he was on 29 suggested a tickle of bat.

But Lambourn and Sean Levey had, by that point, teed it up perfectly for Scandinavia and Tom Marquand to strike for home two furlongs out, and the proven stamina of the winner of the two-mile Goodwood Cup allowed him to tough it out through the final quarter as Rahiebb and Scandinavia’s stable companion, Stay True, tried and failed to close him down.Marquand was called up for the ride on Scandinavia as O’Brien grappled with a mini-crisis in his team of jockeys, after a season-ending leg injury for Ryan Moore and a 10-day suspension for Wayne Lordan, who rode Lambourn to his Derby success. The fact he had ridden Scandinavia as a two-year-old was perhaps what tipped the balance his way, and the betting market struggled to separate Scandinavia and Lambourn until shortly before the start, when late money sent the former off as the 2-1 favourite.View image in fullscreenThe stamina-laden Scandinavia showed his toughness under a drive from Tom Marquand to win the St Leger.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“I’ll be honest, I’d have been happy on any of the three, any ride in a Classic is big,” Marquand said. “I rode him as a two-year-old at Newmarket and really liked him, it was one of those when sometimes the stars align, when I rode him that day. Obviously I didn’t think I’d be winning the Leger on him, but it’s nice to ride these horses early when they’re progressing into staying types, as they just take their time to get there.“He’s got the most beautiful temperament [and] he was tough today, it’s a long way up the straight on that ground when you’ve been trying to fend off good horses. He stays extremely well, as he showed at Goodwood, but I thought today was a real show of his tenacity on that ground.”Soumillon, O’Brien’s stand-in No 1 after Moore’s injury, had drawn a blank on his first nine rides for Ballydoyle after his call-up before the first day of Irish Champions Weekend, but his enduring quality emerged aboard Delacroix in the afternoon’s feature event.Soumillon seized the initiative on the turn for home and carved out a decisive advantage before Delacroix showed grit to go with his turn of foot and hold the challenge of Anmaat, the secondfavourite, by three-quarters of a length.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two strides, it was over. He wasn’t there, and the next, he was gone.”Delacroix is now a hugely significant stallion prospect for the Coolmore Stud operation which supplies O’Brien’s ammunition, as he is an outcross from the Galileo and Sadler’s Wells bloodlines that feature in many of the stud’s broodmares. As a result, he is highly unlikely to race on at four and O’Brien did not commit to even a single further outing after Saturday’s success. “It could be,” O’Brien said as to whether it was the horse’s last race. “I can’t tell you how important he is … he has all the options really.”Explore more on these topicsSt LegerHorse racing tipsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

You’d be forgiven for assuming this particular issue was sorted out quite a long time ago. But, because we live in hell, it seems the question is once again up for debate.Not by women, though; the fairer sex is obviously too emotional for such muscular discussion. So please sit this one out, ladies, and listen to what America’s finest male intellectuals have to say.First up is Braeden Sorbo, a 24-year-old conservative influencer and nepo baby (he’s the son of the Hercules actor Kevin Sorbo), who claims he is constantly harangued by women telling him how desperate they are to have their rights taken away.“I know more young women today who say they wish they didn’t ever get the right to vote than I’ve ever talked to in my life,” Sorborecently toldRichard Harris, host of the Truth & LibertyYouTube show. Which rather raises the question: how many young women has Sorbo ever talked to in his life? Harris didn’t push Sorbo on the veracity of this anecdata, however. Instead he just gave a manly chuckle as Sorbo blamed all the ills of the world (abortion, feminism) on the 19th amendment.Per Sorbo, his female peers have also told him that “I would much rather give up my one right to vote if it meant 10,000 liberal women wouldn’t be allowed to vote, so that we could return to a better place”. (Manysuch cases!) He went on tosaythat his ultimate vision is a “voting system based on Christian morals, which relates to married couples having one joint vote”.Perhaps you’re thinking: what does it matter what a 24-year-old jamoke on a far-right YouTube show says? I refer you to line three of paragraph one: it matters because we live in hell. In a normal world, Sorbo would be a fringe figure shouting into the ether who we could all happily ignore. But thanks in part to digital media, we don’t have that luxury any more. Sorbo has 1.9 million followerson TikTok.; while some of his videos only get a few thousand views he has quite a few that top a million.More importantly, however, Sorbo’s views can no longer be dismissed as “fringe”. Rather, the idea that women shouldn’t vote is increasingly being co-signed and amplified by some of the most powerful people in America.Last month, for example, the US defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, shared a video on X in whichseveral pastorssay women should no longer be allowed to vote as individuals. “In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” one of the pastors in theCNN clipsays. “I would ordinarily be the one to cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.” While Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the video, he did retweet it with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life.”Slate thencontactedthe Pentagon to give Hegseth a chance to clarify his thoughts on the matter. The reply wasn’t a straight answer; instead it just said Hegseth was a member of a church affiliated with Pastor Doug Wilson and “very much appreciates many of Mr Wilson’s writings and teachings”. Wilson is a Christian nationalistwho has said“women are the kind of people that people come out of” and written blogposts with titles such as “The Lost Virtue of Sexism”.Then there’s the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who helpedbankrollJD Vance’s political career. Back in 2009, Thielpublished an essaythat argued it may have been a bit of an error to give women the right to vote. “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” Thiel wrote.Thiel got a lot of flak for this and laterclarified his statement, saying: “It would be absurd to suggest that women’s votes will be taken away … While I don’t think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better.” Which is rather different from saying: “Of course women should have the right to vote, I’m mortified anyone misinterpreted my pretentious word salad.”Predictably, Elon Musk also has some views on this matter. While the tech billionaire (soon to betrillionaire?) has never explicitly argued women shouldn’t vote, he has amplified tweets that undermine the idea of universal suffrage.Last year, for example, he wrote “interesting observation” on a retweet of a post by an account called Autism Capital which stated a “Republic of high status males is best for decision making.” The same post argued “women and low T men” are “malleable” and can’t think freely. A year before, Musk appeared toendorse the ideathat “democracy is probably unworkable long term without limiting suffrage to parents”.The right are very good at shifting the Overton windowin their favourand propelling oncefringe viewsinto the mainstream. They’re also adept atweaponizingthe law to help advance their agenda. They won’t be able to get rid of women’s voting rights overnight, of course. Just like the right to a legal abortion, they’llchip away at itgradually with bills that disenfranchise the “wrong” sort of people andmechanismsthat make voting more difficult. But we should not mistake their ultimate objective. Musk, Thiel and Hegseth are some of the most powerful people in the world: when they, along with influencers such as Sorbo, hint that they are interested in getting rid of women’s suffrage, we should take them very seriously indeed.Texas professor fired after accusations of teaching ‘illegal’ gender identityTexas A&M Universityfired a professoron Tuesday after a viral video in which a student complained they were being taught illegal notions about gender identity. The university president responded by saying: “This isn’t about academic freedom; it’s about academic responsibility.” But the professor, Melissa McCoul, hasappealedagainst her termination and is exploring further legal action. McCoul’s termination comes amid a broader crackdown by the Trump administration onhigher educationand freedom of speech. Rather than fighting back, many universities (helloColumbia!) are shamefully bending the knee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Black has said an independent inquiry found he had a limited relationship with Epstein and didn’t know about his sexual misconduct.

Or my byline photo made you spontaneously strip down to nothing but a pair of crusty underwear and a smile. I don’t judge, and I also don’t blame you. That photo is from a decade ago.Assuming you’re in clothes, then you had to decide what to wear. It’s an arduous task for most of us – the rummaging in a closet, color coordinating, the classic “smell” test to confirm you can go another week without doing your laundry. For me, dressing is a joy. I have multiple closets stocked with clothes – suits, mostly. I have some shorts, some sweats, hoodies and T-shirts, but those are for special occasions only. Like a kid’s birthday or a hangover.You know what you won’t find in my closet?Jeans.Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel ConnollyRead moreI hate jeans. Not even apoorly conceived Sydney Sweeney commercialcould convince me I needed to buy jeans. If I had to choose between wearing denim and one of thosebarrels cartoon hobos wear, I’d choose the barrel. Far more dignified. Jeans were created for gold miners so they didn’t rip their pants while sloshing in a river full of jagged rocks. I panned for gold once, on a school field trip toSutter’s Fortin fifth grade. I was not asked to go pro.Jeans make some people look like Bruce Springsteen – macho, blue collar and soulful. Jeans make me look like my dad – balding, with bad posture and a curious mustard stain on my crotch. Suits make me look grown up. Jeans make me look ground down. They make me look washed, cooked, chopped and all the other things my kid yells at me when I try to bend over to pick up one of his toys and I screech in pain.You can wear jeans if you want. I won’t stop you, but please, cease and desist with the denim discourse. Arecent GQ articlefrom July titled “I Went Back to Skinny Jeans, and It Feels Incredible” is the latest in a cottage industry of fashion articles that give you permission to do something we all decided was lame a few years ago.Another GQ article from this year, called “Sperry Boat Shoes Won Me Back. I Never Should’ve Docked ‘Em” assured nervous young men that Sperry Top-Siders are actually not five-alarm fire, dweeb alert material, but an “American classic”. We should all be sure to have Top-Siders under our bed, in case a yachting regatta spontaneously breaks out within walking distance of our house, the local crew team is looking for a coxswain, orJordan Belfort needs help committing a complex financial crime.I’m in my early 40s (hence the screeching and the back pain and the child) and I have lived through a variety of trends at this point. I remember JNCO Jeans, which were wide enough to smuggle an entire 2-liter bottle of orange soda into a matinee screening ofThe Crow. I’ve seen bucket hats come and go, mostly timed to whether or not Oasis was touring. I understand the imperative to keep changing how people dress so that they will never stop buying more clothes. If we ever collectively stopped buying clothes we didn’t need, pollution-generating factories around the world would disappear, access to fresh water would increase and we’d be robbing the world of millions of borderline slave-labor jobs. So we keep generating content designed to make people buy new versions of clothes they gave away five years ago, because the same publication told them what they already owned sucked.No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. They get wider, narrower, higher or lower depending on which way the fashion industry wind blows. The expensive jeans you bought in 2022 are potentially out of step three years later. If you are entirely devoid of an individual sense of style, you will cycle through all these permutations of denim in order to maintain the shred of self-esteem you have left that comes from recognizing your pants in a paparazzi photo of Jacob Elordi.I didn’t stop wearing skinny jeans because they went out of fashion. I stopped because I can’t fit into them comfortably. They objectively do not look good on me. I look like an old man trying to seem young. The author of the GQ article about skinny jeans refers to his ideal personal style as “Regular Millennial Guy Look”. Oh, to be regular, to be just a “guy” again! What heaven it would be. If I could press a button and be 25 again, I would. But buying the same clothes I wore when I was 25, desperate to fit in and not be noticed by anyone, is not going to magically make me 25 again.Worse yet, the writer describes what sounds like a minor cardiac event that occurred when he dipped back into the world of skinny jeans. “On a whim I decided to wrestle my way into a pair of Petit Standards. Behind the velvet curtain, red in the face and out of breath – but for once, it was me in the mirror.” I support anyone who feels comfortable in what they wear, but if your journey of self-discovery involves the warning signs of a heart attack, maybe there are other options out there for you.The longer I’m on this planet, the less I care about the various permutations of the fashion industry, its blatant greed and a stunning lack of creative energy. There are exceptions, mostly smaller labels fronted by young designers, but luxury fashion iscontrolled by billionaire conglomeratesthat care more about maximizing profits than making anything worth owning. Fast fashion iscontributing to global pollutionat an alarming rate. And the fashion media just wants you to keep buying more junk. No one will ever convince me to buy jeans. I don’t need jeans. Skinny, wide or otherwise.Now, if GQ would report on the resurgence of hobos wearing barrels, maybe I’d see things a little differently.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsJeansOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Putin and Xi are pondering immortality in real lifeSat 13 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 08.08 EDTShareIwas in bed scrolling on my phone when I read the headline: Hot mic catches Xi and Putindiscussing organ transplants and immortality. It took me a long time to get to sleep after that.Not yet, I thought. I pride myself on my prescience, but I wasn’t ready for the future I had imagined to arrive so soon.Since 2017, I’ve been thinking about the implications of longevity research, sketching out possible futures – the shifts in society, the complications and subcultures. This year I published the result of my thought experiment,Who Wants to Live Forever, a speculative literary novel. It follows Yuki and Sam, a couple at a crossroads at the same time that a new drug, called Yareta – which extends the human lifespan by 200 years and preserves youth – becomes available. Sam takes it, Yuki doesn’t, and the novel follows the fallout as the world changes around them. The story ends in 2039. Naively, considering the billions being poured into longevity research by the likes ofPeter Thiel,Jeff BezosandBryan Johnson(subject of this year’s Netflix documentaryDon’t Die), I thought that was how long it might take for my fiction to become reality.But the tech bros and autocrats are moving much faster, making the question of extended lifespans more urgent. As sci-fi writer William Gibson said: “The future is already here – it’s just unevenly distributed.”I’m not immune to the siren call of a longer life. An elder millennial, I’m obsessed with my LED mask and Trello board, and time’s relentless march always on my mind. My novel is told from the viewpoint of five characters who have contrasting opinions on immortality, and I feel for all of them. But when it comes to authoritarian leaders living for ever, I’m unequivocal: it’s a nightmarish prospect. Especially when one of them – Vladimir Putin – has reportedlybathed in the bloodof Siberian deer antlers for its supposed anti-ageing properties. There is something gruesome about these leaders wishing to hoard time, hoard life, when their regimes are shortening the lives of those in Ukraine and Myanmar through military action and intervention. Our political leaders should be the ones regulating this new technology, not rushing to partake of it. Have any of them given a thought to the societal consequences? Luckily I have.This technology, when it arrives, will not be available to everyone. Inevitably it will be prohibitive for all but the most wealthy. We are watching that play out right now with drugs like Ozempic: those who have the money and inclination drop hundreds a month while others turn to the black market, often ending up in A&E,vomiting blood.Statistically, in the UK the most wealthy are older white men who live in London and the south-east. What will be the knock-on consequences of such a demographic disproportionately sticking around, as it were, blocking opportunities for others around them and for younger generations coming up? In my novel, a character called Maya feels pushed to take Yareta to advance in her career – without the extra time, she might never get promoted. Even Elon Musk, who in 2022 claimed to have uploaded hisbrain to the cloud, could see this, saying: “If you live forever, we might become a very ossified society where new ideas cannot succeed.” (Last year he announced that he would rather be dead than live to 100 – a relief for us all.)This disparity is, of course, nothing new. In England, there is already a19-year gapin healthy life expectancy between the most and least affluent areas. A drug like Yareta would only widen it further. In my fiction, this division leads to a new job sector emerging staffed by an underclass of Helpers who take on the “risky” work that those on Yareta no longer want to do, such as driving, handling knives and climbing ladders. Since no drug can eliminate the risk of accidental death, an intensive health and safety culture takes hold, leading to wealthy “spanners” wearing helmets and neck braces as they go about their lives, wrapped up like Ming vases while Helpers serve as a renewable source of labour, each one a butterfly living for a brief span of time by comparison.That’s just work. The social order itself will be shaken. Dating apps that filter for users on the drug. Parents the same age as their children. Overpopulation, or child permits. Relationships strained as one partner grows older while the other does not (as with Peter Pan and Wendy Darling, or Buffy and Angel, that dynamic is hard to sustain). Romance has always carried an unspoken time limit: “for ever” is only meaningful because our lives are not. In my imagined world, marriage gives way to the Seven Ceremony: vows renewed or discarded every seven years.You might live to be 100. Are you ready? | Andrew J ScottRead morePersonally, I look forward to growing older – to meeting my aged face and accruing more wisdom that I hope to pass on. And then if I am very lucky and have lived to a ripe old age, I look forward to letting it all go. Who would want to be Jeff Bezos, presiding over an empire of cardboard boxes for eternity? I would rather be a butterfly making way for those yet to come.The words of poet Joseph Fasano keep ringing round my head from arecently published poem: “Ruler, the children will outlive you.”Let’s hope he’s right.Hanna Thomas Uose is a writer and strategist.

I live in Finland and so know well that the country is heavy metal mad. It boasts more metal bands per capita thanany other country in the world. Metal has long been the nation’s unofficial flagship cultural pursuit, with bands (called things such as Nightwish, Apocalyptica and Amorphis) acting as ambassadors where few other cultural figures have broken through abroad. But I still wasn’t prepared for what I saw.The gig was preceded by a gathering of the “Crazy Finns” – a ragbag of Finnish Maiden fanatics who have followed the band on tour for two decades. The fan group celebrated their 20th anniversary with a concert pre-party featuring Dennis Stratton, who played on the band’s self-titled debut in 1980. As Stratton performed an acoustic version of Prowler, backed by local musician Henri Seger, the tears started to flow – predominantly from the men in the audience. At this point I realised one of the main reasons for metal’s popularity in a country where the inhabitants are famously emotionally restrained – it offers a rare outlet for collective expression. I won’t forget the sight of these macho, taciturn Finnish men united in their tears and their denims, the instantly recognisable uniform of the metal fanbase worldwide.The appeal of heavy metal might be strongest in Finland, but it goes well beyond its borders. It is old for a musical subculture (Black Sabbath released their debut album 55 years ago), but it is in rude health. Metal has prominently featured in mainstream discussion over the past year, from Gojira’s Paris Olympicsopening ceremony performanceand Grammy win, to Iron Maiden’s 50th anniversary tour, toBlack Sabbath’s farewell gig. Ozzy Osbourne’s death just weeks later was followed by the kind of outpouring of public emotion usually reserved for stars of mainstream music. Given Sabbath are widely credited with producing the first metal album, this seems the right time to ask what music’s darkest genre owes its longevity and increasing popularity to.As a metal fan since 1990, I can relate that in any bar in any town in any western country (and some more besides), you can strike up a conversation over a metal T-shirt or band patch. This is practically survival for some. As a weird metal kid, you were often ostracised, sometimes persecuted. In UK seaside towns in the 90s, such as Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex, where I grew up, or neighbouring Hastings, where I attended art college, teenage boredom often tipped over into mindless violence around music and fashion affiliations. At such times, metal clothing signified people you could run to and trust in a scrape. It is the garb of the dispossessed.View image in fullscreenFans at Villa Park, Birmingham, for the final concert of heavy metal legends Black Sabbath, 5 July 2025.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ability that metal has to reach out to the alienated and provide a community is not lost on the UK’s Graphic Nature – who play a gritty crossover of extreme and nu metal. I saw them play at the QStock festival in Oulu,Finland, in July – and during their set, the lead singer, Harvey Freeman, explained that many of their lyrics are about mental health awareness, before asking the assembled crowd to “bang your heads”. Graphic Nature’s relentless syncopated rhythm left me – and, it appeared, a good portion of the crowd – feeling emotionally lighter by the set’s end. A little later that evening, the Finnish “Viking metallers” Ensiferum delivered a heroic-camp set, with their long-bearded bassist gurning like a pirate throughout. Their considerable technical ability was only matched by the ludicrousness of their premise and their huge stage presence.Two weeks after QStock I attended the Atomic Grass festival at Tukikohta cultural centre in Oulu – a small event in a building with squat party vibes and a “bring your own beer” policy. Among the seven Finnish metal bands on the lineup, Turku’s Sgt Slime moved a dedicated crowd with a mix of hardcore and metal. Their lyrics reveal a sense of fun behind the bludgeoning riffs, as with the song Escape from Planet Hell, which conveys the torment of having no beer in a post-apocalypse world:The darkness lasted for daysIn the comet’s wakeThe yeast is now erasedThis could seem crass given the many threats to our existence today, but would a more serious message achieve anything more? We live in exceptional times, facing challenges we feel powerless to do anything about. Many seek refuge in spirituality and wellness, others stress themselves further with endless doom-scrolling, hoping to find answers.Metaloffers an alternative to the saccharine messaging of social media and banging one’s head against a wall by endlessly revisiting the horrors of our time on our feeds.As ludicrous as metal often is, it never dresses up the harsh realities and refuses to provide false solace – an approach that appears toboost the wellbeing of its fans. Its honesty hits even harder as you get older and realise what the stakes are – and what it means to have hopes and goals thwarted. Forget the comic trope of rockers with Zimmer frames. Sticking with metal as you age signals your continued willingness to do things on your own terms – an ethos thankfully being passed down through the generations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wide-eyed and unflinching, surely aware his days were numbered, the Prince of Darkness started his farewell gig rising up on a black throne, straddling the worlds of high camp and horror. It is this ability to confront the dark side head on and with a touch of humour that has enabled metal to endure and grow in popularity over time.

His crackdown on Democratic-led municipalities has fueled legal concerns and spurred protests, including a recent demonstration by several thousand people in Washington DC.Democratic leaders have said that the massive deployments are more a show of power by Trump rather than a serious effort to fight crime.More than a dozen residents of Shreveport,Louisiana, told Reuters they viewed any deployment as more of a political stunt than a meaningful crime-fighting solution – and a way for Trump to blunt criticism that he’s only targeting Democratic-controlled states.Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, is Republican. The mayors of Shreveport and Baton Rouge, two of Louisiana’s most prominent cities, are Republicans. But the mayor of New Orleans, the state’s best-known city, is a Democrat.A Pentagon spokesperson did not comment in detail on the documents. A spokesperson said: “Leaked documents should not be interpreted as policy. We will not discuss these plans through leaked documents, pre-decisional or otherwise.”‘It’s not safe in DC as an immigrant’: racial profiling surged during Trump’s Washington takeoverRead moreThe planning documents, according to the Post, state that the plan would allow the military to supplement law enforcement in cities such as New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Both cities have majority Black populations.The Pentagon’s plan outlines a mobilization lasting until 30 September 2026, though no start date was specified.Among the documents is an unsigned, undated draft memo from Pentagon chiefPete Hegsethto US attorney generalPam Bondiand homeland security secretaryKristi Noem, which highlights the “unique advantage” of the military’s proposed approach to law enforcement in Louisiana, according to the Post.Hinging on a request for troop deployment from Landry, who is a staunch Trump supporter, the proposal has not been confirmed as approved by federal or state officials, according to the Post’s reporting. The Pentagon’s Louisiana plan suggests a robust operation is under consideration, with national guard personnel “supplementing” the law enforcement presence in high-crime neighborhoods. They could also help with drug interdiction and by providing “logistical and communications support” to local authorities, the Washington Post reported.On Friday, Trump said he would send national guard troopsto Memphis, Tennessee.Explore more on these topicsLouisianaTrump administrationUS militaryUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

By that time, he had told the Commons he had confidence in Mandelson during prime minister’s questions at midday.Kemi Badenoch accused Starmer andLabourMPs of “lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson’s involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein”.The Tory leader wrote on X: “If No 10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement. The prime minister has very serious questions to answer. The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when.”Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, the backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake said the reports that Starmer had not been told about Mandelson’s emails to Epstein soon enough were “really embarrassing”. “Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails are presented to them clearly has deep failings,” she said.“We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the backbenches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.“Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.”She said Labour should consider whether Mandelson, who had displayed “a lack of judgment”, should continue to represent the party in the Lords. “It’s very worrying that we’re in this position,” she said.The Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty told MPs on Thursday that Mandelson had not disclosed the extent of his friendship with Epstein at the time of his appointment.“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment,” he said. “In particular, Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information.”He said Mandelson was being sacked “with immediate effect” in light of the new information.The Guardian was told Starmer had taken the decision to sack Mandelson during a meeting with Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, on Thursday morning, after reviewing the new material on Mandelson’s defence of Epstein the previous night.It is understood Mandelson had not had access to the emails written in 2008 himself until the leak, because they came from a long-deleted account, which was not available during the Foreign Office’s vetting process for the role of ambassador.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crown did not accept the basis of the plea.The fire gutted the premises, as well as those of a small charity for people with very rare genetic diseases called Niemann-Pick UK (NPUK). An NHS mental health service for veterans was based in the same building.Fire investigators were seen on Thursday at the offices in the Concord area of Washington, Tyne and Wear. Graffiti on the side of the building reads “328 days blood on your hands,” although it is believed to have been there for as long as a year.Oliver had been living in a tent nearby, the court heard. District judge Kate Meek remanded him in custody to appear at Newcastle crown court on 14 October.Oliver was charged with arson of Vermont House, Washington, with the damage estimated at between £250,000 to £500,000, and he admitted starting a fire in a wheelie bin that then spread.Heather Bolton, defending, said: “He accepts he has set fire to the wheelie bin, he didn’t intend for the fire to spread to the building.”The defendant was told a decision will be made whether a Newton hearing, which would rule whether the offence was intentional or not, will be necessary.Oliver also admitted burgling the building when he stole a mallet and power tools on the night. He admitted three counts of criminal damage, namely smashing windows at Vermont House, in the days before the fire.The defendant also admitted twice smashing widows at his father’s house in Sunderland in July.The district judge said he will be sentenced for all offences at the crown court.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Thirteen more were killed in a separate operation in South Waziristan district.The incidents underline the strugglesPakistanfaces as it tries to contain the resurgence of militant groups.The country has faced a rise in attacks in recent years, most claimed by the PakistaniTaliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.TheTTP calls itself the world’s biggest jihadist front, and has committed a number of high-profile attacks including the attempted murder of the peace activist Malala Yousafzai, the murder of Pakistan’s former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the attempted bombing of Times Square in New York.The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 emboldened the TTP, and gave militants a haven over the border from where they can conduct operations against Pakistan. This has led to a deterioration of ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.The Pakistani military urged the Taliban government in Kabul to “to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan”.The military described the dead militants as “Khawarij” – a term referring to a radical sect that emerged during the early years of Islam, which the government uses for the TTP. It alleged the militants were backed by India though provided no evidence.Pakistan has long accused India of supporting the TTP and separatists in Balochistan, which New Delhi denies. There was no immediate comment from the Taliban in Kabul or from New Delhi.Saturday’s attack was one of the deadliest in months in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP once controlled areas of territory. Last month the Pakistani military launched a“targeted operation” against militants in Bajaur, a former stronghold, which displaced tens of thousands of people.Explore more on these topicsTalibanAfghanistanPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The curved finger of ice, rumpled like tissue, cuts between high buttresses of granite and gneiss. Now it has melted out of sight.People here once feared the monstrous ice streams, describing them as devils, but now they dread their disappearance. Like other glaciers in the Alps and globally, the Fiesch is melting at ever-increasing rates. More than ice is lost when the giants disappear: cultures, societies and entire ecosystems are braided around the glaciers.The neighbouringGreat Aletsch, like the Fiesch, flows from the high plateau between the peaks of the Jungfrau-Aletsch, a Unesco region in the Swiss canton of Valais and Europe’s longest glacier. It is receding at a rate of more than 50 metres a year, but from the cable car above it remains a mighty sight.View image in fullscreenThe Aletsch glacier viewed from Moosfluh, looking towards the Olmenhorn and Eggishorn peaksClouds scud across the sky and shafts of light marble the ice. On the rocky slopes leading down to the glacier from the ridge, there are pools of aquamarine brilliance, the ground speckled with startling alpine flowers. The ice feels alive, with waterfalls plunging into deep crevasses and rocks shimmering in the sun.“It’s just so diverse, these harsh mountains and ice, and up the ridge, a totally different habitat,” says Maurus Bamert, director of the environmental education centre Pro Natura Aletsch. “This is really special.”Participants now pray for the glacier not to vanish, but they once prayed for it to retreat and stop swallowing their meadowsMany of the living worlds in the ice and snow are not visible to the human eye. “You don’t expect a living organism on the ice,” Bamert says. But there is a rich ice-loving biotic community and surprising biodiversity that thrives in this frozen landscape.Springtails or “glacier fleas” survive on the snow’s crust – this year alone, five new species were identified in the European Alps. But there are also algae, bacteria, fungi andice worms, as well as spiders and beetles, which feed on springtails.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFolds on the glacier showing the sooty crust left on the ice from fossil fuels, wildfires, mineral dust and organic matter. The bare rock shows the retreat of the ice, leaving meltwater pools and rivulets cutting through the iceAs ice melts, this landscape and its inhabitants, human and non-human, are all affected. Along the glacier’s path, ice turns to water and the rushing sound of the river becomes audible. In 1859, at the greatest extent of its thickness, the glacier reached 200 metres higher than it does now.The landscape revealed by the melt is mostly bare rock, riven with fissures that spill across the hillside. Jasmine Noti from Aletsch Arena,the regional tourism organisation, says these widen each year, new cracks appear and routes are redesigned. The ice acts like a massive buttress, gluing the hillside together, and as it melts, slippage and instability increase.As the edges of the glacial valley descend into the cool cover of the Aletschwald forest, “it’s like walking through time”, says Bamert. On the higher slopes, older pines dominate, but lower down the trees thin, and the pioneer species of larch and birch cover the hillside: early signs of newer postglacial reforestation.It only takes about five to 10 years for plants to colonise the land.

All this was once under ice sheets, but the succession of growth tells a story of glacial retreat, historic and recent.View image in fullscreenLarch and birch are beginning to cover hillsides laid bare by the retreating glacier, with pines higher up the slopesTom Battin, professor of environmental sciences at Lausanne’s Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, says glacial margins are a transitional landscape where ecosystems are vanishing and appearing. An expert on the microbiology of stream ecosystems, Battin led a multiyear project on vanishing glaciers and what is lost with them.As he walks down to theMärjelensee, one of the Aletsch’s glacial lakes, this transition is readily apparent. In this mountain hollow, there was once an expansive lake with ice cliffs around its rim. Today, the pools of water are lit by patchy sun and rain, fish jumping andbog cottondancing in summer light.Battin points to aquatic mosses. These, he says, could never live in glacial streams which are fast flowing and extreme.

He studies the biodiversity that will be lost with glaciersLee Brown, professor of aquatic sciences at Leeds University, has studied invertebrate communities in glacier-fed rivers around the world, and says we do not yet know the full importance of those that are likely to disappear.“It’s a challenge to communicate,” he says, pointing out the crucial roles that tiny organisms have in the “trophic networks”–the nutrients flowing between organisms within an ecosystem–that connect ice, rivers, land and oceans. Biofilms, or communities of micro-organisms that stick to the surface of ice and rivers, filter the water.Glacierswash down vital nutrients from the mountain, but their rivers may run dry when the ice melts.Without this biodiversity which you can’t see, all that other biodiversity that people care about might disappearTom BattinThere are whole worlds in and around the ice, poorly known and understood until recently.Mountainsare like high islands, Battin says, with unique ecosystems and endemic species.“Without this biodiversity which you can’t see,” he says, “all that other biodiversity that people care about might disappear.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPioneering plants and trees such as birch and larch colonising the slopes above the AletschwaldFrancesco Ficetola is a professor of environmental science at Milan University who leads the PrioritIce project examining emerging ecosystems in glacial forelands, or land exposed by the retreating ice. As it melts, he says, “there’s a powerful combined effort of organisms” to create new and increasingly complex habitats.As something is gained, however, much is lost. Cold-climate specialists such asptarmiganandAlpine ibexare retreating up mountains, their habitats becoming ever smaller. The Swiss pines, on whose seedsnutcracker birdsfeed, are also moving upwards. Specialist alpine flowers and other pioneer plants at glacier edges are threatened, pushed out by the succession of forests and meadows.View image in fullscreenAdmiring the Aletsch glacier.

The guides Martin Nellen and his son, Dominik, have lived with the Aletsch glacier all their life. Martin jokes that the older he gets, the farther he must climb from the ridge to the glacial valley as the ice melts. “It’s rubbish,” he says.‘This is ground zero for Blatten’: the tiny Swiss village engulfed by a mountainRead moreMartin was instrumental in raising funds for information boards, which he also helped design, that explain the life story of the Aletsch. Dominik says they feel “sad, of course” about the glacier’s retreat, but they are also proud to educate people about glaciers and the distinctive landscape of snow-covered peaks and lush pastures.Every year at 6am on 31 July people gather for a procession that winds from the church in Fiesch to theMariahilf chapelin the forest above. Participants now pray for the glacier not to vanish, but they once prayed for it to retreat and stop swallowing their meadows and grazing land.View image in fullscreenAn altarpiece in the chapel in Ernen, showing the Fiesch glacierDivine assistance was first requested in 1652. Rosa, one of those gathered for the pilgrimage, remembers the deep snow and cold of past years. “I have been going since I was five,” she says. “There used to be more people.”This procession is special for the reversal of its request, but similar stories exist across the Alps. They are a reminder that something intangible is lost as glaciers disappear. The great rivers of ice have shaped the imaginations of inhabitants and visitors. Not everyone sees the glacier through the lens of faith, but many visitors – whether praying, guiding or educating – worry what the future holds.At a place called Baseflie, a cross still stands, erected in 1818 to banish the Aletsch glacier when it threatened pastures.

Their request was supported by their coach, Neil Brown, who helped persuade the skating federation to agree new rules, referring to ice dance partners as Skater A and Skater B instead of man and woman.Colling, an art student, enrolled at skating school a year after her family moved to Finland, and Aalto, a fashion student, has been skating since she was five years old. They met two years ago.“We were immediately on the same level, we really clicked,” said Colling. They began to skate together but “at that point we hadn’t seen any other same-gender skating teams”.But this year, the retired Olympic championsMadison Hubbell and Gabriella Papadakis performed together, hoping to help break gender stereotypes in the sport. Colling said: “It was completely new and we were, whoa, OK.”View image in fullscreenThe pair train at a rink in Helsinki.Photograph: Tom Little/ReutersIt was a “common misconception” that same-sex teams were gay or in a relationship, she added. “There are lots of queer athletes, and we really admire them. But it’s not the case that in order to be in a non-traditional team you have to be queer.”Aalto said: “The point is to be opening possibilities for everyone, not just for queer people.” Ice dancing with a same-sex partner was “not necessarily any different”, she said.Colling added: “One of us leads, one follows, one lifts, one of us is lifted. We have quite similar body mass, so technically there are some differences, but we still do the same content.”“Every partnership is different,” said Aalto. “Every couple has their own strengths and weaknesses, and their programmes are built around those strengths and weaknesses. Ice dance is a really individual sport – each couple is unique, and we’re just another unique couple.”If the duo qualify, they would be unable to take part in the national competition in December, as that requires further changes. “The federation has said we can’t do it yet – but fingers crossed for the future,” Colling said.The pair hope their participation in the qualifier will be a strong signal of change to the ice dance community and the public. They do not expect to win – “we’re just excited to get out there”, Colling said.They said they felt free and happy while skating. “You stop being a normal version of yourself. You can be whatever you want on the ice,” Aalto said. “It’s the best feeling – it feels like home.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsGenderFinlandFigure skatingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The illness is usually self-limiting. Most cases lasting up to two weeks.A small proportion of patients, mainly children, could develop life-threatening haemolytic uremic syndrome, which can lead to kidney failure. A similar condition called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may also develop in a small proportion of adults.Stec bacteria are most prevalent in cattle in the UK, but have also been found in the faeces of deer, rabbits, horses, pigs and wild birds.Government guidance says the strain is particularly infectious because very few bacteria are needed to cause illness, allowing the disease to spread easily within families and other settings such as hospitals and schools.People can become ill through eating contaminated food, contact with infected animals or people who have the illness, and drinking water from inadequately treated sources.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A third of people do not tell their bosses about their use of AI tools amid fears their ability will be questioned if they do.Research for the Guardian has revealed that only 13% of UK adults openly discuss their use of AI with senior staff at work and close to half think of it as a tool to help people who are not very good at their jobs to get by.Amid widespread predictions that many workers face a fight for their jobs with AI, polling by Ipsos found that among more than 1,500 British workers aged 16 to 75, 33% said they did not discuss their use of AI to help them at work with bosses or other more senior colleagues. They were less coy with people at the same level, but a quarter of people believe “co-workers will question my ability to perform my role if I share how I use AI”.The Guardian’s survey also uncovered deep worries about the advance of AI, with more than half of those surveyed believing it threatens the social structure. The number of people believing it has a positive effect is outweighed by those who think it does not. It also found 63% of people do not believe AI is a good substitute for human interaction, while 17% think it is.Next week’sstate visit to the UKby Donald Trump is expected to signal greater collaboration between the UK and Silicon Valley to make Britain an important centre of AI development.The US president is expected to be joined by Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI who has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in areas including justice, security and education. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, is also expected to announce an investment in the UK’s biggest datacentre yet, to be built near Blyth in Northumbria.‘We are teaching the machine to take our job’: Banks bet big on AI as thousands of jobs cutRead moreKeir Starmerhas saidhe wants to “mainline AI into the veins” of the UK. Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.The polling appears to reflect workers’ uncertainty about how bosses want AI tools to be used, with many employers not offering clear guidance. There is also fear of stigma among colleagues if workers are seen to rely too heavily on the bots.A separateUS studycirculated this week found that medical doctors who use AI in decision-making are viewed by their peers as significantly less capable. Ironically, the doctors who took part in the research by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School recognised AI as beneficial for enhancing precision, but took a negative view when others were using it.Gaia Marcus, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the large minority of people who did not talk about AI use with their bosses illustrated the “potential for a large trust gap to emerge between government’s appetite for economy-wide AI adoption and the public sense that AI might not be beneficial to them or to the fabric of society”.“We need more evaluation of the impact of using these tools, not just in the lab but in people’s everyday lives and workflows,” she said. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen any compelling evidence that the spread of these generative AI tools is significantly increasing productivity yet. Everything we are seeing suggests the need for humans to remain in the driving seat with the tools we use.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is called the “nocebo effect”, the opposite of the better-known placebo effect.Experiencing it is closely linked to anxiety, depression and fatigue, with experts saying people become “wary of anything that they believe might make [the conditions] worse”. This, in turn, spurs on the effect.It has been seen with other medicines, butthe study, by psychologists at Sheffield University, is the first to link the syndrome with use of the pill, whichhas fallen sharply.The pill remains the most popular form of contraception in England, but the proportion of women who access NHS sexual health services and use thepill as their form of birth control fellfrom 39% in 2020-21 to 28% in 2023-24.Sexual health experts believe the decline in uptake, and the fact that two-thirds of women who use it stop doing so within two years, is a major reason why the number ofabortions in England and Wales has risen sharplyin recent years and hit an all-time high of 251,377 in 2022 – 17% up on the previous year.NHS bosses are worried about the role of influencers on TikTok and YouTube, who have postedcontent that warns women against using the pilland advocate using “natural” birth control instead.For example, one has claimed that the pill “robs us of our health” because of “common” side-effects including an alleged heightened risk of thyroid problems, blood clots and strokes.Dr Rebecca Webster and Lorna Reid, the co-authors of the study, found that the “nocebo effect” involved four psychological factors that were associated with women having a negative experience of the pill. They were:An expectation at the outset that the pill will be harmful.Low confidence in how medicines are developed.A belief that medicines are overused and harmful.A belief that they are sensitive to medicines.“The evidence suggests that many of the commonly reported side-effects of hormonal contraception are a result of psychological, or nocebo, response to the act of taking oral contraceptives,” Webster said.“Despite these being psychological in origin, it’s important to understand that these are very real experiences for women, often affecting their decision to continue taking the pill.”The authors wrote: “Medicine-related beliefs were associated with increased experience of oral contraceptive side-effects, demonstrating the potential role that nocebo-related factors may have in impacting oral contraceptive side-effect experience.”Their findings were based on a study of 275 women aged 18-45 who had used the pill over the previous 18 months. Almost all – 266 (97%) – experienced at least one side-effect while doing so.They found that women’s expectations that they would have a negative experience of the pill from the outset often proved self-fulfilling. But negative messaging about the pill in the media and a belief that medicines are harmful or over-used raised the risk of them reacting badly to it.“I think since Covid there’s the anti-facts, anti-big pharma rhetoric coming out on social media. I think that’s had an effect”, said Dr Janet Barter, the president of theCollege of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, which represents sexual health specialists.Britain is ‘a terrible place’ to sell medicines, says drug firm executiveRead more“But I think also we know that a lot of young people are suffering with their mental health, with either depression or particularly anxiety. So they’re likely to be very wary of anything that they believe might make that worse.”Brook, a large sexual health services provider, also blamed online misinformation for helping to create the “nocebo effect” the researchers identified.“Young people in particular are influenced by what they see and hear about contraception. People in our clinics are increasingly expressing concern about hormonal contraception due to things they have heard on social media”, said Laua Domegan, Brook’s head of nursing.“Common myths include that the pill will make you gain weight, will impact your long-term fertility or even affect the kinds of people you are attracted to.”Misinformation about the pill was gaining traction because health professionals did not give women enough information about contraception and also because schools did not include enough about it in sex and relationships classes, she added. More “honest conversations” were needed, she said.However, Webster and Reid argue in their paper, published in Perspectives on Sexual and ReproductiveHealth, that because many women’s bad reactions to the pill are psychological in origin, that “psychological interventions” – such as challenging negative beliefs about medication – could be used to cut side-effects and keep them using the pill.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

My only hope is the European institutions. Giorgi is now Ivanishvili’s personal prisoner. I ask, for someone to help, please”.Bachiashvili fled Georgia earlier this year after falling out with Ivanishvili, the honorary chair of the country’s ruling party, for whom he worked as a “right hand man” for a decade.At the time that he skipped the country for Abu Dhabi, Bachiashvili was on trial for allegedly stealing $42m (£31m) in cryptocurrency from the billionaire politician.Bachiashvili, who vehemently denied the allegations,claimed in an interview with the Guardianfrom his hideaway in the Gulf state that the prosecution was punishment for his outspoken criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.He further claimed that Ivanishvili – who has guided a shift away from the west and towards Russia – may have concluded he was a western spy.Transparency International has described the case against Bachiashvili as being “devoid of both legal and factual grounds”.Soon after the interview, Bachiashvili was seized outside a hotel where he had been meeting his lawyer by men who said they were from Interpol.He was taken to a police station in Abu Dhabi and then on to Dubai. Within 48 hours, the then 39-year-old was deported without a hearing via a Georgian Airways flight with a bag over his head, his lawyers claim.Bachiashvili alleged that one of the five other passengers on the flight to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was the head of Georgia’s security services.He was taunted during the flight for his belief that he could escape lvanishvili’s reach, his lawyers claim.The Georgian government subsequently issued a press statement in which it claimed it had found and arrested Bachiashvili near the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan.Ramazashvili said that she had not been allowed to speak to her son since June but that she had learned from his lawyers that he had been badly beaten in his cell on 11 July, two days before his 40th birthday.A man who did not appear to be a prisoner had repeatedly smashed Bachiashvili’s head against the wall and bit him on the shoulder. During the altercation, he briefly lost consciousness, it is claimed.“They are trying to break him every day,” said Ramazashvili. “They even have new rules. The parliament adopted a law that if someone is found guilty of financial misconduct the authorities can ban him from leaving the country for 16 years.”Bachiashvili is facing 11 years in jail after being convicted of stealing the cryptocurrency but the prosecution is seeking to add further years to his sentence for absconding.Prosecutors are also seeking a further jail term for Bachiashvili’s alleged negligence in overseeing a state investment in a hydro-power station. Ivanishvili has separately launched a civil case against him.Ramazashvili said it had been through treating Ivanishvilli and his family as patients that her son was first introduced and then began working for the businessman who at the time had companies in Russia.She said: “As a person, he was very normal, very kind. I cannot tell anything bad about him, or of members of his family, for that. Because of this, I thought that Giorgi will be very safe … This is my greatest mistake in my life.”Georgia continues to have aspirations to join the EU and it has recently submitted a response from Brussels demands for a series of reforms after claims that the country was sliding into autocracy.Ramazashvili, who is now living in the US state of Alabama, said she had been left bereft and that her only hope was that international institutions, such as the European court of human rights or the UN would intervene.“I have nothing inside,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaCryptocurrenciesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Prices are rising,jobs growthhas stalled, uncertainty is everywhere andstock marketshave soared to record highs. Against this background a scary word last used in the 1970s is being uttered again: stagflation.GDP chartStagflation is the term that describes “stagnant” growth combined with “inflation” of prices. It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumersRead moreThe last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.For now, theUS economyisn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.AfterDonald Trump’stariffswere announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June wererevised downby 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation ratehit2.9%, the highest since January.Inflation chartBrett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.Trump’scrackdown on immigrationhas cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes toprices, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.Investors are banking on hopes theFederal Reservecutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell,outlinedthe “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reportedRead more“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down.Inflationwent down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”Oneanalysisfrom Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.jobs chart“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.The Yale Budget Labestimatedthat Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and hasclaimedthat recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump tariffsInflationEconomicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The 43-year-old grew up as one of five children of a Catholic priest in the American midwest, an eccentric upbringing documented, famously, inPriestdaddy, her hit memoir of 2017, and a wellspring of comic material that just keeps giving. Priests in the wild amuse and comfort her, a reminder of home and the superiority that comes with niche expertise. “I was recently at St Louis airport and saw a priest,” she says, “high church, not Catholic, because of the width of the collar; that’s the thing they never get right in TV shows. And I gave him a look that was a little bit too intimate. A little bit like:I know.” Sometimes, as she’s passing, she’ll whisper, “encyclical”.This is Lockwood: elfin, fast-talking, determinedly idiosyncratic, with the uniform irony of a writer who came up through social media and for whom life online is a primary subject. If Priestdaddy documented her unconventional upbringing in more or less conventional comic style, her novels and poems since then have worked in more fragmentary modes that mimic the disjointed experience of processing information in bite-size non sequiturs. In 2021, Lockwood published her first novel,No One Is Talking About This, in which she wrote of the disorienting grief at the death of her infant niece from a rare genetic disorder. In her new novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, she returns to the theme, eliding that grief with her descent into a Covid-induced mania, a terrifying experience leavened with very good jokes. A danger of Lockwood’s writing is that it traps her in a persona that makes sincerity – any statement not hedged and flattened by sarcasm – almost impossible. But Lockwood, it seems to me, has a bouncy energy closer to anElizabeth Gilbertthan a Lauren Oyler or an Ottessa Moshfegh, say, so that no matter how glib her one-liners, you tend to come away from reading her with a general feeling of warmth.So it is in person, too. Lockwood is speaking with me from her home in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives with her husband, Jason. In 2019, the pair took a vacation to Scotland, accompanied by her mother, providing Lockwood with the opening tour de force of the new novel. Entitled Fairy Pools, this section is a fictionalised travelogue in which the family bicker in the car and enjoy misunderstandings with the Scots, in the form of her mother’s persistent and doomed efforts to order iced tea. There is a long, satisfying run of jokes about how Irn-Bru strikes the American palate (“a pink electrocution of the tongue”). The Lockwood character gets food poisoning. (“Arugula, she thought. I’m going to die alone in a Scottish castle because people have gotten too good for iceberg lettuce.”) They take photos. (“Upon her arrival, instead of taking pictures of the North Sea, she had taken pictures of elk bellowing on the walls and a little guy who appeared to be penetrating his bagpipes.”) And there is a touching vignette based on Lockwood’s sister losing her phone, containing thousands of photos of her late niece, Lena. “You know that the images are backed up,” says Lockwood, now. “But it’s not the original phone. People have these very warm, entangled relationships with these devices as storing memories.”All of which is precursor to the main event of the novel, a section entitled The Changeling in which the Lockwood character gets Covid very early on in the pandemic and descends into a state that strikes her as akin to madness, a wordless fog in which intense, random thoughts take on outsized meaning. For example: “It’s like Joyce Carol Oates is trying to start a feud with me … does everyone have this feeling?” Or: “I was glad God had killed Gene Kelly.” It was this experience, says Lockwood, that sparked the novel, which grew out of The Changeling’s first lines: “It stole people from themselves. You might look the same to others but you have been replaced.”Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything I’ve previously experiencedThe challenge for any writer looking back on 2020 at this relatively short distance is that nobody much wants to revisit it. Lockwood was acutely conscious of this and while there are some people in masks in the book, she strenuously avoids use of the words “Covid” and “lockdown”. She hopes that her period of derangement works both as a literal account of a widely experienced phenomenon, and more generally as the book’s guiding metaphor, a stand-in for any life event that causes one to lose contact with reality. And in fact, in early readings, she says, “what seems to be true of audiences is that they recognised all of what I was talking about – even if they hadn’t been ill. I also found it interesting that people were so ready to talk about it when it was something that was like: Hey, ‘Close the curtains, do not write about this, we do not need to think about this again,’ which is what happened with the original flu pandemic [in 1918].”I have to confess to Lockwood that words like “changeling” and “fairies” in this context make me extremely nervous. “Do tell!”, she says, gamely. It’s the suggestion of whimsy that sets me off, all the way up to Hilary Mantel’s ghost on the stairs or Muriel Spark’s insistence on believing in angels. Like, sure, OK. But really? Lockwood laughs. “I think you would probably believe in angels too if you could write the way Muriel Spark did” – a fair point. But the difficulty for any writer going the changeling-and-fairy route is to stop the story floating away into figurative affectation, even as she tries to evoke literal feelings of unreality.The fact is, says Lockwood, that her sense of being dislocated from herself during Covid was very real. “There are visual, optic aura-type phenomena that I would experience early on, where you would see strange after-images, or a beating in the corner of your eye – things like that. I think people who have those things learn to live with them and make companions out of them and give them names. But this governing phenomenon has no name to [the character]. She doesn’t know what it is. So she’s only experiencing the sensations, the patterns, the colours, the visions. And the true thing, when it feels like madness, is that there’s no name for it.”View image in fullscreenAs I was reading, those passages reminded me of a line of Alice Munro’s in which, wrote Munro, everything became “a spiteful imitation of itself”. “Yes,” says Lockwood, “that’s very resonant. Did someone come into my house in the middle of the night and replace everything with a slightly less genuine version? It felt like my eyesight changed, like I was seeing things in less dimensionality, which leads to suspicion. These secret nursed hatreds: like, if I’m not I, are you, you? What is a person?”These inquiries of Lockwood’s are presented in a high comic style that saves them from too much abstraction. “For three weeks straight,” she writes, “I have nightmares about being asked aboutcancel culture. It is my greatest fear, to be asked aboutcancel culture– or that I will be so terrorized by the possibility that I will immediately begin talking about it anyway, and in doing so present the opportunity to be murdered by public opinion myself.”This riff falls in a section in which the protagonist goes on a virtual book tour and endures a photoshoot, all the while freaking out not just about Covid but about exposure. “What she’s experiencing is success, actually, but she’s terrified,” says Lockwood. “Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything you’ve experienced. In any publicity experience you felt very exposed, but more so because of the extreme cloistered-ness of what everyone was experiencing. Everyone pouring their eyes and their faces into these screens.” One can take this point while also vaguely wishing that novelists might heed the following warning: if you’re tempted to write about going on a book tour, it might be time to venture out beyond publishing to refill the tank.Anyway, Lockwood is obviously writing about herself and the disorienting experience both of the success ofPriestdaddy, which won the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the viral success of her earlier writing; namely, the poemRape Joke, published by the Awl in 2013, that launched her career, and her subsequent years at the coalface on Twitter, making very good jokes and sharing her comic poetry. (Her most famous sext-parody: “I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole.”) She’s off Twitter, now, like everyone else. “For a while I did Bluesky, which I liked a lot, and a lot of the original people from Twitter went there.” But as the platform grew, she says, “it had a problem with disagreement bots; you would post something, it would get traction and waves of not-people would be like, ‘I take issue with this!’ That made things less fun.” When Trump was re-elected, she decided she wasn’t going to spend the next four years immersed in online discourse about it and bailed.In some ways, says Lockwood, it was her first novel,No One Is Talking About This, shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2021, that proved more exposing than the memoir, because she wrote about her niece, Lena. Lockwood holds up her phone to show me a photo of a baby girl with a shock of brown hair, encumbered by medical equipment. Lena, who was born withProteus syndrome, died in 2019 at the age of six months. In the years since, Lockwood has written very evocatively about grief. “I saw it secondhand with my sister, and then experienced it myself – that it doesn’t get better. It doesn’t heal. You think, OK, a year has passed, and now progress is going to happen. There won’t be stops and starts, you won’t fall back. You’ll continue to have dreams of this person. And you don’t. There’s this thing that everyone else in the world expects you to move on; like, hurry up already. And that’s not how it happens.”View image in fullscreenLockwood describes herself as the sort of ‘impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night’.Photograph: Anna OttumIn the case of the death of a baby, she says, there’s even less patience for the grieving parent in some ways; a sense that “she lived for six months and a day, and that’s such a short time upon this Earth there’s a commensurate idea that after six months have passed maybe [things get better].” But that’s not how it goes. Six years after Lena’s death and all that has happened is that “in the mother’s mind, now she’s six years old”.Lockwood’s broader writing about her family has given us one of the great, dysfunctional households in literature, up there with David Sedaris’s rackety crowd. Her father, Greg, a former submariner turned Lutheran minister, converted to Catholicism and had a dispensation from the Vatican to be a priest with a wife and children. The five Lockwood kids grew up in rectory accommodation in Cincinnati, Ohio and St Louis, Missouri with a father who liked guns, electric guitars and Rush Limbaugh, as well as God. While her father is inadvertently hilarious but has “never knowingly said anything funny in his life”, her mother, Karen, says Lockwood, “really really knows the joke is funny. She’s a big wordplay person, which I did not inherit! I actually have almost a pun deafness. Someone will present me with a pun and I’ll just stare at them. You tune out your mother as a teenager – ‘Oh, God, mom’ – and it ended with me being completely unable to produce a good pun of any kind.”Surprisingly, Lockwood says she is the most conventional of the siblings. Despite describing herself as the sort of “impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night”, in the context of the family, “everyone would say I’m the most normal. Writing [everything] down is kind of a normie thing to do. In an age in which we have suffered the desaturation of the personality, where we all sound a little bit more the same and colours are more muted, we’ve got some freaks over here among the Lockwood children.”We have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at who is doing thisThis is particularly true of her father, a Trump supporter whom Lockwood has tried to view generously as the victim of Maga’s mass manipulations. In a London Review of Books diary recently she wrote about visiting her parents, “and seeing a Trump flag hanging in the alcove of the rectory, which is not a thing you’re allowed to do in the rectory!” she exclaims. But, she says, “I also had to look at this as something that has happened to a lot of people his age. I’ve seen so many people disappear down rabbit holes of every variety, believe incredibly strange things, that I think we do have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at the people who are doing this. Who benefits, right? From us being driven from the bosoms of our families because of these nursed hatreds that don’t even make immediate sense?” She says, “I didn’t want it to be true of anyone except this extremely eccentric, idiosyncratic man, right? But what happens when it’s a wave and the wave is overtaking the entire world?”The only recourse for the writer is to expose the fundamental absurdity of these people, a role Lockwood is happy to assume. “I think of the clown as the sacrificial role, the one who’s willing to be a fool and to state the thing that everyone else in the room agrees goes unstated. You take that a little bit on yourself so that other people can cohere around you and have a better time.”On which subject, I have to ask. At the height of her Covid-induced delusions, what exactly was her beef with Gene Kelly? She laughs. “Oh, that he swept through dance in this muscular way and was like: dance teachers are too feminine, and I’m going to bring masculinity into the world of dance!” This is the joy of a Lockwood rant; a wild jag jumping off from a kernel of truth. During her Covid collapse, the real measure of how far she had drifted from common reality wasn’t Gene Kelly or Joyce Carol Oates but another insidious, heretical thought. She whispers it: “Maybe Meryl Streep isn’t as good as people are saying?” My hand flies to my mouth. “Right? What is a human being if we don’t believe that Meryl Streep can accurately convey a character? Like, where even are you?” Her eyes widen with shock and amusement. “Out of the world.”Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury.

Bedford! Bedford,” some roared, punching the air as the horse, jockeyed by Michael Fundi, broke into a gallop on the home stretch, passed the leader, and stormed to victory.Fundi, who had started the day on top of the jockey standings, was crowned the season’s champion after the last race. At 20, he was the youngest in a decade.View image in fullscreenAbove: Michael Fundi with Bedford after winning the 2400m Jockey Club Stakes George Drew Challenge Series.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Kenya’s former president Uhuru Kenyatta presents the champion jockey plate to Fundi. Far right: Fundi speaks with former champion James Muhindi (L) in the weighing room before the 1200m Alico Limuru Cup race.“This is one of those feelings that you can’t put in words,” he beamed in the parade ring after his award presentation.Fundi embodies the growing involvement of black Kenyans in horse racing, changing perceptions of a sport that has been synonymous with the country’s white minority since the British colonial era.“Growing up, that was a sport for other people, not me,” said Muturi Mutuota, who, like many other children in Nairobi in the 80s and 90s, was taken to the racetrack by his parents at weekends.Now, Mutuota, who is in his 40s, is a director at the Jockey Club of Kenya, which operates and regulates the sport. At this year’s Day of Champions, three of the seven trainers were black, as were 10 of the 13 jockeys.View image in fullscreenHorses cross the finish line.Raised in Nairobi by his grandparents, Fundi fell in love with horse racing when his grandfather started taking him to Ngong when he was 13. His grandfather persuaded Steve Njuguna, a former champion jockey and a trainer at the time, to teach Fundi how to race.Fundi briefly worked as a groom before starting racing when he became eligible – at 16 – coming last in his first race and winning in his fifth. The 2024/25 season, his fifth, was his best.The newly diverse scene, he said, has increased competition for jockeys and trainers.Black trainers are making their mark too.Joe Karari, 41, was one of those with horses racing on the Day of Champions.View image in fullscreenAbove: Joe Karari with a horse at his stables at Ngong Racecourse.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: The kit room at Karari’s stables. Far right: A groom washes a horse at Karari’s stables after training.Born and raised near the racetrack in western Nairobi in what he describes as a household of horse lovers, he used to visit the venue with his family to cheer racehorses belonging to his uncles. After completing college, he spent a lot of time in stables, getting a job as a groom and work rider under trainer Oliver Gray.He learned the ropes for five years and became a trainer in 2006, since when he has built his portfolio from six horses from one owner to 26 horses from 70 owners, including syndicates.A perennial runner-up for the champion trainer title, Karari finally won it in the 2024/25 season with five meetings remaining, becoming the first black Kenyan to win it in a decade.Karari is mentoring other black yard workers to become trainers. “This game is here to stay. And it belongs to everyone,” he said after a morning training session a few days before the last meet.View image in fullscreenJames Muhindi, a former champion jockey, checks the race card in the weighing room.The owners of the horses that Karari trained in the 2024/25 season embody the evolving landscape of upper-class Kenyan society. They number among them foreigners, and whiteand black Kenyans. “It’s a mix of all sorts of people here,” he said.K Bakor, a 54-year-old Kenyan businessman who joined the sport as a horse owner in 2022, is also helping diversify it by giving jockey opportunities to young, black stable workers. “We need to get a new generation,” said Bakor, who used to ride donkeys in races in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu, where he was born.Horse racing was introduced in Kenya in the 19th century, with venues opening up in different parts of the country as the sport grew in popularity. But now, Ngong Racecourse, which opened in 1954, is the only racetrack left.During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s in Kenya, the sport attracted thousands of spectators. However, its fortunes dwindled over time to a point a few years ago when, with near-empty stands, it was struggling to survive years of steady decline attributed to dwindling sponsorship and mismanagement.Now the situation is improving with more local participation.View image in fullscreenCrowds in the grandstand before a race.The sport had always been dominated by white people, but in recent years, as increasing numbers have left the country, their places have been taken by black Kenyans who had access to horses, stables and training facilities through working in support roles such as groom work.At the members’ lounge above the grandstand after the last race of the Day of Champions, Mutuotaacknowledged the need for change and for the club “to have an open mind for racing to succeed”.“We have to shed the traditional mentality that we’ve held on to,” said Mutuota, one of two black members of the club’s eight-person executive committee.The jockey club is making attempts to revive horse racing through partnerships.Kabir Dhanji, creative director at Kivuli Creative, an agency that the jockey club partnered with in 2023 to rebuild and grow the sport, said his company is treating horse racing as “a modern sport”. That has entailed marketing, advertising and social media content creation, as well as the introduction of pop-up restaurants and bars on the site, and between-race entertainment offers such as music and acrobatics.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFaces in the crowds at Ngong Racecourse.Dhanji said the agency wants to make horse racing inclusive, family-friendly, accessible and “a sport for Kenyans by Kenyans”.“The sport may have had a problematic past – not intentionally – and this was associated with colonialism, oppression, suppression, repression,” he said. “And Kenyans don’t want to be associated with that. They want to be able to come and express themselves.”The efforts are paying off. At Ngong on the Day of Champions, the grandstand was packed with a multiracial mix of young and older spectators. On the turf next to it, spectators strolled about in sunglasses and colourful clothes. A little further away, parents watched their children bounce on inflatable castles. And elsewhere, punters sat glued to TV screens, monitoring their bets. By the last race, there were 5,000 people in attendance. Many stayed on for an afterparty that went late into the night.“It’s become an event, and this is fantastic news,” said Michael Spencer, a British businessman who, alongside his wife, Sarah, is a benefactor of the jockey club and own a stud farm in central Kenya. “Now I’m not worried about the survival (of the sport). I just want to see it prosper, be more successful.”View image in fullscreenHorses gallop down the final straight in a race.The club will have to work harder, though, to maintain the momentum and retain talent. Professional jockeys earn £23 a ride. For the Day of Champions, there was about £4,000 up for grabs in total prize money for seven races. Some jockeys have in recent years relocated to Europe in search of the better pay they can get by exercising racehorses.Sitting on a bench with his friends at the top section of the grandstand, David Mukuria, a 48-year-old construction worker who has been attending meets for about 15 years, was delighted that Fundi had emerged champion jockey.“We feel happy when many black people are involved in the sport,” he said. “It shows that Africans have risen.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayHorse racingKenyaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year’s biggest Emmy surprisesRead moreDrama seriesNominees:Andor,The Diplomat,The Last of Us,Paradise,The Pitt,Severance,Slow Horses,The White LotusThis is one of the most interesting races for best drama in years, and not just because the absence of the most recent juggernauts – HBO’s Succession and FX’s Shōgun – leaves the field open. Rather, its two frontrunners, Apple TV’s workplace hell Severance and HBO Max’s medical drama The Pitt, distill thecurrent state of the television business. One is the model of 2020s prestige TV – an extremely high-budget ($20m an episode!), cerebral mystery box that paid for top-tier talent and took its sweet time (3 years!) between seasons. The other is old network television finally adapted to a streaming service – fast-paced, single-location, straightforward, making stars rather than hiring them. The Pitt is the feel-good choice here, as an actually enjoyable proof of concept against TV bloat. But it’s likely that Emmy voters will be more impressed by the vague black boxes of Severance’s second season. Still, neither are the best show of the year – that would be Disney+’s Andor, a bafflingly under-discussed comet that somehow slipped through the contraction of the TV business. It is unlikely we will see something like it – politically radical with Disney budget carte blanche – ever again.Will win:SeveranceShould win:AndorBest comedy seriesNominees:Abbott Elementary,The Bear,Hacks,Nobody Wants This,Only Murders in the Building,Shrinking,The Studio,What We Do in the ShadowsAnother interesting race, with beloved veterans (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks) competing with popular new series (The Studio, Nobody Wants This). Though it’s still nominated as a comedy, most of Hollywood has finally dispensed with the pretense that The Bear – nominated for the season that came out in June 2024 – deserves to win as one. To be fair, last year’s winner, Hacks, was only questionably a comedy this season, as well. Netflix’s Nobody Wants This, created by Hollywood insider Erin Foster, could sneak in the low-key popular favorite everyone enjoyed binging. But never, ever underestimate Hollywood’s navel-gazing self-interest. Apple TV’s The Studio, starring Seth Rogen as a bumbling movie executive failing upwards, is Hollywood’s preferred flavor of self-roast, and there’s almost no way it won’t win.Will win:The StudioShould win:HacksBest limited or anthology seriesNominees:Adolescence, Black Mirror,Dying for Sex, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The PenguinOf all the major series awards, this is most predictable; though The Penguin proved that the world of Batman can still be insightful and surprising (if still relentlessly dark), and Michelle Williams gloriously shatters taboos in the lovely Dying for Sex, Netflix’s Adolescence has this on lock. The four-part British series about a 13-year-old boy who murders a female classmate, motivated by online misogyny and toxic masculinity the adults don’t understand, was a genuine watershed cultural moment. It’s now the second-most viewed English-language program in Netflix history, and afixture in secondary school programsacross Europe. A technical achievement – each episode was filmed, impressively, as a continuous take – andthematic lightning rod, Adolescence deserves what it will almost certainly get.Will win:AdolescenceShould win:AdolescenceLead actor in a drama seriesView image in fullscreenNoah Wyle in The PittPhotograph: Warrick Page/APNominees:Sterling K Brown (Paradise), Gary Oldman (Slow Horses),Pedro Pascal(The Last of Us), Adam Scott (Severance), Noah Wyle (The Pitt)It is a crime that Diego Luna is not on this list for his occasionally sublime work anchoring the vast masterpiece that is Andor. Short of that, this is once again a race between Severance and The Pitt, though I wouldn’t discount affection for Gary Oldman as the sour washed-up spy boss in the cult-beloved UK series Slow Horses. Severance may have the edge in the drama category, but Adam Scott is more of a capable ensemble player in its labyrinthine plot than anchoring star. The Pitt, meanwhile, could not work without the flinty empathy and gravitas of Noah Wyle. Add to that the feel-good narrative of the ER veteran returning to a medical drama, and you have yourself a likely win.Will win:Noah WyleShould win:Noah WyleLead actress in a drama seriesNominees:Kathy Bates (Matlock), Sharon Horgan (Bad Sisters), Britt Lower (Severance), Bella Ramsey (The Last of Us), Keri Russell (The Diplomat)Likewise, the lead actress race is all about narrative. At 77, Kathy Bates is the oldest person to be nominated for a lead actress Emmy for Matlock; she put off retirement to star as a late-in-life lawyer motivated by the opioid death of her daughter. I, too, am caught in swell of goodwill for the Oscar-winning actor – star of Misery, Primary Colors, Titanic and many others – and for a network drama making Emmy inroads. Britt Lower may pull some votes for her subtle work in Severance, and Bella Ramsey deserves attention for the heavy burden that was The Last of Us season two, but Bates is the easy favorite.Will win:Kathy BatesShould win:Kathy BatesLead actor in a comedy seriesNominees:Adam Brody (Nobody Wants This), Seth Rogen (The Studio), Jason Segel (Shrinking), Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building), Jeremy Allen White (The Bear)If The Studio hadn’t rocketed into theEmmyswith 23 nominations, tying The Bear’s record for a first-time series, this may have been Martin Short’s year to deliver an excellent first-time Emmys speech for the consistently chuckle-worthy Only Murders in the Building. (Former winner Jeremy Allen White has simply grown wearisome as the overburdened, maximally stressed Chef Carmy in The Bear.) But the Studio is on a coke-fueled awards bender, and though the always charming Adam Brody may be the dark horse for Nobody Wants This, Emmys enthusiasm skews heavily to Rogen, whose inherent stoner-guy appeal makes his idiot-in-charge character bearable.Will win:Seth RogenShould win:Adam BrodyLead actress in a comedy seriesView image in fullscreenJean Smart in HacksPhotograph: APNominees:Uzo Aduba (The Residence), Kristen Bell (Nobody Wants This), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Ayo Edebiri (The Bear), Jean Smart (Hacks)Jean Smart, a six-time Emmy winner, is in the same position as Julia Louis-Dreyfus in her Veep era: as long as she’s on the show, she will win. Smart has won thrice previously for her late career-defining role as the brittle, brassy comedian Deborah Vance. There’s no reason why she shouldn’t continue her streak for Hacks’ fourth season, for her portrait of just how awful it can be – how vengeful, vicious and wounded one can become – when they get everything they wanted.Will win:Jean SmartShould win:Jean SmartLead actor in a limited or anthology seriesNominees:Colin Farrell (The Penguin), Stephen Graham (Adolescence), Jake Gyllenhaal (Presumed Innocent), Brian Tyree Henry (Dope Thief), Cooper Koch (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story)This one is a toss-up, with strong performances across the board, and it’s nice to see the always excellent Brian Tyree Henry get a nod for Dope Thief, one of many Apple TV series that, like Gyllenhaal’s Presumed Innocent, disappear into the streaming ether soon after release. Given the Emmys preference for awarding shows in bulk, there’s a world in which Adolescence sweeps all of the limited series awards in which its nominated; Stephen Graham certainly deserves for the aching portrait of an aloof father faced with the worse-case scenario. But Colin Farrell, who won the Golden Globe and SAG awards earlier this year for his full vanity disappearance in The Penguin, may have the edge here.Will win:Colin FarrellShould win:Stephen GrahamLead actress in a limited or anthology seriesNominees:Cate Blanchett (Disclaimer), Meghann Fahy (Sirens), Rashida Jones (Black Mirror), Cristin Milioti (The Penguin), Michelle Williams (Dying for Sex)Look, Cate Blanchett is, indisputably, one of the best actors of her generation, but the muddled Apple TV show Disclaimer is not a worthy showcase of her talents. In a similar vein, I want awards for Meghann Fahy, who was the deceptively nuancedtrue star of the White Lotus’s second season, but Netflix’s Sirens was outright bad, and her performance in it iffy. Cristin Milioti is delivering career-best work in the Penguin, but voter preference will skew toward the perennially nominated Michelle Williams, whose performance in Dying for Sex is up to her very high standards – spiky, layered, vulnerable and totally convincing.Will win:Michelle WilliamsShould win:Michelle WilliamsScripted variety seriesNominees:Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,Saturday Night LiveI maintain that it is not fair to pit the thoroughly researched, impeccably delivered deep dives of Last Week Tonight against the deliberately loose sketch comedy of Saturday Night Live. I also maintain that Last Week Tonight is a singular television program whose constant drive to be better, to cut through bullshit, to be more empathetic and reasonable, deserves a 10th consecutive Emmy.Will win:Last Week TonightShould win:Last Week TonightTalk seriesView image in fullscreenThe Late Show with Stephen ColbertPhotograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesNominees:The Daily Show,Jimmy Kimmel Live!,The Late Show With Stephen ColbertAs someone who watches every late-night monologue every morning for work, I personally think the Daily Show – Jon Stewart plus a rotating cast of five correspondent-hosts (Jordan Klepper, Desi Lydic, Michael Kosta, Ronny Chieng and Josh Johnson) – is doing the best work at processing the day’s headlines in a way that is both informative and funny, with the appropriate amount of seriousness and cynicism. But this award will almost certainly be the first and only talk series win for the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, after CBS cancelled the flagship program during the middle of an $8bn merger seeking Trump administration approval. This will be one of the speeches to look out for, as I doubt Colbert will pull many punches.Will win:The Late Show with Stephen ColbertShould win:The Daily ShowSupporting actor in a drama seriesNominees:Zach Cherry (Severance), Walton Goggins (The White Lotus), Jason Isaacs (The White Lotus), James Marsden (Paradise), Sam Rockwell (The White Lotus), Tramell Tillman (Severance), John Turturro (Severance)Finally, we have the time-honored Emmy tradition of a White Lotus-off: Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs and much-ballyhooed guest star Sam Rockwell compete for the show’s middling third season, while John Turturro, Zach Cherry and Tramell Tillman represent the stacked Severance cast. Tillman deserves for his unnerving and unforgettable performance as a corporate henchman, but I bet voters prefer Goggins’s especially miserable tourist.Will win:Walton GogginsShould win:Tramell TillmanSupporting actress in a drama seriesNominees:Patricia Arquette (Severance), Carrie Coon (The White Lotus), Katherine LaNasa (The Pitt), Julianne Nicholson (Paradise), Parker Posey (The White Lotus), Natasha Rothwell (The White Lotus), Aimee Lou Wood (The White Lotus)Another, more exciting White Lotus-off! I would’ve liked to see Leslie Bibb nominated as well for her pitch-perfect portrayal of a secret Texas Republican, or for Katherine LaNasa to get more attention for her radiant calm on the Pitt. But this is a heavyweight supporting category between Aimee Lou Wood’s deceptively difficult work, Parker Posey’s North Carolina accent and Carrie Coon’s magnificent portrayal of feral love and jealousy in a friend triangle.Will win:Carrie CoonShould win:Aimee Lou WoodSupporting actor in a comedy seriesNominees:Ike Barinholtz (The Studio), Colman Domingo (The Four Seasons), Harrison Ford (Shrinking), Jeff Hiller (Somebody Somewhere), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Michael Urie (Shrinking), Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live)The recognition of Jeff Hiller’s heartfelt and genuinely funny work on the under-sung Somebody Somewhere is a classic case of the nomination is the win. There’s a lot of love for Ike Barinholtz’s physical comedy as a coke-addled exec in The Studio, and residual affection for Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s beloved Cousin Richie on the Bear, but it’s hard to beat the narrative of national treasure Harrison Ford getting his first Emmy nomination at age 83.Will win:Harrison FordShould win:Jeff HillerSupporting actress in a comedy seriesNominees:Liza Colón-Zayas (The Bear), Hannah Einbinder (Hacks), Kathryn Hahn (The Studio), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Catherine O’Hara (The Studio), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Abbott Elementary), Jessica Williams (Shrinking)The Bear’s Liza Colón-Zayas won last year, likely because her standout episode in the Bear’s third season, Napkins, aired in June and was fresh in Emmy voters minds. Because of Emmy timing, she’s up for that deserving episode now, but the tide has shifted against the Bear. Hannah Einbinder has yet to win for her yin to Jean Smart’s yang on Hacks, and this is her year.Will win:Hannah EinbinderShould win:Liza Colón-ZayasSupporting actor in a limited or anthology seriesView image in fullscreenOwen Cooper in AdolescencePhotograph: Courtesy of NetflixNominees:Javier Bardem (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story), Bill Camp (Presumed Innocent), Owen Cooper (Adolescence), Rob Delaney (Dying For Sex), Peter Sarsgaard (Presumed Innocent), Ashley Walters (Adolescence)This is another tight lock – the power of Adolescence as a“wake-up call”on the influence of online misogyny on young boys does not work if the actor playing the boy doesn’t invoke both revulsion and empathy.

The first two episodes of its third and final seasondrew 25 million viewers, triple the audience of its debut.As it approaches its highly anticipated finale on Wednesday, the show’s main audience is not teenagers but women over 25, and they cannot stop talking about it.“Why Every Millennial Woman You Know Is Suddenly Watching The Summer I Turned Pretty”, rana headline in Vogue. “Why Almost Every Woman You Know Is Obsessed With The Summer I Turned Pretty,” saidanother in Elle.So fervent is the fandom that Amazon evenasked viewers to start “acting normal online”after cast members were targeted with abuse in the buildup to the climax.To understand why the show has enthralled so many women, look no further than its premise. It is centred on Isabel “Belly” Conklin (played by Lola Tung), who spends her summers in the fictional US east coast beach town of Cousins with the Fisher brothers: the brooding and brilliant Conrad (Christopher Briney), and the outgoing and dependable Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno).View image in fullscreenChristopher Briney, as Conrad (left) and Gavin Casalegno as Jeremiah. Fans have split into two entrenched camps: Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah.Photograph: Erika Doss/Prime VideoWhen Belly approaches her 16th birthday, she goes from being overlooked to the centre of the brothers’ romantic attention. Across three seasons, the show leans into the full sweep of adolescent feeling: Belly’s decade-long crush on Conrad and the slow burn of first love, her ricocheting affections between the brothers (sparking a messy love triangle), and the devastating loss of the boys’ mother to cancer. By the end, the core characters have all but graduated from university and are grappling with the sharper edges of adulthood.Fans have split into two entrenched camps: Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah. TikTok is awash with close readings of glances and gestures, whilethemed hen dos,watch partiesandCousins-style dinnersrecreate the show’s atmosphere.Part of the appeal lies in nostalgia. Han’s books were first published between 2009 and 2011, and the adaptation retains a distinctly noughties feel. The dynamics echo the teen dramas and romances millennials grew up with, when aligning with characters became a way of signalling who you were – Twilight’s Team Edward v Team Jacob, The OC’s Team Seth v Team Ryan, One Tree Hill’s Team Lucas v Team Nathan.The show also leans into the booming “sad girl” soundtrack that has become a genre in its own right. It has deployedmore than 20 Taylor Swift songs, alongside Olivia Rodrigo, Phoebe Bridgers and Gracie Abrams. YouTube is full of fan-made compilations set against Swift’s most emotional songs, while some theories even posit that Swift may drop the first single from her upcoming album in the finale.“I think millennials are so enthralled by TSITP because it reminds us of so many great romance stories that we watched growing up,” said Emma Lymar, a 32-year-old business owner and content creator who posts about the show on TikTok.“It isn’t just a teen romance; it’s a reminder of our first crushes, heartbreaks and summers full of hope and possibilities. With only one episode a week, the anticipation and post-episode debriefs in the group chat create a sense of community and nostalgia, reminiscent of how we used to watch our favourite shows in the 90s and 00s.”Kate Mansfield, a dating and relationship coach, agreed. For older viewers, she said, the obsession was not just escapism but “a form of emotional time travel”. “Many women’s own adolescent dating lives were a landscape of confusing signals, unrequited feelings and messy breakups. This show offers a unique opportunity for a ‘dating do-over’ in a controlled, safe environment. It allows them to revisit the intense, all-consuming emotions of first love without the real-world consequences or heartache.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The show leans into the full sweep of adolescent feeling.Photograph: Erika Doss/Prime VideoHayley Quinn, another dating coach, said the show struck a nerve because it recalled a “more untainted era” of romance. “Recalling your formative sexual experiences, and first noticing you’re being noticed, feels a lot more emotionally rewarding than the carousel of dating apps and ‘situationships’ that defines the dating lives of many women. And for those already in relationships, TSITP may also create nostalgia for a time when they felt younger, freer and full of opportunities.”On TikTok,one mother filmed herselfwaking “extra early” to watch the latest episode before her children were up.Another posted: “Me every Wednesday: someone’s actual mum sprinting to watch a bunch of teenagers in some love triangle and crying over it.” A third fanposted: “I’m 30. I pay taxes. And I’m fully invested.”Many point to Han’s undeniable knack for writing swoonworthy guys, who are emotionally articulate, deeply feeling, and usually have tousled hair. Conrad’s combination of curtains, collared shirts and pained silences has been compared to the 90s-era Leo DiCaprio.“Chris Briney’s performance will go down in history alongside Jack Dawson, Noah Calhoun and Mr Darcy,” Lymar said, referring to DiCaprio’s character in Titanic, Ryan Gosling in The Notebook and the Jane Austen character. “It feels like we haven’t had a character like this in so long – someone who yearns for a woman over time, rather than chasing instant gratification.”Mansfield added: “It’s a fantasy of being pursued by men who are not only attractive but also emotionally intelligent, which is an incredibly compelling narrative for women at any age.”Whether the finale brings the curtain down on the TSITP universe remains uncertain. What is not in doubt is the show’s impact: a cross-generational reminder of the power of nostalgia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaWomenAmazon Prime VideofeaturesShareReuse this content"

West End attendance has reportedlygrown by 11%and regional audiences have increased by 4% since 2019 – pretty impressive amid a cost of living crisis and after a pandemic that had us all locked in our houses.The increase in attendance can be chalked up to all sorts of reasons: the post-Covid return of tourists to the UK, schemes offering more reasonably priced tickets, and big films such as Wicked leaving people wondering whatthatDefying Gravity note sounds like live. But I’d throw another contender into the mix: the rise of AI.For some, AI’s arrival has been exciting or, at the very least, handy – who doesn’t want to outsource life’s grunt work, or get an expert photo editor/nutritionist/therapist for nothing? For others, it feels bleak and bewildering. They’ve watched AI replace jobs, supersede human connection and infiltrate almost every area of our lives. Even worse, it’s started doing it on the sly. From AI-generated articles appearing in Wired and Business Insider (I’m real, I promise) to deepfakes of politicians going rogue, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to spot what’s real and what’s not.That feels especially unsettling when it comes to the arts – a space where we let our emotional selves loose. It’s a sickening feeling to discover that the song that made you feel seen wasn’t written by a human with the same struggles as you. And that, no, that wasn’t real despair cracking the voice that moved you to tears.But theatre? Sitting with other humans, watching yet more humans grapple with what it is to be human? There’s no mistaking that. Yes, the whole thing’s make-believe, but at least the artifice is out in the open. And everything else is as real as it gets, which is exactly what many of us are after.There’s the real human connection that comes from a shared experience (no AI companions here); real points of view instead of assertions Frankensteined from every thought on the internet; real mistakes to whip Instagram’s veil of perfection from our eyes; and real variety between performances. And, of course, there are real emotions – on stage and in the audience.That last one is especially important. In his seminal text, Poetics, Aristotle argued that feeling negative emotions while watching a tragedy not only lets us purge those emotions, but also equips us to deal with them better in our real lives. When tricky feelings can be muted with scrolling, and griefsidestepped through AI-resurrected loved ones, perhaps there’s part of us that knows that what we really need is a good old cry in a darkened room. Plus, live theatre is one of the few art forms where digital distraction just isn’t an option.Theatre doesn’t just challenge us to feel. While AI takes the cerebral heavy lifting out of life – knowing everything so we can retain next to nothing, and telling us what to buy, eat and wear – theatre promises the opposite. At its best it holds a mirror to our greatest societal challenges and asks us what we think. What we’re going to do. A tempting proposition for anyone valiantly fighting brain rot.View image in fullscreenA scene from An American in Paris by the Royal Ballet and Opera.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut AI detractors taking solace in theatre doesn’t mean that theatre-makers have been ignoring it. AI-focused research projects are happening at Stanford University and the Royal Shakespeare Company; the National Youth Theatre has performed improv using scene prompts from Microsoft Copilot; and, next June, the Royal Ballet and Opera launches RBO/Shift, an annual festival exploring the links between opera and technology. The inaugural theme? You don’t need ChatGPT to answer that one.AI can automate lighting and sound, generate set designs, produce live captioning and audio descriptions, and even write scripts. In theYoung Vic’s 2021 production AI, a group of theatre-makers prompted GPT-3 to write one script over the course of three performances. And, in the same year, the Czech Centre in London and Prague’s Švanda theatre producedAI: When a Robot Writes a Play, a largely “autobiographical” tale.But in true societal mirror-brandishing style, both plays interrogated the technology. In AI, audiences watched GPT-3 describe the character played by one of the actors, Waleed Akhtar, as a terrorist and typecast him as a Muslim.Guardian critic Arifa Akbarfound that the robot’s autobiographical masterpiece largely consisted of it “obsessing about sex, which may not be surprising, given the prevalence of internet pornography”. Maybe theatre, then, isn’t just an escape from the perils of AI, but one of the best places to explore them in real time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In March, bodies including Equity and the Society of London Theatre co-published a manifesto aimed at protecting workers. But the technology’s potential to cut costs and streamline processes could also help the struggling sector (despite my cheery opener, theatres are facing unsustainable financial strain thanks to rising costs and shrinking investment), and many theatre-makers seem confident that AI’s role will never stretch beyond creative partner.And, really, how could it ever hope to? Unless we reach Full Robot Takeover, no AI will ever be able to stage a play – even one that it wrote, designed and composed the music for – without those wonderful things we spoke of earlier: humans.Theatre may just be one of the only art forms to benefit from AI without ever being truly threatened by it.

At home with the family, I made sure we washed all our food and even then I didn’t feel safe eating it. I would bring in the post and then be worried about touching the front door. I’d shower for ages, trying to wash the virus away.I’m a journalist, so before the anxiety set in I was a pretty outgoing and adaptable person. But from the start of lockdown until September 2022, I didn’t go anywhere indoors other than home or the hospital. I didn’t even walk down a street for a year and a half, for fear of passing too close to someone.For a long time, I didn’t want to get better. I felt so scared by the world. It seemed like my old life just wouldn’t happen again, that I’d never feel OK being in a bar, a club, a gig or anything that involved being near lots of people. Music became really important as a way to cope – especially a band calledBastille, who I was late to discover but instantly loved.By spring 2022, I was very slowly starting to get better. I was still washing all my food and not going near people, but I was able to walk down the street again, even if I did hold my breath every time someone walked past. However, my progress had plateaued and I didn’t know what to do.Then I had a vivid dream about going to a live Bastille gig. The excitement and joy of that dream helped me realise how much I wanted music, people and new experiences in my life again. I had to get better.My cultural awakening: an Asian Dub Foundation song gave me the courage to take a stand against racismRead moreI started to pour all my energy into my recovery. I became more optimistic. I looked around for concerts close to me and discovered that Bastille were playing at the Victorious festival, which is just down the road from my home in Southampton. I contacted the PR team and was delighted to be offered review tickets for a nonprofit community website I run. Best of all, I was granted aninterview with Bastille.From that moment on, I worked hard to prepare myself for the gig. I began to get fit again. I went into a shop for the first time in months, started socialising more and going for walks with friends.On the day of the concert, we went through the VIP entrance, which was much quieter, so that really helped. I stood backstage with the PR team, waiting for my turn to interview the band. My heart was racing, not just because I was meeting Bastille, but also because I really didn’t want to use hand sanitiser in front of them, which had become a habit. I had to pretend that the last couple of years hadn’t happened to me and, somehow, I was able to. When I shook their hands, it took the total number of people I’d had any physical contact with in the last two-and-a-half years to about 10.During the concert, we started off on the periphery of the crowd and slowly edged further into the centre. It didn’t feel stressful; actually, it felt really good. I remember dancing and feeling happy, and finding the whole thing unbelievable. “Look what I’ve done,” I thought. “I’m doing this!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It took a while for the anxiety to go completely, but it didn’t control me any more. On top of the work for my website, I got a job at a community centre for lonely and vulnerable people. They were really tolerant of my initial shyness and helped me find my way back into the world again.Bastille is definitely my favourite band. I recently saw them at a packed gig on Oxford Street, and a cramped record shop gig in Southampton. And I always go to Victorious festival now.

What’s the appeal?Ralph JonesSat 13 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShare‘Well, lot number 56 created quite a buzz, ladies and gentlemen … ” I’m sitting in a marquee in Chichester at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, sheltering from the summer heat. The auctioneer tells us that there have already been several telephone bids for this particular lot. Someone on the phone kicks things off with £180,000. The room holds its breath. Behind us are various astonishingly luxurious cars. One, an orange 1992 Mazda RX-7 FD Veilside Fortune Coupe, was used in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All of a sudden the bidding for lot 56 is at £220,000. Now £230,000. Now £240,000 from someone online. Now £250,000. I can hear the distant vrooming of race cars tearing around a track. But lot 56 isn’t a car. It’s a number plate.Until recently, the UK record for a number plate sold at public auction was £518,480, set in 2014 when Ferrari dealer John Collins beat the competition to get his hands on “25 O”. Private deals have been done for millions of pounds. In Dubai, “P7” sold for £12m in 2023, setting a world record. Number plates can dwarf the value of the cars on which they sit. The question is: why?John Harrison, 75, is known as the “modern godfather” of autonumerology – the hobby of being enormously into registration plates. He tells me over the phone: “You’ve got people who are mainly interested in what I’d call the pattern of numbers, the more technical side; people interested in personal numbers; people interested in foreign plates. I do a bit of all three.” As a child, like many number-plate fans, he scribbled down the ones he saw on the road and started looking up some of their details. He tracked the work of the late Noel Woodall, the hobby’s true OG, who wrote 24 – yes, 24 – books about registration plates. (One of them is called Where’s It From? When Was It Issued?) Harrison has limited himself to just the one title: The Number Plate Book.There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich peopleA few days later, I meet Harrison face to face at the annual Registration Numbers Club rally at the Wythall Transport Museum in Worcestershire – the equivalent ofComic-Confor number-plate fans. They convene there to admire one another’s wares and hand out tongue-in-cheek awards, and have done so for almost 50 years.View image in fullscreenA class winner trophyI also meet Neal Bircher, who might be more interested in number plates than anyone else on the face of the Earth. He is my introduction to the world of Facebook groups for plate fans, and I join one called Private Number Plate Enthusiasts, which is like a birdspotting group for number-plate devotees. Bircher’s car boasts “NEA 1”, and over the years he has owned various iterations of his initials, “NAB”. He also owns “149 PCE”, the number plate on the truck at the heart of Steven Spielberg’s first film,Duel. He still yearns for “NB1” or “NA1”, or perhaps “A1”, which enthusiasts tend to consider the great white whale of the plate world. “A1” is perhaps the only plate with itsown Wikipedia page. It is owned by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the younger brother of the Sultan of Brunei, and would sell for multiple millions.Speaking of multiple millions, at the rally I also meet Richard Conway. I know about Conway because I have heard he is selling the “1 HRH” plate on his Bentley for £2.5m. (He doesn’t throw in the Bentley for that price.) It is a valuation that raises eyebrows everywhere I mention it. “Too much,” Harrison says. “If you’re a multimillionaire, two-and-a-half may be peanuts, but to me it sounds, shall we say, somewhat ambitious.”Angela Banh is marketing manager for Regtransfers, which, as the biggest number-plate broker in the country, advertises some plates for millions of pounds. “F1”, which belongs to car entrepreneur Afzal Kahn, was listed on the website until recently and he expects £15m for it. Does she think “1 HRH” is worth £2.5m? “It’s not one that we would value at that kind of figure,” Banh says. “But that doesn’t mean someone’s not going to pay two-and-a-half for it.”View image in fullscreenAngela Banh works for Regtransfers, which advertises some number plates for millions of poundsConway, 50, is an entrepreneur who also owns the Number Plate Company Group Limited. He won’t tell me how much he paid for “1 HRH”, of course, but in 2009 it changed hands at a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) auction for £92,000 plus VAT and fees. He bought it 13 years later, but hadn’t intended on selling it. Like various other enthusiasts, he likens the hobby to collecting expensive paintings. “I might think: ‘What an idiot. They’ve spent £3m on that piece of art.’ But that’s because I don’t understand the market.” He tells me he has already turned down seven-figure offers. What if King Charles tapped him on the shoulder? “I think that’s unlikely,” he smiles. The reverse plate – “HRH 1”, which those in the business consider the “right” way around because the letters come first – was given to Queen Elizabeth II as an engagement present by the original owner. Conway doesn’t seem likely to give his up for free.Back in Chichester, the price of lot 56 is still rising: £300,000, £310,000, £320,000. The number plate in question is “JB 1”, once the property of Rolls-Royce and Bentley dealer John Barclay. Why is the plate so valuable? Because “JB” has a good claim to being the most common set of initials in the country. (To help them come to an accurate valuation, Regtransfers has a database of names and surnames.) “330,” says the auctioneer. “340 … ” One of the bidders in the room is John Doherty, buy-in manager for Regtransfers, sitting with Banh. He has just bid £350,000. There is a new bid every second. It’s like pinball for rich people.In 2019, when the DVLA surveyed drivers with an interest in private number plates, they found that 6% wanted them for their business; 17% considered them an investment; and 69% bought them because of a personal connection. The perception of people who go in for personalised number plates isn’t famously positive. Of course, hardcore hobbyists demur, making the point that being really into number plates doesn’tnecessarilymake you an overcompensating flash prat. “It’s not about ‘Me, me, me – look at me,’” Bircher says. “It’s ‘I find this interesting.’ I say to people, ‘What on earth is showy about the squiggles on the plate on the front of your car?’”One noticeable thing about the enthusiasts is that they tend to be older, white and male. But bucking one of those trends is 23-year-oldKit Joubert, who is making a splash on Instagram with an account devoted to exploring the history of number plates. He presents slick videos in which he discusses notorious plates, always with access to the cars they are on. Joubert thinks that over the last couple of decades the public perception has changed significantly, to the point that a personalised number plate is now simply another part of car customisation. “There’s a shift beginning to happen,” he says, “and I, for better or worse, might be the face of that, at least on social media.” Because there is often an overlap between fast cars and lucrative number plates, the hobby is well suited to visual platforms such as Instagram. Joubert recently organised a meet-up for plate enthusiasts, which he claims was the first to happen without the involvement of the Registration Numbers Club. He wants to make number plates his full-time job in the next year. “It’s changed my life,” he says.View image in fullscreenKit Joubert’s Instagram account delves into the history of number plates. He wants to make it his full-time jobNumber plates were introduced to British roads under the 1903 Motor Car Act and, as Harrison explains in his book, at first they were one or two letters (denoting an area of the country), followed by up to four numbers. Harrison believes the first to have been a Hastings plate, “DY 1”. (The letters correlated to the size of the local authority. London, the largest, had “A”. Once the end of the alphabet was reached, “AA” took effect.) After the numbers were used up, letters were added before the two initials. Then, in the 1950s, the reversed format was phased in: “1234 AB”. In the 60s, letters were added to the end, with the “A” suffix in “AMP 595A” denoting 1963, for example. From the 1980s things got increasingly convoluted – one of the many reasons that people yearn for the beautiful simplicity of those early plates.Another explanation for the popularity of plates today is that the DVLA has cottoned on to how much of a cash cow the hobby is. In 1977 the government was plotting to make the transfer of plates more expensive and difficult. “No one could make a convincing claim that he would suffer genuine hardship if he could no longer afford to transfer his cherished mark or his personalised number plate,”said the MP John Horam. The Registration Numbers Club formed in opposition to this philosophy, and ultimately won the fight. Now, the DVLA would never seek to make the process more difficult: the DVLA’s head of external communications points me to anannual reportthat says in 2024-25 they made more than £274m from personalised number plates. (The organisation charges an £80 fee for every plate sold.)I want to know if ‘OAS 1S’ might go for a silly amount. The DVLA are no fools when it comes to the timing of their releaseThe DVLA held its first auction in 1989. Initially, it simply sold plates that had already been issued. Over time, however, it has become possible to request that a specific plate be created and auctioned. If it is valid and unreleased, it could be yours. Once upon a time, all of the DVLA’s auctions were in-person, but when attendance fell during the pandemic, it moved them all to its website. In June, I register to check one out.I am interested in this specific auction because I want to know if “OAS 1S” might go for a silly amount of money. (The DVLA is no fool when it comes to the timing of its releases.) Also up for grabs is “95 A”, which Bircher tells me is the first three-character plate to be auctioned in five years. As I watch, I can see the prices rise in real time. At the end of the five-day auction, “OAS 1S” is at £56,040; “95 A” has secured £71,010; but the winner is “8 FU”, which has sold for £90,000. Harrison’s insight is that “Fu” is a common surname in China, where the number eight is also considered lucky.View image in fullscreenDavid McFarlane from Leicester with his personalised number plate“FU” brings us to another subject:naughty plates. Banh tells me that until 2024, “FU” was suppressed (because of its “fuck you” connotations). As Harrison says in his book, censorship has been a concern since the very beginning. “DD” was originally considered too problematic to have on a car because the initials stood for “drop dead”. When local authorities were allocated two-letter prefixes, Dorset were disgruntled with “BF” because it was considered to stand for “bloody fool”; “666” used to be deemed too offensive for sensitive eyes. “They go around in circles,” Banh says. “What was considered rude many years ago is no longer rude now.” Currently you can have a “PEN 15” but you can’t have an “AR25 HOL”.At the rally I meet Matthew Edwards, 56, who is selling his “S69 CUM” plate for £15,000. (His wife no longer finds it funny.) For a while he also had “K21 KKK” – until the DVLA decided “KKK” was too offensive to be allowed on the road. He had bought it purely to sell it, but that became all but impossible. “I couldn’t give it away,” he says.View image in fullscreenNicholas Young concedes that it is ‘childish and stupid’ to buy plates that match your initialsMeanwhile, in Chichester, “JB 1” has broken the £400,000 barrier. Everyone but Doherty and a mysterious bidder on the phone has dropped out. The bidding goes up to £410,000, then £420,000, then £430,000. When it creeps up to £500,000, an audible murmur goes around the room. The record is within touching distance.“Is it any different from adorning your car with anything else – to having a special paint job, or having some bolt-on goodie? I don’t know,” says Nicholas Young, 76, as I sit in his Rolls-Royce (number plate “NY 1”). Young, whose fascination lies in the history of number plates, concedes that it is “childish and stupid” to buy plates because they match your initials. He also admits that’s exactly what he’s done.Young has also written his own book – the colossal Car Number Classics (“I was impressed not only by its weight, but certainly more by its contents!” one of the reviewers said) – and he has no interest in treating the plates as a way to get rich. “If I say I christened my son after a number plate, that really does sound sad,” he says, “but his name is the same as mine. So they’ll go to him.”View image in fullscreenIn Chichester, the anonymous bidder on the phone is head-to-head with Doherty. They’re at £500,000. “510,” the auctioneer says. He looks at Doherty, who nods. “520,” he says. With that, it has broken the UK record. Joubert, who is standing feet away from me, is well aware of this. “530,” the auctioneer says, taking a bid from the phone. There is a silence. “530,” he repeats, looking at Doherty. He shakes his head. As the auctioneer raises his hammer, fireworks crash somewhere above our heads. “530,000,” he says, banging his hammer. The room breaks out into applause. It is an astonishing turn of events. With the addition of fees and VAT, “JB 1” has sold for £608,600. Is it simply three squiggles on a sheet of metal? Or is it a priceless piece of history? As Edwards says: “You either get it or you don’t.”Who is the mysterious new owner of “JB 1”? Weeks later, I hear back from the auctioneer who had the bidder on the other end of the phone. I wanted to know if they might be willing to speak to me. “I spoke to the buyer,” he says. Yes? “And I can confirm they would like to remain anonymous.” Damn. “However, they are fine to say that they have the initials JB.” Justin Bieber? Joe Biden? Jeff Bezos? Jack Black? James Blunt? Juliette Binoche, perhaps? I have chosen to believe it was Jim Broadbent. But we may never know.Explore more on these topicsHobbiesMotoringAutomotive industryDVLAHeritagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I like a gherkin that puckers the mouth with a sour smack to the gustatory cortex. It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed?This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or asa brine for pork chops. Pickle juice is packed with flavour and perfect for cooking, so please don’t just pour it down the drain.The best supermarket gherkinsBestoverall:Baxters whole gherkinsView image in fullscreen£1.98 for 600g at Asda (33p/100g)£2.50 for 600g at Morrisons (42p/100g)★★★★☆Small and olive green. The jar is packed with dill and mustard seeds, and pieces of pepper. Very sweet at first, then the sourness cuts through, followed by complex mustard and ginger notes, and a fragrant dill finish. An impressively clean ingredients list and a very low salt content (0.86%). And the crunch? Spot on.

Yellowy-green, with a long flavour profile that moves from dill and onion to sourness, salt and, finally, mustard and black pepper. The crunch is perfect, too.

The flavour is dominated by salt, which overwhelms any nuance aside from lingering dill and onion notes. The crunch is decent, though. Mrs Elswood is a heritage brand,founded in 1947, that shows more consideration for sustainability than some. Uses additives, though, which detracts from the overall appeal.Sainsbury’s pickled gherkinsView image in fullscreen£1.35 for 340g at Sainsbury’s (40p/100g)★☆☆☆☆A cocktail-sized, mossy-hued green gherkin. Has a soupy and quite sweet preserved aroma, with strong capsicum and onion notes. Unfortunately, the spirit vinegar hits harshly at the back of the throat. The crunch is very good, though. These contain sulphites, which are unnecessary additives of potential concern, especially when simpler recipes are tastier.Dawtona pickled gherkinsView image in fullscreen£1.94 for 900g at Asda (22p/100g)£2.90 for 900g at Tesco (32p/100g)☆☆☆☆☆A decent-sized snozzcumber (as Roald Dahl’s BFG might say), ranging in colour from dark army-green to iridescent yellow chartreuse, but, sadly, I think I had a spoiled jar. There’s a slight saltiness, but it’s overshadowed by a stale flavour that’s hard to ignore, plus the texture is softer and moister than you’d expect. As a result, these are disqualified – sorry.Explore more on these topicsPickling, fermenting and preservingThe FilterFoodVegetablesSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I probably shouldn’t have messed with it, but I did, because I’m a tinkerer. I wanted a lot of spring onions, you see, because, together, cooked green onions and spinach are a bittersweet fantastic dream, especially when they’re tempered with some creamy ricotta. But then, to stop it from getting too sleepy, I escalated the fresh herbs, kept the sharp feta (I’m not a monster) and finished it with a fresh lemon and pine nut salsa. Same same, but actually quite a bit different.Spinach and feta galette with lemon and pine nut salsaPrep15 minCook45 minServes450g pine nutsExtra-virgin olive oil200g spring onions(about 2 bunches), greens and whites sliced and rinsed4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely mincedFine sea salt1kg frozen spinach, thawed25g fresh dill, leaves and tender stalks, choppedA grating of fresh nutmeg2 tsp dried mint1 lemon, zest finely grated200g feta, crumbled150g ricotta7 sheets filo pastry(270g)1 tsp nigella seeds60g parsley, leaves picked and very finely choppedPut the pine nuts in a large frying pan, put over a medium heat and toast for about five minutes, tossing every minute or so, until golden all over. Tip the pine nuts into a bowl.Heat four tablespoons of oil in the same frying pan and, when hot, add all the spring onions, the minced garlic and a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring, for five minutes, until the onions have wilted and turned emerald green.Add the thawed spinach, cook for 10 minutes, until all the water has evaporated, then add the dill and cook for a further two minutes. Add the nutmeg, dried mint, lemon zest, feta and ricotta, cook for two minutes more, then take off the heat.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lay a large sheet of baking paper (about 60cm across) on a worktop. Lay one sheet of pastry on the paper and brush all over with oil. Lay a second sheet of pastry on top angled at 1pm, oil that, too, then repeat at 3pm, 5pm, 7pm and all the way around until you’ve used all seven sheets of pastry.Spoon the spinach and cheese mixture into the centre of the top sheet of pastry, and spread out so it’s 20-22cm across. Pull up the sides of the pastry into the middle, then scrunch the edges back to leave most of the spinach mix exposed. Oil any visible pastry again, then sprinkle over the nigella seeds and pop in the oven for 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden. Remove and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the salsa. Pare off and discard all the pith from the zested lemon. Cut the flesh first into quarters and then into thin slices, add to the pine nut bowl, then stir in the chopped parsley, four tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt.When the galette has rested, spoon the salsa over the top and serve.Explore more on these topicsPieMeera Sodha recipesGreek food and drinkVegetablesFoodPastryCheeseBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

A larger deposit will typically secure a better rate. At 95% Marsden Building Society offers a five-year fixed rate at 4.69% with an arrangement fee of £998, or 4.79% with no fee.First Step borrowers can apply for a mortgage between £96,000 and £350,000, and must put down at least £5,000, or 2% of the property’s price, whichever is higher. On purchases above £250,000 that means a deposit of more than £5,000. Borrowers will need to declare the source of the deposit when they apply.Newcastle said the deal was part of a move across the market to make it easier for first-time buyers to access bigger loans to get their foot on to the property ladder, and just one of its deals for would-be homeowners.Ben Smith, the building society’s head of commercial and product development, said: “We’re committed to helping first-time buyers whatever their background, and our mortgages support a range of people and their circumstances, including those with gifted deposits.“First Step has been designed for homebuyers in particular who have worked hard to save a deposit by themselves, and are ready to get on the property ladder.”David Hollingworth from the brokers L&CMortgagessaid the loan would help buyers who feared prices would continue to climb quicker than they could save.“It’s a great option for those that can show they’re able to afford the mortgage but are struggling with the demands of saving enough for a deposit while meeting steep rent and other costs of living,” Hollingworth said.“If parents want to help out then they may still be able to assist by covering some of the ancillary costs that buyers face, such as survey and legal fees.”Many low-deposit mortgages require a guarantor or a relative to lock away money in a linked savings account, althoughSkipton Building Society offers a dealin which buyers can access a 100% loan if they have proof they have a good track record of paying rent.“Not everyone can be reliant on the bank of mum and dad to get a foot on to the property ladder. This is why it’s so fundamental for lenders to support buyers with small deposits, to keep the market moving,” said Rachel Springall from Moneyfacts.Springall added a note of caution for buyers thinking of taking on mortgages that make up a big part of their purchase price.“Those borrowing at the higher ends of the loan-to-value spectrum will have little equity in their homes as a result, and disaster could strike if house prices were to plummet,” she said. “Seeking advice before entering any arrangement is vital.”‘Shock’ in store for 350,000 UK households on low-interest fixed-rate mortgagesRead moreExplore more on these topicsMortgagesFirst-time buyersMortgage ratesBanks and building societiesPropertynewsShareReuse this content"

The spotlight arrives with great timing for an 85-year-old on a hot streak. His brand is in better health than it has been for decades, with shares up 35% in 2025 and annual sales figures showing an 8% growth to $7.1bn (£1.25bn).On the first night of New York fashion week, Lauren hosted the curtain-raiser for a month of catwalks with a show in his Madison Avenue design studio. Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King chatted to Lauren’s family; Usher smiled broadly behind sunglasses, lounging on a plushly cushioned front row. Champagne was served on silver trays under twinkling chandeliers. In the fractious climate, with the US reeling from theshooting of the far-right activist Charlie Kirk, Ralph Lauren’s affable, charming vision of the American dream has never looked more seductive.View image in fullscreenSwanky beach house vibes.Photograph: ShutterstockButton-down shirts in parachute silk were worn open over swimwear, their sleeves rolled up. There was a crisp sundress in a cheerful tomato red, and a cricket sweater with slouchy trousers. Long dresses with delicate spaghetti straps dipped low at the back, worn with flat sandals and seashell jewellery. Imagine the wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama set in an impossibly swanky east coast beach house, and you get the picture.View image in fullscreenSoft tailoring on the runway.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockRalph Lauren’s business model is selling “a romantic story of how people want to live”, as David Lauren, the designer’s son and brand strategy lead, puts it. More than just a fashion designer, Ralph Lauren – like Walt Disney – is a visual merchandiser for the American dream itself.The brand’s revival is as much about price points as about fantasy and storytelling. The sundress in which Taylor Swift recently announced her engagement had a $318 (£235) price tag. ‘“Greedflation” – the rampant price hikes with which the luxury industry milked the post-pandemic appetite for shopping – has backfired on European designer brands, which have placed themselves beyond what consumers are prepared to pay. The affordability of Ralph Lauren’s Polo handbags, and the evergreen appeal of cable-knit sweaters stamped with the horse-and-rider logo, is paying dividends.View image in fullscreenThis collection is like a wardrobe of a glossy Netflix lifestyle drama.Photograph: Angelina Katsanis/ReutersHaving outfitted Wimbledon and the US Open for decades, the brand has also received a boon as tennis has soared in popularity and profile, becoming an increasingly prominent part of international sport culture worldwide.At the end of the show, Ralph Lauren, who is still closely involved with his collections and works in the office several days a week, took a bow with his wife, Ricky. Applauding from the front row was Anna Wintour who, despite stepping aside from the editorship of American Vogue, has remained very much front and centre of Vogue’s presence at thisNew York fashion week, sitting alongside the newly appointed head of editorial content, Chloe Malle.Applause for KorsView image in fullscreenMichael Kors waves to the crowd.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APA similarly breezy, long-and-loose summer wardrobe showed up at the Michael Kors show, where the designer said he “wanted to bring a bit of Marrakech to Manhattan” with poet-style tunics, fluid trousers gathered at the ankle and sarongs.“No one knows how to dress any more, because cities that used to be cold are now hot,” he said in a preview. “We can learn a lot about how to dress now from people who live in hot climates.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We paddle into sea caves as stunning as cathedralsThe huge Pizzomunno rock, in the Puglian town of Vieste, feels warm from the September sun as I gaze southwards, watching Castello beach shrug off the weight of high summer. There are a few people in the water or lying on the sand, but the sunbeds and umbrellas have started disappearing, and this two-mile stretch of pale sand is getting back to its unspoilt self.The 25-metre Pizzomunno sea stack was once, according to legend, a handsome fisherman of the same name, who would meet his sweetheart Cristalda on this spot. Unfortunately, the local mermaids fancied the pants off him too, and in their jealousy dragged Cristalda to a watery death, leaving Pizzomunno petrified by grief.The ill-fated pair are said to come alive again once every 100 years on 15 August, but if they do so any summer soon, they’ll struggle to find a quiet spot for their tryst. For two or three weeks every August, Vieste – with its old town on a high promontory, its narrow streets and archways, and its newly restored romanesque cathedral – is a magnet for (mainly Italian) holidaymakers. The town receives 80% of its annual two million visits in the space of less than a month. By the time of theSettimana dell’Olioolive oil festival in late August, Vieste is noticeably quieter, and in September peace returns.View image in fullscreenMattinatella beach, near Vieste.Photograph: Cherry Blossom/AlamyWe’re staying 25 miles to the south in the small town of Mattinata. Here, about a mile from the coast, it’s “tranquil even in August”, a local tells us.Agriturismo Giorgio(doubles from €59 B&B in low season – 16 September to 31 October) stands on its western edge, walking distance from great restaurants such asLocanda del Maniscalco.Temperatures climb to 28C most days, and the summer’s heat has left the sea deliciously warm. On our first full day, we drive 10 minutes to Mattinatella beach, where we’ve rented a transparent canoe from local operatorDove Andiamo Sul Gargano(full day €60). We are aiming forBaia delle Zagare(Citrus Blossom Bay), a couple of miles up the coast, but it takes us half the day to get there because we stop to paddle into sea caves as stunning as cathedrals, and picnic on an otherwise inaccessible little beach. The bay itself is famous for its sea stacks, one called “the scissors” for its curious shape, eroded by sea and wind.The other advantage of early autumn in the Gargano is that it is, paradoxically, a livelier period. The hard graft of summer done, locals prepare to partyThis south side of the peninsula is sheltered from any northerly winds, so perfect in autumn. Another day, we swim out from Baia di San Felice to admire the natural sea arch that guards it, and particularly enjoy a trip onhired ebikes(half-day €30) to view these white beaches from the clifftopSentiero dell’Amore.The other advantage of early autumn in the Gargano is that it is, paradoxically, a livelier period. The hard graft of summer done, locals prepare to party. Every SeptemberVieste in Loveexpands on the tale of Pizzomunno and Cristalda, hosting free shows, concerts and children’s events across the historic centre. Mattinata celebrates its patron saint in mid-September with so many parades, concerts, magic shows and fireworks we catch just a fraction of what’s on. And that’s before it goes really mad with its Octoberolive harvest festival.September is also busy in Unesco-listed Monte Sant’Angelo, whose Archangel Michael festival on 29 September attracts pilgrims from all over the world. The fun bit is a torchlit reenactment the Sunday before, with splendidly costumed angels, archers, bishops and even God himself giving their all in the main square.Later in the autumn there’sleaf-peeping in the Foresta Umbraa few miles inland. Fast forward to spring in the Gargano and you’ll be rewarded with one of Europe’s highest concentrations ofwild orchids, plus more festivals – one celebrating rosé wine in Vieste, for example. Which makes it all the more strange that everyone crowds here in August.Liz BoulterAlentejo, PortugalView image in fullscreenPraia de Odeceixe.Photograph: Pawel Niemczyk/AlamyIt’s hard to beat as a base for catching late-summer sun – you may have a pristine beach to yourselfThe “queen offado”, Amália Rodrigues, said Portugal’s melancholic, passionate ballads “came from the sea, the vast sea in front of us”. No surprise, then, in the 1960s, that Amália chose an Alentejo clifftop overlooking the Atlantic to build a creative retreat.Small waves of artists and sun-seekers arrived in the 70s and 80s, and this south-western coastline continues to attract those looking for a different life; incomers who live side-by-side with locals whose families have been there for centuries, united by the rhythm of the land and the sea. The peaceful, slow ways of rural Portuguese life contrast with the raw natural landscape, and the best part is that it is still blissfully undeveloped.Take a look at a map and you’ll notice an absence of cities or large towns in this corner of Portugal. The main motorway south from Lisbon heads deep inland, before continuing down to Faro. Even the national roads steer away from the coast. There’s no fast way to reach Alentejo, and when you do, you’ll find time slows down.Odeceixe (pronounced “oh-deh-shay-sh”) is hard to beat as a base for soaking up late-summer sun. On its beach, black cliffs rise on both sides, the Algarve to the south, the Alentejo to the north. The large, golden beach is a tale of two halves, with the clear, shallow waters of the river ideal for paddleboarding and kayaking, and the sea offering consistently good waves for all surfing levels.Water Element offerssurf classes year round, plus hire of surfboards, bodyboards, canoes, kayaks, as well as umbrellas, sunloungers and a massage area.There’s no fast way to reach Alentejo, and when you do, you’ll find time slows downThose in the know return toBar da Praia, year after year, in a hidden-away spot (tip: follow the blue umbrellas) perched above the beach at Odeceixe with fabulous views. For 12 years it has been delivering a menu of classics such asAmêijoas á bulhão Pato(clams in garlic, coriander, white wine and lemon).The village of Odeceixe is two miles from the beach and has a life of its own. Social life moves to the village square after the sun goes down and its bakeries and cafes open early. The village is made up of small houses painted white with coloured borders around the windows and doors. There’s a working Iberian windmill, painted in white and Alentejo blue, with views of the River Seixe snaking through a flat valley to the Atlantic.With the intense summer heat subsiding, the temperature is ideal for daily walks on theRota Vicentina– a network of trails taking in nature and historical villages, with inland and coastal routes. Once used only by locals to access secluded beaches and fishing spots, the single-track Fisherman’s Trail is now a well-marked route. There are also24 circular routescovering more than 155 miles, and some shorter out-and-back stretches ideal for combining with an afternoon on the beach. In late summer, it’s not unusual to have a pristine beach to yourself.View image in fullscreenA section of the Rota Vicentina hiking trail passes through Odeceixe.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyFor those looking to pick up the pace,Adventure Ridingoffers horseback tours for all levels along clifftops and through the countryside (as of 2025, beach rides are no longer permitted in the nature park), including at sunset and in the moonlight.Tucked away are special places celebrating a simpler way of life, far from big cities and mass tourism. The pair behindCasa Ateliê, Samer Haidar and Lisa Müller, offer pottery workshops and Lebanese food at their bed and breakfast in a village setting to the north of Odeceixe – well positioned for exploring Zambujeira do Mar, Vila Nova de Milfontes and Almograve.Italian Filippo Pozzi arrived in the area with classical winemaking experience in south-west France and California’s Napa Valley. He set out to restore neglected parcels of land and is producing “unconventional” single vineyard wines. On top of a small hill, surrounded by olive trees, vineyards and cork oaks,Atlas Land quinta(from €100 a night, room-only) is bathed in sunlight from dawn to dusk. There are two double rooms and wine-tasting sessions can be arranged. The nearest town is Aljezur, with ruins of a 10th-century castle and a Moorish village.Inland from Odeceixe isMonte West Coast(from €104 B&B, two-night minimum), a collection of restored rustic buildings on a farm, with a saltwater pool, kitchen gardens, orchards, and tables and chairs dotted about the wild grass meadows.Emma BalchCorsicaView image in fullscreenBonifacio is perched on limestone cliffs.Photograph: Pascal Poggi/Getty ImagesI wander deeper into the maze of alleyways where restaurants spill out and diners clink glassesIt’s not just summer that clings on in southern Corsica, so too does the precipitous citadel that hangs on the cliff edge in Bonifacio. It’s a wonder that the walls haven’t tumbled into the Mediterranean in the intervening millennium, but this jumble of terracotta-roofed homes and shops stands proud atop 70-metre-tall white limestone cliffs, on a narrow promontory, to create one of Corsica’s most impressive sights.It’s a hot Saturday afternoon when I arrive and the narrow, shaded streets within the old town offer a welcome relief. After checking into theHotel Le Royal(doubles from €76 room-only), a bright, modern hotel, I wander deeper into the maze of alleys where restaurant terraces spill out on to the street and cheerful diners clink glasses. It isn’t long before I’ve reached what feels like the summit, but to get a better view I need to climb up the steps on the citadel walls.From the corner of Rue des Bocche, the view is spectacular: the inner harbour below and a jagged coast that zigzags into the distance, framed by a hazy backdrop of mountains. A few steps away on Rue du Palais, an enticing bar,L’Assaghju,is serving aperitifs, including the owner’s homemade chestnut liqueur, a sweet and moreish tipple I sip from a stool in the cool stone arches of the bar. She tells me about other liqueurs she’s created from the island’s many signature products, such as clementines. “Have you tried the local wine?” she asks, pouring me a glass of the muscat pétillant, a delicately sweet and gentle sparkling white.View image in fullscreenBonifacio’s port and citadel.Photograph: Nito/AlamyI make my way back to the hotel’s restaurant feeling a little tipsy, gazing at the towering palm trees in the Place Carrega and peering into the ladder-like stairways of the imposing buildings, so steep I wonder how they get any furniture into the apartments.The next morning, I venture west to the Plage de la Tonnara, 20 minutes’ drive along the coast, to enjoy a different side of Corsica. The surrounding landscape is rocky and arid, but the beach is a crescent of blond sand that descends into a shallow bay of crystalline water warm enough for swimming in October. I spend an hour paddling, reading and people-watching.Lunch is booked a further 50 minutes around the coast and inland towards the perched town of Sartène, where the landscape changes again. Steep mountains lie ahead and I stop atLa Bergerie d’Acciola, a laid-back bar-restaurant serving barbecued dishes under a rustic, timber-framed roof, with a terrace offering views of the surrounding peaks. I order a platter of cheese and charcuterie, including aprisuttuham, with fat that melts in the mouth like butter; the goat and sheep cheeses are salty and moreish. I banish the thought that my journey will end soon and savour the flavours of the island, clinging on to the joy of its many faces for as long as possible.Carolyn BoydEssaouira,MoroccoView image in fullscreenA bedroom in the Salut Maroc hotel in EssaouiraCamel rides, kayaking, surfing and horse riding are all on offer on the long, sandy beachVisitors beware. I went to Essaouira for a day trip and ended up living there for a year. I had driven down from Marrakech (it’s just three hours by road), where the temperature was in the high 30s. I swept round the final roundabout and on to the corniche. The sea was a deep, glittering blue framed by imposing maritime pines, and the sand was sprinkled with coloured umbrellas. A cool breeze wafted in through the window – such a welcome change from the furnace of Marrakech. At that moment, I decided to move and set up home there.In the summer, the city is rammed with Moroccans on their holidays, but by late September and October it’s much quieter with temperatures down to about 24C.I like to stroll along market street around 5pm, when all the locals are out shopping for dinner, tasting fat dates and spicy olivesEssaouira has two distinct parts: the medina, enclosed within high walls, and the new town, which has grown up around it. The medina is small and much more navigable than the Marrakech equivalent, but still with that heady African/Arab mix. Two main streets lead off Place Moulay Hassan, the main square by the port. Avenue Sidi Ben Mohamed Abdellah is known as “tourist street” and parallel is Avenue de L’Istiqlal, “market street”. I like to stroll along market street around 5pm, when all the Souiris (locals) are out shopping for dinner, and fat dates, spicy olives and fresh fruit from surrounding farms are out waiting to be tasted.To be in the centre of the action, base yourself in the medina atDar Adul(doubles £59 B&B), a typical riad; orSalut Maroc(doubles from €200), a riot of pattern and colour with rooftop bar and restaurant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Halfway up tourist street, traditional and fusion music plays from a shop whose knowledgable owner can introduce you to the rhythms ofgnaoua(alsognawa), the music brought to Morocco from west Africa. Dozens of small galleries sell work by local artists, and on Sundays many artists open their studios to visitors in thejoutiyaflea market in the new town.Essaouira is also a vibrant fishing hub, and at lunchtime stalls at the port sell a variety of seafood (the sardines are often freshest and cheapest – head to the less touristy stalls farthest away), which you then take to be cooked over charcoal for a few dirhams. Eat your catch with homemade bread and sweet tea, watching the seagulls and cats fight for the scraps.But it’s the long, sandy beach that attracts most visitors. There’s plenty for the active: kite surfing, surfing, kayaking, quad biking, camel rides and horse riding are all on offer. It is also a great beach for kids and swimming, as the waves and tides are not strong.View image in fullscreenSurfers on the beach at Sidi Kaouki, along the coast from Essaouira.Photograph: RnDmS/AlamyMy favourite thing to do is to walk along the beach to the town of Sidi Kaouki. It’s about 16 miles (25km) and will take most of the day (or jump in a taxi) but you’ll see horses galloping past and pass locals fishing for octopus perching patiently over the rock pools. Sidi Kaouki is becoming known for wellness as well as surfing. Little boutique hotels such asKasbah d’Eau(doubles from €340 B&B for two nights), which has just opened, offer lots of sea- and land-based activities.Every day in Essaouira has to be a sundowner day. You are in Morocco’s most westerly city and the sunsets are glorious. Sipping a chilled glass of wine at one of the beach restaurants, likeOcean Vagabond, while watching the camelteers take their animals home is the perfect prelude to dinner.There are some great small restaurants in the medina and new town, offering tagine, couscous and grilled sardines, but I love the beef wellington atUmiaand the grilled fish of the day atLa Coupole. If you’re up for some fun, try the fire show and magicians atCaravane Cafe.Essaouira has lots to offer but it doesn’t foist itself on you. The people are relaxed, the weather is mild and you get to enjoy Morocco at a slower pace. Writing this has made me realise that it is high time for another visit.Alice MorrisonAxarquía, SpainView image in fullscreenThe view from the village of Comares.Photograph: Barry Mason/AlamyThis is the highest of Andalucía’s pueblos blancos, in a land of caves, valleys and ancient trailsThere’s something delightful – and practical – about planning your next few days’ activities just by looking out from the terrace of your hotel. At theHotel Rural Olivia Verde(doubles from €90 room-only) in the village of Comares, you can do just that. Comares, an hour’s drive north-east of Málaga, is the highest of thepueblos blancos, the white villages that dot the Andalucian landscape. It’s in the heart of the Axarquía, a land of valleys, caves, limestone outcrops, white villages and ancient – Roman, Arabic and possibly Phoenician – trails that crisscross them.Thanks to the village’s many vantage points, including the terrace, you get a 360-degree view of your forthcoming activities.The hotel (also home to the best restaurant around) is a converted olive mill. From its terrace, there’s a steep 100-metre drop to a dusty road below and to the south is the glittering Mediterranean. But if you’ve made it up the winding road from the plain to Comares, then you’re likely here for the mountains, the walks and the adventure.Let your gaze drop down and turn inland along that dusty road. Round the bend, you will join up with one of the well-signposted paths that hem the village. Close to the aquifer that has sustained the village for centuries, you’ll probably see climbers scaling a rock face. The village also has its own zip wire.Now walkers can really get excited. Heading inland, the route called La Teja passes another huge outcrop. In about an hour you will reach the remains of an Arab settlement at Masmullar.Drop into a cafe in the hamlet of Los Ventorros, or head back to Comares up the track for rest and refreshments at the excellentMirador de la Axarquíarestaurant on the village outskirts. That should be enough for day one.View image in fullscreenHiking on La Maroma mountain.Photograph: David Sonder/AlamyLots of people know that the Costa del Sol is barricaded by mountains, but most tourists don’t venture further than crowded places like Ronda. That is a huge shame because the Axarquía needs visitors – no overtourism here – and because a lot of people who appreciate clean air and empty, epic country are missing out.If you have a bike, head into thecampo(countryside) and explore the villages of Cutar and Benarmagosa. If your tyres can take it, bump along the riverbed of the Riogordo towards Colmenar. It will almost certainly be dry, but if the rains do come, beware – the river and the villages that lie along its banks is flash-flood territory.Most villages have a bustle about them once the summer heat passes: gone is the ghost-town atmosphere of the remote pueblos blancosThe majestic peak of La Maroma, the local mountain, is walkable, but at over 2,000m, it’s best to get a guide. The quiet village of Canillas de Aceituno is a good base camp.To venture beyond, you will probably need a car. The main village on La Maroma’s southern flank is Cómpeta, which is good fun and bustling. I’ve always enjoyed a visit to the long-establishedEl Pilónrestaurant.But most villages have a bustle about them once the summer heat has passed: gone is the ghost-town atmosphere of the remotepueblos blancos, where everyone stays indoors with the blinds down in the hot weather.While many of the annual villageferias(fairs) take place in summer, Nerja’s is mid-October, Comares has its Night of the Candles in early September, while Cutar offers the Moorish-themed Fiesta del Monfi in October.And the season is lengthening. In late November I was still in my shorts. November used to be when the rains came.Mark JonesKonitsa,GreeceView image in fullscreenThe Konitsa bridge and Aoos River in autumn.Photograph: Vasilis Ververidis/AlamyThe river, fed by mountain springs, holds the most luminous blue when I open my eyes under waterA small bell still hangs beneath the Konitsa bridge to warn those crossing the cobbles of strong winds. Built in 1870 and curving 20 metres above the translucent green waters of the Aoos River, this astonishing stone bridge is thought to be one of the highest single-arched spans in the Balkans. I look upstream from it into the Aoos gorge as the sun rises over the towering mountains.The summer heat of Greece has mellowed to a warm September glow – and soon autumn will begin to yellow and bronze the leaves of the canyon trees. It’s my favourite time of year to be in this land of mountains, water and stone.About 40 miles north of the city of Ioannina in north-west Greece, the historic town of Konitsa spreads like an amphitheatre over the lower slopes of Mount Trapezitsa. A zigzagging road from the river leads to its leafy squares and evocative upper town with Ottoman-era mansions and Orthodox churches. I’m staying at the wonderful, family-runKonitsa Mountain Hotel(doubles from €90 room-only), and each afternoon I savour wild mountain tea on the terrace with a panoramic view of the Albanian mountains and the Aoos winding across the plain towards the border.As part of Unesco’s Vikos-Aoos Geopark, Konitsa is the perfect base for exploring the wider region. The next morning, I drive 15 minutes south to the Voidomatis River. There I follow a marked path along the riverbank upwards from another elegant stone bridge near the village of Kleidonia through a beautiful gallery forest of plane trees that bend low over the water. In the canyon walls above the trail are rock shelters once used by Palaeolithic hunters; below, fish fin slowly against the swift currents in the shadows of the trees. I always succumb to a swim in this river. Fed by deep mountain springs, it’s freezing whether high summer or late autumn, but holds the most luminous blue when I open my eyes underwater.View image in fullscreenThe Vikos canyon.Photograph: Traumlichtfabrik/Getty ImagesAfter a riverside lunch of grilled trout and fresh Greek salad at O Voidomatis taverna (open daytime only) I drive up into the Zagori region. The stunning stone houses and plane-shaded squares of Papingo and Mikro Papigko sit beneath the limestone mass of Mount Tyymfi, but my destination is the village of Vikos, on the edge of the Vikos Gorge – one of the deepest and most extraordinary geological forms in the world. The cooler temperatures of late September and October make walking the path down to the gorge’s turquoise springs far easier than in summer, and the reward after the ascent is a cold drink at the welcoming Viewpoint Garden cafe, set on a natural balcony above the chasm.Kingfishers fizz upriver and dippers dive into the flow, as the immense geological drama of the canyon and its current unfoldsDuring the years I’ve been coming to Konitsa I’ve visited the atmospheric monastery of Molyvdoskepastos near the border with Albania and explored the beautiful villages of Monodendri, Kipoi and Vitsa at the southern end of Zagori. I’ve watched river-rafters on the Voidomatis, swum in the rock pools of Papingo, and listened to long-distance hikers talk about the alpine lakes and mountain refuge on Mount Tymfi. But I always return to the remarkable bridge over the Aoos before leaving.I stop for coffee and traditional walnut cake at the cafe of theGefyri Hotelby the bridge, and then walk the path towards the Panagia Stomiou monastery perched on a promontory by the narrowest point of the gorge. Pale boulders break the green-blue torrents while still pools by the banks reflect the craggy cliffs. Kingfishers fizz upriver and dippers dive into the flow, as the immense geological drama of the canyon and its current unfolds. This is a place where the ancient contours of earth and water are close enough to touch.Julian HoffmanFor information about conservation work on the Aoos River, visitmed-ina.org.The accommodation prices quoted are for October 2025 and were correct at the time of publicationExplore more on these topicsBeach holidaysPortugal holidaysCorsica holidaysItaly holidaysGreece holidaysSpain holidaysMorocco holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They pinged each day on my phone like tiny arrows: two dozen or more, with random all-caps.Mom: Making mark red velvet CAKE. we have the gang of coyotes eating and harassing down below on the flats. Going to rest and take it easy and go TOMORROW FOR FOOD and water AGAIN.Me: Make sure you’re hydrated!Mom: I will sweet ANGELMy 77-year-old mother wanted sympathy, the kind Mark believed was for the weak: offers of a cup of a tea, a hug. Long ago, decades even, she had learned not to seek it from him. With him, she was a trooper.At 62 she had retired and followed him up to a high desert mountain, 6,500ft (1,981 metres) in north-eastCalifornia. Two and a half hours from the nearest town, their 20 acres (8 hectares) were nothing but dry rock, bitterbrush and a lone juniper here and there, raising a gnarled arm against the horizon.She took pride in her resilience, but her deeper comfort was this: he would never leave herFor 15 years, they lived with no power or plumbing in a 150-sq-ft cabin they had bought off Craigsist – a shack, really, so small there was no room for a couch or dining table so they ate on the bed. She bathed with a basin of warm vinegar water and chose each night whether to squat over a chamber pot or trudge up the hill to the outhouse.She took pride in her resilience, but her deeper comfort was this: he would never leave her.But life was getting harder. She was five years older than Mark, and off-grid living was taking more of a toll on her. Her joints ached in the icy mornings, UTIs plagued her. She was losing her teeth.Photograph: Courtesy of Joelle FraserBy the next week, she wrote that she had fallen twice, which persuaded Mark they needed to go to the hospital in Susanville, a five-hour round trip.Underneath my genuine concern was a deeper fear – that this could be another one of her veiled cries for help. She had had a mystery illness years before, and I had a familiar feeling that there was nothing actually wrong, not physically. Instead, I suspected she had hit the wall again with their grueling life on the mountain.To declare her existence untenable – to her husband, to me, to anyone – was not an option. Like a house of cards, her entire persona as his ride-or-die partner would collapse. Worst of all, he might tell her to leave, that he would be better off alone. That, for my mother, was unthinkable.After hours of tests, of blood draws, a CT scan, an EEG, the doctors could not find anything wrong. But she felt dizzy, she insisted. She showed them, taking slow, stumbling steps, leaning on the nurse’s arm like a tipsy dance partner. Maybe she’d had a small stroke? They couldn’t rule it out.Tossing and turning until after midnight, I finally got a text at 12.20am.Mom: In AMBULANCE TO RENOI read the text again, feeling cold, then flushed. I pictured the ambulance reeling across the dark desert night, then across the state line from California to Nevada. Headed to Reno, headed for me.The next morning, after a stop at Trader Joe’s for a smoothie and a bouquet of flowers, I found Mom in the neurology ward in a room bigger than their cabin. Beside her, the attending nurse typed notes into the standing computer, a giant rolling cart like a mini-office on wheels.“Oh you’re here! That’s my daughter,” my mother said, clasping her hands to her chest.She looked shrunken but happy in the imposing hospital bed. She yelped with joy at the flowers and smoothie.I tried to be honest with the nurse.“They have no power, no generator, no water. They haul it up in 200-gallon jugs.”The nurse raised her eyebrows and typed that in. Then she looked at me. “So for showering …”“Outside in the summer, with a hanging solar-powered bag,” I said, and added - not sure if it would help: “Five gallons.”View image in fullscreenMom and Mark.Photograph: Courtesy of Joelle Fraser“Hmm, and in the winter?”Mom and I exchanged a glance. “Sponge baths, with vinegar.”The nurse typed silently as I noted Mom’s hands, wondering if this nurse had seen how dirty they were. How could she not? Later, I would need two washcloths to clean the dug-in dust and dirt. Under her wedding ring, the skin was a darker brown that needed extra scrubbing.The nurse then asked about the bathroom layout.“Well, actually, there’s an outhouse.”A frown appeared briefly. “How far outside?”About 75ft, Mom told her, then described the narrow path up the slope. I pulled out my laptop at this point, brought in case there was downtime to work, and clicked on a picture. It looked like an upright coffin on the hill.“See?”I showed her another one of the inside. Mom craned to look, too, and I noticed how smudgy her glasses were. I dug a lens wipe out of my purse and unwrapped it while the nurse peered at the genuine toilet seat on top of the wooden bench, the coffee can full of lime to sprinkle into the hole, a roll of toilet paper. Mark had made a small shelf that held reading material: a US army survival guide, tattered copies of Better Homes and Gardens and Pioneer Magazine.“So there’s no handrail …” Her frown was permanent now.Mom piped up, eager to shift the mood. “Mark can make one. He’ll nail up a branch.”The nurse nodded as if that was a normal workaround. I would feel the familiar weight of her and others’ judgment over the coming week.During those hospital visits, I remembered being fascinated about feigned illnesses during war time. In the civil war, since most soldiers had little medical knowledge, they usually faked something familiar, like rheumatism. The war department caught on and ended that by year two. Other common pretended ailments were heart disease, vision problems and hemorrhoids.For fake paralysis, doctors would attach electrodes to the legs and flip the switch, or press tubes of radium to the skin until it burned. I was impressed by the ingenuity of one soldier who stuffed the heart of a turkey in his rectum to resemble piles. Others swallowed tobacco, causing nausea and vomiting, or coated their tongues with soap or chalk.To combat these ruses, doctors would give them awful duties such as cleaning vomit and feces so they would think their lot would be better back with their regiment. Another tactic would be to make the treatment worse than the illness, by, for example, applying fly blisters to the spine or dosing them with castor oil.She had made a pact with the man she loved decades before, one that had since hardened and encircled herI had a hunch Mom was doing the same. All the previous week, she had made her own symptoms by drinking just enough to keep herself alive and eating the barest portions. That made her dizzy and caused her falls.One afternoon after another hospital visit, I tried to figure out why I had been so quiet when it came to Mom and Mark. I could sense the nurses, friends and family members wanting me to confront my mother. I had heard comments like: “Get power of attorney. Call the sheriff. This is elder abuse.”By defending Mom’s choices, I suppose I was defending myself too. I understood why she and Mark loved the wild. The city jangled my nerves, and I missed small-time life from my youth, so when she wanted to return to their cabin, I understood. Like her, I had sacrificed monetary success for my writing, living a life with few if any luxuries. But I could no longer ignore that there was a cost to the quiet.Photograph: Courtesy of Joelle FraserSure enough, the problem with Mom turned out to be hyponatremia, a sodium deficiency due to dehydration. They recommended Gatorade and eight glasses of water every day. This felt more than anticlimactic, and my mother looked chagrined. Then she announced she wanted to be discharged immediately and go to my house. But because the nurses had reported some unsteadiness when they walked her around, she needed to go to the rehab hospital for seven to 10 days.“What?!” Mom yelled. She shifted on the bed and the alarm blasted, then stopped. “Damn it! I don’t need any more ‘care’. I can fall anytime, anywhere. At my daughter’s, for starters!”“But you’re weaker now,” one of the nurses pointed out.Then, to everyone’s astonishment, she got up and danced a jig. The alarm shrieked again.“See?!” she shouted. “I’m just FINE.”“Please sit down,” the nurse said, arms out, as the intercom chimed in like the voice of God.With furious defeat in her eyes, Mom glared at everyone in turn, then folded her arms across her chest. She knew she had to play along, but her patience was cracking like a thin sheet of ice. Below that layer was anger, even rage. That anger was directed at the staff, at the rules, and maybe somewhere deeper, also at herself. She had made a pact with the man she loved decades before, one that had since hardened and encircled her.When I got home, I made an appointment for my mother with a psychologist who had helped me get through my divorce. It was a long shot, but I hoped when this crying wolf episode was over and Mom was out of rehab, I could convince her to go.To my surprise, Mom agreed to see Dianna, the psychologist, on her next visit with me in Reno. On the night before the appointment, she took an hour-long hot bath, slipped into the fleece pyjamas I had laid out for her, and snuggled under the red, electric blanket. As always, what she wanted to do was join an Alcoholics Anonymous phone meeting. She loved to spend an hour listening to other people and how they pushed through the challenges of their lives. She put it on speaker, so I could hear the shares from the kitchen, and after a while I could figure out the topic: forgiveness. Fear. Self-pity.When it was her turn, I listened in the hallway and her tone was off, forced, as if trying to reassure everyone that she was OK up on the mountain. Very fine actually and it’s such an adventure! And yes, of course sometimes she feels sorry for herself, very sorry actually, especially when her fingers are as cold as frozen carrot sticks so she can’t even text her daughter. And yes it gets crazy lonely with no neighbors or visitors. But she has it better than a lot of folks.“Gratitude,” she said. “That’s what the topic should be next time! Or how about grit!? Now that’s a topic I could get behind.”These meetings were impossible on the mountain, the signal too sketchy unless you were 200 yards up the road. Mark, though, could get the news he wanted on his cell phone, where he learned how the weather system was being manipulated and wars were brewing and evil people were plotting in windowless rooms in places like the mountains of Switzerland. The banking system was also about to fail, so they needed to get their money from the bank and he would wear it in a money belt around his waist.“He says it’s going to be like Y2K,” Mom told me. I pointed out that that was a nothing burger.She cracked up at the phrase, delighted.“You should tell him that when you get home,” I said. “Hey Mark – chill out! It’s all just a big, fat, juicy nothing burger!”We laughed so hard Mom spat out her tea.I was sucked into a twilight world of deadly codependency that leads to insanity, suicide, murderDuring Mom’s therapy appointment, I waited at a nearby Starbucks, but having seen Dianna myself, I could imagine it well. I was sure Mom was immediately soothed by the serene decor of the office, the low-bubbling tank with its gently swaying fish, the lavender palette and soft couch pillows. Dianna, a statuesque blonde in her early 60s, was always dressed in flowy silk outfits in muted colors like dusty rose and light gold. Her large eyes brimmed with wise compassion, yet to me she had dispensed firm, sometimes uncomfortable insights. They were just what I needed.Later at home, I asked Mom how it went.“Well, she was really dramatic.”“How so?”“She diagnosed us withfolie à deux.” She chuckled a little, then sighed. “It’s a real diagnosis. But ridiculously rare.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Joelle Fraser“I think I’ve heard of it.” I knew from my French that it meant “madness of two”.“According to Dianna, Mark and I are nuts and I need to get off the mountain. She told me” – and here Mom paused for a beat – “‘One day you will die from this.’”I took that in, my chest tight. It felt like Dianna had reduced all of my fears into one, blunt sentence – the one I could never bring myself to say to my mother.“Wow.” I took a deep breath. “She’s very smart, you know. And experienced. What do you think of what she said?”“Well again, it was a bit dramatic. I’ll have to think about it.”“Are you going to tell Mark?”“Probably.”That night after she went to bed, I spent hours researching folie à deux. I was sucked into a twilight world of deadly codependency that leads to insanity, suicide, murder. I learned that folie à deux is an indeed rare but actual diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), where it is referred to as “Shared Psychotic Disorder”, in which one person develops delusions that mirror another person’s delusions due to a close, long-term relationship. Like a marriage. (If three people share the delusion, it’s a folie à trois.)Other factors include financial challenges, and it is highly correlated with people who are isolated outsiders. I felt an odd mix of sorrowful vindication: this was what had been happening to them for decades. Then, reading further, I locked on to one of the four subtypes of this disorder:folieinduite(imposed psychosis). Unlikefoliesimultanée(simultaneous psychosis), where both people are equally delusional, withfolieinduite, one patient takes on another’s delusion.A flood of memories enveloped me, of Mom defending Mark’s dreams, of her insisting that most people just will not admit that they envy the freedom she and Mark have. That their lives are wondrous and worth the deprivation and sacrifice. That Mark was very wise and knowledgeable.I searched for treatment – how are these people helped? One line crushed me: “Due to the rarity of this disorder presenting in a clinical setting, the clinical course and prognosis are not fully understood.”Inside the LA ‘psychic reset’ bootcamp that promises happiness – at a priceRead moreA few months later I headed up for a visit, sleeping in a tent since there was not enough room in the cabin. Mom was proud to show me a sign they had carved and painted, giving their place a name with a mocking acceptance: “Folie A Deux”. I took a picture of them in front of it.It was clear to me that Mom had chosen her life with Mark, come what may. And I had to accept her choice.Two years later, by the time Mark relented to see a doctor, cancer had spread much too far. He died a few weeks later.My mother had a crippling stroke and now lives in a nursing home. The injury damaged her emotional center, so life for her is that of a strange contentment.I visit her every week and push her in the wheelchair down the shady street. She loves the trees, and sometimes we just stop and rest beneath their reaching branches and shifting shadows. Below us, the roots dig down deep into the earth, grasping and holding on for dear life."

The truth is, I had no idea how much a new flat roof should, or could, cost.But my wife wasn’t home when the roofer came round, climbed out on the roof, and said: “That’s really bad.” She didn’t hear his wholly convincing explanation of what was wrong, and what must be done to put it right. She was not impressed by my version of those explanations. And she probably hadn’t worked herself up into expecting a quote at double the price. In any case, she has reservations.“How do we know if he’s any good?” she says.“He seemed to know what he was talking about,” I say.“How would you know if someone knew what they were talking about?” she says.“You gave me his number,” I say.“I told you, it was a secondhand recommendation,” she says.“In that case, we just check,” I say, opening my laptop.Unfortunately, the roofer has a very common name, common even to roofers, including one scam roofer who, on closer inspection, confines his operations to the eastern portion of the state of Massachusetts. And also a man who killed someone closer to home, but a decade ago – his mugshot is one of the first things to come up.“That’s not him, is it?” my wife says.“Probably not,” I say.“What do you mean, probably not?” she says.“I mean I didn’t spend the whole time looking at him,” I say.“So it could be him,” she says.“The quote was reasonable,” I say.“On the whole I’d prefer a roofer who hadn’t killed anyone,” she says.“Me too, but I’m not sure we can afford that,” I say.“Call him and say we want to meet him again,” she says.“On what grounds?” I say.‘Well that’s it,’ says my wife. ‘From now on you’re not allowed to handle this sort of thing on your own’A second meeting proves hard to arrange; we have only just come back from holiday; the roofer is busy during most weekdays, and my wife has a string of appointments. A week slips by. Then 10 days.“Why is he being so elusive?” my wife says.“I think he’s probably asking the same question about us,” I say.In the meantime, after a summer of fortuitous drought, rain has returned. My wife obtains another roofing recommendation, but no one picks up the phone when she rings the number.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I call my wife, who is out.“Are you gonna be here?” I say. “There’s no point if you’re not …”“I’ll be back by lunchtime,” she says.“I mean, I’ve already met him,” I say.“I’ll be there,” she says.Tim Dowling: my wife’s decided we need a muzzle – no, not for meRead moreAs soon as I hang up, a long-threatened thunderstorm erupts; 10 metres of belting rain separates my office shed from the house, where I can just make out the oldest one working at the kitchen table. I stand there, willing him to go upstairs and position the bucket under the hole in the roof. But he’s not picking up the vibrations.The roofer arrives shortly after 2pm, by which time the sun is out. He comes into the kitchen, shakes our hands, pats the dog, re-explains both the problem and the solution, offering a best-case and a worst-case scenario, and a price to go with each. He is patient with my wife’s inquiries about his experience – which seems to be considerable – and on his way out engages in a brief and knowledgable exchange with my oldest son about the football transfer window.“Well I like him,” my wife says as soon as the door shuts.“He’s definitely not the murderer, by the way,” I say.“When can he start?” she says.“He’s gonna let us know,” I say. “Hopefully within the next two weeks.”A couple of hours later I find what eluded me a fortnight ago: dozens of five-star reviews for the roofer and his work, on a reputable building website, stretching back years.“Why didn’t we see these the first time?” my wife says.“I have no idea,” I say. “I even used the same search terms.”“Well that’s it,” she says. “From now on you’re not allowed to handle this sort of thing on your own.”I think: if I have accomplished nothing else in the past fortnight, I have accomplished that.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than a dozen green triangles representing shadow fleet vessels pop up around the coastline of southern Sweden alone.Every day hundreds of shadow fleet ships – unregulated ageing tankers from around the world in varying states of repair carrying oil from Russia to states including China and India – are moving through a relatively narrow passage in the Baltic.What was previously hoped would effectively become “Nato lake” after Finland andSwedenjoined Nato, has instead become a battleground for hybrid warfare and the shadow fleet, which move under various identities and change flags to circumvent western economic sanctions imposed on Moscow since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.View image in fullscreenTracking different vessels on a map.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianSome shadow ships are understood to be accompanied by Russian military vessels, others have planes following their route from above to make sure they get to their intended destination.The Guardian was given rare access to the coastguard’s operations, accompanying KBV 003 from the port of Karlskrona on an eight-hour patrol of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.“Sea traffic in the Baltic has increased somewhat copiously with the whole shadow fleet, but also with Nato ships, defence ships and the coastguard,” says the vessel’s captain, Joakim Håkansson. “So we try to get far out and show that we’re here.”In the Bornholm strait, where shipping traffic is divided like a motorway, shadow fleet vessels pass less than 10 nautical miles off the coast of Sweden. In our vicinityoff the rocky Blekinge archipelago,there are two.Later the coastguard follows one, an oil tanker currently flagged in Malta that according to online maritime records has in the last two years alsobeen flagged in the Marshall Islands under a different name. As long as vessels are in a country’s economic zone as opposed to its smaller territorial sea – at most 12 nautical miles offshore – the grounds for intervention are extremely limited, but as of July, the coastguard is allowed to contact the vessel to request information about the ship and its insurance. A crew member on the oil tanker says over the radio its last port of call was Primorsk, Russia, and it is carrying just under 30,000 metric tonnes of diesel. Its next stop, he says, is Aliağa in Turkey. Its end destination is impossible to know, but the Swedish coastguard is certain this ship is part of the Russian shadow fleet.View image in fullscreenAn oil tanker followed by the coastguard.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianThe radio call is part of a new government plan aimed at tightening checks on the shadow fleet amid fears of a serious oil spill. The vessels are under no obligation to respond, but so far the coastguard says ships have been cooperative.“There are hundreds of [shadow] ships moving in the Baltic all the time. And it’s a lot for our little sea here,” says Håkansson. “We see ships that have never been seen in the Baltic before that we come across now.” They need to build a picture of how seaworthy the ships are, he says, “because if there was an oil accident with these ships there would be an oil catastrophe in the Baltic”.Security in the Baltic has changed dramatically since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says Håkansson. As well as the growing shadow fleet, there is increasing disturbance to satellite-based navigation systems, such as GPS, and Baltic authorities must keep a close eye on undersea infrastructure. In the event of an oil spill, the coastguard would be responsible for emergency response and clean-up. There is also a growing physical threat from the Russian military, as its presence has “stepped up” in the Baltic, says Håkansson.Håkansson also comes across ships he strongly suspects of spying. “Before they had these research ships [for spying]. Lately they have been using cargo ships to do these operations,” he claims.View image in fullscreenThe coastguards watch as a German ship passes them in the Karlskrona archipelago.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianBut unless there is evidence of an environmental crime, a fishing crime or some sea traffic crimes, the Swedish coastguard’s ability to act on such threats is extremely limited. According to the rules of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that deals with safety and security of shipping, “the shadow fleet is allowed to move freely in the whole of the Baltics”, says Jonatan Tholin, a preliminary investigation manager for the Swedish coastguard.National law can only apply in a country’s territorial waters, in the country’s broader economic zone it is the legislation of the country that the flag is shipped in that counts.The problems caused by the shadow fleet are exemplified by Eagle S, an oil tankersuspected of damaging five undersea cablesby dragging its anchor between Finland and Estonia in December 2024. Finnish authorities filed charges against members of the crew, arguing that although the measures were carried out outside Finland, the effects of the crime materialised in Finland, meaning it falls into its jurisdiction. The crew members deny the charges.However, Tholin believes the most dangerous risk of the shadow fleet is its uninsured vessels, which in the event of an oil spill could have huge financial and environmental costs. “It means it will be taxpayer, the state, who pays,” he says.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It’s unusual for ­politicians to invite you into their home, but Ireland is famous for its hospitality. The house looks impressively humble – a tiny, ­unprepossessing terrace. A woman answers. “Hi,” I say. “Does the taoiseach live here? “No,” she says.I start to panic. Our interview is due to start in two minutes.Can you tell me the postcode here?“No.”She shuts the door.Now I’m in full panic mode. There must be another road with the same name nearby and the taxi driver has taken me to the wrong place.As I walk away, I see another cab. Phew. I hail it. Thankfully two people are getting out, and the driver says he’s free.Then I notice one of the passengers is Leo Varadkar and he’s walking towards the house that isn’t his.I chase after him, breathless. “Leo, a woman told me this wasn’t your house. I asked if the taoiseach lived there, and she said no.”“Ah, I forgot to tell her,” he says. “And actually she’s right. I’m not the taoiseach.” Varadkar resigned as head of the Irish government in April 2024.Accompanying Varadkar is his book publicist, Cliona. She says he would like to have something to eat and suggests she and I return in half an hour.We find a general shop that sells automated coffee and a bench of sorts and while away the half hour. Cliona tells me that Varadkar isn’t like most politicians. The former leader of Fine Gael (which is perhaps closest to a moderate, old-fashioned Tory party) is famous for speaking his mind. He’s also unusual for having walked away from politics while in his 40s, when many of his rivals are still trying to wheedle their way to power. And he is gay and of Asian heritage (his father was an Indian GP, his mother an Irish nurse) – both of them firsts for a taoiseach.Half an hour later, we return to his house. He answers the door. The woman, who is cleaning, looks at me as if it’s the first time we’ve met. Varadkar is a youthful 46 – trim, black hair, smart-casual in a blue shirt, cream chinos and spotless trainers. His memoir Speaking My Mind, as you might expect, is refreshingly honest. It starts with him as a little boy going with his mother to vote at the polling station. From then on, he wanted to go into politics. Actually, from then on he wanted to be taoiseach.I was always interested in politics. I was fascinated with elections and the way they can turn ordinary people into people of influenceBy the time I reach the end of the book, I feel I know every significant incident that happened in his political life, and every player in Irish politics, but one question remains. Why was he so desperate to be taoiseach? Boris Johnson was another prime minister who stated his ambition young, but he couldn’t be a more different character. While Johnson is all pompous bluster, Varadkar appears to be a modest man with a hint of a stammer. While Johnson talks in rambling generalities, Varadkar is all about the detail, delivered in fully formed sentences.It feels as if you wanted to run the country from day zero I say. “I’m not sure about dayzero,” he says with a smile. What was behind that drive? “The truth is I don’t know. For sure, I was always interested in politics. I was fascinated with elections and the process by which elections can turn ordinary people into people of influence. Then as I got older, living in west Dublin, my community was very short in terms of services, playgrounds, schools, you name it.”View image in fullscreenWith his parents Miriam and Ashok, 2017.Photograph: Frank McGrath /Irish IndependentVaradkar went on to study medicine at Trinity College Dublin and became a GP, like his father, Ashok, who first moved toIrelandfrom Mumbai in the 1960s. His time as a doctor hardened his resolve to make a career of politics. Varadkar saw problems in the health service and thought there was more chance of solving them as a teachta dála (or TD, the equivalent of a British MP) than as a doctor. “It was definitely in my personality to want to get stuck in and put something right rather than say someone else should fix it, or dump on the people who were trying to fix it.”He’s still pondering my question about why he wanted to lead the country. “Is the answer in the book there somewhere?” he asks hopefully. Well, no, I don’t think it is, I say. Was it ambition or the desire to serve? “Politicians are driven by a combination of ego and altruism. So you do want to do things to make things better and you need that self-belief.”The young Varadkar had extraordinary self-belief. “I first ran for election when I was 20, which was kind of crazy. But I didn’t get elected. I got on to the council when I was 24.” Within four years, he was a TD. But he was as awkward as he was confident. Irish politicians are renowned forplámás– their ability to work the room, schmooze and flatter. Varadkar had none of that. He barely knew how to talk to people, let alone flatter them. In her recent memoir, the former SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was always glad to find Varadkar in a room full of people with her because she knew that at least there was somebody as shy as her. “He was even more introverted than me,” she wrote.Was he aware of his lack of social niceties? “Yes. I’ve never been great at working the room and making friends. The upside is I’m fairly immune to the sycophancy andplámássome politicians practise.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Linda Brownlee/The GuardianHe quickly became known as Fine Gael’s rottweiler. “I was the go-to attack dog if they needed somebody to go on the radio or on TV.” He says he really was an angry young man back then – Fine Gael’srival party, Fianna Fáil, had been in power for an eternity and the country went through a terrible recession amid the global financial crisis in 2008. “There was a world financial crisis, but only seven countries had the IMF [International Monetary Fund] in.” Ireland was one of them. “My generation of people had homes that were worth a fraction of what we paid for them. People were once again being forced to leave Ireland because they couldn’t find employment here. And, working in the health service, I saw big cuts to budgets that affected the patients around me.”But he says you can’t stay an attack dog for long if you want to progress in politics. “It’s easy when you’re a newly elected politician in opposition to be angry and righteous, and I had to modify that as I became more and more responsible for the country. I definitely mellowed over time.” He says his early sense of certainty was delusional. “I was sure I knew what needed to be done and I could get it done. Over time I learned I wasn’t always right and getting things done is a lot harder than people think.” After stints as transport minister and health minister, he became taoiseach at the age of 38.Varadkar asks if I want a drink. We head downstairs. The kitchen is spacious and stylish. There are lots of photos, mainly of him and his partner, Matt Barrett, a cardiologist, with friends and family. He proudly points to their invitation to King Charles’s coronation, which is framed on the wall. One of the likable things about Varadkar is that awkwardness. It’s given him a reputation for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. In this case, he was filmed picking his nose on the way into the ceremony.Coming out opened up a whole new life to me: a partner of 10 years I thought I’d never have, a whole new bunch of friends, a whole new way of seeing the worldThe house has a lovely relaxed feel. The front door rug, a gift from his former PA, features an illustration of him and Barrett wearing shades and personalised T-shirts alongside a ginger tabby, and says: “Go away unless you have alcohol and cat treats.” On the wall is a copy of a mural of two men hugging from the 2015 marriage equality referendum, which made Ireland the first country in the worldto legalise same-sex marriageby popular vote.Varadkar came out in January 2015 on his 36th birthday, four months before the referendum. He says it was a calculated decision. If he was going to lead the country, he felt he had to disclose his sexuality. “I was ready anyway. I wasn’t pretending any more. I was going to gay bars in Dublin. People were seeing me. Journalists were talking about it. It wasn’t really a secret at that stage.”Was it a defining event in his life? “Yes, but what’s strange is at the time I didn’t think it was.” Why not? “I just thought: I am gay, I’m not going to pretend any more. If it damages my career, I don’t really care. The referendum was coming up, so I just thought, I’ll get it out of the way and then forget about it. And that was untrue, because it opened up a whole new life to me – a partner of 10 years that I thought I’d never have, a whole new bunch of friends, a whole new way of seeing the world.”As a politician he was known for being fiscally conservative and socially liberal. As a young man, though, he says, he was conservative on all fronts. “It’s very easy to be black and white about life when you haven’t lived much of a life. As you go on, you understand ambiguity and how grey things can be.” But, he says, there was more to it than that. “I think part of it was also that I was a closeted gay man, and it’s not uncommon for closeted gay men to be a bit more conservative and a bit more judgmental, where you feel ifyouhave to live a certain life and conform to certain social standards, well, other people should be willing to do that, too.”How old was he when he had his first relationship? “My first real relationship?” Yes, I say, or your first sexual experience? “I’m not telling you that!Hahaha.”When he laughs, he does so with shoulder-shaking gusto. OK, first relationship then? “I was well into my 30s, yeah.” Had he been reluctant to have a relationship because he wasn’t out and he was worried that it could threaten his political ambitions? “Yeah, I was avoiding it, really. Like a lot of [closeted] gay men, you throw yourself into your career or whatever your thing is.” That must mess with your head, I say. “It’s called the velvet rage. It’s this concept of closeted gay men who throw themselves into their art or their work or their business and then after you come out you’re a bit annoyed about all the years you’ve missed that could have been great fun. I might even have it there.” He goes to his bookshelf, and among the many political biographies is a book calledThe Velvet Rageby Alan Downs. “There we are,” he says, passing it over.Was he supported by his family when he came out? “Very much so.” Varadkar verges on the apologetic when talking about it. “I am aware that coming out when you’re a doctor in your 30s who’s a government minister is a bit different to an 18-year-old kid.” It’s easier? “Yes, of course. I was financially secure. I had status. It’s a very different experience. There are still kids who get kicked out of home. Who was going to do that to me? My officials in my department weren’t going to refuse to work with me. So I was able to do it from a position of privilege and strength. I get that.” Were his friends upset that it had taken him so long to come out? “My straight friends?” No, your gay friends. “I didn’t have any gay friends at that time. Maybe if I’d made gay friends already I’d have come out earlier.”He had long been aware that his life was taking a different shape to many of his friends’. “They were already going in different directions, forming families, having kids. They werevery keento tell you about their kids.” He makes it clear that he found all the family talk boring.What advice would he give to kids coming out? “I’d be careful about giving advice to minors. But 18, 19, 20: I’d say I’ve never met anybody who regrets it – even people who had a bad experience coming out.”Varadkar became a figurehead of the new socially liberal Ireland, even though he’d hardly been in the vanguard of the campaign for marital equality. At the time, he was health minister, which was regarded as the poisoned chalice of politics. He survived it, and on 2 June 2017 he won the battle to lead Fine Gael after Enda Kenny’s resignation. Twelve days later, he was voted in as taoiseach by the Dáil in Dublin. Kenny, who had led the country for six years, said Varadkar represented a “modest, diverse and inclusive Ireland”.View image in fullscreenWith Boris Johnson in Dublin, 2019.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersFrom the start, Varadkar faced significant challenges, not least the upcoming abortion referendum and the fight with Britain to ensure that there was no hard border on the island of Ireland after the Brexit vote. In May 2018, Ireland voted overwhelmingly by 66.4% to 33.6% to overturn the abortion ban. It was seen by many as proof that the country had finally evolved from a secretive clerical state to a modern liberal democracy. Varadkar, who had campaigned in favour of liberalisation, called it “a historic day for Ireland”, saying that a “quiet revolution” had taken place. “It’s also a day when we say no more,” he said. “No more to doctors telling their patients there’s nothing that can be done for them in their own country, no more lonely journeys across the Irish Sea, no more stigma as the veil of secrecy is lifted and no more isolation as the burden of shame is gone.”He was praised for standing his ground on Brexit and, eventually, the then British prime minister Boris Johnson was forced to agree to the Northern Ireland protocol and a de facto tradeborder in the Irish Sea. How did he get on with Johnson? “I got on well with him. He was someone I felt I could talk to. And we’re both interested in history and the classics. He’s got a good sense of humour, and I felt I could deal with him one to one in a way that was much more difficult with prime minister [Theresa] May, because she was much more formal and stuck to her briefs. Eventually, we were able to make a deal. We agreed on the protocol.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Well, not quite, he says. “Within months he tried to renege on it. I felt betrayed by that because we’d come to an agreement he’d sold to the British people as the oven-ready deal we’d cooked together. He won the election on it, got it through parliament and then within months was trying to unwind it.” You sound surprised, I say, but Johnson is famous for saying one thing and doing the other. “I suppose he hadn’t done it to me then. Dominic Cummings said he’d always intended to break the agreement.”View image in fullscreenWelcoming Donald Trump and his wife Melania to Ireland during the president’s first term of office, 2019.Photograph: Liam McBurney/PAView image in fullscreenWith then MEP Nigel Farage after Varadkar  addressed the European parliament, 2018Photograph: Courtesy of Leo VaradkarHow did he get on with Donald Trump? “Erm, actually well.” Has he got a thing for rightwing populists? “Well, I think part of the reason they’re successful is they’re generally quite likable. Nigel Farage is quite likable, too. Trump has been very welcoming to me any time we’ve met …” But? “You go in there to the Oval Office and you feel you’re a guest on his show. And, on another level, it feels like a medieval court. When you met, for example, President Biden you might be in one to one, and then you might meet with a small group of, say, six people. With Trump, there might be 20 people in the room.”Does Trump’s influence scare him? “I’m much more worried about his second term than his first. Trump 2.0 is different from Trump 1.0. In his first term he had a lot of restraining influences around him like Mike Pence. He’s come back and is only surrounding himself with people who stood by him after January 6, so it’s a much more extreme administration.”In what way? “On LGBT issues, for example. He wasn’t interested in that in his first term and now it’s become one of the focuses, which is to erase trans people and also downgrade the whole idea of diversity, equity and inclusion.”I ask which leader he admired most. “Angela Merkel,” he says instantly. “She knew how to use power very skilfully. She was the head of a big country, the biggest economy inEurope, 80 million people, and never threw her weight around. She was clever in the way she used power, from listening to the debate on different sides then coming up with the compromise that everyone would come in behind, or being very sensitive around the needs of smaller countries. She also got elected for four terms. My party managed to get four terms, but with three leaders. She did that all on her own.”Varadkar was taoiseach for three years from June 2017. He was returned to power in 2020 as part of a historic coalition with Fianna Fáil (to the left of Fine Gael and thought of as the party of government through the 20th century), first as tánaiste (deputy leader) and then again as taoiseach. He led the country through a tough time that included Brexit, Russia’s war against Ukraine and the pandemic, and is generally thought to have done well on all fronts. Ireland was incredibly generous to Ukrainian refugees, taking in more than 100,000 and providing housing and benefits under the EU’s temporary protection directive. During the pandemic, Varadkar briefly returned to work as a GP and was hailed as a “badass” by the Hollywood actor Matt Damon. Ireland had one of thelowest Covid death ratesin western Europe.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Linda Brownlee/The GuardianAnd yet, travelling through Ireland the week I interview Varadkar, I get little sense of love for him. There is certainly not the affection the public has for the president, Michael D Higgins. The most common criticism is that he failed to deal with Ireland’s housing crisis. Varadkar says his critics have a point. “We made efforts to deal with it, but we didn’t succeed. But a lot of people have come to believe the narrative that we didn’t solve the housing crisis because we didn’t care or we had the wrong policies. The year we came in, 7,000 homes were built in the entire country, and the year I finished there were 32,000.” The problem is, he says, he was too fiscally cautious, determined to run a budget surplus so he could build a war chest to cover the impact of Brexit. But ultimately that proved unnecessary. “We thought there may be an economic hit coming from Brexit. Had we known we would get a good deal on Brexit in the end, we would have probably run a small deficit, and that would have freed up some money for housing.”His popularity also suffered when he was investigated for corruption after “leaking” a confidential document to a friend. The allegation was clouded in confusion, partly because the issue was so knotty and partly because it was such small fry. In April 2019, he sent a copy of a draft contract between the state and the Irish Medical Organisation to Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail, who was then head of the National Association of General Practitioners, which is now defunct but was then regarded as a rival of the IMO. Varadkar said the allegations that he broke the law in doing so were made by “sworn political opponents”. In July 2022, after a two-year investigation by the Garda Síochána (Irish police), the director of public prosecutions concluded that he would not be prosecuted. Varadkar apologised for what he had done, calling it “inappropriate” and an “error”. At the time, he was tánaiste, and five months later he took over as prime minister for a second stint, this time as part of the coalition government.The allegation of corruption could have destroyed you, I say. “Yes, totally.” Could he have ended up in prison? “Erm, I don’t ever think that was likely, but in theory. In the end, the most important thing is the Garda found nothing against me, then the DPP said I had no case to answer, and then it went to the ethics body who decided there was no breach of the code of conduct. But I did worry that this might be the thing that brings me down. And it was such a small thing.” He says he found it cathartic to be able to tell his side of the story in his memoir. “It helped me realise how silly the whole thing was. I was acting in good faith and there was no question that I was trying to benefit myself or the person I gave the document to. A priority of the deal was to extend free GP care to more children, which is a good thing to do, you know!”How did the investigation affect him? “It was draining. It was very tough and I had to put on a brave face. Journalists always asked, ‘Is this a distraction from your work?’, and my answer was always no. But of course it was a distraction. It was on my mind all the time, and the most difficult thing was it went on for so long. I was surprised that the police were investigating it at all. I think most people were quite frankly, including politicians and journalists.”In March 2024, halfway through his second stint as taoiseach, he announced he was resigning. There had been no sign this was coming, and no obvious reason for it. It shocked the country in much the way Jacinda Ardern’s resignation as New Zealand’s prime minister had done a year earlier. There is a remarkable symmetry between the two politicians. Both took power in 2017, both were remarkably young (she 37, he 38), and both quit because they’d had enough when they were still young enough to be starting out.Why did he resign? “On a personal level, I wasn’t loving it any more. The job is so full-on. You have to like it, and I wasn’t enjoying it.” Had he fallen out of love with politics? “Yeah, not politics per se, but the job. Being on the frontline. Being the commander. I certainly fell out of love with being taoiseach.” Why? “I had been doing it for a long time. I also found – maybe they’re connected – that my political capital had depleted. We were heading into local elections, and there were a lot of colleagues whose seats were in jeopardy. I felt the party had a better chance to refresh and rebrand without me.”Like Ardern, who led through Covid, he was exhausted. And he found the global move towards rightwing populism depressing. There had been so much social progress in Ireland, but he could see the start of a backlash. There were now increasing incidents of homophobia and racism. In September 2023, a protest outside the Dáil featured an effigy of a man hanging from a gallows, on which were stuck pictures of politicians, including one of Varadkar labelled “GLOBALIST TRAITOR”. Far-right protesters chanted against transgender rights, migration and planned hate speech laws, and held signs saying “Irish lives matter”.Two months later, there was a riot in Dublin after a man who was originally from Algeria stabbed three children and a care worker. Police described it as the most violent riot in modern Dublin history, and Garda commissioner Drew Harris blamed it on a “lunatic, hooligan faction driven by a far-right ideology”.Some said Varadkar’s generosity towards Ukrainian refugees was partly responsible for the upsurge in anti-migrant feeling. “I don’t regret for a second that we opened our door to Ukrainians,” he says. Varadkar and Barrett hosted a Ukrainian refugee in their home for nine months. Today, he wears a bracelet made of steel from the Azovstal steel and iron plant in Mariupol that held out for 82 days in 2022 against Russian air bombardment and became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.View image in fullscreenWith his partner Matt Barrett (far right) and former US vice-president Mike Pence and his sister Anne, 2019.Photograph: Brian Lawless/PALast month, Varadkar wrote a piece for the Sunday Times about the recent attacks on Indian migrants. “But it’s not just about Indians,” he stresses. “A country that has become very liberal and tolerant is now facing a backlash. A certain degree of xenophobia and homophobia is more acceptable than it was a few years ago. For a minority of people it’s become socially acceptable again to dislike the other, and even harm them.”As a gay, mixed-race taoiseach, Varadkar has been the supreme symbol of that tolerance. Even so, he occasionally suffered coded homophobia during his time in office. In 2019, it emerged that he had sent Kylie Minogue a letter saying he was a huge fan and would love to welcome her to Dublin personally before her concert. It became something of a national joke. “Had I written that note to a golfer or footballer or Bruce Springsteen it wouldn’t have been framed in the same way; that I was ‘fan-girling’ over Kylie! I didn’t lose any sleep over it because it wasn’t that big a deal. I met Cher and nobody took a photograph of that! And she asked to meetme!”It seems from the book that Barrett found it particularly difficult in coping with media attention, I say. “Well, heandme. We never bought into political life as a couple. You often see the wife of a politician who is very dedicated to her husband’s career or vice versa. But we never agreed on that political path.” In December 2022, shortly before beginning his second stint as taoiseach,Varadkar was secretly filmedsnogging a young man in a nightclub. Barrett was there, too. Did it shock him that it was leaked to the press? “It’s a slightly difficult thing to talk about because it involves other people and I want to protect their privacy.” He says that a bigger deal was made of footage of Finland’sSanna Marin dancing with her friends. Marin, who became the world’s youngest serving prime minister at 34, quit politics when she was only 37. “I was fortunate that the gay community rallied around me, and that the Irish media and public wanted to treat it as a private matter. It may not have been the same in other countries.”Is Ireland sufficiently liberal that it could accept a leader who was in an open relationship? For the first time he balks at a question. “Well, we’re in a long-term committed relationship of 10 years, so that doesn’t arise. That’s not to say we haven’t had our slip-ups from time to time, but that’s our business.”I’m not allowing myself to contemplate ever running for election againVaradkar, Ardern, Marin – all refreshingly modern politicians who ultimately put their personal life before their professional one. Varadkar believes we’re witnessing the end of the career politician. “I think the turnover is going to be quicker in politics. My generation has a different attitude. Politicians don’t necessarily want the job for life like they used to, and also people get sick of politicians quicker than they did before. You can see in Britain how quickly the new government’s become unpopular.”He insists he has no interest in going back into politics. For now, he’s happy with a portfolio career – writing occasional newspaper articles, teaching part-time at Harvard, working in an advisory role with the US-based PR firm Penta Group. In recent weeks, singer Bob Geldof, Riverdance star Michael Flatley and MMA fighter Conor McGregor have all been rumoured to be joining the race to become the next president of Ireland in October. Would he stand for the presidency? “No. I’m not allowing myself to contemplate ever running for election again.”When he assesses his record, is he pleased at what he’s achieved? “I really don’t want to write my own report card. It’s for others to make that judgment. I think it’s only over time that you can judge the performance of a prime minister or politician – 10 or 20 years later, when you’ve seen what’s come next.” Perhaps. In the short term, it feels as if Varadkar is more appreciated away from home than in Ireland. Maybe his achievements are best judged in terms of what he didn’t do rather than what he did. After all, he led Ireland through a period of relative stability and calm when neighbouring countries in Britain imploded in a series of scandals that destroyed trust in party politics.‘Empathy is a kind of strength’: Jacinda Ardern on kind leadership, public rage and life in Trump’s AmericaRead moreDespite the negatives, he hopes to encourage decent people to go into politics. “There is a profound risk that politics will only attract people who are perfect or shameless. And that wouldn’t be a good thing, because you need human beings in politics. I want to say to people, ‘You can go for it; it doesn’t have to be for life.’ People are very aware of the abuse politicians get, but the vast majority of people you meet just want to say hello. They might even thank you for the work you’re doing. I really hope that people thinking of going into politics now don’t think it’s awful, because it’s not. It’s actually really rewarding. Youcanmake changes for the better and the negative stuff isn’t as bad as people think.”Meanwhile, he’s loving his new freedom. “You can speak more freely, write more freely and think more freely.AndI’ve got time to go to the gym.” He spoke to Ardern before resigning, and her advice helped him make up his mind. “She crystallised my thoughts. She said there are three ways it ends as prime minister – you die, you lose or you resign. I always wanted to go on my own terms. I know a lot of people in politics who were forced to resign or who lost their seat and they’re still bitter about it, whereas I made my decision. I took control.”Speaking My Mind by Leo Varadkar is published by Sandycove (£25). To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Following his death, conservative commentators, activists and public officials in the US have engaged in social media campaigns against people accused of disrespecting Kirk’s memory.A Saturday morning tally by Reuters showed that at least 15 people had been fired or suspended.On Thursday, Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state and former US Mexican ambassador,warnedon X that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country”.“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the state department can protect the American people,”saidLandau, who was appointed US ambassador to Mexico and served from 2019 to 2021 during Trump’s first presidency.People began responding to Landau’s post with examples of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk’s death. Among those was a clip of Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for the ruling Morena party, speaking on a television news program on Milenio.Ramírez appeared on a roundtable political analysis program with Milenio, discussing Kirk’s killing.“I think if Charlie Kirk lived, he may like what I am about to say, because what I am about to say is very ‘anti-woke’,” Ramírez facetiouslysaid. “He was given a spoonful of his own chocolate. They gave a spoonful to someone who promoted the use of weapons. They gave a spoonful to someone who was financed by the National Rifle Association – a political association that is of the extreme right, pro-Trump, of the most radical wing of the Republicans.”Ramírez added that Turning Point USA was “an anti-rights, anti-LGBT – practically anti-women – movement”.After a post tagging Milenio and the Morena party made Landau aware of Ramirez’s comments, heresponded with an imagereading “El Quitavisas”, roughly meaning “the visa remover”. Minutes later, Landau went after Milenio itself, which is one of the most watched and read news outlets in Mexico.“Really, Milenio? This is the level of ‘discourse’ that you promote on your channel? I am embarrassed for having interacted with you during my tenure as United States ambassador to Mexico,”Landau wrote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All once possessed unassailable power – then were undermined, in some cases wiped out, by the march of new technology.“Speed and stealth and firepower,” the head of the Australian Submarine Agency, Jonathan Mead, told the Guardian two years ago of Australia’s forthcoming fleet of nuclear submarines. “The apex predator of the oceans.”But for how much longer?In the first quarter of the 21st century, nuclear submarines have proven a formidable force: essentially undetectable deadly attack weapons. Some also carry a vital “second-strike” deterrent effect: any attack on a country armed with nuclear-powered submarines is made with the knowledge that retaliation is certain – from a warship hidden beneath the waves.The lethal legacy of Aukus nuclear submarines will remain for millennia – and there’s no plan to deal with itRead moreBut a drumbeat of declarations – much of it speculative, but most of it from China, the very nation the Aukus pact was established to counter – report rapid developments in submarine-detection technologies: vast networks of acutely sensitivesonar arrays;quantum sensing; improved satellite tracking able to spot tiny perturbations in the ocean’s surface; technologies thatdetect minute disturbancesin the Earth’s magnetic field; real-time AI processing of vast reams of data.Could emerging technologies render the last opaque place on Earth – the oceans – transparent?It may not be so binary. The oceans may become, in parts, less impenetrable: key contested sea lanes and littoral areas may be intensely surveilled, while remote, deep trenches remain arcane.Forecasting a future conflict is fraught. But the consequences for Australia, having dedicated an extraordinary $368bn towards itsAukusnuclear submarine fleet, are immense: will the apex predator of today become the prey of tomorrow?One brutal assessment put it in stark terms: Australia’s fleet of nuclear-powered submarines may end up being “billion-dollar coffins”.Q&AWhat is Aukus pillar one?ShowPillar one of the Australia-UK-US (Aukus) agreement involves Australia being given the technology to command its own fleet of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. There are two stages:• First, Australia will buy between three and five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US, the first of these in 2032. But before any boat can be sold to Australia, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that the US relinquishing a submarine will not diminish its navy’s undersea capability. The US submarine fleet now has only three-quarters of the submarines it needs (49 boats of aforce-level goalof 66). And there are significant concerns the US cannot build enough submarines for its own needs, let alone any for Australia.• Second, by the “late 2030s”, according to the \"optimal pathway\" outlined in Australia’ssubmarine industry strategy, the UK will launch the first specifically designed and built Aukus submarine for Britain’s Royal Navy.The first Australian-built Aukus submarine, for the Royal Australian Navy, will be in the water “in the early 2040s”. Australia will build up to eight Aukus boats, with the final vessels launched in the 2060s.Each of Australia’s nuclear submarines is forecast to have a working life of about three decades. Australia will be responsible for securing and storing the nuclear waste from its submarines - including high-level nuclear waste and spent fuel (a weapons proliferation risk) - for thousands of years.Aukus is forecast to cost Australia up to A$368bn to the mid-2050s.Photograph: Colin Murty/AFPWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Underwater arms raceThere is anarms race under wayunderwater, dedicated to perfecting the technologies that can find submarines, and finding new ways to keep them hidden.Vast resources are being poured into improving detection technologies and developing new ones: drones, sonobuoys, satellites, magnetometers, quantum sensors. All seek to shrink the spaces where submarines can hide.Everything is being monitored: the tiniest disturbance in waves across vast stretches of ocean, fractionally altered sea temperatures, faint magnetic disturbances, bioluminescent trails – each could give a tiny clue to a submarine’s path. Combined, they could reveal precisely where it is.Allied to the extraordinary data-processing power of artificial intelligence, these present a formidable threat to submarines’ invisibility. AI programs are able to cut through the “noise” of masses of information, spotting unseen patterns or finding connections between disparate pieces of data, imperceptible to a human analyst.Much of the technological advancement is being driven byChina.Submarines, made of metal, cause tiny distortions in the Earth’s magnetic field as they move through the water, changes increasingly detectable to sophisticated magnetometers.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailLast year a research team fromShanghai Jiao Tong University reportedthe development of a new seabed sensor able to detect the faint electromagnetic waves generated by a rotating submarine propeller from nearly 20km away, about 10 times the previous detection range.And in a peer-reviewed study published in December, researchers in Xi’an claimed to have developed an airborne magnetometer that cantrack the persistent trace of a submarine’s magnetic wake.Quantum sensors, which can detect infinitesimally small perturbations in the environment at an atomic level, promise even greater sensitivity and accuracy.In April scientists from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said they had developed a drone-mounted quantum sensor system that could track submarines with pinpoint accuracy. They claim thecoherent population trappingatomic magnetometer is as sensitive as theMAD-XR systemused by Nato countries but far cheaper, and so able to be deployed at a massive scale.These are the technologies that are known about but, as Dr Anne-Marie Grisogono of Flinders University points out, if an adversary had a technology to accurately detect submarines, would it tell anyone?The arms race is, of course, accelerating on both sides – designers are working on counter-detection measures to make submarines ever more covert: anechoic tiles to defeat or confuse sonar; cooling systems to weaken detection by thermal imaging or infrared detection by satellites; “degaussing” submarines to reduce magnetic signatures; and using pump-jet propulsors to produce less wake.‘We should be asking bigger questions’Grisogono was a co-author of the 2020 reportTransparent Oceans, which argued that by the 2050s – as new Australian Aukus boats continued to be sent to sea – nuclear submarines “will be able to be detected in the world’s oceans because of the evolution of science and technology”.She told Guardian Australia this year: “The likelihood that the oceans will become transparent at some time is basically 100%, it’s just in what time frame.Aukus will cost Australia $368bn. What if there was a better, cheaper defence strategy?Read more“And they could become transparent much sooner. We’ve seen tremendous advances in artificial intelligence ... an accelerant for all of these detection technologies that we are seeing developed.”Grisogono argued that it may not be one technology that renders submarines detectable. She can envisage a future of “underwater meshes of networked sensors” using different technologies, all of which are expendable and none of which is critical to the network functioning.“It’s an adaptive mesh of cheap components, and importantly, it’s a distributed system, so you can’t really take it out,” she said. “You can lose quite a lot of them and still have a functioning network … and it’s cheap.“If your defensive system is really cheap and can take out really expensive assets from your opponent … the advantage is now to the defence, not to the attack.”Grisogono said Australia should use the opportunity before too much is committed to Aukus to re-evaluate its capacity, not to fight a war in 20 years but in 30, 40 or 50.“We should be asking bigger questions about our defence posture,” she said. “I think acquiring these nuclear-powered submarines really only makes sense if you’re wanting to contribute and join into much bigger conflicts in the region with the US.“Perhaps when the decision was first taken, the logic of Aukus might be defensible in some way. But does that still stand up now?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With each one about the size of a minibus, they can be deployed from warships or launched off the coast.The Guardian asked the defence minister, Richard Marles, whether the investmentwas a “hedge”against a future where crewed submarines were detectable.“We are very confident about Australia’s future submarines being fundamentally critical to Australia’s military capability,” Marles responded, saying the Ghost Sharks would “complement” crewed nuclear submarines.“While there’s a whole lot of advancements in technologies about detecting submarines, there’s also a lot of advancements in technologies around making submarines harder to detect, and we are really confident about … giving Australia a highly capable, long‑range submarine capability in the future.”Standing alongside the minister, Australia’s chief of navy, V Adm Mark Hammond, said he believed crewed submarines would grow more stealthy as efforts to detect them strengthened.“I’ve heard about ‘transparent oceans’ since I qualified in submarines 31 years ago, and nothing’s really changed: every advancement in detection capability is usually met by an advancement in encounter detection capability and increased stealth.”The land and the air were “completely transparent”, Hammond said, “and no one has stopped building ships and aircraft.”“My personal belief is that the undersea battle space will continue to be increasingly congested, increasingly contested – but ultimately that is the most opaque environment on the planet, and I believe that our allies and partners will continue to enjoy the capability advantage in that space.”Detectable equals destroyableAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.Prof Peter W Singer, a strategist at the New America thinktank, cites Arthur C Clarke’s famed third law.He tells the Guardian that the rapid pace of change across technological domains, accelerated by developments in AI, makes predicting future developments – especially beyond the span of a human or technological generation – increasingly fraught.Australia’s first Aukus submarines are scheduled to be in the water in the 2040s. They will still be under construction into the 2060s.“Twenty years is a very long time when it comes to technology … what’s a generation for undersea warfare: is it every 30 years? Every 15 years? Every 10 years? We’re talking about a pretty substantial period of time,” Singer says.An accelerating trend is “greater observation of the battlefield, and the worry that once stealthy systems might be detectable”.“If they’re detectable, they’re destroyable,” he says.Surface tension: could the promised Aukus nuclear submarines simply never be handed over to Australia?Read more“Military leaders around the world are wrestling with this – whether they are in the ADF, Nato, the US Navy, Marine Corps – there’s a trend where essentially the apex predators are looking around and wondering if they are now the prey.”The Marianas Trench – largely uncharted and reaching depths beyond human exploration – might remain unknowable, Singer says, but key sea lanes in the South China Sea could be intensely surveilled.He cites the cold war example of the GIUK Gap – naval choke points in the North Atlantic – which was populated by a battery of hydrophones designed to detect the passage of Soviet submarines.Singer predicts that undersea warfare of the future will not be a battle between crewed submarines but between hybrid fleets of new technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles, potentially working in concert with crewed subs. UUVs will be far cheaper and expendable in comparison with traditional submarines.The terrestrial equivalent is Ukraine’s revolutionary use ofcheap but lethal armed dronesto counter Russia’s invasion. Expendable drones worth a few hundred dollars a unit are taking out tanks that cost tens of millions, halting entire offensives.“The uncrewed systems are not all going to be like a pet on a leash, they’re going to be increasingly operating on their own,” Singer says.“So you may have some physically large systems that need to go long distances and carry massive payloads, but you may also have smaller systems, maybe with less range but, because they’re smaller, they’re cheaper, and you can essentially fill the battle space with them.”The upshot is a balancing act, Singer says – accepting that decision-makers have neither a perfect view of the future nor an unlimited budget.“I am not saying ‘don’t buy Virginia Class’ or ‘don’t buy Aukus’,” he says. “I think they do bring value. The question is how much of a bet do you want to make?”Explore more on these topicsAustralian militaryAukusWeapons technologyAustralian foreign policyOceansNuclear powerChinanewsShareReuse this content"

We can create new homes for the next generation while maintaining the beauty of local communities and having a vibrant, exciting place to live.“At the moment, we are so far behind. Sydney is the 800th densest city in the world. It doesn’t mean we’re going to turn into Tokyo overnight – no one is suggesting that. But there is a halfway house where we can have appropriate development in the right spot.”Parramatta Road isa boulevard of broken dreams, with previous ambitious and visionary plans stalling, leaving the Victorian-era shops, small factories and car yards that line the 23km road increasingly decrepit.In 2001, landscape architects McGregor Coxallwon an international design competition run by a consortium of councils.It proposed mid-rise along the road and installing a light rail – turning it into a largely car-free, pedestrian-friendly boulevard. However, fears that the light rail would lead to more congestion on the main artery halted the idea.In2017, the previous Coalition government rezoned several areasfor medium-density builds of about six storeys. But the costs of consolidating sites from terrace-style, Victorian shops appeared to deter development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is in addition to the 31,000 new homes in its Fairer Future plan, which the council is proposing as an alternative to the government’s transport-oriented development (Tod). Fairer Future focuses on higher densities around Ashfield and Petersham.The Inner West mayor, Darcy Byrne, said: “Our Inner West community wants to see more desperately needed new homes delivered and local people are telling us that the Parramatta Road corridor is the right location for higher residential densities.”View image in fullscreenThe Inner West Parramatta Rd rezoning map, showing Leichhardt and Camperdown.Photograph: NSW government“By partnering with the government to build more homes on Parramatta Road, we can give more of our young people and essential workers a place to live in the inner west, and make sure that increased density is distributed fairly across our whole community,” he said.The government has already declared eight projects along Parramatta Road as “state significant” through theHousingDelivery Authority. On one government-owned site – the WestConnex dive site – it has agreed to 20 storeys in return for 500 units, including 200 affordable homes for key workers.Greater densities at Homebush and North Burwood have also been approved to deliver up to 19,600 homes.“We will look at tranport as part of the rezoning,” Byrne said, but noted that “complicated transport solutions” like the proposed light rail had caused earlier plans to stall because of concerns they might worsen congestion on Parramatta Road.The minister for planning and public spaces, Paul Scully, said: “Parramatta Road needs more homes and jobs in vibrant communities. It’s a major transport corridor that connects so many communities to the city but it can be so much than a tired thoroughfare”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsNew South WalesSydneyHousingnewsShareReuse this content"

Election analyst Ben Raue called the win for Labor two hours after the polls closed.It is unusual for a government to gain a seat in a byelection, but Raue said Labor had more incentive to work harder for the victory.

I will continue to be the leader. It’s about the best representative for Kiama … It’s about electing someone who will take the toughest fight up to the government.”But it had been suggested that if the Liberals had a two-party-preferred result in the low 40s, or worse, then Speakman would be in trouble.

On Wednesday multiple Russian drones had crossed into Poland, prompting Nato to send fighter jets to shoot them down, underlining long-held concerns about theexpansion of Russia’s more than three-year warin Ukraine.Nato announces more air support to defend Poland against future Russian incursionsRead moreThe Polish military’s operational command posted on X during the afternoon that ground-based air defence and reconnaissance systems were on high alert.It stressed “these actions are preventive in nature” and were aimed at securing Poland’s airspace and protecting the country’s citizens. It cited a threat of drone strikes in regions of Ukraine borderingPolandbut didn’t give further details.The prime minister, Donald Tusk, posted that “preventive air operations” had begun in Polish airspace because of the threat posed by Russian drones operating over nearby areas of Ukraine.The Polish Air Navigation Services Agency said Lublin airport was closed to air traffic “due to military aviation activities” and the government security centre warned of a threat of air attack affecting several border counties in the region.Emergency UN security council meeting convened after Russian drone incursion into PolandRead moreLater on Saturday, the military’s operational command wrote on X that the operation “has been completed” and that ground-based defence and reconnaissance systems had returned to normal.Russia has said it didn’t target Poland on Wednesday, and Moscow’s ally, Belarus, said the drones went astray because they were jammed.But European leaders have expressed certainty that the incursions were a deliberate provocation by Russia.Polish aircraft have been scrambled repeatedly in recent months to patrol the country’s airspace in connection with Russian airstrikes in Ukraine but those strikes have usually occurred overnight or in the early morning.Also, on Saturday Romania – which shares a border with Ukraine – said a Russian drone breached its airspace.Romania’s defence ministry said the breach by a drone came during a Russian attack on infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine.After the Nato member scrambled two F-16 fighter jets late on Saturday to monitor the situation, the aircraft “detected a drone in national airspace” and tracked it until “it disappeared from the radar” near the village of Chilia Veche, said a ministry statement.AFP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsPolandEuropeUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

The production site sustained minor damage, and a fire broke out, which is currently being extinguished,” he added.View image in fullscreenThe fire at Bashneft’s Novoil refinery.Photograph: X.comA source in Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence agency claimed responsibility for the attack.Since Moscow launched its full-scale military offensive in Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has responded with attacks on Russian refineries in an attempt to curb the Kremlin’s ability to fund the conflict.A wave of Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries over the summer hit processing capacity at several key sites and pushed up prices at the fuel pump.The Kremlin described Bashneft’s Ufa refining complex in 2016 as “one of the largest in the country”, saying it produced more than 150 types of oil products.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

My only hope is the European institutions. Giorgi is now Ivanishvili’s personal prisoner. I ask, for someone to help, please”.Bachiashvili fled Georgia earlier this year after falling out with Ivanishvili, the honorary chair of the country’s ruling party, for whom he worked as a “right hand man” for a decade.At the time that he skipped the country for Abu Dhabi, Bachiashvili was on trial for allegedly stealing $42m (£31m) in cryptocurrency from the billionaire politician.Bachiashvili, who vehemently denied the allegations,claimed in an interview with the Guardianfrom his hideaway in the Gulf state that the prosecution was punishment for his outspoken criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.He further claimed that Ivanishvili – who has guided a shift away from the west and towards Russia – may have concluded he was a western spy.Transparency International has described the case against Bachiashvili as being “devoid of both legal and factual grounds”.Soon after the interview, Bachiashvili was seized outside a hotel where he had been meeting his lawyer by men who said they were from Interpol.He was taken to a police station in Abu Dhabi and then on to Dubai. Within 48 hours, the then 39-year-old was deported without a hearing via a Georgian Airways flight with a bag over his head, his lawyers claim.Bachiashvili alleged that one of the five other passengers on the flight to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was the head of Georgia’s security services.He was taunted during the flight for his belief that he could escape lvanishvili’s reach, his lawyers claim.The Georgian government subsequently issued a press statement in which it claimed it had found and arrested Bachiashvili near the border with Armenia and Azerbaijan.Ramazashvili said that she had not been allowed to speak to her son since June but that she had learned from his lawyers that he had been badly beaten in his cell on 11 July, two days before his 40th birthday.A man who did not appear to be a prisoner had repeatedly smashed Bachiashvili’s head against the wall and bit him on the shoulder. During the altercation, he briefly lost consciousness, it is claimed.“They are trying to break him every day,” said Ramazashvili. “They even have new rules. The parliament adopted a law that if someone is found guilty of financial misconduct the authorities can ban him from leaving the country for 16 years.”Bachiashvili is facing 11 years in jail after being convicted of stealing the cryptocurrency but the prosecution is seeking to add further years to his sentence for absconding.Prosecutors are also seeking a further jail term for Bachiashvili’s alleged negligence in overseeing a state investment in a hydro-power station. Ivanishvili has separately launched a civil case against him.Ramazashvili said it had been through treating Ivanishvilli and his family as patients that her son was first introduced and then began working for the businessman who at the time had companies in Russia.She said: “As a person, he was very normal, very kind. I cannot tell anything bad about him, or of members of his family, for that. Because of this, I thought that Giorgi will be very safe … This is my greatest mistake in my life.”Georgia continues to have aspirations to join the EU and it has recently submitted a response from Brussels demands for a series of reforms after claims that the country was sliding into autocracy.Ramazashvili, who is now living in the US state of Alabama, said she had been left bereft and that her only hope was that international institutions, such as the European court of human rights or the UN would intervene.“I have nothing inside,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaCryptocurrenciesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He accompanied them to the hospital. While there, he said that he heard from family in the village that nine Israeli soldiers had stormed his home.The soldiers asked his wife, Suha, for his whereabouts and went through her phone, he said, while his nine-month-old daughter was at home. They also briefly detained one of his uncles, he said.As of Saturday night, Adra said he had no way of returning home to check on his family, because soldiers were blocking the entrance to the village and he was scared of being detained.No Other Land film-makers denounce Trump’s Gaza plan: ‘A crazy thing’Read moreIsrael’s military said soldiers were in the village after Palestinians had thrown rocks, injuring two Israeli civilians. It said its forces were still in the village, searching the area and questioning people.Adra has spent his career as a journalist and film-maker chronicling settler violence in Masafer Yatta, the southern reaches of West Bank where he was born.After settlersattacked his co-director, Hamdan Ballal, in March, he told the AP that he felt they were being targeted more intensely sincewinning the Oscar.He described Saturday’s events as “horrific”.“Even if you are just filming the settlers, the army comes and chases you, searches your house,” he said. “The whole system is built to attack us, to terrify us, to make us very scared.”Another co-director, Yuval Abraham, said he was “terrified for Basel”.“What happened today in his village, we’ve seen this dynamic again and again, where the Israeli settlers brutally attack a Palestinian village and later on the army comes, and attacks the Palestinians.”No Other Land, which won an Oscar this year for best documentary, depicts the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.View image in fullscreenNewly erected mobile houses set up by Israeli settlers near the Palestinian village of Umm al-Khair in the Masafer Yatta area, south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank seen in August 2025.Photograph: Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty Imagesallal and Adra made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Abraham and Rachel Szor.The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as whenMiami Beach proposed ending the lease of a cinemathat screened the documentary.Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 six-day war, along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, while the western-backed Palestinian Authority administers population centres.The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled.About 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards – and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There also has been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Thirteen more were killed in a separate operation in South Waziristan district.The incidents underline the strugglesPakistanfaces as it tries to contain the resurgence of militant groups.The country has faced a rise in attacks in recent years, most claimed by the PakistaniTaliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.TheTTP calls itself the world’s biggest jihadist front, and has committed a number of high-profile attacks including the attempted murder of the peace activist Malala Yousafzai, the murder of Pakistan’s former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the attempted bombing of Times Square in New York.The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 emboldened the TTP, and gave militants a haven over the border from where they can conduct operations against Pakistan. This has led to a deterioration of ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.The Pakistani military urged the Taliban government in Kabul to “to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against Pakistan”.The military described the dead militants as “Khawarij” – a term referring to a radical sect that emerged during the early years of Islam, which the government uses for the TTP. It alleged the militants were backed by India though provided no evidence.Pakistan has long accused India of supporting the TTP and separatists in Balochistan, which New Delhi denies. There was no immediate comment from the Taliban in Kabul or from New Delhi.Saturday’s attack was one of the deadliest in months in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP once controlled areas of territory. Last month the Pakistani military launched a“targeted operation” against militants in Bajaur, a former stronghold, which displaced tens of thousands of people.Explore more on these topicsTalibanAfghanistanPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Marchers were arrested for a range of offences, including affray, violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage.The crowds were addressed by Elon Musk, who dialled in via video link and spoke of “the rapidly increasing erosion of Britain”, beforecalling for the dissolution of the UK parliament.The French far-right politician Éric Zemmour was also invited to speak. He told protesters they were subject to “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture”, adding that “you and we are being colonised by our former colonies”.The huge turnout meant attenders could not be contained within Whitehall, the endpoint of the march, where the rally was being held. The swelling numbers resulted in clashes with police with the Met saying officers “faced unacceptable violence” after being “assaulted with kicks and punches. Bottles, flares and other projectiles were thrown.”1:19Aerial footage shows scale of 'unite the kingdom' rally – videoAbout 5,000 counter-protesters from trade unions and anti-fascist groups marched in a separate route in central London.Large crowds displaying union jack and St George flags had been drifting into central London since the early morning in anticipation of the rally.Shortly before 1pm, people began marching across Westminster Bridge. The crowd, which was largely white, sang “Keir Starmer’s a wanker” to the tune of Seven Nation Army and broke into chants of “Tommy”, “Whose street? Our street” and “England”. Some also held signs in support of Tommy Robinson.On the approach to Whitehall, stalls sold books co-authored by Robinson titled “Manifesto: Free Speech, Real Democracy, Peaceful Disobedience” and “Mohammed’s Koran: Why Muslims Kill for Islam”.One elderly woman in a wheelchair, who travelled to attend from Merseyside with her son, held a sign with Charlie Kirk’s face on it with the words: “God bless, never forget”.“I’m British through and through; this is our capital,” she said. “I had to be here today for our country.”Her son added: “I feel our country is being inundated with the ideology which is trying to suppress and suppress us and I just want our country back.”The pair said they were “followers of Tommy Robinson and what he stands for”, adding the “establishment just want him out”. They denied it was a far-right event, saying their attendance was a “patriotic visit”.The mother said when she was a child in Liverpool, she “lived amongst neighbours from Africa, Pakistan; we were all one. It’s not about race, this is the government just overcrowding our country.”Carol took the coach from south Wales to attend the rally. She said she was there because “we need to unite the kingdom basically, it just seems to be so divided. We just need to come together, all of us.” Elaborating on this, she said: “It seems to be one half can say ‘I do what I want’, and the other half have to watch everything they do.”She held a sign that read “Change my mind: RIP Charlie”, referencing Kirk’s open-invitation college campus debates. She said she “probably picked up on him about a year ago” after he came up on her social media feed.When asked what she thought of Robinson’s involvement in the rally, she said: “When I first heard of him in 2017, the consensus and opinion around him was that he’s a bad un.” Since then, “having looked more into what he does”, she said: “He’s doing really well. He’s changed a lot of minds.”Whitehall quickly became so full that it was closed to marchers before the first speakers even took to the stage, leaving thousands stuck on Westminster Bridge and in Parliament Square.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People stood on bus stops and portable toilets to get a better view of the stage.One man waved a sign saying: “Why are white people despised when our tax money pays for everything?” Another had a placard that said: “Call centres: speak English.”The rally began with music. Members of the Destiny Church in New Zealand performed a traditional haka dance for the protesters, which was followed by a song with the lyrics “Making the west look like the Middle East”. They then displayed the flags of the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State and Palestine to boos from the crowd, before tearing each of them in half to loud cheers.Robinson then took to the stage and said “Britain has finally awoken” and that “this is never going away”. He claimed that British courts ruled that the rights of undocumented migrants supersede those of the “local community”, referring to Epping council’s failed case against the Home Office.“They told the world that Somalians, Afghanis, Pakistanis, all of them, their rights supersede yours – the British public, the people that built this nation.”He then played a video that included images of convicted members of a grooming gang followed by a video of a white woman crying.Elon Musk, speaking by video link, told the crowd: “I think there’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration.”“A failure by the government to protect innocent people including children who are getting gang-raped. It’s unreal the government has failed in its duty to protect its citizens, which is a fundamental duty of government.”Zemmour, who came in fourth place in the first round of the 2022 French presidential election, told the crowd in French, which was translated for the audience, that the “freedom of our peoples is in danger”.At the anti-fascist march, the MP Diane Abbott told a crowd that Tommy Robinson’s allies “are some of the most anti-women forces in society”.She said: “They are trying to drag women into their project, they are claiming that they are protecting women, but they are some of the most anti-women forces in society – they oppose equal pay, they oppose action against discrimination, they belittle sexual harassment as banter.“So we are here to stand together, we are here to fight, and we are here in the certainty that we will defeat the fascists.”A Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said police faced a “wholly unacceptable” level of violence. He said an investigation had begun and the force was working to identify suspects involved in disorder.He added: “There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence. They confronted officers, engaging in physical and verbal abuse and making a determined effort to breach cordons in place to keep everyone safe.“The violence they faced was wholly unacceptable. Twenty-six officers were injured, including four seriously – among them broken teeth, a possible broken nose, a concussion, a prolapsed disc and a head injury.”Explore more on these topicsProtestFar rightTommy RobinsonLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

You can’t – we don’t have another four years, or whenever the next election is, it’s too long.“Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.”This is not the first time Musk has involved himself in British politics. He started a war of words with the UK government over grooming gangs and also criticised 2023’s Online Safety Act, calling the legislation a threat to free speech.He had a warm relationship with Nigel Farage, and there were even rumours he could channel a donation to his party before the Tesla boss called for the Reform UK leader to be replaced during a dispute over his support for Robinson.Musk told the crowd in central London: “My appeal is to British common sense, which is to look carefully around you and say: ‘If this continues, what world will you be living in?’1:19Aerial footage shows scale of 'unite the kingdom' rally – video“This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn’t get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. They don’t want that, they’re quiet, they just go about their business.“My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You’re in a fundamental situation here.“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”View image in fullscreenKatie Hopkins with Tommy Robinson at the ‘unite the kingdom’ rally in central London on Saturday.Photograph: Lucy North/PAMusk also told the crowd “the left are the party of murder”, referring to thedeath of Charlie Kirk.He said: “There’s so much violence on the left, with our friend Charlie Kirk getting murdered in cold blood this week and people on the left celebrating it openly. The left is the party of murder and celebrating murder. I mean, let that sink in for a minute, that’s who we’re dealing with here.”He also criticised what he called the woke mind virus and said decisions for advancement should be on merit rather than “discrimination on the basis of sex, or religion or any race or anything else”.View image in fullscreenFlares are thrown as police try to hold back the crowd at the rally.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/EPAHe said: “A lot of the woke stuff is actually super-racist, it’s super-sexist and often it’s anti-religion, but only anti-Christian, like why anti-Christian? That’s unfair … that should be all that matters, the woke mind virus, that I call it, is against all that.”More than 110,000 people were estimated to have taken part in the far-right street rally, in what is thought to be one of the largest nationalist events in decades. The marchers were faced by about 5,000 anti-racist counter-protesters.In addition to Musk, figures including Katie Hopkins and French far-right politician Éric Zemmour were invited to speak at the event.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsElon MuskProtestFar rightTommy RobinsonLabourLondonThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

The society added: “We emphasise that these are his personal views and not those of the Union, nor do they represent the values of our institution.“At the same time, we are deeply disturbed by and strongly condemn the racial abuse and threats that George has faced in response. No individual should ever be attacked because of the colour of their skin or the community they come from. Threats to his life are abhorrent. Such rhetoric has no place online, or anywhere in society.”The statement went on to defend the right to free speech and freedom of expression, but added that free speech “cannot and will not come at the expense of violence, intimidation, or hate”.“The Oxford Union does not possess executive powers to summarily dismiss a president-elect. However, the complaints filed against the president-elect have been forwarded for disciplinary proceedings and will be addressed with the utmost seriousness.“Our duty is to demonstrate to our members, the university community, alumni, and the wider public, that disagreement must be expressed through debate and dialogue, not through abuse or threats. That is the tradition we uphold, and it is the standard we will continue to set.”On Thursday, Abaraonye said he had “reacted impulsively” to the news of Kirk’s shooting, and that the comments were “quickly deleted” after news emerged of his death.“Those words did not reflect my values,” Abaraonye added. “Nobody deserves to be the victim of political violence … I extend my condolences to his family and loved ones.“At the same time, my reaction was shaped by the context of Mr Kirk’s own rhetoric – words that often dismissed or mocked the suffering of others. He described the deaths of American children from school shootings as an acceptable ‘cost’ of protecting gun rights. He justified the killing of civilians in Gaza, including women and children, by blaming them collectively for Hamas. He called for the retraction of the Civil Rights Act, and repeatedly spread harmful stereotypes about LGBTQ and trans communities. These were horrific and dehumanising statements.”Kirk and Abaraonye had met during a debate on toxic masculinity held by the Oxford Union in May, the Telegraph reported. Donald Trump, the US president,paid tribute to Kirkas a “martyr for truth and freedom” after the shooting.Valerie Amos, the master of University College, Oxford, said on Friday that no disciplinary action would be taken against Abaraonye by the college he attends.Amos said: “Though Mr Abaraonye’s comments are abhorrent, they do not contravene the college’s policies on free speech, or any other relevant policy. Therefore, no disciplinary action will be taken.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of OxfordCharlie Kirk shootingnewsShareReuse this content"

His crackdown on Democratic-led municipalities has fueled legal concerns and spurred protests, including a recent demonstration by several thousand people in Washington DC.Democratic leaders have said that the massive deployments are more a show of power by Trump rather than a serious effort to fight crime.More than a dozen residents of Shreveport,Louisiana, told Reuters they viewed any deployment as more of a political stunt than a meaningful crime-fighting solution – and a way for Trump to blunt criticism that he’s only targeting Democratic-controlled states.Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, is Republican. The mayors of Shreveport and Baton Rouge, two of Louisiana’s most prominent cities, are Republicans. But the mayor of New Orleans, the state’s best-known city, is a Democrat.A Pentagon spokesperson did not comment in detail on the documents. A spokesperson said: “Leaked documents should not be interpreted as policy. We will not discuss these plans through leaked documents, pre-decisional or otherwise.”‘It’s not safe in DC as an immigrant’: racial profiling surged during Trump’s Washington takeoverRead moreThe planning documents, according to the Post, state that the plan would allow the military to supplement law enforcement in cities such as New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Both cities have majority Black populations.The Pentagon’s plan outlines a mobilization lasting until 30 September 2026, though no start date was specified.Among the documents is an unsigned, undated draft memo from Pentagon chiefPete Hegsethto US attorney generalPam Bondiand homeland security secretaryKristi Noem, which highlights the “unique advantage” of the military’s proposed approach to law enforcement in Louisiana, according to the Post.Hinging on a request for troop deployment from Landry, who is a staunch Trump supporter, the proposal has not been confirmed as approved by federal or state officials, according to the Post’s reporting. The Pentagon’s Louisiana plan suggests a robust operation is under consideration, with national guard personnel “supplementing” the law enforcement presence in high-crime neighborhoods. They could also help with drug interdiction and by providing “logistical and communications support” to local authorities, the Washington Post reported.On Friday, Trump said he would send national guard troopsto Memphis, Tennessee.Explore more on these topicsLouisianaTrump administrationUS militaryUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday, Poland rejectedDonald Trump’s suggestion that the incursions could have been a mistake, a rare contradiction of the US president from one of Washington’s closest European allies. Its foreign minister told Reuters that Poland hoped Washington would take action to show solidarity with Warsaw.

I’m going to make you wish you never opened your mouth.”Republican congressman Clay Higgins said in apost on Xthat anyone who “ran their mouth with their smartass hatred celebrating the heinous murder of that beautiful young man” needed to be “banned from ALL PLATFORMS FOREVER”. The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, saidon the same sitethat he had been disgusted to “see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action”.Republicans’ anger at those disrespecting Kirk’s legacy contrasts with the mockery some of the same figures – including Kirk – directed at past victims of political violence, Reuters reported.For example, when former House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, was clubbed over the head by a hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist during a break-in at their San Francisco home shortly before the 2022 midterm elections, Higgins posted a photo making fun of the attack. He later deleted the post.Loomer falsely suggested that Paul Pelosi and his assailant were lovers, calling the brutal assault on the octogenarian a “booty call gone wrong”. Speaking to a television audience a few days after the attack, a grinning Kirk called for the intruder to be sprung from jail.“If some amazing patriot out there in San Francisco or the Bay Area wants to really be a midterm hero, someone should go and bail this guy out,” he said.Loomer and Higgins did not return messages to Reuters seeking comment.Scott Presler, a far-right activist with2.3 million followers on X, asked for tips about teachers “celebrating Kirk’s death” – and he has shared posts and social media profiles of alleged wrongdoers, including details of their workplaces,Time reported.In Florida, the state’s board of education issued aproactive memorandumspecifically warning school employees not to post any personal viewpoints that “may undermine the trust of the students and families that they serve”.Two educators in Clay county wereremoved from their classroomsand placed under state investigation on Thursday, one an elementary school teacher who posted to her personal social media account an article about the shooting, and the words: “This may not be the obituary we were all hoping to wake up to, but it is a close second for me.”The other, a high school counselor, alluded in a post to Kirk’s position, expressed in 2023, that it was “worth it” to have “some gun deaths every single year” to protect the “God-given right” of gun ownership.The counselor wrote, “37 years in public education, ready to take a bullet for my kids. No I’m not shedding a tear, he chose to sacrifice himself for the rights [to] be protected. Karma’s a bitch.”The comments were “egregious” and “hateful”, Jennifer Bradley, a Republican state senator, said in a statement.Arguably the most prominent individual to lose employment was Matthew Dowd, a veteran political analystfired by MSNBCfor suggesting on air that Kirk’s radical rhetoric may have contributed to the violence that killed him.“Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” Dowd said, adding: “You can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and then not expect awful actions to take place.”The network and Dowd issued separate apologies. But ina Substack articlepublished Friday, Dowd said he was the victim of a “rightwing media mob”, and that his words had been misconstrued because he spoke before knowing Kirk was the target or had been fired upon.Most of those who have been fired or suspended, however, are people in regular jobs whose comments displeased their employers or were otherwise exposed. They include aSecret Service agentwho said Kirk “spewed hate and racism on his show” and “you can’t circumvent karma”.The Carolina Panthers, an American football franchise,fired a communications coordinatorwho asked on Instagram: “Why are y’all sad? Your man said it was worth it,” another reference to Kirk’s previous comments on the constitution’s second amendment, guaranteeing Americans the right to bear arms.A reporter covering pro basketball’s Phoenix Suns lost his job for posting comments including: “Truly don’t care if you think it’s insensitive or poor timing to decline to respect an evil man who died.”Trump declines to call for unity after Charlie Kirk killing in stunning moveRead moreA New Orleans firefighter wasreportedlythrust under investigation by her employer after posting – then deleting – a social media comment that called the bullet that struck Kirk “a gift from god”.Delta Air Lines announced it had suspended employees over “social media content related to Kirk’s killing that the company judged to have gone “well beyond healthy, respectful debate”. According to a statement signed by Delta’s chief executive officer Ed Bastian, the suspensions would remain in effect pending an investigation, and the company made it a point to say “violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination”.Separately, American Airlines issued a statement on social media saying “employees who promote such violence on social media were immediately removed from service”.“We will continue to initiate action with team members who display this kind of behavior,” American Airlines’ statementsaid.The Hillgave numerous other examplesof workers, including nurses, university employees, and others, fired or disciplined for their comments.

It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumersRead moreThe last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.For now, theUS economyisn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.AfterDonald Trump’stariffswere announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June wererevised downby 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation ratehit2.9%, the highest since January.Inflation chartBrett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.Trump’scrackdown on immigrationhas cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes toprices, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.Investors are banking on hopes theFederal Reservecutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell,outlinedthe “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reportedRead more“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down.Inflationwent down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”Oneanalysisfrom Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.jobs chart“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.The Yale Budget Labestimatedthat Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and hasclaimedthat recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump tariffsInflationEconomicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The document appears to counter other documentation that Cook’s critics have cited in support of their claims that she committed mortgage fraud by reporting two different homes as her primary residence, two independent real-estate experts said.US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumersRead moreReuters was unable to reach Cook for comment. She has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing regarding her properties, which also include a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and an investment property in Massachusetts.Administration officials led by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have used mortgage documents from her Atlanta and Michigan properties to accuse Cook of claiming both as her “primary residence”. The allegedly false claims of residence, which could improve mortgage and tax implications for a homeowner, led Pulte to refer the matter to the Department of Justice, prompting a federal investigation and an order by Donald Trump to dismiss her.Cook, who remains at the Federal Reserve, has sued the president to resist her dismissal. Reuters was unable to determine whether Pulte or administration officials are aware of Cook’s Atlanta loan estimate. Spokespeople at the FHFA, the agency led by Pulte, did not respond to a request for comment.The documents cited by Pulte include standardized federal mortgage paperwork which stipulates that each loan obtained by Cook for the Atlanta and Michigan properties is meant for a “primary residence”. But documentation reviewed by Reuters for the Atlanta home, filed with a court in Georgia’s Fulton county, clearly says the stipulation exists “unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing”. The loan estimate, a document prepared by the credit union, states “Property Use: Vacation Home”.The document appears to help Cook’s case, said two real-estate experts who aren’t involved in representing her. That’s because it indicates that during the loan-application process, she told the lender she intended to use the property as a vacation home.The lender, Washington-based Bank-Fund Staff Federal Credit Union, did not respond to a request for comment.In another point that could help Cook’s case, she never requested a tax exemption for the Georgia home as a primary residence, according to property records and a Fulton county tax official.A separate document reviewed by Reuters, related to a federal form completed by Cook as she obtained security clearance for her role at the Federal Reserve, shows that in December 2021 she also declared the Atlanta property as a “second home.” Though unrelated to the mortgage, the declaration on that document, a supplement to a US government national security form known as SF-86, is consistent with the claim on her Atlanta loan summary.Surrounding the accusations against Cook is a battle over Trump’s effort to wield more control over the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States and an independent institution meant to be free of political meddling. Trump has often criticized Fed governors because of their reluctance to cut interest rates since he returned to the White House earlier this year.Amid the controversy, the personal finances of other government officials and their families have also come into question by rival politicians, the media and others.Last week, Reuters reported that Pulte’s own father and stepmother had declared two homes in two different states as their primary residence, prompting a town in Michigan to remove a tax exemption for their home there and charge the couple for back taxes. Pulte and his parents didn’t respond to requests for comment about the matter.Explore more on these topicsUS newsFederal ReserveUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Smoke swirls amid the gloom. Foul odours belch from the sulphurous earth. The landscape echoes to howls and grunts and screams. A great light has gone out and all that remains is confusion and fear. Everywhere coaches and managers, hunched under their doubts, scuttle hither and thither, desperately seeking a path through the wilderness.From his very first season at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola’s way of playing football has been dominant. The effectiveness of his philosophy was so obvious and so pervasive that there is not an elite manager now who has not in some way been influenced by his philosophy, even if they are not, as many are, overt disciples.‘Not good enough’: Haaland hits out at Manchester City’s form before derbyRead moreBut as the near-universal acceptance of his methods fractures, as other Premier League sides turn away from or adapt Pepism towards approaches based on counterattacking, set plays, players who run with the ball or a more direct style, the result is a profound uncertainty. Belief recedes to leave a wasteland of possibility.The environment is akin to England after the reliance on W-M and the winger was shattered by Hungary in 1953, or 19th-century Europe after scientific discoveries had provoked the crisis of faith. If none of the previous assumptions are true, if we cannot trust the old doctrine, how do we know what is right?This is the world that produced Charles Darwin and Friedrich Nietzsche and had Arthur Conan Doyle attending seances and believing in fairies, just as managers in the 50s started trialling strike pairings and back fours and had the Doncaster manager Peter Doherty assigning players with random numbers to spread confusion. Nobody knows what is true any more, and the consequence is a chaotic world of experimentation.That sense of uncertainty may help explain why this was a summer dominated by the striker carousel, as large numbers of clubs sought a classic No 9, or at least the modern interpretation of that: a big player with pace, technically accomplished and capable of running the channels, a complete centre-forward in the mould of Didier Drogba or Hernán Crespo. As faith goes, what could be more comforting than reducing football to its most fundamental act, scoring goals? Never mind the process: a striker who can guarantee 20 goals a season assures a side of at least some measure of achievement.Football has never known a moment quite like this before. Pepism is probably the most hegemonic style the world has known. It helped that he arrived just as background conditions were perfect for his style, as pitch technology improved to the point that first touches could be taken almost for granted, the liberalisation of the offside law increased the effective playing area and a crackdown on intimidatory tackling allowed technically gifted but diminutive midfielders to flourish.The game was ripe for Guardiola-style innovation, but his ideas spread as they did because football has never been as globalised, never been as scrutinised. There has never been such an agglomeration of the world’s best players at such a small array of clubs, nor such focus on them.View image in fullscreenComplete centre-forwards like Didier Drogba are back in vogue.Photograph: Scott Heavey/Action Images/ReutersFor 15 years or so, the world has accepted this is the most effective way to play. Even the hard-pressing of the German school and the Guardiola style, which could at one point reasonably be pitched as a way of playing based on regaining possession against a style that prioritised its retention, came in the end to an accommodation.Which raises one of the paradoxes of Pepism, which is that it is so diverse as to be almost indefinable. Certain fundamentals can be identified: pressing, a high line, the use of possession for control, a suspicion of dribbling and long-range shots, a preference for the low cut-back over the booming cross from deep, and a paranoia related to the height of the line about the danger of being countered against.But Guardiola is not a dogmatist in the way many of his followers are: he is flexible, forever innovating and tinkering. He likes a 3-2-5 defensive structure out of possession, but has achieved that in various ways over his career: one full-back overlaps, the other covers across; both full-backs push up, a central midfielder drops between the central defenders; a full-back inverts and tucks into midfield as the other covers across; the back four comprises central defenders but John Stones steps into midfield to create the second holder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although both have developed along their own paths, they offer a snapshot of where Pepism was at the moment they set out alone: Maresca comes from the days of control through possession; Arteta from the era of four central defenders across the back. A tactical assessment of the elite is like a vertical tasting of Pepism.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta’s use of four central defenders was picked up from Pep Guardiola.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAlthough Guardiola had previously worked with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robert Lewandowski, the signing of Erling Haaland, a pure striker who shows little interest in or capacity for engaging with the midfield, represents the greatest rupture. The creative tension between his demand for directness and Guardiola’s cautious instincts brought the treble but may underlie the present problems.The ostracism of Ederson andsignings of James Trafford and Gianluigi Donnarumma, neither of whom has the sweeping capabilities Guardiola has demanded of his goalkeepers, feel like another step towards orthodoxy (or, depending who actually authorised the signings, perhaps towards City’s post-Guardiola future). Just as politics undergraduates have become used to answering the question: “Was Karl Marx a Marxist?” it may soon seem reasonable to ask whether Guardiola is any longer a Pepist.But then Guardiola – paradoxically and in obvious contrast to his opposing manager on Sunday, theManchester Unitedmanager, Ruben Amorim – has always been a pragmatist. He has always been willing to tweak and adapt; evolution, arguably, is itself essential to Pepism, which is perhaps to conclude that Pepism is ultimately so mutable as to resemble Peronism, a vast array of competing ideas whose one defining principle is their origin in one man.And for now, afterCity’s two defeatsin their first three league games, that one man seems just as lost in the wilderness, just as baffled as to which path to take next, as everyone else.Explore more on these topicsPep GuardiolaInside footballManchester CityManchester UnitedcommentShareReuse this content"

After all, nothing else seems to have made Graham Potter’s dreadful side realise that marking opponents at set-pieces is a good idea.It was another shocker for West Ham, erasing any advances made during theirvictory over Nottingham Foresttwo weeks ago. They are languishing in 18th after conceding 11 goals from their first four matches and it was hard not to feel their latest humiliation in a London derby will only increase the yearning for the kind of boardroom bloodletting recently witnessed at Tottenham, who should probably keep in mind that there was no kinder start to life without Daniel Levy than by visiting the London Stadium.No wonder anti-board protests are planned for West Ham’s home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace. It is an utter mess. West Ham are winless in seven home games while Potter has lost 13 of his 24 matches in charge. “The second half we make a mistake for the first goal,” the manager said. “It becomes an uncomfortable second half. I understand the frustration.”West Ham v Tottenham: Premier League – liveRead moreSpurs cruised as they continued their fine start under Thomas Frank. Xavi Simons marked his debut with an assist for Pape Matar Sarr’s opener, Lucas Bergvall scored a peach shortly after West Ham lost Tomas Soucek to a red card and the only consolation for Potter was that the visitors eased off after Micky van de Ven made it 3-0 in the 64th minute. “A good, clear win,” Frank said. “A good performance. We haven’t won here for six years. Now we won 3-0.”Members of the Lewis family were in attendance for the first game since Levy’s removal as chair and were perhaps mulling over an interesting lineup from Frank before kick-off. The Dane utilised his squad by resting Rodrigo Bentancur and Richarlison after their exertions during the international break, started Simons on the left and deployed Mathys Tel up front despite leaving the Frenchman out of his Champions League squad.Perhaps it would have played out differently if Lucas Paquetá had given West Ham an early lead. Using Paquetá as a false nine did not work, though. Potter defended his decision not to use Callum Wilson after his excellent cameo against Forest, saying the striker is still building his fitness.View image in fullscreenJarred Gillett shows a red card to Tomas Soucek.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPASpurs were largely untroubled. They were faster and sharper in every area, particularly with Mohammed Kudus on a mission to show West Ham what they lost in the creative department when he left for £54.5m last summer.The barracking of Kudus from the home fans was no surprise but the winger did not hide. He was a constant threat on the right and thought that he had a deserved assist when he saw an early corner headed in by Cristian Romero, only for the goal to be disallowed for a push by Van de Ven on Kyle Walker-Peters.Spurs were dominant as half-time approached, pushing West Ham back, stifling the ponderous midfield of Soucek and James Ward-Prowse. The pressure rose – hardly encouraging the hosts were banking on Konstantinos Mavropanos and Max Kilman holding firm in central defence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spurs crowded the far post as Simons delivered a corner from the left but West Ham did not react. Sarr did not even have to jump as he headed past Mads Hermansen.It was West Ham’s fourth concession from a corner this season. What a feeble team. Soon they were down to 10 men, Soucek ripping one of João Palhinha’s socks after taking a heavy touch and lunging into a challenge with his studs up.That was as close as West Ham got to putting up a fight. Soon it was 2-0, Romero lifting a gorgeous ball over the top, Bergvall making a late run from midfield and looping an audacious header over Hermansen.Bergvall was excellent in an advanced role. He made the third, teeing up Van de Ven to fire in a low shot. West Ham gave up.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone.The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black.Florian Wirtz is a sure bet at Liverpool but Newcastle are gambling on Nick Woltemade | Philipp LahmRead moreSo maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn’t a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn’t been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president’s special friendDonald Trump.Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. It is apparently “a misconception” that the US might be a hostile or dangerous place for non-white visitors, which is no doubt a relief for all concerned. TodayI feel like a concerned black African football tourist. But you know what? With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it’s all fine, so carry on.You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino’s assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation.But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter:Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it’s finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0.It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. A museum, you say? Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? But this was a museum devoted entirely to the works of Cristiano Ronaldo, its official title the CR7 Life Museum, which certainly sounds like the best museum, a very tall, very handsome museum.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo scored three times in the international break, making it 141 goals from his 223 games for Portugal.Photograph: Vincenzo Orlando/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockAnd as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic,Portugalare in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. The last time Ronaldo played in America was a summer tour game for Real Madrid in 2014. The last time he was photographed there was in 2016.This is a significant development. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has nowcollapsed into legal chaos, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows.What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. So presumably there must be a good reason.Ronaldo has never commented on this. There are no charges, and certainly no convictions. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered ano-admission no-guilt payoffto make the whole thing stop.The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. None of which means Ronaldo’s presence in the US wouldn’t have been met with protests, bad publicity, a reigniting of some kind of action. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. No pics, no talkshow stuff, no temporary deal with the Kansas City Wangdoodles.View image in fullscreenFifa president Gianni Infantino has courted Donald Trump since he was elected in the US, with the World Cup coming up across North America next year.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersAnd now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let’s face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump likes winners. Trump likes vibey, wealthy masculine guys. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won’t go away. Trump technically even has the power to offer a legal pardon, even to a foreign national, even before any charge is made, or likely to be made.Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner).And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy.For those who have followed his astonishing professional existence it is also a chance understand a little more clearly what Ronaldo is, which is still slightly mysterious. In many ways football has still not really come to terms with the magnificent monster it has built.Ronaldo is arguably the most famous person in the world, already the most followed person on Instagram ahead of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, God, authentic human feeling and diverse Kardashians. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name.He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo last played a game in the US back in 2014, during Real Madrid’s pre-season tour, when they took on Manchester United in Michigan.Photograph: Melanie Maxwell/APFor all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Clearly he is a magnificent footballer. But still. Why the state of outright worship? Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? To understand this is to understand the internet, and the strangely intimate nature of online fame.Ronaldo is perfect for the internet. He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. Ronaldo has mastered his routines, his intake, accumulated wealth spectacularly. As a facial signifier, a human logo, he has that indefinably moreish quality of the online hyper-famous. Lots of people are handsome. Ronaldo is handsome in a way that is always him, a face, a six-pack, a flaring neck you just have to click on.What does he look like? A perfectly glazed wedding cake figurine. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain’s ball. An avatar of human immortality made out of marzipan, yeti-sperm and greed.This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I’ve always been worried I wouldn’t be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it’s very respectable.”Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIs that what it is? Orderliness in a crazed and dysfunctional world. Devotional perfection. Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else. And now he has a chance, should the stars align, to breach the final consumer frontier, to conquer America decisively next summer, decks finally clear and with a president on hand who will be very interested in any hint of a brand-building collab.Call me cynical, paranoid, conspiracy-prone but it seems inconceivable there hasn’t been some kind of pre-chat, a feeling-out, a focus-grouping of what it may mean, optics-wise, good and bad, finally to get Ronaldo on that stage.There are so many strange and manipulative aspects to America’s public contortions right now, so many aspects that seem out of control, leading right into a World Cup where even the logo looks mildly sinister, a strange black cancerous date stamp oozing out from beneath that iconic, throbbingly veined golden trophy. Ronaldo to America just feels like a very natural extension, the ultra-influencer, here to bring peace, and above all to spread his own version of irresistibly monetised human theatre.Explore more on these topicsCristiano RonaldoWorld Cup 2026PortugalWorld CupUS sportsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

The former Tottenham manager could scarcely have hand-picked a spicier debut assignment. Then reality intervened.ThisArsenalteam are not easily pushed around. They give away next to nothing at the back. They crave control of the ball and the flow of the game. Their mission is to suffocate and punish and they made sure that Postecoglou’s return to north London was as uncomfortable as possible – and not only because of the predictable taunts he heard from the stands.The occasion was illuminated by break-out performance from two of Arsenal’s summer signings. Martín Zubimendi does not score many from his role in front of the back four but here he got two – the first a blockbuster of a volley from the edge of the area, one to draw involuntary gasps as he finessed the technique. The second was a header. When he slapped his forehead during the celebrations, there was an element of both fun and disbelief.View image in fullscreenThe Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou never looked as though he had the answers on his return to north London.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersThen there was Noni Madueke, who was given a standing ovation when he was withdrawn towards the end. The winger was positive throughout, always looking to make something happen, and perhaps the greatest compliment to pay him was that he made light of the injury-enforced absence of Bukayo Saka. To think that some Arsenal fans were against him coming to the club.Forest were well beaten, Viktor Gyökeres scoring in between Zubimendi’s goals, Postecoglou never looking as though he had the answers. There is so much for him to do to instil his ideas at Forest, given how stark of a contrast he is to his popular predecessor, Nuno Espírito Santo. This was an inauspicious start.Mikel Arteta had needed something afterArsenal’s defeat at Liverpoolbefore the international break and the managerial change at Forest did not help his preparations. Unknowns always annoy Arteta, even if he had to think that Postecoglou would not tinker too much. There had simply not been the time.Arteta’s big selection call was to stick with Mikel Merino in midfield; Declan Rice was among the substitutes and the rotational move advertised the greater depth that Arsenal have these days. They need it because the injuries have started to accumulate. Once again, Martin Ødegaard was forced off early in a game, with a recurrence of his shoulder problem.View image in fullscreenMartín Zubimendi fires Arsenal into the lead with a showstopper drive on 32 minutes.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAArteta replaced him with Ethan Nwaneri and for the manager, it was all about plotting a way through in the final third, working those intricate triangles; nothing long. The goal would come, Arteta told himself, as his team looked in danger of being a little overelaborate in the opening 30 minutes; their tempo generally the same. When the goal did arrive, it was a showstopper.The crowd had started to sing the name of Madueke as he went to take a corner, which he had won after a jet-heeled burst and pull-back for Jurriën Timber. Murillo dived in to make the saving block and at great personal cost. He hurt himself and would be forced off.Before Murillo departed, Zubimendi enjoyed his moment. Madueke’s corner was half-cleared to the edge of the area and Zubimendi’s connection on the dropping ball was impossibly sweet, the volley fizzing past Matz Sels, whose line of sight was blocked by Elliot Anderson and Murillo. There looked to be a slight deflection.Madueke was quick and direct, the ball always under his spell. He tormented the left-back, Morato, whom Postecoglou had started because of an injury to Ola Aina – it was the manager’s only change to Nuno’s last Forest lineup. Postecoglou moved Morato into central defence after Murillo had limped off, asking Neco Williams to swap sides and address the Madueke problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gibbs-White worked a give-and-go with Chris Wood before shooting wide in stoppage time, but that was it from them.Arsenal did not create much themselves before the interval. There was a clear chance on seven minutes for Merino after a set piece fell kindly for him; Sels made a fine block. But there was the sense that Arteta’s team had higher gears into which to move.View image in fullscreenMartin Ødegaard struggles with a shoulder injury after landing heavily, which forced him off in the first half. He was replaced by Ethan Nwaneri.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesEberechi Eze had a few nice moments off the left on his full Arsenal debut and it was his assist that helped to provide the cushion early in the second half. Riccardo Calafiori went long for him, which was a major break to what had gone before from Arsenal, and Eze’s low cross was made to measure for Gyökeres.Arsenal were indebted to David Raya shortly afterwards. Dan Ndoye led a rare Forest break and his cross looped off the chest of Wood and looked to be dropping in over the goalkeeper. Raya extended his fingertips to brush the ball on to the bar. On the second phase of the move, Cristhian Mosquera jumped into a saving challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi. It was Raya’s 42nd clean sheet in 100 appearances for Arsenal. A couple of words, too, for Mosquera, who filled in for the injured William Saliba. Imposing, assured.Arteta’s team turned the screw. Gyökeres smashed a shot against the outside of a post from an acute angle and Rice, whom Arteta did introduce, almost stretched to meet a low Timber cross. Zubimendi’s header after a cross from another substitute, Leandro Trossard, gave the scoreline a deserved gloss.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Bedford! Bedford,” some roared, punching the air as the horse, jockeyed by Michael Fundi, broke into a gallop on the home stretch, passed the leader, and stormed to victory.Fundi, who had started the day on top of the jockey standings, was crowned the season’s champion after the last race. At 20, he was the youngest in a decade.View image in fullscreenAbove: Michael Fundi with Bedford after winning the 2400m Jockey Club Stakes George Drew Challenge Series.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Kenya’s former president Uhuru Kenyatta presents the champion jockey plate to Fundi. Far right: Fundi speaks with former champion James Muhindi (L) in the weighing room before the 1200m Alico Limuru Cup race.“This is one of those feelings that you can’t put in words,” he beamed in the parade ring after his award presentation.Fundi embodies the growing involvement of black Kenyans in horse racing, changing perceptions of a sport that has been synonymous with the country’s white minority since the British colonial era.“Growing up, that was a sport for other people, not me,” said Muturi Mutuota, who, like many other children in Nairobi in the 80s and 90s, was taken to the racetrack by his parents at weekends.Now, Mutuota, who is in his 40s, is a director at the Jockey Club of Kenya, which operates and regulates the sport. At this year’s Day of Champions, three of the seven trainers were black, as were 10 of the 13 jockeys.View image in fullscreenHorses cross the finish line.Raised in Nairobi by his grandparents, Fundi fell in love with horse racing when his grandfather started taking him to Ngong when he was 13. His grandfather persuaded Steve Njuguna, a former champion jockey and a trainer at the time, to teach Fundi how to race.Fundi briefly worked as a groom before starting racing when he became eligible – at 16 – coming last in his first race and winning in his fifth. The 2024/25 season, his fifth, was his best.The newly diverse scene, he said, has increased competition for jockeys and trainers.Black trainers are making their mark too.Joe Karari, 41, was one of those with horses racing on the Day of Champions.View image in fullscreenAbove: Joe Karari with a horse at his stables at Ngong Racecourse.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: The kit room at Karari’s stables. Far right: A groom washes a horse at Karari’s stables after training.Born and raised near the racetrack in western Nairobi in what he describes as a household of horse lovers, he used to visit the venue with his family to cheer racehorses belonging to his uncles. After completing college, he spent a lot of time in stables, getting a job as a groom and work rider under trainer Oliver Gray.He learned the ropes for five years and became a trainer in 2006, since when he has built his portfolio from six horses from one owner to 26 horses from 70 owners, including syndicates.A perennial runner-up for the champion trainer title, Karari finally won it in the 2024/25 season with five meetings remaining, becoming the first black Kenyan to win it in a decade.Karari is mentoring other black yard workers to become trainers. “This game is here to stay. And it belongs to everyone,” he said after a morning training session a few days before the last meet.View image in fullscreenJames Muhindi, a former champion jockey, checks the race card in the weighing room.The owners of the horses that Karari trained in the 2024/25 season embody the evolving landscape of upper-class Kenyan society. They number among them foreigners, and whiteand black Kenyans. “It’s a mix of all sorts of people here,” he said.K Bakor, a 54-year-old Kenyan businessman who joined the sport as a horse owner in 2022, is also helping diversify it by giving jockey opportunities to young, black stable workers. “We need to get a new generation,” said Bakor, who used to ride donkeys in races in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu, where he was born.Horse racing was introduced in Kenya in the 19th century, with venues opening up in different parts of the country as the sport grew in popularity. But now, Ngong Racecourse, which opened in 1954, is the only racetrack left.During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s in Kenya, the sport attracted thousands of spectators. However, its fortunes dwindled over time to a point a few years ago when, with near-empty stands, it was struggling to survive years of steady decline attributed to dwindling sponsorship and mismanagement.Now the situation is improving with more local participation.View image in fullscreenCrowds in the grandstand before a race.The sport had always been dominated by white people, but in recent years, as increasing numbers have left the country, their places have been taken by black Kenyans who had access to horses, stables and training facilities through working in support roles such as groom work.At the members’ lounge above the grandstand after the last race of the Day of Champions, Mutuotaacknowledged the need for change and for the club “to have an open mind for racing to succeed”.“We have to shed the traditional mentality that we’ve held on to,” said Mutuota, one of two black members of the club’s eight-person executive committee.The jockey club is making attempts to revive horse racing through partnerships.Kabir Dhanji, creative director at Kivuli Creative, an agency that the jockey club partnered with in 2023 to rebuild and grow the sport, said his company is treating horse racing as “a modern sport”. That has entailed marketing, advertising and social media content creation, as well as the introduction of pop-up restaurants and bars on the site, and between-race entertainment offers such as music and acrobatics.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFaces in the crowds at Ngong Racecourse.Dhanji said the agency wants to make horse racing inclusive, family-friendly, accessible and “a sport for Kenyans by Kenyans”.“The sport may have had a problematic past – not intentionally – and this was associated with colonialism, oppression, suppression, repression,” he said. “And Kenyans don’t want to be associated with that. They want to be able to come and express themselves.”The efforts are paying off. At Ngong on the Day of Champions, the grandstand was packed with a multiracial mix of young and older spectators. On the turf next to it, spectators strolled about in sunglasses and colourful clothes. A little further away, parents watched their children bounce on inflatable castles. And elsewhere, punters sat glued to TV screens, monitoring their bets. By the last race, there were 5,000 people in attendance. Many stayed on for an afterparty that went late into the night.“It’s become an event, and this is fantastic news,” said Michael Spencer, a British businessman who, alongside his wife, Sarah, is a benefactor of the jockey club and own a stud farm in central Kenya. “Now I’m not worried about the survival (of the sport). I just want to see it prosper, be more successful.”View image in fullscreenHorses gallop down the final straight in a race.The club will have to work harder, though, to maintain the momentum and retain talent. Professional jockeys earn £23 a ride. For the Day of Champions, there was about £4,000 up for grabs in total prize money for seven races. Some jockeys have in recent years relocated to Europe in search of the better pay they can get by exercising racehorses.Sitting on a bench with his friends at the top section of the grandstand, David Mukuria, a 48-year-old construction worker who has been attending meets for about 15 years, was delighted that Fundi had emerged champion jockey.“We feel happy when many black people are involved in the sport,” he said. “It shows that Africans have risen.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayHorse racingKenyaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fixed planes of movement. Positive metrics. Data victory. Safety in order. Strength through no joy. This is all good stuff. This is a matrix for winning at sport. This is how Mikel Arteta has transformedArsenalfrom a flapping bead curtain made up of fun guys and leftovers into a hugely impressive team. You can definitely come second in the league like this.But then there are other things, the need for a little blood and a little risk. Attack ships off the shoulder of Orion. Very positive underlying numbers in the first halfagainst Liverpool. All these moments will be lost if the moments are not also seized, if a little ragged edge doesn’t enter the programme too. Or in the case ofthis 3-0 defeat of Nottingham Forest, a little bit of unprocessed Gyökeres.Martín Zubimendi’s zest a bitter pill for Postecoglou as Arsenal batter ForestRead moreOn a sunny, drizzly, breezy day, Arsenal strolled through a game they might at other times have struggled to win with this degree of ease. Best of all they did so with some interesting notes of variation, most obviously in the shape of Viktor Gyökeres, who was blunt and a little rough at times, but by the end had some great numbers.Seven passes in 90 minutes. Four shots. One goal. Also: zero dribbles, zero crosses, zero key passers, zero all that stuff. You could quibble and ask for some fouls, but those will come. It felt, even before his goal, just the right kind of bluntness in a team where the challenge for Arteta has been to usher in more of those moments where the brakes slip, where the birds fly backwards through the sky.This was a very good game for him, sparked by a front-loaded selection, and made even better by the contrast between a first half that felt at times like the football equivalent of watching someone build a Lego replica of Paddington Station.The second half served up four key moments between minutes 45 and 51, perhaps even key moments in Arsenal’s season. They were up by that point, the goal was a sublime hip-high volley from Martin Zubimendi, which may sadly under the Arteta “magic moments” scale (Szoboszlai coefficient) have to be scrubbed from the record.The first of those acts was a hard, flat punt from David Raya that ended up skimming out of play, but was also Arsenal’s first long pass from the back. The second, 47 seconds into the half, was a beautifully simple goal. Riccardo Calafiori flighted another pass down that flank. Eberechi Eze took the ball with a lovely cushioned touch and squared it.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta’s Arsenal cruised through a game they might at other times have struggled to win with this degree of ease.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APIn fairness, Gyökeres had to that point spent much of the game running around a like a stray dog in the school playground at morning break. But he was in exactly the right place, doing just the right thing. He scored easily. The PA announcer got to scream “VIKTOR … VIKTOR … VIKTOR”. It was a goal Arsenal might not have scored previously, three passes, the sort of goal teams this good should just rack up as a matter of course.On 51 minutes, the third unusual thing happened and this was also good because it involved some chaos. Calafiori gave the ball away high upfield with no one behind him. A Forest cross hit Chris Wood in the chest and looped goalward. Raya made a brilliant save, pushing it on to the bar. From the loose ball Cristhian Mosquera made a forensic goal-saving tackle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe just let him do it. Take a chance. Allow individual brilliance to happen, this time in defence. Arsenal have not conceded a goal from open play with Mosquera on the pitch. Who knows what it means. But he is very good at tackles and blocks.It is worth dwelling on Gyökeres a little. On 58 minutes, he summoned up the fourth big thing, combining with Eze on the left, running across to the far right and whamming a shot on to the post from a narrow angle, a silly place to shoot from also a great place to shoot from because it is exactly that this team has needed.Forest were cautious. The question before the game had been how would the players cope with Ange Postecoglou’s free-form nose flute jazz. On this evidence: by sitting very deep in much the same way. But Arsenal did find a way to beat that low block. The full-backs strolled into midfield. Noni Madueke treated his full-back like a spilled yoghurt pot in aisle seven to be tactfully avoided.Best of all Gyökeres did that simple thing well. The greatest pre-criticism of his signing was that he is Not an Arteta Player. But this is a good thing. Arsenal already had plenty of those. Gyökeres has been called a donkey, but this is also good. They already have enough robot parcel delivery droids. Kai Havertz, underrated as a central striker, may come in for the more fine-margin games. But the season also contains a lot of days like these and here was one of them ticked off.Explore more on these topicsArsenalNottingham ForestanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Italian rolled the dice and his team surrendered two points. “We try to win every game but know we won’t win every game,” he said, after victory was denied in the closing seconds.Brentford, despite changes of personnel and manager, remain motivated, dangerous. Keith Andrews’ team closely resembled the Thomas Frank era in the dedication and spirit they maintained to the last kick. After Moisés Caicedo’s pile-driving goal, Chelsea’s second, they kept going. Robert Sánchez was soon asked to make a scrabbling save from Dango Ouattara. That would not be the last of them.Tottenham humiliate 10-man West Ham to deepen gloom of home fansRead moreIn the 95th minute, Fábio Carvalho bundled home, Chelsea’s defenders allowing the substitute to tap in unmarked at the back post from a Kevin Schade long throw. “It’s a useful tool,” said Andrews of Brentford’s not-so-secret weapon. “Any coach should look to find advantages. It’s been here for numerous years, it’s not new to us. I felt there’s a little bit of snobbery in the game around scenarios like that, but if the big boys now do it then it seems to be accepted.”Chelsea’s initially unfamiliar lineup had stuttered. With Cole Palmer short of fitness, and Bayern Munich and Old Trafford to come, the loanee Facundo Buonanotte was handed the No 10 role, after a hat-trick in a behind-closed-doors fixture at Cobham. Brighton, his parent club, have never got to the bottom of the Argentinian’s talent. He lasted just 45 minutes at the Gtech. “He needs time,” said Maresca, seeking to calm the waters of a disappointing denouement. “It’s a shame but it happens,” he said. “Probably we could manage that moment of the game better.”Wesley Fofana at right-back when Reece James and Malo Gusto were both on the bench seemed a ploy to avert Brentford’s set-piece threat while Jorrel Hato standing in for Marc Cucurella at left-back was another experiment with disappointing results. A half-time rethink was required.Quick GuideKey statsShow• All six of the Premier League goals that Brentford’s Fábio Carvalho has scored have been in the 75th minute or later, witheach of his last four coming in the 89th minute or later.• Carvalho’s equaliser was the seventh goal Brentford have scored from a throw in the Premier League since the start of last season,atleast five more than any other side.Stats by OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maresca suggested this was all planned: “Always Fofana we plan 45 minutes for him. Hato is similar. Buonanotte the last period has not been great for him knowing he has to go somewhere. Overall they were OK. I think we deserve to win the game in the second half.”Within five minutes of his second-half arrival, Palmer volleyed in to level Schade’s opener but would rue two later misses. “Cole was not fit to play until the second half,” said Maresca.View image in fullscreenCole Palmer equalises for Chelsea after coming off the bench.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesIgor Thiago’s early booking was unhelpful for a Brentford striker who has led the division in what statistical wonks term high-intensity pressures in the final third but Chelsea still found him a wholly awkward customer. His partner, Schade, after missing a penalty at Sunderland, made no mistake when sent away by Jordan Henderson to slot past Sánchez. “Kevin’s pace is just sensational and he’s constantly growing in confidence,” said the approving Andrews.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thomas Tuchel was watching, given otherwise slim pickings, with just English two starters on either team of which Keane Lewis-Potter and Jamie Gittens are uncapped. Henderson gets through plenty of pointing, in lieu of the engine that once carried him through many kilometres of long-distance chasing. But the passing radar is retained, judging by that Schade goal. “What you have seen tonight is Jordan,” said Andrews. “He relishes the battle.”Emiliano Martínez denies Everton as Aston Villa’s scoreless run continuesRead moreMaresca’s half-time changes had Cucurella, James and Tyrique George replacing Hato, Fofana and Buonanotte as Chelsea eventually found some zip. Palmer’s rest lasted until the 55th minute. His goal, his first non-penalty Premier League one since January, was struck coolly, after João Pedro laid Enzo Fernández’s ball up. A second, in only his second game back after the Club World Cup, ought to have come in the 75th minute, but a side-footed slap from Pedro Neto’s pass did not deceive the commanding, outstanding Caoimhín Kelleher. Further rustiness was shown in a late scuff after Brentford’s equaliser.Still, Maresca’s gamble appeared to be coming off. Alejandro Garnacho, within six minutes of his Chelsea bow, had supplied the bullet from which Caicedo scored. Game over?

We have a lot of new guys in there. We have a lot of players trying to feel their way in an environment that’s really difficult to feel their way into. Really, really difficult.View image in fullscreenLawrence Shankland pumps his fist after scoring the opening goal against Rangers.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA“So we just have to make sure they’re alright as human beings first and improve their performance. But there’s anxiety at the moment. The players are not the same team we see in training on Thursday and Friday when they go out and play in this environment right now. And that’s not a criticism of anyone. But we have to just keep working.”Martin has previously stressed that he has the support of the Ibrox board and asked if it was still the case, the former Southampton manager said: “I don’t know. We’ll see, won’t we? They’ve been great up until now. All of them. So we’ll see.”Asked how difficult it is to work when the fans are so vociferous, Martin spoke of his players being “scared” and said: “It doesn’t affect me personally. Professionally it’s difficult because we need the team to play in a certain way that requires certain things.“And it’s really difficult when the atmosphere is how it is. It’s aimed towards me, not towards the players.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I didn’t like that today. It’s so unfair on a manager, I don’t like it at all. He is a fine man, he’s a fine manager and when results don’t always come, at clubs, especially clubs this size, it’s more than just the manager for me. That is tough on him.“It’s early on in the season. He’s a new manager and likewise with myself, I am just in at Hearts and if we were still sitting towards the bottom end of the table and integrating loads of players and trying to kind of implement what we want to do, you’d be asking for that understanding.

A spectacular goal it was too – “one in 10,000” – that settled a largely excitement-free affair and it didn’t come from a home player but Marco Silva couldn’t care a jot. You couldn’t say the same for Leeds’ Daniel Farke and, in particular, Gabriel Gudmundsson.Just when it seemed as if both sides had settled for a point, Kevin, the Brazilian winger signed by Fulham on deadline day, brought the energy that Silva had seen at Shakhtar Donetsk and convinced him to pay £34.6m. His turn and shot produced a flying fingertip save from Karl Darlow. Such were the slim pickings, that in itself was one of the game’s highlights.Newcastle 1-0 Wolves, Fulham 1-0 Leeds, Rangers 0-2 Hearts and more: football clockwatch – liveRead moreThe ensuing corner by Sasa Lukic was not threatening in the least but Gudmundsson, under no pressure, stooped and met the ball with such force that Darlow had no chance of preventing the own goal that flew in from 12 yards out. It was Farke who called it “one in 10,000”.While the manager did his best to compliment his players on their efforts, crestfallen does not do it for Leeds, whose miserable run in the capital stretches to nine consecutive Premier League defeats, back to May 2022. When the fixture list came out, two games in London in the early part of this season might have sent shivers down Farke’s spine. Their last game before the international break was theirhammering at Arsenal.Farke’s assessment of the defeat and, in particular its manner, was stark. “Football is cruel.” As for how Gudmundsson was feeling, Farke said he would need to give his Sweden defender “a little hug”.For Silva there was the warm afterglow of not only a new player showing his worth immediately but also a well-timed substitution. Fourteen minutes was all Kevin had to play with but he used them well, though Silva thought Fulham had changed the momentum in their favour after a poor first half in which they did not manage a shot on target.He said: “Even before Kevin came in I thought the tempo was different and Sasa Lukic went close. The substitutes came in and made a massive impact. And in moments like this you need players with a different profile, like Kevin. It was a moment for us to push forward more and he did it. Great feeling for us. Of course not a great feeling for Daniel and the boys.” That is, quite possibly, the understatement of the season.View image in fullscreenGabriel Gudmundsson is consoled after his own goal.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAFor the first 45 minutes there had been little warning of the excitement to come. Only Sean Longstaff, after a long free-kick taken by Darlow, had a shot on goal but it cleared Bernd Leno and the Fulham bar.It took until the second half for anyone to test a goalkeeper and it was Leeds who took the initiative. Three minutes after the interval, Anton Stach worked his way down the left and to the byline. He dinked in a cross to Brenden Aaronson and his first-time shot was well saved low to his left by Leno.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having won a free-kick 25 yards out, Harry Wilson, whose move to Leeds fell through on deadline day, curled a free-kick that seemed set for the top corner before Darlow pawed it away. With 20 minutes left, Rodrigo Muniz offered a tame downward header that was easy for the goalkeeper to gather.Silva could see his side were finally stirring but goals have been hard to come by for them this season, with only two in their first three games, even if they had one perfectly good goalruled out at Chelsealast month. With Muniz offering little in attack and not getting enough service from Wilson or Alex Iwobi, they appeared increasingly short of ideas.However Silva does have options on the bench in Adama Traoré, Raúl Jiménez and Emile Smith Rowe but it was Kevin who everyone wanted to see and, in the nick of time, the man from São Paulo duly delivered.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We’ve got match-winners one to 11. There’s a lot of role clarity.“Nights like this are so special. Edgbaston is an amazing place to play. The atmosphere is always great and it felt like a home game tonight. I think the most special thing is playing with your mates and helping them succeed. There is an amazing spirit in this squad and I think we’re going to have a great night!”The final was a battle of T20 big boys – with bothSomersetand Hampshire on their 11th visit to Edgbaston – canny experienced campaigners. Smeed’s 94 off 58 balls had kept Somerset in the hunt to catch Hampshire’s 194 for six, even after Tom Kohler-Cadmore, in sparkling form, was bowled by an 88mph yorker by Sonny Baker – back in the limelight after his England debut. And even in the tricky middle overs as the runs dried up and the clock ticked down – with six overs to go, an imposing 76 were needed.Sean Dickson, in his last game for the club before moving to Glamorgan, was dropped by Scott Currie on seven, a lease of life that proved bad news for Hampshire as he and Smeed dragged Somerset to within 18 runs before Smeed crunched the ball to James Vince on the boundary. The pendulum might have swung, but Lewis Gregory’s sealed the deal with 18 in five balls and an over to spare, to bring Somerset their third Blast trophy – level with Hampshire and Leicestershire – and their second in three years. “We did it the hard way,” said Gregory – but no one minded, least of all the spectators roaring Blackbird in the stands.If Blast finals day hasn’t got the cachet it once had with the rise of the Hundred and franchise tournaments round the world, not to mention the scheduling squeeze, then no one at the ground had told the enthusiastic if occasionally dishevelled crowd, belting out a succession of stadium anthem specials, or the players whose despair, joy or fury was shown on the big screen, and who played entertaining cricket over 11 hours.View image in fullscreenToby Albert anchored Hampshire’s innings with a 48-ball 85.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersIt was the end of a difficult week for Hampshire, who were deducted eight points for an unfit pitch to put them in relegation danger in the County Championship, and learned that they would lose the services of their head coach, Adrian Birrell, after seven years at the club. It had looked their game to lose at the halfway stage after James Vince, with his usual casual rakishness, and Toby Albert, touch-perfect as befits the Blast’s leading run scorer in 2025, gave Hampshire a blazing start in a partnership of 97.They had both slotted fifties in their same over – Vince’s 46th in T20 Blast games – when Vince was caught. James Fuller followed soon afterwards but Albert pressed the accelerator, four times reversing his wrists and reaching the rope, a whirlwind of trick shots until Gregory finally sent him on his way for 85. Benny Howell kept up the momentum and Hampshire finished with the second highest score in Blast history. But it wasn’t quite enough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lynn moved from 78 to 108 in the space of one devastating over, sending Lloyd Pope into a Hollies Stand of ecstatic sombreros and swaying bananas with five successive sixes. He finished 108 not out, hitting every one of Hampshire’s 11 sixes to carry them to a six-wicket Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method win.Somerset romped to a 23-run victory in the first semi final, beating an underpoweredLancashire, with Jimmy Anderson but without England’s Luke Wood, Phil Salt, Jos Buttler and Saqib Mahmood, and the overseas players Ashton Turner (back in Australia) and Chris Green (at the Caribbean Premier League).Lancashire’s chase had hinged on Liam Livingstone, whose disbelief when the third umpire upheld the onfield lbw decision when he was on 29 suggested a tickle of bat. When Lancashire retired out George Balderson only for his replacement Tom Hartley to hit his first ball straight to long-off, the die was cast.View image in fullscreenThe players celebrate Somerset’s third T20 Blast triumph.Photograph: Nigel French/PAExplore more on these topicsVitality Blast T20HampshireSomersetNorthamptonshireLancashireTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Under Erik ten Hag, Amorim’s predecessor, Mainoo was a regular in the XI. The Portuguese was asked how the England international had reacted to being demoted.“He’s not used to fighting for his place, maybe,” Amorim said. “He’s uncomfortable, but he’s a very good kid. He wants to learn. Sometimes it’s hard to push different things from the players.”Altay Bayindir to stay as United No 1 for Manchester derby despite Lammens signingRead moreUnder Ten Hag, Mainoo scored United’s FA Cup-winning goal against Manchester City inthe 2024 final. Later that summer he started England’s European Championship final defeat by Spain. When reminded of this pedigree Amorim pointed to Paris Saint-Germain’s Vitinha, who when on loan at Wolves for the 2020-21 season made only five league starts, as an example to Mainoo.“I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton,” Amorim said of his compatriot. “Nowadays, you can see that Vitinha is maybe the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes.”The coach recruited from Sporting last November continued: “The way I play is completely different from the last manager. I watched a lot of games from the Premier League in Portugal. You can feel then that Manchester United really [played in] transitions. He was the only guy that calmed down the game. Now we have other players that calm down the game.“Sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo. Sometimes, maybe if I start [him] more, Kobbie Mainoo is going to play and he’s going to get hard to take out. I need to go with what I’m feeling at the moment and that is the only feeling. He’s starting the final of the European Championship in a team that has a lot of talented players – [Phil] Foden played that game, [Cole] Palmer was on the bench. He was playing. I know all that, but sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.”United are at City for Sunday’s derby. Pep Guardiola’s side have three points to United’s four but Amorim brushed off whether the Catalan was under the greater pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Lambourn and Sean Levey had, by that point, teed it up perfectly for Scandinavia and Tom Marquand to strike for home two furlongs out, and the proven stamina of the winner of the two-mile Goodwood Cup allowed him to tough it out through the final quarter as Rahiebb and Scandinavia’s stable companion, Stay True, tried and failed to close him down.Marquand was called up for the ride on Scandinavia as O’Brien grappled with a mini-crisis in his team of jockeys, after a season-ending leg injury for Ryan Moore and a 10-day suspension for Wayne Lordan, who rode Lambourn to his Derby success. The fact he had ridden Scandinavia as a two-year-old was perhaps what tipped the balance his way, and the betting market struggled to separate Scandinavia and Lambourn until shortly before the start, when late money sent the former off as the 2-1 favourite.View image in fullscreenThe stamina-laden Scandinavia showed his toughness under a drive from Tom Marquand to win the St Leger.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA“I’ll be honest, I’d have been happy on any of the three, any ride in a Classic is big,” Marquand said. “I rode him as a two-year-old at Newmarket and really liked him, it was one of those when sometimes the stars align, when I rode him that day. Obviously I didn’t think I’d be winning the Leger on him, but it’s nice to ride these horses early when they’re progressing into staying types, as they just take their time to get there.“He’s got the most beautiful temperament [and] he was tough today, it’s a long way up the straight on that ground when you’ve been trying to fend off good horses. He stays extremely well, as he showed at Goodwood, but I thought today was a real show of his tenacity on that ground.”Soumillon, O’Brien’s stand-in No 1 after Moore’s injury, had drawn a blank on his first nine rides for Ballydoyle after his call-up before the first day of Irish Champions Weekend, but his enduring quality emerged aboard Delacroix in the afternoon’s feature event.Soumillon seized the initiative on the turn for home and carved out a decisive advantage before Delacroix showed grit to go with his turn of foot and hold the challenge of Anmaat, the secondfavourite, by three-quarters of a length.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two strides, it was over. He wasn’t there, and the next, he was gone.”Delacroix is now a hugely significant stallion prospect for the Coolmore Stud operation which supplies O’Brien’s ammunition, as he is an outcross from the Galileo and Sadler’s Wells bloodlines that feature in many of the stud’s broodmares. As a result, he is highly unlikely to race on at four and O’Brien did not commit to even a single further outing after Saturday’s success. “It could be,” O’Brien said as to whether it was the horse’s last race. “I can’t tell you how important he is … he has all the options really.”Explore more on these topicsSt LegerHorse racing tipsHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

He sits two behind the Frenchman Adrien Saddier and the resurgent Swede Alex Norén with 18 holes to play. Saddier and Norén are 15 under par.John Daly claims unwanted slice of golf history with record 19 on single holeRead more“We’ll be on a flight. I don’t know,” said Hatton when asked how he may mark success. “There’s a lot of golf left to play. All I want to do tomorrow is play well and give myself a chance.“Winning would mean a lot. When I last played here, in 2023, I finished second and had a putt on the last that I hoped would at least get me in a playoff. I holed it butRyan Fox went and birdied the last. It was still special to finish the week with a full grandstand on 18 and the support I’ve had this week has been amazing again.”Stumbles, surprising ones, from some of the favourites at the head of proceedings have opened this event right up. Ludvig Åberg slipped to a 73, Justin Rose a 76 and Hideki Matsuyama the same. Viktor Hovland’s 71 was excellent in context of his fellow illustrious names. Hovland is three from the lead. There are 18 players within six of Saddier and Norén. Harry Hall, Matt Fitzpatrick and Patrick Reed are notable at minus 10.Had Norén timed this run only slightly differently, he would be a Ryder Cup player rather than a vice-captain. The 43-year-old’swin at the British Masterslast month was his first for seven years on the DP World Tour. A member of the successful European team of 2018, Norén would have been a valuable Bethpage addition in this form.Rory McIlroy has produced 17 birdies in three rounds with his five under par total the consequence of big errors elsewhere. He has played the last two holes in an aggregate of four over par. Saturday included a double-bogey seven at the 17th.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our writers set out the arguments on both sidesBryan Armen GrahamandDonald McRaeSat 13 Sep 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 04.31 EDTShareWhy Terence Crawford will beat Canelo ÁlvarezFor yearsBud Crawford’s name has been synonymous with patience. Denied mainstream recognition and opportunities against name-brand fighters, he kept beating everyone they put in front of him until he’d unified all four titles at junior welterweight. Then he did it again at welterweight with a dismantling of Errol Spence Jr so completeit cemented his placein boxing’s pound-for-pound S-tier alongside Naoya Inoue and Oleksandr Usyk. His gifts are obvious: the ability to switch seamlessly between stances, to read rhythms like sheet music, and to mete out punishment with icy composure once he’s cracked the code.Terence Crawford: from a bullet’s glancing blow to boxing’s biggest stageRead moreCrawford’s scaling of two weight classes for this fight remains the 168lb elephant in the room. All but one of his 41 professional bouts took place at 147lb or below, while Canelo has been entrenched at 168 for nearly seven years and once captured a title at 175. On paper that is an enormous gap. But the leap may not be prohibitive. Crawford’s wiry frame has long suggested he could carry more weight – he’s actually a half-inch taller than Álvarez with a three-and-a-half-inch reach advantage – and reports from camp say he has done so without sacrificing quickness. Just as important, Canelo’s aura of near-invincibility has dimmed. He has not finished an opponent inside the distance in nearly four years. Against elusive opposition (Callum Smith, John Ryder, most recently William Scull), he has been content to bank rounds rather than impose himself. Against slick boxers (Mayweather, Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, Amir Khan for a while), he’s even looked ordinary. If the Mexican superstar is indeed in gentle decline, Crawford is precisely the kind of opponent capable of exposing it.Quick GuideCanelo Álvarez v Terence CrawfordShow•Canelo  v  Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answeredWhat's happening?Terence Crawford, the undefeated American boxer who has won world titles in four divisions from 135lb to 154lb, is moving up two weight classes to challenge for the undisputed 168lb championship held by Saúl ‘Canelo’ Álvarez, the Mexican four-weight champion and the sport's biggest star.Where and when is the fight?The scheduled 12-round bout will take place on Saturday night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, home of the NFL’s Raiders, which is expected to be configured for about 71,835 spectators. It will almost certainly shatter the previous Las Vegas attendance record for boxing: the 29,214 who turned up for the 1982 fight between Larry Holmes and Gerry Cooney at a purpose-built outdoor arena in the Caesars Palace parking lot.The main card begins at 9pm ET (2am BST on Sunday), with Álvarez and Crawford not expected to make their ringwalks until after 12am ET (5am BST).What belts are on the line?Álvarez's undisputed crown at 168lb is at stake: the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles all on the line. Crawford keeps his WBA belt at 154lb whatever happens.Where can I watch it?For the first time in boxing history, a fight of this magnitude will be streamed live globally on Netflix at no additional cost to subscribers. The stream begins at 9pm ET, with undercard bouts leading into the main event.Netflix will offer commentary feeds in English and Spanish. Unlike traditional pay-per-view, which often costs US fans around $90, this one is included in a standard subscription.Who else is fighting?The first six undercard bouts not carried by the Netflix stream will be available free on Tudum starting at 5.30pm ET (10.30pm BST). The entire order of play is as follows:Preliminary card (Tudum, from 5.30pm ET/10.30pm BST)• Serhii Bohachuk v Brandon Adams, 10 rounds, middleweights• Ivan Dychko v Jermaine Franklin Jr, 10 rounds, heavyweights• Reito Tsutsumi v Javier Martinez, six rounds, super featherweights• Sultan Almohamed v Martin Caraballo, four rounds, super lightweights• Steven Nelson v Raiko Santana, 10 rounds, light heavyweights• Marco Verde v Sona Akale, six rounds, 162lb catchweightMain card (Netflix, from 8pm ET/1am BST on Sunday)• Callum Walsh v Fernando Vargas Jr, 10 rounds, junior middleweights• Christian Mbilli v Lester Martinez, 12 rounds, super middleweights• Mohammed Alakel v John Ornelas, 10 rounds, lightweights• Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford, 12 rounds, for Alvarez's undisputed super middleweight championshipWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Canelo’s vulnerabilities are not theoretical. Dmitry Bivol outworked him with straight punches and consistency, underlining his tendency to fight in bursts and give away stretches of rounds. Billy Joe Saunders and Caleb Plant both troubled him before wilting late. Even in victory, Canelo can drift, allowing opponents space to build momentum. Crawford thrives on hesitation. He forces fighters to second-guess, then punishes the pauses with sharp, accurate counters. If Canelo indulges in those lulls, Crawford will turn them into banked rounds and tilt the scorecards his way.Canelo Álvarez v Terence Crawford: all of your pre-fight questions, answeredRead moreIt won’t be easy work. The first time Crawford is hit cleanly by Canelo will be the hardest he’s ever been hit in his life. And while the American has never been down or seriously hurt in a fight, it’s not as if he’s untouchable. Egidijus Kavaliauskas buckled his knees in 2019. Shawn Porter was competitive for the better part of nine rounds. Israil Madrimov had moments of success last year at 154. But those fights only reinforced Crawford’s defining trait: he adjusts midstream better than anyone in the sport. Once he solves the puzzle, he finishes the job. That’s why he strung together 11 straight stoppages before Madrimov – and why many consider him the most ruthless finisher in boxing. The danger he presents is cumulative. The jab grows more authoritative, the body work more telling and the counters sharper until resistance crumbles.Much has been made of the Vegas judges leaning Canelo’s way. Many felt Gennady Golovkin deserved the nod in their first fight,present company included. And the 114-114 card in the Mayweather fight was risible. It’s hard to imagine Crawford taking it out of their hands completely. But if his counters are sharper, his command of distance more telling and his punches more eye-catching, then he could follow the same path to victory that Sugar Ray Leonard took when he climbed to middleweight and outpointed Marvin Hagler in 1987.View image in fullscreenTerence Crawford poses on the scale during Friday’s ceremonial weigh-in.Photograph: Candice Ward/Getty Images for NetflixThe weight may allow Canelo’s power to carry more consequence, especially early, but Crawford’s discipline will matter most. He will not allow himself to be trapped on the ropes or bullied into fighting at Canelo’s pace. Expect a competitive opening, then Crawford gradually asserting control with timing, angles and sharp counters that accumulate on the scorecards. Canelo will have moments, but Crawford’s rhythm and relentlessness will ensure they’re fewer and farther between as the fight goes on.The spectacle will be immense – Allegiant Stadium swollen with 70,000 fans, Netflix broadcasting to millions worldwide – but strip away the noise and this comes down to fundamentals. On Saturday night, I believe Crawford’s timing, adaptability and efficiency will carry him to a close but uncontroversial points win. Whether he gets the decision is another matter altogether.Bryan Armen GrahamWhy Canelo Álvarez will beat Terence CrawfordNext month it will be 20 years sinceSaúl “Canelo” Álvarezmade his professional debut in the historic old Mexican town of Tonalá on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Álvarez had turned 15 three months earlier and his fight purse was 800 pesos – the equivalent of $40.Years laterhe confidedthat “they actually only paid me half of that. The other half was in tickets. I gave all the tickets to my family so I came home with 400 pesos. It seemed a lot.”Álvarez has long been the richest fighter in boxing, with his earnings closing in on a billion dollars, but on Saturday night he will earn the most astronomical purse of his career in a manufactured contest. The greatTerence Crawfordis, essentially, a brilliant welterweight while Álvarez has even been a world champion at light-heavyweight. They will meet at super-middleweight, the natural home for Álvarez in his twilight years. He remains the undisputed world champion at 168lb while Crawford, whose last bout was an unconvincing first performance at 154, is jumping two weight divisions.Álvarez and Crawford face off in breathless blockbuster destined to break recordsRead moreYet their discrepancy in size is balanced by various factors which mean that, despite the contrived match-up, this fight is fueled by enough intrigue and uncertainty to offer it a legitimacy that could never be attached to the embarrassment of Jake Paulsharing the ring with a 58-year-old Mike Tysonin 2024’s equivalent of the most hyped scrap of the year.Álvarez and Crawford are exemplary fighters who carry gravitas and grit, style and substance. Crawford is a master boxer who fights with an ice-cold edge. He has the speed and movement to trouble Alvarez – especially as the Mexican is years past his prime. Alvarez, at 35, is actually the younger man as Crawford turns 38 next month. The Mexican has compiled a formidable 63-2-2 record but he is now a much slower and weathered version of his best self.Álvarez’s ring IQ is matched by his intelligence outside the ring and so it’s little surprise that he has chosen his recent opponents carefully. His courage and resolve have been indisputable against many outstanding fighters – from Shane Mosley and Floyd Mayweather Jr to Gennady Golovkin and Dmitry Bivol. But lately, rather than facing dangerous rivals like David Benavidez, who would have a serious chance of beating him, Álvarez has selected easier opponents.This strategic thinking is one of the reasons why it’s difficult to pick against him. Álvarez has great respect for Crawford’s blistering talent but he seems certain he will be too big and strong for the American.Crawford has a flawless 41-0 record but, in his last fight, which saw him move up to super-welterweight, helooked diminished against Israil Madrimov– who made just his 12th appearance in the professional ring. Madrimov is a solid fighter but it was a salutary night for Crawford. He won a unanimous decision but his supporters must have shuddered when wondering how he would negotiate another leap up two further weight classes, where Álvarez hits so much harder than Madrimov.View image in fullscreenSaúl “Canelo” Álvarez flexes for the crowd at Friday’s ceremonial weigh-in.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesÁlvarezlooked terrible in his last fight, a stinker in May against the lightly-regarded pacifist William Scull. But he is intensely motivated now and it seems telling that Álvarez has been sparring hard withJaron “Boots” Ennis, who would test Crawford at welterweight.Crawford is, technically, the world’s best boxer since Mayweather Jr. Álvarez was barely 23 whenhe was outboxed by Mayweather in 2013, but he also struggled during a split-decision win against Erislandy Lara, a slick southpaw who moved. Crawford epitomizes those three attributes far more convincingly than Lara.But it seems unlikely that Crawford will be able to put a real dent in Álvarez. His clinical punching will chip away at the Mexican’s granite chin but, eventually, the logic of size and space should prevail. Álvarez is so adept at shutting down distance that, when he eventually corners Crawford, his bulk and power will be sapping.Crawford is fiercely competitive and his instinct might be to stand and trade. That could be a terrible mistake. Instead, Crawford needs to stick and move in an attempt to expose this worn version of Álvarez. But boxing is an unforgiving business and Álvarez, so often favored by the judges in Vegas, will probably bludgeon his way to a points victory over the valiant, skilful but, ultimately, outgunned Crawford.Donald McRaeExplore more on these topicsBoxingCanelo ÁlvarezTerence CrawfordMexicoUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A third of people do not tell their bosses about their use of AI tools amid fears their ability will be questioned if they do.Research for the Guardian has revealed that only 13% of UK adults openly discuss their use of AI with senior staff at work and close to half think of it as a tool to help people who are not very good at their jobs to get by.Amid widespread predictions that many workers face a fight for their jobs with AI, polling by Ipsos found that among more than 1,500 British workers aged 16 to 75, 33% said they did not discuss their use of AI to help them at work with bosses or other more senior colleagues. They were less coy with people at the same level, but a quarter of people believe “co-workers will question my ability to perform my role if I share how I use AI”.The Guardian’s survey also uncovered deep worries about the advance of AI, with more than half of those surveyed believing it threatens the social structure. The number of people believing it has a positive effect is outweighed by those who think it does not. It also found 63% of people do not believe AI is a good substitute for human interaction, while 17% think it is.Next week’sstate visit to the UKby Donald Trump is expected to signal greater collaboration between the UK and Silicon Valley to make Britain an important centre of AI development.The US president is expected to be joined by Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI who has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in areas including justice, security and education. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, is also expected to announce an investment in the UK’s biggest datacentre yet, to be built near Blyth in Northumbria.‘We are teaching the machine to take our job’: Banks bet big on AI as thousands of jobs cutRead moreKeir Starmerhas saidhe wants to “mainline AI into the veins” of the UK. Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.The polling appears to reflect workers’ uncertainty about how bosses want AI tools to be used, with many employers not offering clear guidance. There is also fear of stigma among colleagues if workers are seen to rely too heavily on the bots.A separateUS studycirculated this week found that medical doctors who use AI in decision-making are viewed by their peers as significantly less capable. Ironically, the doctors who took part in the research by Johns Hopkins Carey Business School recognised AI as beneficial for enhancing precision, but took a negative view when others were using it.Gaia Marcus, the director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, an independent AI research body, said the large minority of people who did not talk about AI use with their bosses illustrated the “potential for a large trust gap to emerge between government’s appetite for economy-wide AI adoption and the public sense that AI might not be beneficial to them or to the fabric of society”.“We need more evaluation of the impact of using these tools, not just in the lab but in people’s everyday lives and workflows,” she said. “To my knowledge, we haven’t seen any compelling evidence that the spread of these generative AI tools is significantly increasing productivity yet. Everything we are seeing suggests the need for humans to remain in the driving seat with the tools we use.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All once possessed unassailable power – then were undermined, in some cases wiped out, by the march of new technology.“Speed and stealth and firepower,” the head of the Australian Submarine Agency, Jonathan Mead, told the Guardian two years ago of Australia’s forthcoming fleet of nuclear submarines. “The apex predator of the oceans.”But for how much longer?In the first quarter of the 21st century, nuclear submarines have proven a formidable force: essentially undetectable deadly attack weapons. Some also carry a vital “second-strike” deterrent effect: any attack on a country armed with nuclear-powered submarines is made with the knowledge that retaliation is certain – from a warship hidden beneath the waves.The lethal legacy of Aukus nuclear submarines will remain for millennia – and there’s no plan to deal with itRead moreBut a drumbeat of declarations – much of it speculative, but most of it from China, the very nation the Aukus pact was established to counter – report rapid developments in submarine-detection technologies: vast networks of acutely sensitivesonar arrays;quantum sensing; improved satellite tracking able to spot tiny perturbations in the ocean’s surface; technologies thatdetect minute disturbancesin the Earth’s magnetic field; real-time AI processing of vast reams of data.Could emerging technologies render the last opaque place on Earth – the oceans – transparent?It may not be so binary. The oceans may become, in parts, less impenetrable: key contested sea lanes and littoral areas may be intensely surveilled, while remote, deep trenches remain arcane.Forecasting a future conflict is fraught. But the consequences for Australia, having dedicated an extraordinary $368bn towards itsAukusnuclear submarine fleet, are immense: will the apex predator of today become the prey of tomorrow?One brutal assessment put it in stark terms: Australia’s fleet of nuclear-powered submarines may end up being “billion-dollar coffins”.Q&AWhat is Aukus pillar one?ShowPillar one of the Australia-UK-US (Aukus) agreement involves Australia being given the technology to command its own fleet of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. There are two stages:• First, Australia will buy between three and five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US, the first of these in 2032. But before any boat can be sold to Australia, the US commander-in-chief – the president of the day – must certify that the US relinquishing a submarine will not diminish its navy’s undersea capability. The US submarine fleet now has only three-quarters of the submarines it needs (49 boats of aforce-level goalof 66). And there are significant concerns the US cannot build enough submarines for its own needs, let alone any for Australia.• Second, by the “late 2030s”, according to the \"optimal pathway\" outlined in Australia’ssubmarine industry strategy, the UK will launch the first specifically designed and built Aukus submarine for Britain’s Royal Navy.The first Australian-built Aukus submarine, for the Royal Australian Navy, will be in the water “in the early 2040s”. Australia will build up to eight Aukus boats, with the final vessels launched in the 2060s.Each of Australia’s nuclear submarines is forecast to have a working life of about three decades. Australia will be responsible for securing and storing the nuclear waste from its submarines - including high-level nuclear waste and spent fuel (a weapons proliferation risk) - for thousands of years.Aukus is forecast to cost Australia up to A$368bn to the mid-2050s.Photograph: Colin Murty/AFPWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Underwater arms raceThere is anarms race under wayunderwater, dedicated to perfecting the technologies that can find submarines, and finding new ways to keep them hidden.Vast resources are being poured into improving detection technologies and developing new ones: drones, sonobuoys, satellites, magnetometers, quantum sensors. All seek to shrink the spaces where submarines can hide.Everything is being monitored: the tiniest disturbance in waves across vast stretches of ocean, fractionally altered sea temperatures, faint magnetic disturbances, bioluminescent trails – each could give a tiny clue to a submarine’s path. Combined, they could reveal precisely where it is.Allied to the extraordinary data-processing power of artificial intelligence, these present a formidable threat to submarines’ invisibility. AI programs are able to cut through the “noise” of masses of information, spotting unseen patterns or finding connections between disparate pieces of data, imperceptible to a human analyst.Much of the technological advancement is being driven byChina.Submarines, made of metal, cause tiny distortions in the Earth’s magnetic field as they move through the water, changes increasingly detectable to sophisticated magnetometers.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailLast year a research team fromShanghai Jiao Tong University reportedthe development of a new seabed sensor able to detect the faint electromagnetic waves generated by a rotating submarine propeller from nearly 20km away, about 10 times the previous detection range.And in a peer-reviewed study published in December, researchers in Xi’an claimed to have developed an airborne magnetometer that cantrack the persistent trace of a submarine’s magnetic wake.Quantum sensors, which can detect infinitesimally small perturbations in the environment at an atomic level, promise even greater sensitivity and accuracy.In April scientists from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said they had developed a drone-mounted quantum sensor system that could track submarines with pinpoint accuracy. They claim thecoherent population trappingatomic magnetometer is as sensitive as theMAD-XR systemused by Nato countries but far cheaper, and so able to be deployed at a massive scale.These are the technologies that are known about but, as Dr Anne-Marie Grisogono of Flinders University points out, if an adversary had a technology to accurately detect submarines, would it tell anyone?The arms race is, of course, accelerating on both sides – designers are working on counter-detection measures to make submarines ever more covert: anechoic tiles to defeat or confuse sonar; cooling systems to weaken detection by thermal imaging or infrared detection by satellites; “degaussing” submarines to reduce magnetic signatures; and using pump-jet propulsors to produce less wake.‘We should be asking bigger questions’Grisogono was a co-author of the 2020 reportTransparent Oceans, which argued that by the 2050s – as new Australian Aukus boats continued to be sent to sea – nuclear submarines “will be able to be detected in the world’s oceans because of the evolution of science and technology”.She told Guardian Australia this year: “The likelihood that the oceans will become transparent at some time is basically 100%, it’s just in what time frame.Aukus will cost Australia $368bn. What if there was a better, cheaper defence strategy?Read more“And they could become transparent much sooner. We’ve seen tremendous advances in artificial intelligence ... an accelerant for all of these detection technologies that we are seeing developed.”Grisogono argued that it may not be one technology that renders submarines detectable. She can envisage a future of “underwater meshes of networked sensors” using different technologies, all of which are expendable and none of which is critical to the network functioning.“It’s an adaptive mesh of cheap components, and importantly, it’s a distributed system, so you can’t really take it out,” she said. “You can lose quite a lot of them and still have a functioning network … and it’s cheap.“If your defensive system is really cheap and can take out really expensive assets from your opponent … the advantage is now to the defence, not to the attack.”Grisogono said Australia should use the opportunity before too much is committed to Aukus to re-evaluate its capacity, not to fight a war in 20 years but in 30, 40 or 50.“We should be asking bigger questions about our defence posture,” she said. “I think acquiring these nuclear-powered submarines really only makes sense if you’re wanting to contribute and join into much bigger conflicts in the region with the US.“Perhaps when the decision was first taken, the logic of Aukus might be defensible in some way. But does that still stand up now?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With each one about the size of a minibus, they can be deployed from warships or launched off the coast.The Guardian asked the defence minister, Richard Marles, whether the investmentwas a “hedge”against a future where crewed submarines were detectable.“We are very confident about Australia’s future submarines being fundamentally critical to Australia’s military capability,” Marles responded, saying the Ghost Sharks would “complement” crewed nuclear submarines.“While there’s a whole lot of advancements in technologies about detecting submarines, there’s also a lot of advancements in technologies around making submarines harder to detect, and we are really confident about … giving Australia a highly capable, long‑range submarine capability in the future.”Standing alongside the minister, Australia’s chief of navy, V Adm Mark Hammond, said he believed crewed submarines would grow more stealthy as efforts to detect them strengthened.“I’ve heard about ‘transparent oceans’ since I qualified in submarines 31 years ago, and nothing’s really changed: every advancement in detection capability is usually met by an advancement in encounter detection capability and increased stealth.”The land and the air were “completely transparent”, Hammond said, “and no one has stopped building ships and aircraft.”“My personal belief is that the undersea battle space will continue to be increasingly congested, increasingly contested – but ultimately that is the most opaque environment on the planet, and I believe that our allies and partners will continue to enjoy the capability advantage in that space.”Detectable equals destroyableAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.Prof Peter W Singer, a strategist at the New America thinktank, cites Arthur C Clarke’s famed third law.He tells the Guardian that the rapid pace of change across technological domains, accelerated by developments in AI, makes predicting future developments – especially beyond the span of a human or technological generation – increasingly fraught.Australia’s first Aukus submarines are scheduled to be in the water in the 2040s. They will still be under construction into the 2060s.“Twenty years is a very long time when it comes to technology … what’s a generation for undersea warfare: is it every 30 years? Every 15 years? Every 10 years? We’re talking about a pretty substantial period of time,” Singer says.An accelerating trend is “greater observation of the battlefield, and the worry that once stealthy systems might be detectable”.“If they’re detectable, they’re destroyable,” he says.Surface tension: could the promised Aukus nuclear submarines simply never be handed over to Australia?Read more“Military leaders around the world are wrestling with this – whether they are in the ADF, Nato, the US Navy, Marine Corps – there’s a trend where essentially the apex predators are looking around and wondering if they are now the prey.”The Marianas Trench – largely uncharted and reaching depths beyond human exploration – might remain unknowable, Singer says, but key sea lanes in the South China Sea could be intensely surveilled.He cites the cold war example of the GIUK Gap – naval choke points in the North Atlantic – which was populated by a battery of hydrophones designed to detect the passage of Soviet submarines.Singer predicts that undersea warfare of the future will not be a battle between crewed submarines but between hybrid fleets of new technologies, including unmanned underwater vehicles, potentially working in concert with crewed subs. UUVs will be far cheaper and expendable in comparison with traditional submarines.The terrestrial equivalent is Ukraine’s revolutionary use ofcheap but lethal armed dronesto counter Russia’s invasion. Expendable drones worth a few hundred dollars a unit are taking out tanks that cost tens of millions, halting entire offensives.“The uncrewed systems are not all going to be like a pet on a leash, they’re going to be increasingly operating on their own,” Singer says.“So you may have some physically large systems that need to go long distances and carry massive payloads, but you may also have smaller systems, maybe with less range but, because they’re smaller, they’re cheaper, and you can essentially fill the battle space with them.”The upshot is a balancing act, Singer says – accepting that decision-makers have neither a perfect view of the future nor an unlimited budget.“I am not saying ‘don’t buy Virginia Class’ or ‘don’t buy Aukus’,” he says. “I think they do bring value. The question is how much of a bet do you want to make?”Explore more on these topicsAustralian militaryAukusWeapons technologyAustralian foreign policyOceansNuclear powerChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Experts reveal how applicants can get aheadSally WealeSat 13 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 08.22 EDTShareOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently told a US podcast that if he was graduating today, “I would feel like the luckiest kid in all of history.”Altman, whose company developed and releasedChatGPTin November 2022, believes the transformative power of AI offers unprecedented opportunities for young people.Yes, there will be job displacement, but “this always happens,” says Altman, “and young people are the best at adapting to this.” New, more exciting jobs will emerge, full of greater possibilities.For UK sixth-formers and their families looking at universities, trying to make the best possible choices about what to study – and where – in the age of generative AI, Altman’s words may offer some comfort. But in a fast-changing environment, experts say there are steps students can take to ensure they are well placed both to make the most of their university experience and to emerge from their studies qualified for the jobs of the future.Dr Andrew Rogoyski, of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, says that in many cases students will already be well versed in AI and ahead of the game. “What’s striking is the pace of change and adoption vastly outstrips the pace of academic institutions to respond. As a general truth, academic institutions are quite slow and considered and thoughtful about things. But actually this has gone from the launch of ChatGPT to ‘Should we ban it?’, to ‘OK, here are some concerns about exams’, to actually recognising it’s going to be a life skill that we have to teach in every course and that we want all our students to have equitable access to.“So it’s gone from zero to 100 in a very short space of time, and of course, the world of work is changing accordingly as well.”His advice to prospective students? “Be demanding. Ask the questions. I think there are some careers that are going to be very different … make sure that universities are adapting to that.”Students who are less familiar with AI should take time to learn about it and use it, whatever their chosen subject. Rogoyski says being able to use AI tools is now equivalent to being able to read and write, and it’s important “to be resourceful, adaptable, to spend time understanding what AI is capable of and what it can and can’t do”.He says: “It’s something you need to be able to understand no matter what course you do, and think about how it might impact your career. So read around, look at some of the speculation surrounding that.“Then I’d start thinking about what the university’s responses are and what support there is for integration of AI. Is my course, and is the university as a whole, on the front foot with regards to the use of AI?”There will be a lot of information online but Rogoyski recommends visiting universities to ask the academics who will be delivering your degree: “What is your strategy? What is your attitude? Am I going to get a degree that’s worth having, that will stand the test of time?”Dan Hawes, co-founder of specialist recruitment consultancy the Graduate Recruitment Bureau, is optimistic about the future for UK graduates and says the current slowdown in the jobs market is more to do with the economy than AI. “It’s still very hard to predict what jobs there will be in three to four years, but we think it’s going to put a premium on graduates,” he says. “They are the generation growing up with AI and employers are probably very interested in getting this new breed of talent into their organisations.“So for parents and sixth-formers deciding where to study, the first thing always to take note of is the employability of the graduates that are produced by certain universities.”For example, maths has consistently been the top degree his clients are looking for, and he thinks this is unlikely to change. “AI is not going to devalue the skills and knowledge you get from doing a maths degree,” he says.He agrees that AI is a concern for parents and those considering going to university, “but in the long term I think it’s going to be a good thing. It’s going to make people’s jobs more interesting, redesign their roles, create new jobs.”Elena Simperl, professor of computer science at King’s College London, where she co-directs the King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, advises students to look at the AI content right across a university, in all departments. “It is changing how we do things. It’s not just changing how we write emails and how we read documents and how we look for information,” she says.Students might wish to consider how they can set themselves up for a job working in AI. “DeepMind is proposing AI co-scientists, so entire automatic AI labs, to do research. So a university should train their students so that they can make the most out of these technologies,” she says. “It doesn’t really matter what they want to study at the university. They don’t have to study AI themselves, but they should go to a university where there is a broad expertise in AI, not just in a computer science department.”Prof Simperl says that the evidence so far suggests it is unlikely that entire jobs will completely disappear. “So we need to stop thinking about what jobs will be killed by AI and think about what tasks can AI help with. People who are able to use AI more will be at an advantage.”In the brave new world of AI, will it still be worth doing a degree like English literature or history? “Yes, if they’re well taught,” says Rogoyski. “They should be teaching you things that will last throughout your lifetime. The appreciation of literature, learning how to write well, learning how to think and how to communicate are enduring skills.“The way that you might use that degree in the future will undoubtedly change, but if it’s taught well, the lessons learned will see you through. If nothing else you’ll enjoy your downtime as our AI overlords take over all the work and we’ll have more time to read books while we’re all on universal basic income.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)University Guide 2026EmployabilityWork & careersUniversitiesHigher educationStudentsUniversity guidefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Are there other solutions?Kaamil AhmedSat 13 Sep 2025 06.01 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 06.02 EDTShareIt was a year in to driving his daughter to school in his new electric vehicle that Phil Bellamy discovered she dreaded the 10-minute daily ride – it made her feel sick in a way no other car did.As the driver, Bellamy had no problems with the car but his teenage daughters struggled with sickness every time they entered the vehicle.Research has shownthis is an issue – people who did not usually havemotion sicknessin a conventional car found that they did in EVs.For Bellamy, 51, his family’s aversion to riding in his car made him wonder at the cause. He tried changing his driving style and even buying a different car but found the issues persisted. His daughters now refuse to travel with him, if possible.“If we’re going on a journey, they’re absolutely taking travel sickness tablets immediately. They’re not even considering coming in the car without them,” he says.Bellamy enjoys driving his electric car, which is quieter and smoother compared with the vibrations of a traditional combustion engine car, but hopes manufacturers will consider how to address the concerns of passengers who are affected by motion sickness.The causes of sickness could include the relatively quick acceleration of EVs compared to fuel vehicles, their regenerative braking systems and a lack of sensory triggers such as engine noise and vibrations when travelling in a car.Research carried out in China, a big producer of electric cars, found that EVs were associated with more severe motion sickness symptoms than fuel vehicles.Atiah Chayne, a content creator from London,posted on TikTokabout her experiences of car sickness in EVs this summer when she booked Ubers to take her out.Why do I get car sick and my boyfriend doesn’t? I asked expertsRead moreChayne says “extreme nausea” kicked in very quickly and stopped immediately after she left the vehicle, but it took her a while to realise it happened only in EVs. She now avoids using Ubers as it’s difficult to find one that is not an EV.Chayne says: “It usually started quickly soon after we moved off. I’d say it got really bad one minute into the journey. I would put the windows down and go on my phone to distract myself,” she says. “The sickness was constantly there throughout the whole journey. If your Uber is 20 minutes away from your destination, you’re counting down the minutes until you get out.”John Golding, a professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster in London, says motion sickness specifically affects passengers because it is, in large part, related to being able to anticipate changes in movement.While drivers have control of the car’s movement, passengers do not – especially those in the back seat – and he thinks this could become more of an issue with the potential introduction of self-driving cars.He says the car industry is aware of motion sickness issues for some people in EVs and is looking at ways to help passengers anticipate changes in movement,such as vibrations in the car seatthat warn the passenger when the car is turning.Golding says people can also either take motion sickness medication or make behavioural changes. “The simplest thing is to sit in the front to get a view. Avoid moving your head too much, don’t look at your phone or start reading; that makes things much worse. If you can get some fresh air, that will help,” he says.View image in fullscreenBackseat passengers have no control over the car’s movements.Photograph: Bsip Sa/AlamyHow to cope with motion sicknessExperts andthe NHS suggestbehavioural changes, medication and acupressure bands could help.Sit at the frontKnowing what’s going on around you is the best way to avoid motion sickness. It allows you to see and anticipate what will happen next, while in the back the view just flashes past, says Golding.Try motion sickness medicationsThese come in the form of patches or tablets that can be bought from pharmacies and help control how your brain and body react to movement. They should be takenbefore travelling.WearacupressurebandsThese are thought to work for some, though research suggests probably through a placebo effect. “Placebo effects can be very, very strong. If they work for an individual, don’t knock it,”Golding says.Listen to a 100hz soundfor a minute.Researchfrom Japan’s Nagoya University suggests the vibrations at this frequency could help by stimulating a part of the inner ear that detects gravity and acceleration.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringEthical and green livingGreenhouse gas emissionsSelf-driving carsTravel and transportHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You’d be forgiven for assuming this particular issue was sorted out quite a long time ago. But, because we live in hell, it seems the question is once again up for debate.Not by women, though; the fairer sex is obviously too emotional for such muscular discussion. So please sit this one out, ladies, and listen to what America’s finest male intellectuals have to say.First up is Braeden Sorbo, a 24-year-old conservative influencer and nepo baby (he’s the son of the Hercules actor Kevin Sorbo), who claims he is constantly harangued by women telling him how desperate they are to have their rights taken away.“I know more young women today who say they wish they didn’t ever get the right to vote than I’ve ever talked to in my life,” Sorborecently toldRichard Harris, host of the Truth & LibertyYouTube show. Which rather raises the question: how many young women has Sorbo ever talked to in his life? Harris didn’t push Sorbo on the veracity of this anecdata, however. Instead he just gave a manly chuckle as Sorbo blamed all the ills of the world (abortion, feminism) on the 19th amendment.Per Sorbo, his female peers have also told him that “I would much rather give up my one right to vote if it meant 10,000 liberal women wouldn’t be allowed to vote, so that we could return to a better place”. (Manysuch cases!) He went on tosaythat his ultimate vision is a “voting system based on Christian morals, which relates to married couples having one joint vote”.Perhaps you’re thinking: what does it matter what a 24-year-old jamoke on a far-right YouTube show says? I refer you to line three of paragraph one: it matters because we live in hell. In a normal world, Sorbo would be a fringe figure shouting into the ether who we could all happily ignore. But thanks in part to digital media, we don’t have that luxury any more. Sorbo has 1.9 million followerson TikTok.; while some of his videos only get a few thousand views he has quite a few that top a million.More importantly, however, Sorbo’s views can no longer be dismissed as “fringe”. Rather, the idea that women shouldn’t vote is increasingly being co-signed and amplified by some of the most powerful people in America.Last month, for example, the US defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, shared a video on X in whichseveral pastorssay women should no longer be allowed to vote as individuals. “In my ideal society, we would vote as households,” one of the pastors in theCNN clipsays. “I would ordinarily be the one to cast the vote, but I would cast the vote having discussed it with my household.” While Hegseth didn’t explicitly endorse the video, he did retweet it with the caption “All of Christ for All of Life.”Slate thencontactedthe Pentagon to give Hegseth a chance to clarify his thoughts on the matter. The reply wasn’t a straight answer; instead it just said Hegseth was a member of a church affiliated with Pastor Doug Wilson and “very much appreciates many of Mr Wilson’s writings and teachings”. Wilson is a Christian nationalistwho has said“women are the kind of people that people come out of” and written blogposts with titles such as “The Lost Virtue of Sexism”.Then there’s the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who helpedbankrollJD Vance’s political career. Back in 2009, Thielpublished an essaythat argued it may have been a bit of an error to give women the right to vote. “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” Thiel wrote.Thiel got a lot of flak for this and laterclarified his statement, saying: “It would be absurd to suggest that women’s votes will be taken away … While I don’t think any class of people should be disenfranchised, I have little hope that voting will make things better.” Which is rather different from saying: “Of course women should have the right to vote, I’m mortified anyone misinterpreted my pretentious word salad.”Predictably, Elon Musk also has some views on this matter. While the tech billionaire (soon to betrillionaire?) has never explicitly argued women shouldn’t vote, he has amplified tweets that undermine the idea of universal suffrage.Last year, for example, he wrote “interesting observation” on a retweet of a post by an account called Autism Capital which stated a “Republic of high status males is best for decision making.” The same post argued “women and low T men” are “malleable” and can’t think freely. A year before, Musk appeared toendorse the ideathat “democracy is probably unworkable long term without limiting suffrage to parents”.The right are very good at shifting the Overton windowin their favourand propelling oncefringe viewsinto the mainstream. They’re also adept atweaponizingthe law to help advance their agenda. They won’t be able to get rid of women’s voting rights overnight, of course. Just like the right to a legal abortion, they’llchip away at itgradually with bills that disenfranchise the “wrong” sort of people andmechanismsthat make voting more difficult. But we should not mistake their ultimate objective. Musk, Thiel and Hegseth are some of the most powerful people in the world: when they, along with influencers such as Sorbo, hint that they are interested in getting rid of women’s suffrage, we should take them very seriously indeed.Texas professor fired after accusations of teaching ‘illegal’ gender identityTexas A&M Universityfired a professoron Tuesday after a viral video in which a student complained they were being taught illegal notions about gender identity. The university president responded by saying: “This isn’t about academic freedom; it’s about academic responsibility.” But the professor, Melissa McCoul, hasappealedagainst her termination and is exploring further legal action. McCoul’s termination comes amid a broader crackdown by the Trump administration onhigher educationand freedom of speech. Rather than fighting back, many universities (helloColumbia!) are shamefully bending the knee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Black has said an independent inquiry found he had a limited relationship with Epstein and didn’t know about his sexual misconduct.

Following the release of the birthday album, Black, who has strong ties toNew York’s Museum of Modern Art(Moma), attended a private event at the museum. This may wellreignite previous demandsfor Moma to cut ties with Black.New Mexico is thefirst state to promisefree childcare for all familiesBRB, just going to look at house prices in Santa Fe.Chicago man travels to Gaza and boasts about killing civiliansPlease take the time to read thisimportant and disturbing investigationin the Guardian about how Daniel Raab, a sniper from Chicago, went off to Gaza, where he massacred three members of the same family.

And the denim discourse is insufferableSat 13 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 16.48 EDTShareIf you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you are wearing clothes. Or my byline photo made you spontaneously strip down to nothing but a pair of crusty underwear and a smile. I don’t judge, and I also don’t blame you. That photo is from a decade ago.Assuming you’re in clothes, then you had to decide what to wear. It’s an arduous task for most of us – the rummaging in a closet, color coordinating, the classic “smell” test to confirm you can go another week without doing your laundry. For me, dressing is a joy. I have multiple closets stocked with clothes – suits, mostly. I have some shorts, some sweats, hoodies and T-shirts, but those are for special occasions only. Like a kid’s birthday or a hangover.You know what you won’t find in my closet?Jeans.Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel ConnollyRead moreI hate jeans. Not even apoorly conceived Sydney Sweeney commercialcould convince me I needed to buy jeans. If I had to choose between wearing denim and one of thosebarrels cartoon hobos wear, I’d choose the barrel. Far more dignified. Jeans were created for gold miners so they didn’t rip their pants while sloshing in a river full of jagged rocks. I panned for gold once, on a school field trip toSutter’s Fortin fifth grade. I was not asked to go pro.Jeans make some people look like Bruce Springsteen – macho, blue collar and soulful. Jeans make me look like my dad – balding, with bad posture and a curious mustard stain on my crotch. Suits make me look grown up. Jeans make me look ground down. They make me look washed, cooked, chopped and all the other things my kid yells at me when I try to bend over to pick up one of his toys and I screech in pain.You can wear jeans if you want. I won’t stop you, but please, cease and desist with the denim discourse. Arecent GQ articlefrom July titled “I Went Back to Skinny Jeans, and It Feels Incredible” is the latest in a cottage industry of fashion articles that give you permission to do something we all decided was lame a few years ago.Another GQ article from this year, called “Sperry Boat Shoes Won Me Back. I Never Should’ve Docked ‘Em” assured nervous young men that Sperry Top-Siders are actually not five-alarm fire, dweeb alert material, but an “American classic”. We should all be sure to have Top-Siders under our bed, in case a yachting regatta spontaneously breaks out within walking distance of our house, the local crew team is looking for a coxswain, orJordan Belfort needs help committing a complex financial crime.I’m in my early 40s (hence the screeching and the back pain and the child) and I have lived through a variety of trends at this point. I remember JNCO Jeans, which were wide enough to smuggle an entire 2-liter bottle of orange soda into a matinee screening ofThe Crow. I’ve seen bucket hats come and go, mostly timed to whether or not Oasis was touring. I understand the imperative to keep changing how people dress so that they will never stop buying more clothes. If we ever collectively stopped buying clothes we didn’t need, pollution-generating factories around the world would disappear, access to fresh water would increase and we’d be robbing the world of millions of borderline slave-labor jobs. So we keep generating content designed to make people buy new versions of clothes they gave away five years ago, because the same publication told them what they already owned sucked.No item of clothing seems to go through revisions more than jeans. They get wider, narrower, higher or lower depending on which way the fashion industry wind blows. The expensive jeans you bought in 2022 are potentially out of step three years later. If you are entirely devoid of an individual sense of style, you will cycle through all these permutations of denim in order to maintain the shred of self-esteem you have left that comes from recognizing your pants in a paparazzi photo of Jacob Elordi.I didn’t stop wearing skinny jeans because they went out of fashion. I stopped because I can’t fit into them comfortably. They objectively do not look good on me. I look like an old man trying to seem young. The author of the GQ article about skinny jeans refers to his ideal personal style as “Regular Millennial Guy Look”. Oh, to be regular, to be just a “guy” again! What heaven it would be. If I could press a button and be 25 again, I would. But buying the same clothes I wore when I was 25, desperate to fit in and not be noticed by anyone, is not going to magically make me 25 again.Worse yet, the writer describes what sounds like a minor cardiac event that occurred when he dipped back into the world of skinny jeans. “On a whim I decided to wrestle my way into a pair of Petit Standards. Behind the velvet curtain, red in the face and out of breath – but for once, it was me in the mirror.” I support anyone who feels comfortable in what they wear, but if your journey of self-discovery involves the warning signs of a heart attack, maybe there are other options out there for you.The longer I’m on this planet, the less I care about the various permutations of the fashion industry, its blatant greed and a stunning lack of creative energy. There are exceptions, mostly smaller labels fronted by young designers, but luxury fashion iscontrolled by billionaire conglomeratesthat care more about maximizing profits than making anything worth owning. Fast fashion iscontributing to global pollutionat an alarming rate. And the fashion media just wants you to keep buying more junk. No one will ever convince me to buy jeans. I don’t need jeans. Skinny, wide or otherwise.Now, if GQ would report on the resurgence of hobos wearing barrels, maybe I’d see things a little differently.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsJeansOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

After more headline evidence this week of the extreme nature of American gun violence, some may conclude that the answer is no. Nine months out from the opening game, it is now almost impossible to ignore this. But believe it or not statistics suggest more than 300 people will have been shot in America last Wednesday alone.The same number will also be shot on Friday, Saturday, every day next week, and every day of World Cup year. On average 127 of these unnamed, largely non-famous people not called things such as the superstar influencer Charlie Kirk will die each day. Within this, youth gun deaths will be both alarmingly high and a register of social injustice: a disproportionate 46% of all young people shot will be black.Florian Wirtz is a sure bet at Liverpool but Newcastle are gambling on Nick Woltemade | Philipp LahmRead moreSo maybe the events of Wednesday really do suggest America isn’t a fitting World Cup host. Maybe it hasn’t been for a while, as members of the African media suggested while questioning Gianni Infantino in Nairobi a few days ago, expressing alarm at the hostile policies of the Fifa president’s special friendDonald Trump.Happily Infantino cleared this up on the spot. It is apparently “a misconception” that the US might be a hostile or dangerous place for non-white visitors, which is no doubt a relief for all concerned. TodayI feel like a concerned black African football tourist. But you know what? With the benefit of this unique insight I, Gianni, have decided it’s all fine, so carry on.You may still have concerns, or consider Infantino’s assurances are worth exactly what you might expect from a person who seems to be composed entirely from a cylinder of reconstituted human inauthenticity crammed, kebab-meat-style, into a navy blue suit. Or that Fifa is already complicit in this state of alarm. The World Cup will offer a multibillion-dollar boost and a gloss of pure sportswashing to a regime that has used immigration theatrics to alarm its inhabitants and imposed brutal visa curbs on people from the wrong kind of competing nation.But there is at least one shaft of light here. Before anyone gets too worried about travelling to America for the World Cup there was a suggestion this week that one highly influential person may be about to buck this trend. Enter:Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to demonstrate that it’s finally safe to go back in the water, a year into Trump 2.0.It has been a good couple of weeks for Ronaldo. First he was given full superstar hysteria treatment during the Saudi Super Cup in Hong Kong, which included being mobbed during a surprise visit to a museum in Tsim Sha Tsui. A museum, you say? Surely an elite fitness powder emporium, or a skyscraper made entirely from yak fur and parmesan cheese? But this was a museum devoted entirely to the works of Cristiano Ronaldo, its official title the CR7 Life Museum, which certainly sounds like the best museum, a very tall, very handsome museum.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo scored three times in the international break, making it 141 goals from his 223 games for Portugal.Photograph: Vincenzo Orlando/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockAnd as of Wednesday Ronaldo is now in line for a return to the US after an unexplained 12 years away. According to a story first published in the Athletic,Portugalare in talks to play a friendly against the US next March. The last time Ronaldo played in America was a summer tour game for Real Madrid in 2014. The last time he was photographed there was in 2016.This is a significant development. Ronaldo still has a lifetime contract with Nike and assorted big-ticket endorsement deals. He even put his name to an NFT collaboration which has nowcollapsed into legal chaos, with Ronaldo at one point a named party in a class action suit, which may or may not be a related factor, nobody really knows.What is certain is his decade-long absence from the largest consumer economy in the world, no tours, no brand-building appearances, no Major League Soccer contract, has left millions of dollars on the table, for a Ronaldo-industrial complex that definitely likes millions of dollars. So presumably there must be a good reason.Ronaldo has never commented on this. There are no charges, and certainly no convictions. In fact it all seems to have been a terrible misunderstanding. But his absence coincides directly with the appearance of allegations in 2017, always vehemently denied, that Ronaldo sexually assaulted a teacher called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009, and later offered ano-admission no-guilt payoffto make the whole thing stop.The case was reopened in 2018, ran on to 2022, and has now, it seems, died a death. None of which means Ronaldo’s presence in the US wouldn’t have been met with protests, bad publicity, a reigniting of some kind of action. Pre-season tours at his various clubs over this period stayed away from the States. No pics, no talkshow stuff, no temporary deal with the Kansas City Wangdoodles.View image in fullscreenFifa president Gianni Infantino has courted Donald Trump since he was elected in the US, with the World Cup coming up across North America next year.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersAnd now it seems the waters may be clearing. And it is, let’s face it, hard not to associate this with a change in voice, power dynamics, names at the top. Trump likes winners. Trump likes vibey, wealthy masculine guys. Trump knows what it is to suffer historical allegations that just won’t go away. Trump technically even has the power to offer a legal pardon, even to a foreign national, even before any charge is made, or likely to be made.Either way, in June there was an overt cosying up as Trump was presented with a CR7 shirt via the Portuguese European council president, António Costa, at the G7 summit in Canada (on it Ronaldo had inscribed “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace”, pandering very obviously to the aspirant Ballon de Peace winner).And this really is a late-career crunch time for Ronaldo, 40, still a goalscoring machine, and with a chance to dip a toe in those waters before the World Cup, where he really just needs to be present to energise both the tournament and his own brand legacy.For those who have followed his astonishing professional existence it is also a chance understand a little more clearly what Ronaldo is, which is still slightly mysterious. In many ways football has still not really come to terms with the magnificent monster it has built.Ronaldo is arguably the most famous person in the world, already the most followed person on Instagram ahead of Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, God, authentic human feeling and diverse Kardashians. At the Club World Cup this summer he was massively present despite not taking part, anecdotally the most high-profile, obsessively admired footballer most local people could name.He is also deeply now, the most prominent single catalyst of a transformation of the sport into a brand-driven global platform, a nation state arm of power, an endlessly amplified celebrity content machine.View image in fullscreenCristiano Ronaldo last played a game in the US back in 2014, during Real Madrid’s pre-season tour, when they took on Manchester United in Michigan.Photograph: Melanie Maxwell/APFor all that, it is still hard to get your head around the basic question of why exactly Ronaldo is quite so famous. Clearly he is a magnificent footballer. But still. Why the state of outright worship? Why is he so far ahead of everyone else in this? To understand this is to understand the internet, and the strangely intimate nature of online fame.Ronaldo is perfect for the internet. He embodies its obsessions: self-made triumph, motivational success, bodily obsession, porn-like aesthetics. Ronaldo has mastered his routines, his intake, accumulated wealth spectacularly. As a facial signifier, a human logo, he has that indefinably moreish quality of the online hyper-famous. Lots of people are handsome. Ronaldo is handsome in a way that is always him, a face, a six-pack, a flaring neck you just have to click on.What does he look like? A perfectly glazed wedding cake figurine. A hyper-advanced robot replicant at the interstellar fleet captain’s ball. An avatar of human immortality made out of marzipan, yeti-sperm and greed.This is often couched in a weird kind of reverence. “For most of my life I’ve always been worried I wouldn’t be able to see Ronaldo,” one member of the Saudi Cup crowd told the South China Morning Post. Another said: “I like Ronaldo because of his values, what he stands for, it’s very respectable.”Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIs that what it is? Orderliness in a crazed and dysfunctional world. Devotional perfection. Success, attainment, compacted into a single lighted square. Ronaldo also got there first, colonised that space, understood his own power before anyone else. And now he has a chance, should the stars align, to breach the final consumer frontier, to conquer America decisively next summer, decks finally clear and with a president on hand who will be very interested in any hint of a brand-building collab.Call me cynical, paranoid, conspiracy-prone but it seems inconceivable there hasn’t been some kind of pre-chat, a feeling-out, a focus-grouping of what it may mean, optics-wise, good and bad, finally to get Ronaldo on that stage.There are so many strange and manipulative aspects to America’s public contortions right now, so many aspects that seem out of control, leading right into a World Cup where even the logo looks mildly sinister, a strange black cancerous date stamp oozing out from beneath that iconic, throbbingly veined golden trophy. Ronaldo to America just feels like a very natural extension, the ultra-influencer, here to bring peace, and above all to spread his own version of irresistibly monetised human theatre.Explore more on these topicsCristiano RonaldoWorld Cup 2026PortugalWorld CupUS sportsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

That culture was everywhere before feminismRebecca SolnitFeminism exposed the ubiquity of child abuse, rape, sexual harassment and domestic violence – and helped fight that cultureSat 13 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareIwas there. I kept the receipts. I remember how normalized the sexual exploitation of teenage girls and even tweens by adult men was, how it showed up in movies, in the tales of rock stars and “baby groupies”, in counterculture and mainstream culture, how normalized rape, exploitation, grooming, objectification, commodification was.The last Woody Allen movie I ever saw was Manhattan,in which he cast himself as more or less himself, a dweeb in his mid-40s, dating a high school student played by Mariel Hemingway. She was my age, 17, and I was only too familiar with creeps, and the movie creeped me out, even though it was only long afterward that I read that she said he was at the timepressuring herto get sexually involved with him in real life.As the Epstein case shows, Trump’s Maga faithful care about only one kind of sex-crime victim | Emma BrockesRead moreManhattan came out in 1979; two years earlier Roman Polanski, on the pretext that he was taking photographs for French Vogue, got a 13-year-old girl to come alone to a house, where he drugged and raped her vaginally and anally. The probation officer assigned to himwrote: “There was some indication that circumstances were provocative, that there was some permissiveness by the mother,” and “that the victim was not only physically mature, but willing”. In her own account, the girl had said no repeatedly and even pretended to have an asthma attack to try to dissuade him, but the probation officer was of his era and only too willing to blame a drugged child. That was normal then.Movies of the 1970s normalized all this. Jodie Foster was 12 when she played a prostitute in Taxi Driver. In Pretty Baby, an 11-year-old Brooke Shields played another prostitute in quaint New Orleans whose virginity is auctioned off, and who appears nude in some scenes, as she did in a Playboy Magazine special “sugar and spice” issue at age 10. In Milos Forman’s 1971 Taking Off, the runaway 15-year-old daughter of the protagonist reappears with a rock star boyfriend. Groupie culture included more than a few children sleeping with rock stars; Interview Magazine recounts of one prominent groupie that she “lost her virginity at age 12 to Spirit guitarist Randy California. For a time, she was involved with Iggy Pop, who glorified their relationship in his 1996 songLook Away. I slept with Sable when she was 13 / Her parents were too rich to do anything.”It was the 70s in which the soft-focus color photographs of nude and semi-clad pubescent girls of David Hamilton were normalized as coffee table books and posters. By the 1990s, Jock Sturges’s black-and-white photographs of similar slender white girls shot in a nudist colony in the midst of puberty launched controversies. While he defended them with bland notions of high art and edenic life without shame, a former student of his made asemi-documentaryfilm about the sexual relationship she had with him when she was 14 and he was her art teacher, in the 1970s.Later on, when Brooke Shields tried to stop Gary Gross’s nude images of her at age 10 from circulating, as the Guardianreportedin 2009, “Gross’s lawyers argued that his photographs could not further damage Shields’s reputation because, since they were taken, she had made a profitable career “as a young vamp and a harlot, a seasoned sexual veteran, a provocative child-woman, an erotic and sensual sex symbol, the Lolita of her generation”. The judge concurred and, while praising the pictures’ “sultry, sensual appeal”, ruled that Gross was not a pornographer: “They have no erotic appeal except to possibly perverse minds.”That’s what the 1980s were like too. As an adult Molly Ringwaldwroteof the John Hughes teen movies in which she starred back then, “I’m a little embarrassed to say that it took even longer for me to fully comprehend the scene late in Sixteen Candles, when the dreamboat, Jake, essentially trades his drunk girlfriend, Caroline, to the Geek, to satisfy the latter’s sexual urges, in return for Samantha’s underwear. The Geek takes Polaroids with Caroline to have proof of his conquest; when she wakes up in the morning with someone she doesn’t know, he asks her if she ‘enjoyed it.’” That this was rape was not clear to Ringwald, as she says, or to audiences. In 1984, Rolling Stones bass player Bill Wyman, who was 47, began having a relationship with a child he met, claiming “she was a woman at thirteen”. Much later in her life, she advocated for raising Britain’s age of consent from 16 to 18,saying,“You are still a child – even at 16.”Before what got called the sexual revolution, prudery and propriety regarded girls and young women as the property of fathers and future husbands, and not besmirching the purity that was part of their value was at least grounds for saying no. The sexual revolution removed this barrier and when I was a teenager in the 1970s the general idea was that sex was good and everyone should have it, and so I started getting hit on by counterculture dudes when I was 12 or 13, as did my female peers. Everything meant yes; nothing meant no; almost no one aided girls who wanted to avoid these guys; we were on our own and had to become escape artists. In the alternative school I went to in the mid-1970s, in a nice suburb, 13-year-old girls were dating adult drug dealers, a 14-year-old showed off a ring from her middle-aged fiancee, and a 15-year-old got pregnant from a sailor on a nearby base and decided to have the baby. No adults seemed concerned.It was still a misogynist culture; sex was still framed largely in terms of male needs. One more striking piece of 1970s culture was the sexual ethos of the counterculture terrorists who kidnapped Patti Hearst in 1974: that it was “comradely” to meet the needs of others, and thus the women in the Symbionese Liberation Army were always supposed to say yes to the men, to meet the latter’s needs, never mind their own. So much for liberation.Founded in 1978, NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, was an organization of adult men actively campaigning for legalizing sex with male children, and was only gradually driven underground. Straight men didn’t need a special organization to advocate for them; the whole culture did. It was the Playboy Philosophy, it was Hollywood and rock’n’roll, cheesy art like David Hamilton’s, and sniggers and excuses.I write all this because the just-released 2003Jeffrey Epsteinbirthday album is a late relic of that culture, as is Donald Trump’s attitude toward women. Trump was often seen at Epstein’s events, packed with very young female models, at a time when models were sent out to mingle with affluent men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one, a photograph of three people holding a giant check to Epstein, with Trump’s signature (presumably not real), describing Epstein selling a “fully depreciated” woman whose name is redacted to Trump for $22,500. Depreciated is a real-estate term; the joke seems to be that somehow a woman has lost some of her value, but is still saleable as property, livestock, chattel or whatever term you use when you turn humans into property.In the other, a drawing of Epstein in 1983 approaching girl children with balloons and candy clearly recognizes him as a groomer; the other half of the pictures shows him in 2003 in a recliner being serviced by four young women or girls, two in thong bikini bottoms, one with Epstein’s initials tattooed on her butt cheek. It’s clear whoever contributed these suggestive pages to the Epstein album knew of his sexual appetite for young girls, and that a great many others did as well.What happened between the 1970s I’ve described and the present is feminism: feminism that insisted that women were people endowed with rights, that sex, as distinct from rape, had to be something both parties desired, that consent had to be active and conscious, that all human interactions involve power and that the vast power differential between adult men and children meant that no such consent was possible.It was feminism that exposed the ubiquity of child abuse, rape, sexual harassment and domestic violence, that denormalized these abuses that were so much part of patriarchal society. And still are, far too much, but the dismissive, permissive attitude of the past is past, at least in mainstream culture.Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

Frank and fearless advice may be a public service aspiration, but all too often it is clothed in easy-to-misunderstand bureaucratese. So when a statutory officer decides to use plain, clear language to call out fundamental flaws in the legislation she is charged with overseeing, it is important to pause and really listen.That is what Natalie Siegel-Brown didin her first reportto the parliament as the inspector general of aged care.Thehuman rights lawyer, former public guardian and productivity commissioner says she is thrilled that the new Aged Care Act is couched in never-before-seen language, respecting the human rights of older Australians and codifying these rights in law.

Other actions are not actively being considered, and indeed the manner of implementation in some areas may bring about unintended consequences.”The second part of the report details the responses to each of the 148 recommendations but, as the first part of the report demonstrates, this misses the “transformational, whole-of-system change called for by the royal commission”.We should all be grateful that the person charged with overseeing the delivery of the aged care reforms recommended by the royal commission is a straight-talking Queenslander. We should urge the government to pay serious attention and respond meaningfully to her report to the parliament.But until this becomes a real political problem – which it will as more people age and the services fail to keep up – that seems unlikely. Shortly after Siegel-Brown’s report was tabled, rather than responding to her cautionary concerns, the minister for aged care, Sam Rae,put out a media releasereporting on a survey showing high levels of satisfaction with the system. Spin over substance.Four years ago, the eight volumes of the aged care royal commission demonstrated in excruciating detail that the privatised system introduced by John Howard in 1997 wasfailing to meet the needsof older Australians and their families, workers in the system and even the companies seeking an investment opportunity.It argued that what was needed was timely entitlement to aged care. Instead, the government, with the support of the opposition, opted to ration care, aim for three-month waiting periods, increase individual costs exponentially, increase compliance and not address the special needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or people with disabilities who lose NDIS support when they turn 65.Waiting lists are now years long, with homes refusing to even take the names of those in needThis endangers lives and even undermines the much-vaunted quest for improved productivity – every aged person who does not have access to adequate care will rely (if they are lucky) on a family member who can stop work to be there for them.With4.2 million people over 65and an estimated 433,300living with dementia, there are countless stories that illustrate the urgency of the need; nearly5,000 diedlast year waiting for the letter from My Aged Care offering a package.A foretaste of the political potency of this issue became clear a week before the inspector general’s report was tabled.After weeks of niggling media reports and a Senate inquiry, the government announced that it would make 20,000 home care packages available before 1 November when the new, more costly system begins. Rae declared the political compromise that was needed to ensure the passage of the new Aged Care Act was a“huge win”for older Australians.Not everyone saw it that way.Most of the reporting considered that the government had“caved in”,“bowed to pressure”, “been dragged kicking and screaming” and “suffered a defeat”.No doubt, for those lucky 20,000 and their families and carers who had been waiting for months for some support, it was a ray of hope. Whether that hope materialises will depend on where they live, whether they can find and afford the workers they need and whether they have the cognitive ability to navigate the complex aged care system.Labor’s new home care plan could price some elderly people out of laundry and showering help, watchdog warnsRead moreMeanwhile 88,000 others who have also been deemed eligible for support to continue living at home will have to wait well into next year. The 121,000 waiting for an assessment will have to wait even longer with thousands queueing behind them. The announcement offered nothing to the thousands of people waiting in public hospitals for a bed in residential aged care.In New South Wales alone, more than 1,000 people are inpublic hospitals, unable to return home unless, as doctors are wont to say, “you have a lot of servants to look after you”.The home care packages on offer do not begin to address the needs of those who need 24-hour care, but in the past four years only6,500 new residential beds have been built, waiting lists are now years long, with homes refusing to even take the names of those in need.Some health officials call these people “bed blockers”, and state governments are quick to use their presence to demand more commonwealth support. But even using this language highlights once again the gap between the human rights of older Australians and the practical realities of a system that has known the demographics for decades but failed to do enough.Siegel-Brown does not think the problem is intractable, but says the courage to change and implement a paradigm shift – not just dress up a broken model – is needed.

Meanwhile, Putin and Xi are pondering immortality in real lifeSat 13 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 08.08 EDTShareIwas in bed scrolling on my phone when I read the headline: Hot mic catches Xi and Putindiscussing organ transplants and immortality. It took me a long time to get to sleep after that.Not yet, I thought. I pride myself on my prescience, but I wasn’t ready for the future I had imagined to arrive so soon.Since 2017, I’ve been thinking about the implications of longevity research, sketching out possible futures – the shifts in society, the complications and subcultures. This year I published the result of my thought experiment,Who Wants to Live Forever, a speculative literary novel. It follows Yuki and Sam, a couple at a crossroads at the same time that a new drug, called Yareta – which extends the human lifespan by 200 years and preserves youth – becomes available. Sam takes it, Yuki doesn’t, and the novel follows the fallout as the world changes around them. The story ends in 2039. Naively, considering the billions being poured into longevity research by the likes ofPeter Thiel,Jeff BezosandBryan Johnson(subject of this year’s Netflix documentaryDon’t Die), I thought that was how long it might take for my fiction to become reality.But the tech bros and autocrats are moving much faster, making the question of extended lifespans more urgent. As sci-fi writer William Gibson said: “The future is already here – it’s just unevenly distributed.”I’m not immune to the siren call of a longer life. An elder millennial, I’m obsessed with my LED mask and Trello board, and time’s relentless march always on my mind. My novel is told from the viewpoint of five characters who have contrasting opinions on immortality, and I feel for all of them. But when it comes to authoritarian leaders living for ever, I’m unequivocal: it’s a nightmarish prospect. Especially when one of them – Vladimir Putin – has reportedlybathed in the bloodof Siberian deer antlers for its supposed anti-ageing properties. There is something gruesome about these leaders wishing to hoard time, hoard life, when their regimes are shortening the lives of those in Ukraine and Myanmar through military action and intervention. Our political leaders should be the ones regulating this new technology, not rushing to partake of it. Have any of them given a thought to the societal consequences? Luckily I have.This technology, when it arrives, will not be available to everyone. Inevitably it will be prohibitive for all but the most wealthy. We are watching that play out right now with drugs like Ozempic: those who have the money and inclination drop hundreds a month while others turn to the black market, often ending up in A&E,vomiting blood.Statistically, in the UK the most wealthy are older white men who live in London and the south-east. What will be the knock-on consequences of such a demographic disproportionately sticking around, as it were, blocking opportunities for others around them and for younger generations coming up? In my novel, a character called Maya feels pushed to take Yareta to advance in her career – without the extra time, she might never get promoted. Even Elon Musk, who in 2022 claimed to have uploaded hisbrain to the cloud, could see this, saying: “If you live forever, we might become a very ossified society where new ideas cannot succeed.” (Last year he announced that he would rather be dead than live to 100 – a relief for us all.)This disparity is, of course, nothing new. In England, there is already a19-year gapin healthy life expectancy between the most and least affluent areas. A drug like Yareta would only widen it further. In my fiction, this division leads to a new job sector emerging staffed by an underclass of Helpers who take on the “risky” work that those on Yareta no longer want to do, such as driving, handling knives and climbing ladders. Since no drug can eliminate the risk of accidental death, an intensive health and safety culture takes hold, leading to wealthy “spanners” wearing helmets and neck braces as they go about their lives, wrapped up like Ming vases while Helpers serve as a renewable source of labour, each one a butterfly living for a brief span of time by comparison.That’s just work. The social order itself will be shaken. Dating apps that filter for users on the drug. Parents the same age as their children. Overpopulation, or child permits. Relationships strained as one partner grows older while the other does not (as with Peter Pan and Wendy Darling, or Buffy and Angel, that dynamic is hard to sustain). Romance has always carried an unspoken time limit: “for ever” is only meaningful because our lives are not. In my imagined world, marriage gives way to the Seven Ceremony: vows renewed or discarded every seven years.You might live to be 100. Are you ready? | Andrew J ScottRead morePersonally, I look forward to growing older – to meeting my aged face and accruing more wisdom that I hope to pass on. And then if I am very lucky and have lived to a ripe old age, I look forward to letting it all go. Who would want to be Jeff Bezos, presiding over an empire of cardboard boxes for eternity? I would rather be a butterfly making way for those yet to come.The words of poet Joseph Fasano keep ringing round my head from arecently published poem: “Ruler, the children will outlive you.”Let’s hope he’s right.Hanna Thomas Uose is a writer and strategist.

I live in Finland and so know well that the country is heavy metal mad. It boasts more metal bands per capita thanany other country in the world. Metal has long been the nation’s unofficial flagship cultural pursuit, with bands (called things such as Nightwish, Apocalyptica and Amorphis) acting as ambassadors where few other cultural figures have broken through abroad. But I still wasn’t prepared for what I saw.The gig was preceded by a gathering of the “Crazy Finns” – a ragbag of Finnish Maiden fanatics who have followed the band on tour for two decades. The fan group celebrated their 20th anniversary with a concert pre-party featuring Dennis Stratton, who played on the band’s self-titled debut in 1980. As Stratton performed an acoustic version of Prowler, backed by local musician Henri Seger, the tears started to flow – predominantly from the men in the audience. At this point I realised one of the main reasons for metal’s popularity in a country where the inhabitants are famously emotionally restrained – it offers a rare outlet for collective expression. I won’t forget the sight of these macho, taciturn Finnish men united in their tears and their denims, the instantly recognisable uniform of the metal fanbase worldwide.The appeal of heavy metal might be strongest in Finland, but it goes well beyond its borders. It is old for a musical subculture (Black Sabbath released their debut album 55 years ago), but it is in rude health. Metal has prominently featured in mainstream discussion over the past year, from Gojira’s Paris Olympicsopening ceremony performanceand Grammy win, to Iron Maiden’s 50th anniversary tour, toBlack Sabbath’s farewell gig. Ozzy Osbourne’s death just weeks later was followed by the kind of outpouring of public emotion usually reserved for stars of mainstream music. Given Sabbath are widely credited with producing the first metal album, this seems the right time to ask what music’s darkest genre owes its longevity and increasing popularity to.As a metal fan since 1990, I can relate that in any bar in any town in any western country (and some more besides), you can strike up a conversation over a metal T-shirt or band patch. This is practically survival for some. As a weird metal kid, you were often ostracised, sometimes persecuted. In UK seaside towns in the 90s, such as Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex, where I grew up, or neighbouring Hastings, where I attended art college, teenage boredom often tipped over into mindless violence around music and fashion affiliations. At such times, metal clothing signified people you could run to and trust in a scrape. It is the garb of the dispossessed.View image in fullscreenFans at Villa Park, Birmingham, for the final concert of heavy metal legends Black Sabbath, 5 July 2025.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe ability that metal has to reach out to the alienated and provide a community is not lost on the UK’s Graphic Nature – who play a gritty crossover of extreme and nu metal. I saw them play at the QStock festival in Oulu,Finland, in July – and during their set, the lead singer, Harvey Freeman, explained that many of their lyrics are about mental health awareness, before asking the assembled crowd to “bang your heads”. Graphic Nature’s relentless syncopated rhythm left me – and, it appeared, a good portion of the crowd – feeling emotionally lighter by the set’s end. A little later that evening, the Finnish “Viking metallers” Ensiferum delivered a heroic-camp set, with their long-bearded bassist gurning like a pirate throughout. Their considerable technical ability was only matched by the ludicrousness of their premise and their huge stage presence.Two weeks after QStock I attended the Atomic Grass festival at Tukikohta cultural centre in Oulu – a small event in a building with squat party vibes and a “bring your own beer” policy. Among the seven Finnish metal bands on the lineup, Turku’s Sgt Slime moved a dedicated crowd with a mix of hardcore and metal. Their lyrics reveal a sense of fun behind the bludgeoning riffs, as with the song Escape from Planet Hell, which conveys the torment of having no beer in a post-apocalypse world:The darkness lasted for daysIn the comet’s wakeThe yeast is now erasedThis could seem crass given the many threats to our existence today, but would a more serious message achieve anything more? We live in exceptional times, facing challenges we feel powerless to do anything about. Many seek refuge in spirituality and wellness, others stress themselves further with endless doom-scrolling, hoping to find answers.Metaloffers an alternative to the saccharine messaging of social media and banging one’s head against a wall by endlessly revisiting the horrors of our time on our feeds.As ludicrous as metal often is, it never dresses up the harsh realities and refuses to provide false solace – an approach that appears toboost the wellbeing of its fans. Its honesty hits even harder as you get older and realise what the stakes are – and what it means to have hopes and goals thwarted. Forget the comic trope of rockers with Zimmer frames. Sticking with metal as you age signals your continued willingness to do things on your own terms – an ethos thankfully being passed down through the generations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is there that I learned to fish, to plant root crops and to hunt. I came to understand how to read the weather and which plants could be used for injuries and cuts. Above all, I was taught the importance of caring for the land and the ocean.During bedtime, the spiritual connection to the land was taught to me throughkastomstories. How did this land come about, how did that island come about, why is the river shaped like this or why is there a big rock near that waterfall?

I am grounded in valuing life – human life, ocean life and land life.After six years of hard work, our group of Pacific students achieved what we were told was impossible. Theinternational court of justice made a rulingon the world’s biggest problem. In the days leading up to the ruling, I was nervous and afraid, and at times I even wanted to stay away because I did not know what the decision would be. But the outcome was more than we could have ever dreamed of. Shaking off the bad-faith arguments of polluting countries, the court confirmed what we have always known: climate change is violating our human and environmental rights, and countries that continue to burn fossil fuels are responsible.More than this, it made the rules clear. Taking action to stop climate change is not an act of charity; it is a legal obligation. The court found that every stage of fossil fuels, from extraction to burning, is unlawful and harms others. Put simply, it told polluting countries to stop hurting their neighboursand affirmed our right to reparations for the damage done.For islands like mine, this ruling is a step closer to protecting our children and their right to live with dignity, free from the fear of climate change.A thousand kilometres from my island home, we have now come full circle, as thePacific Islands Forum(PIF) was hosted by my country, Solomon Islands, in Honiara. Six years ago, when we started the ICJ initiative, the PIF was our first destination. Now, with a ruling in hand, Pacific leaders can endorse this important roadmap to a safe climate.But a ruling or an endorsement alone will not save my home or calm the angry oceans. Our fight is not over. Countries like Australia that continue to dig up, export or burn fossil fuels, must take action or be held accountable. It is not easy, but every wave that laps the shores of Fanalei, every gust of wind across the Reef Islands, reminds me of why we fight.Cynthia Houniuhi is an Indigenous woman from Solomon Islands, assistant law professor at the University of South Pacific and president of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate ChangeExplore more on these topicsPacific Islands ForumOpinionPacific islandsSolomon IslandsClimate crisisAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

But as the band finished the US leg of their long-awaited reunion tour last weekend, it was clear:Oasishas finally taken over America.View image in fullscreenLiam (left) and Noel Gallagher of Oasis play their second sold-out night at the Rose Bowl.Photograph: Rich Polk/Variety/Getty ImagesIn the days leading up to the two sold-out shows, it felt like the entire city was obsessed. Coffee shops and bars were full of people in Oasis T-shirts, bucket hats and little round sunglasses. On social media feeds, there was an abundance of memes aboutnewly minted Anglophilesand jokeT-shirtssaying “I made it home from Oasis at the Rose Bowl.” A headline inVariety read: “How Oasis turned LA into glorious Britannia for a weekend.”That all might come as a surprise to those who were in the US in the 1990s. Yes, everyone knows Wonderwall, and the bandhas sold 7 million albums here. But by comparison,Nirvana has sold more than 27 millionin the US; even Gin Blossomshave sold 10 million, and you probably need a second to remember who they are.“I had a feeling they’d never take to us,” Liam latersaid of the US. It was a matter of contrast, as theNew York Timespointed out: they had a top-10 song and No 2 album, but it was nothing like the legendary stature they achieved at home. In the pre-2025 US, it was easy to perceive Oasis as part of a parade of 90s rockers with a few big hits.But in 2025, things have been very different. The US tour, with stadium dates in the Chicago, New York and LA areas, sold out in an hour. Huge billboards showcased Liam and Noel’s faces. There were pop-up exhibitions and pre-show parties. The LA shows drew a flock of celebrities, from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kristen Stewart to Doug Emhoff, husband of Kamala Harris. Even Mark Zuckerberg, whose circuitry was just coming online in the 90s, was there.They made an unforgettable concert a religious experiencean Oasis fanAnd these fans were not just there for Wonderwall; nor were many of them even born when the band took off. On Sunday, the last night of the US tour, energy was pulsing through the Rose Bowl as the crowd formed long lines in the field around the stadium, slowly filing in. The queues for merchandise – $50 T-shirts and $25 posters – snaked so far beyond the barriers that it was difficult to tell where one line ended and the next began. But it was unclear why anyone would need the gear, given that nearly everyone seemed to be wearing it already.The mood in the stands was jubilant, as strangers chatted to each other before erupting into cheers at the sight of the Gallaghers walking onstage. For the next two hours, the crowd was on their feet, singing at the top of their lungs and dancing in front of their seats. The night before, Noel had dedicated a song to a woman in the crowd who had spent the whole night in tears; given the feeling in the stadium, it was easy to see why. And that sense of community was not limited to LA. “Best concert I’ve been to EVER. I’m 59, have seen a lot of shows,and [sic] I was completely blown away,” wrote one fan on Reddit of the Chicago show. “The crowd … people I’ve never met from Texas to Wisconsin where I was standing… were like brothers. They made an unforgettable concert a religious experience.”View image in fullscreenThe Rose Bowl crowd.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersBut LA – or Pasadena, or wherever the fuck we were, to paraphrase Liam – was, in many ways, an appropriate place to end the reunion tour. It’s the city where the band performed a notoriously disastrous, drug-fueled concert in 1994. A roadie reportedly put the wrong setlist in front of some members, so that “they were all playing different songs at the same time,” Jason Rhodes, a guitar tech, toldRolling Stone. In the aftermath, Noel left town and headed north to San Francisco to see Melissa Lim, a woman he had met earlier in the tour. “I took him in, fed him and tried to calm him down. He wanted to break up the band,” she told theSan Francisco Chronicle in 2016. She helped convince him not to quit – the subject of the song Talk Tonight, which Oasis played last weekend. This time, Lim herself was in attendance: “30 years and worth the wait,” sheposted on Instagram.Do you remember the first time? Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go awayRead moreBut what happened over those 30 years that transformed the American perception of Oasis from merely a successful band into genuine rock icons? The music writerLizzy Goodmanpoints to the Gallagher brothers’unfiltered, brashpersonas – a balm for gen Zers who “have grown up in a world where everyone everywhere is afraid of saying or posting or retweeting the wrong thing”. Meanwhile, the passage of time has proven that the songs aretimeless, and the band is a reminder of “a more innocent, obnoxious, fun time, when the world didn’t feel so trapped in fear”. That might explain the sense of overflowing joy at the Rose Bowl last weekend: at a time when every day seems to bring a new horror and more brutal division, it offered a rare chance to embrace camaraderie.The US tour began with something akin to a threat from the band: “America. Oasis is coming. You have one last chance to prove that you loved us all along.”Maybe we finally have.Explore more on these topicsOasisLos AngelesLiam GallagherNoel GallagherWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first two episodes of its third and final seasondrew 25 million viewers, triple the audience of its debut.As it approaches its highly anticipated finale on Wednesday, the show’s main audience is not teenagers but women over 25, and they cannot stop talking about it.“Why Every Millennial Woman You Know Is Suddenly Watching The Summer I Turned Pretty”, rana headline in Vogue. “Why Almost Every Woman You Know Is Obsessed With The Summer I Turned Pretty,” saidanother in Elle.So fervent is the fandom that Amazon evenasked viewers to start “acting normal online”after cast members were targeted with abuse in the buildup to the climax.To understand why the show has enthralled so many women, look no further than its premise. It is centred on Isabel “Belly” Conklin (played by Lola Tung), who spends her summers in the fictional US east coast beach town of Cousins with the Fisher brothers: the brooding and brilliant Conrad (Christopher Briney), and the outgoing and dependable Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno).View image in fullscreenChristopher Briney, as Conrad (left) and Gavin Casalegno as Jeremiah. Fans have split into two entrenched camps: Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah.Photograph: Erika Doss/Prime VideoWhen Belly approaches her 16th birthday, she goes from being overlooked to the centre of the brothers’ romantic attention. Across three seasons, the show leans into the full sweep of adolescent feeling: Belly’s decade-long crush on Conrad and the slow burn of first love, her ricocheting affections between the brothers (sparking a messy love triangle), and the devastating loss of the boys’ mother to cancer. By the end, the core characters have all but graduated from university and are grappling with the sharper edges of adulthood.Fans have split into two entrenched camps: Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah. TikTok is awash with close readings of glances and gestures, whilethemed hen dos,watch partiesandCousins-style dinnersrecreate the show’s atmosphere.Part of the appeal lies in nostalgia. Han’s books were first published between 2009 and 2011, and the adaptation retains a distinctly noughties feel. The dynamics echo the teen dramas and romances millennials grew up with, when aligning with characters became a way of signalling who you were – Twilight’s Team Edward v Team Jacob, The OC’s Team Seth v Team Ryan, One Tree Hill’s Team Lucas v Team Nathan.The show also leans into the booming “sad girl” soundtrack that has become a genre in its own right. It has deployedmore than 20 Taylor Swift songs, alongside Olivia Rodrigo, Phoebe Bridgers and Gracie Abrams. YouTube is full of fan-made compilations set against Swift’s most emotional songs, while some theories even posit that Swift may drop the first single from her upcoming album in the finale.“I think millennials are so enthralled by TSITP because it reminds us of so many great romance stories that we watched growing up,” said Emma Lymar, a 32-year-old business owner and content creator who posts about the show on TikTok.“It isn’t just a teen romance; it’s a reminder of our first crushes, heartbreaks and summers full of hope and possibilities. With only one episode a week, the anticipation and post-episode debriefs in the group chat create a sense of community and nostalgia, reminiscent of how we used to watch our favourite shows in the 90s and 00s.”Kate Mansfield, a dating and relationship coach, agreed. For older viewers, she said, the obsession was not just escapism but “a form of emotional time travel”. “Many women’s own adolescent dating lives were a landscape of confusing signals, unrequited feelings and messy breakups. This show offers a unique opportunity for a ‘dating do-over’ in a controlled, safe environment. It allows them to revisit the intense, all-consuming emotions of first love without the real-world consequences or heartache.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The show leans into the full sweep of adolescent feeling.Photograph: Erika Doss/Prime VideoHayley Quinn, another dating coach, said the show struck a nerve because it recalled a “more untainted era” of romance. “Recalling your formative sexual experiences, and first noticing you’re being noticed, feels a lot more emotionally rewarding than the carousel of dating apps and ‘situationships’ that defines the dating lives of many women. And for those already in relationships, TSITP may also create nostalgia for a time when they felt younger, freer and full of opportunities.”On TikTok,one mother filmed herselfwaking “extra early” to watch the latest episode before her children were up.Another posted: “Me every Wednesday: someone’s actual mum sprinting to watch a bunch of teenagers in some love triangle and crying over it.” A third fanposted: “I’m 30. I pay taxes. And I’m fully invested.”Many point to Han’s undeniable knack for writing swoonworthy guys, who are emotionally articulate, deeply feeling, and usually have tousled hair. Conrad’s combination of curtains, collared shirts and pained silences has been compared to the 90s-era Leo DiCaprio.“Chris Briney’s performance will go down in history alongside Jack Dawson, Noah Calhoun and Mr Darcy,” Lymar said, referring to DiCaprio’s character in Titanic, Ryan Gosling in The Notebook and the Jane Austen character. “It feels like we haven’t had a character like this in so long – someone who yearns for a woman over time, rather than chasing instant gratification.”Mansfield added: “It’s a fantasy of being pursued by men who are not only attractive but also emotionally intelligent, which is an incredibly compelling narrative for women at any age.”Whether the finale brings the curtain down on the TSITP universe remains uncertain. What is not in doubt is the show’s impact: a cross-generational reminder of the power of nostalgia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaWomenAmazon Prime VideofeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a good-natured, sweet show that walks comfortably in contentious territoryRhik SamadderSat 13 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareIndian travelogue shows with British TV presenters are as predictable as they are popular. Here, let me sketch the formula on the back of this samosa. Take, I don’t know, Sue Barker and James Redmond. Whack them in front of the Taj Mahal, then in a tuk tuk. Let them eat pav bhaji. Earnest closeup, while regarding temple carvings. Shot of begging children, while they reflect on what a country of contrasts this is. Much saris and smiling. Close on moment of spiritual epiphany, which evaporates by the airport. It’s a hit!So I am unaroused by the prospect of Rob and Rylan’s Passage to India (Sunday 14 September, 9pm, BBC Two), the genesis of the three-part series being that Rob Rinder’s favouritenovel is the namesaketitle by EM Forster. Should we send Patrick Kielty to a Kyoto entertainment district because he likes Memoirs of a Geisha? Still, the pair won a Bafta for their previousjaunt around Italy, so I decide to give them a chance.A quip in the first episode wins me over. Rylan, overwhelmed by the noise of Delhi traffic, is flapping and squawking, and Rinder accuses him of sounding “like the headmistress of a school for excluded children”. I squawk at that.RinderandRylanare funnier than anyone who has previously attempted an Indian travelogue, with the possible exception ofRomesh Ranganathan. Clearly, there’s something about people whose names begin with R, and I should know.Their wits compliment each other like raita and mango chutney. Rinder loves classical music, fine art, history. His is a dry, wry whine, complaining about the indignity of having his ears de-waxed on camera, or being made to walk the streets barefoot. He describes Forster as the “Liza Minnelli of literature” to his travelling partner, who he’s horrified to learn hasn’t read the book before filming. (“I was inLA with Mariah Carey,” is the only excuse Rylan gives.)Rinder grounds the programme, getting misty-eyed at murals, murmuring explainers of why they’re doing any of this at all, all of which washes over Rylan; he’d be as happy at Geri Halliwell’s birthday, or MCing a corporate fruit cider launch. To square the imbalance, the show attempts to imply Rylan is busy doing logistical work off camera. He has many voiceovers along the lines of “While Rob’s admiring sculptures, I’ve tracked down a community spokesperson/organised a tour of the ghats/scored an invitation to a local puppeteering cooperative,” none of which I believe for a second.His karma could do with some repair. Presenting This Morning last month, Rylan naively complained about small boat migrants to the UK being given free iPads and four-star hotels, a comment for which Ofcom has received more than 700 complaints. He’s on safer ground here, hammering a running joke that Rinder is secretly in love with or trying to get off with him.View image in fullscreenPlaytime … Rob and Rylan’s Passage to India.Photograph: Jakob Borges/BBC/Rex TV/ Zinc MediaBanter notwithstanding, the show is at its best when the hosts discuss gay identity and their yearning for relationship.Their friendship has real heart under the ribbing. As working-class social climbers, there may be a subterranean identification between them and their subject. They too are riddled with contradictions. Rylan, who sells himself as sex-driven and supercilious, is actually kind and eccentric. He reveals he has built a life-sized railway station in his house, and can only go the toilet naked: “Can’t even have a sock.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It suggests that anxieties about the subcontinent’s colonial past largely arise from western guilt. (For what it’s worth, I’ve found this too – there’s a bizarre amount of fondness for the Brits in India.) With encouragement from a tailor, Rinder puts aside his worries about cultural appropriation and dons a turban. “I look like Martine McCutcheon with a thyroid problem.”Rob and Rylan’s passage doesn’t transcend travelogue tropes, but it does update them. They interview India’s first openly gay mainstream politician and Naveen Kumar, a Dalit rapper (the caste formerly known as untouchable) who uses his music to call out injustice. This is modern India, beyond holy cows and street sweepers. It remembers to have fun – there’s a king cobra, a brutal astrology reading, lavish parties with billionaires and royalty. It’s closer to EM Forster, but the novelist would have appreciated the phallic gags … and the attempt to change perceptions. A mildly spicy, very sweet treat.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe watcherRylan ClarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 43-year-old grew up as one of five children of a Catholic priest in the American midwest, an eccentric upbringing documented, famously, inPriestdaddy, her hit memoir of 2017, and a wellspring of comic material that just keeps giving. Priests in the wild amuse and comfort her, a reminder of home and the superiority that comes with niche expertise. “I was recently at St Louis airport and saw a priest,” she says, “high church, not Catholic, because of the width of the collar; that’s the thing they never get right in TV shows. And I gave him a look that was a little bit too intimate. A little bit like:I know.” Sometimes, as she’s passing, she’ll whisper, “encyclical”.This is Lockwood: elfin, fast-talking, determinedly idiosyncratic, with the uniform irony of a writer who came up through social media and for whom life online is a primary subject. If Priestdaddy documented her unconventional upbringing in more or less conventional comic style, her novels and poems since then have worked in more fragmentary modes that mimic the disjointed experience of processing information in bite-size non sequiturs. In 2021, Lockwood published her first novel,No One Is Talking About This, in which she wrote of the disorienting grief at the death of her infant niece from a rare genetic disorder. In her new novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, she returns to the theme, eliding that grief with her descent into a Covid-induced mania, a terrifying experience leavened with very good jokes. A danger of Lockwood’s writing is that it traps her in a persona that makes sincerity – any statement not hedged and flattened by sarcasm – almost impossible. But Lockwood, it seems to me, has a bouncy energy closer to anElizabeth Gilbertthan a Lauren Oyler or an Ottessa Moshfegh, say, so that no matter how glib her one-liners, you tend to come away from reading her with a general feeling of warmth.So it is in person, too. Lockwood is speaking with me from her home in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives with her husband, Jason. In 2019, the pair took a vacation to Scotland, accompanied by her mother, providing Lockwood with the opening tour de force of the new novel. Entitled Fairy Pools, this section is a fictionalised travelogue in which the family bicker in the car and enjoy misunderstandings with the Scots, in the form of her mother’s persistent and doomed efforts to order iced tea. There is a long, satisfying run of jokes about how Irn-Bru strikes the American palate (“a pink electrocution of the tongue”). The Lockwood character gets food poisoning. (“Arugula, she thought. I’m going to die alone in a Scottish castle because people have gotten too good for iceberg lettuce.”) They take photos. (“Upon her arrival, instead of taking pictures of the North Sea, she had taken pictures of elk bellowing on the walls and a little guy who appeared to be penetrating his bagpipes.”) And there is a touching vignette based on Lockwood’s sister losing her phone, containing thousands of photos of her late niece, Lena. “You know that the images are backed up,” says Lockwood, now. “But it’s not the original phone. People have these very warm, entangled relationships with these devices as storing memories.”All of which is precursor to the main event of the novel, a section entitled The Changeling in which the Lockwood character gets Covid very early on in the pandemic and descends into a state that strikes her as akin to madness, a wordless fog in which intense, random thoughts take on outsized meaning. For example: “It’s like Joyce Carol Oates is trying to start a feud with me … does everyone have this feeling?” Or: “I was glad God had killed Gene Kelly.” It was this experience, says Lockwood, that sparked the novel, which grew out of The Changeling’s first lines: “It stole people from themselves. You might look the same to others but you have been replaced.”Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything I’ve previously experiencedThe challenge for any writer looking back on 2020 at this relatively short distance is that nobody much wants to revisit it. Lockwood was acutely conscious of this and while there are some people in masks in the book, she strenuously avoids use of the words “Covid” and “lockdown”. She hopes that her period of derangement works both as a literal account of a widely experienced phenomenon, and more generally as the book’s guiding metaphor, a stand-in for any life event that causes one to lose contact with reality. And in fact, in early readings, she says, “what seems to be true of audiences is that they recognised all of what I was talking about – even if they hadn’t been ill. I also found it interesting that people were so ready to talk about it when it was something that was like: Hey, ‘Close the curtains, do not write about this, we do not need to think about this again,’ which is what happened with the original flu pandemic [in 1918].”I have to confess to Lockwood that words like “changeling” and “fairies” in this context make me extremely nervous. “Do tell!”, she says, gamely. It’s the suggestion of whimsy that sets me off, all the way up to Hilary Mantel’s ghost on the stairs or Muriel Spark’s insistence on believing in angels. Like, sure, OK. But really? Lockwood laughs. “I think you would probably believe in angels too if you could write the way Muriel Spark did” – a fair point. But the difficulty for any writer going the changeling-and-fairy route is to stop the story floating away into figurative affectation, even as she tries to evoke literal feelings of unreality.The fact is, says Lockwood, that her sense of being dislocated from herself during Covid was very real. “There are visual, optic aura-type phenomena that I would experience early on, where you would see strange after-images, or a beating in the corner of your eye – things like that. I think people who have those things learn to live with them and make companions out of them and give them names. But this governing phenomenon has no name to [the character]. She doesn’t know what it is. So she’s only experiencing the sensations, the patterns, the colours, the visions. And the true thing, when it feels like madness, is that there’s no name for it.”View image in fullscreenAs I was reading, those passages reminded me of a line of Alice Munro’s in which, wrote Munro, everything became “a spiteful imitation of itself”. “Yes,” says Lockwood, “that’s very resonant. Did someone come into my house in the middle of the night and replace everything with a slightly less genuine version? It felt like my eyesight changed, like I was seeing things in less dimensionality, which leads to suspicion. These secret nursed hatreds: like, if I’m not I, are you, you? What is a person?”These inquiries of Lockwood’s are presented in a high comic style that saves them from too much abstraction. “For three weeks straight,” she writes, “I have nightmares about being asked aboutcancel culture. It is my greatest fear, to be asked aboutcancel culture– or that I will be so terrorized by the possibility that I will immediately begin talking about it anyway, and in doing so present the opportunity to be murdered by public opinion myself.”This riff falls in a section in which the protagonist goes on a virtual book tour and endures a photoshoot, all the while freaking out not just about Covid but about exposure. “What she’s experiencing is success, actually, but she’s terrified,” says Lockwood. “Is this what success is? It feels more dysphoric than anything you’ve experienced. In any publicity experience you felt very exposed, but more so because of the extreme cloistered-ness of what everyone was experiencing. Everyone pouring their eyes and their faces into these screens.” One can take this point while also vaguely wishing that novelists might heed the following warning: if you’re tempted to write about going on a book tour, it might be time to venture out beyond publishing to refill the tank.Anyway, Lockwood is obviously writing about herself and the disorienting experience both of the success ofPriestdaddy, which won the 2018 Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the viral success of her earlier writing; namely, the poemRape Joke, published by the Awl in 2013, that launched her career, and her subsequent years at the coalface on Twitter, making very good jokes and sharing her comic poetry. (Her most famous sext-parody: “I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole.”) She’s off Twitter, now, like everyone else. “For a while I did Bluesky, which I liked a lot, and a lot of the original people from Twitter went there.” But as the platform grew, she says, “it had a problem with disagreement bots; you would post something, it would get traction and waves of not-people would be like, ‘I take issue with this!’ That made things less fun.” When Trump was re-elected, she decided she wasn’t going to spend the next four years immersed in online discourse about it and bailed.In some ways, says Lockwood, it was her first novel,No One Is Talking About This, shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2021, that proved more exposing than the memoir, because she wrote about her niece, Lena. Lockwood holds up her phone to show me a photo of a baby girl with a shock of brown hair, encumbered by medical equipment. Lena, who was born withProteus syndrome, died in 2019 at the age of six months. In the years since, Lockwood has written very evocatively about grief. “I saw it secondhand with my sister, and then experienced it myself – that it doesn’t get better. It doesn’t heal. You think, OK, a year has passed, and now progress is going to happen. There won’t be stops and starts, you won’t fall back. You’ll continue to have dreams of this person. And you don’t. There’s this thing that everyone else in the world expects you to move on; like, hurry up already. And that’s not how it happens.”View image in fullscreenLockwood describes herself as the sort of ‘impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night’.Photograph: Anna OttumIn the case of the death of a baby, she says, there’s even less patience for the grieving parent in some ways; a sense that “she lived for six months and a day, and that’s such a short time upon this Earth there’s a commensurate idea that after six months have passed maybe [things get better].” But that’s not how it goes. Six years after Lena’s death and all that has happened is that “in the mother’s mind, now she’s six years old”.Lockwood’s broader writing about her family has given us one of the great, dysfunctional households in literature, up there with David Sedaris’s rackety crowd. Her father, Greg, a former submariner turned Lutheran minister, converted to Catholicism and had a dispensation from the Vatican to be a priest with a wife and children. The five Lockwood kids grew up in rectory accommodation in Cincinnati, Ohio and St Louis, Missouri with a father who liked guns, electric guitars and Rush Limbaugh, as well as God. While her father is inadvertently hilarious but has “never knowingly said anything funny in his life”, her mother, Karen, says Lockwood, “really really knows the joke is funny. She’s a big wordplay person, which I did not inherit! I actually have almost a pun deafness. Someone will present me with a pun and I’ll just stare at them. You tune out your mother as a teenager – ‘Oh, God, mom’ – and it ended with me being completely unable to produce a good pun of any kind.”Surprisingly, Lockwood says she is the most conventional of the siblings. Despite describing herself as the sort of “impulsive person who will steal a police horse in the night”, in the context of the family, “everyone would say I’m the most normal. Writing [everything] down is kind of a normie thing to do. In an age in which we have suffered the desaturation of the personality, where we all sound a little bit more the same and colours are more muted, we’ve got some freaks over here among the Lockwood children.”We have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at who is doing thisThis is particularly true of her father, a Trump supporter whom Lockwood has tried to view generously as the victim of Maga’s mass manipulations. In a London Review of Books diary recently she wrote about visiting her parents, “and seeing a Trump flag hanging in the alcove of the rectory, which is not a thing you’re allowed to do in the rectory!” she exclaims. But, she says, “I also had to look at this as something that has happened to a lot of people his age. I’ve seen so many people disappear down rabbit holes of every variety, believe incredibly strange things, that I think we do have to keep our eyes on the ball and look at the propaganda machine – look at the people who are doing this. Who benefits, right? From us being driven from the bosoms of our families because of these nursed hatreds that don’t even make immediate sense?” She says, “I didn’t want it to be true of anyone except this extremely eccentric, idiosyncratic man, right? But what happens when it’s a wave and the wave is overtaking the entire world?”The only recourse for the writer is to expose the fundamental absurdity of these people, a role Lockwood is happy to assume. “I think of the clown as the sacrificial role, the one who’s willing to be a fool and to state the thing that everyone else in the room agrees goes unstated. You take that a little bit on yourself so that other people can cohere around you and have a better time.”On which subject, I have to ask. At the height of her Covid-induced delusions, what exactly was her beef with Gene Kelly? She laughs. “Oh, that he swept through dance in this muscular way and was like: dance teachers are too feminine, and I’m going to bring masculinity into the world of dance!” This is the joy of a Lockwood rant; a wild jag jumping off from a kernel of truth. During her Covid collapse, the real measure of how far she had drifted from common reality wasn’t Gene Kelly or Joyce Carol Oates but another insidious, heretical thought. She whispers it: “Maybe Meryl Streep isn’t as good as people are saying?” My hand flies to my mouth. “Right? What is a human being if we don’t believe that Meryl Streep can accurately convey a character? Like, where even are you?” Her eyes widen with shock and amusement. “Out of the world.”Will There Ever Be Another You by Patricia Lockwood is published by Bloomsbury.

At home with the family, I made sure we washed all our food and even then I didn’t feel safe eating it. I would bring in the post and then be worried about touching the front door. I’d shower for ages, trying to wash the virus away.I’m a journalist, so before the anxiety set in I was a pretty outgoing and adaptable person. But from the start of lockdown until September 2022, I didn’t go anywhere indoors other than home or the hospital. I didn’t even walk down a street for a year and a half, for fear of passing too close to someone.For a long time, I didn’t want to get better. I felt so scared by the world. It seemed like my old life just wouldn’t happen again, that I’d never feel OK being in a bar, a club, a gig or anything that involved being near lots of people. Music became really important as a way to cope – especially a band calledBastille, who I was late to discover but instantly loved.By spring 2022, I was very slowly starting to get better. I was still washing all my food and not going near people, but I was able to walk down the street again, even if I did hold my breath every time someone walked past. However, my progress had plateaued and I didn’t know what to do.Then I had a vivid dream about going to a live Bastille gig. The excitement and joy of that dream helped me realise how much I wanted music, people and new experiences in my life again. I had to get better.My cultural awakening: an Asian Dub Foundation song gave me the courage to take a stand against racismRead moreI started to pour all my energy into my recovery. I became more optimistic. I looked around for concerts close to me and discovered that Bastille were playing at the Victorious festival, which is just down the road from my home in Southampton. I contacted the PR team and was delighted to be offered review tickets for a nonprofit community website I run. Best of all, I was granted aninterview with Bastille.From that moment on, I worked hard to prepare myself for the gig. I began to get fit again. I went into a shop for the first time in months, started socialising more and going for walks with friends.On the day of the concert, we went through the VIP entrance, which was much quieter, so that really helped. I stood backstage with the PR team, waiting for my turn to interview the band. My heart was racing, not just because I was meeting Bastille, but also because I really didn’t want to use hand sanitiser in front of them, which had become a habit. I had to pretend that the last couple of years hadn’t happened to me and, somehow, I was able to. When I shook their hands, it took the total number of people I’d had any physical contact with in the last two-and-a-half years to about 10.During the concert, we started off on the periphery of the crowd and slowly edged further into the centre. It didn’t feel stressful; actually, it felt really good. I remember dancing and feeling happy, and finding the whole thing unbelievable. “Look what I’ve done,” I thought. “I’m doing this!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They were really tolerant of my initial shyness and helped me find my way back into the world again.Bastille is definitely my favourite band. I recently saw them at a packed gig on Oxford Street, and a cramped record shop gig in Southampton. And I always go to Victorious festival now.

The Emmys are back, more or less kicking off the Hollywood award season with a healthy mix of Emmy stalwarts and beloved newbies. Will voters choose between the head (Severance, with aleading 27 noms) or the heart (The Pitt) for best drama? Will The Studio sweep the comedy awards? Here are our picks for the night:No Squid Game? Or Patrick Schwarzenegger? This year’s biggest Emmy surprisesRead moreDrama seriesNominees:Andor,The Diplomat,The Last of Us,Paradise,The Pitt,Severance,Slow Horses,The White LotusThis is one of the most interesting races for best drama in years, and not just because the absence of the most recent juggernauts – HBO’s Succession and FX’s Shōgun – leaves the field open. Rather, its two frontrunners, Apple TV’s workplace hell Severance and HBO Max’s medical drama The Pitt, distill thecurrent state of the television business. One is the model of 2020s prestige TV – an extremely high-budget ($20m an episode!), cerebral mystery box that paid for top-tier talent and took its sweet time (3 years!) between seasons. The other is old network television finally adapted to a streaming service – fast-paced, single-location, straightforward, making stars rather than hiring them. The Pitt is the feel-good choice here, as an actually enjoyable proof of concept against TV bloat. But it’s likely that Emmy voters will be more impressed by the vague black boxes of Severance’s second season. Still, neither are the best show of the year – that would be Disney+’s Andor, a bafflingly under-discussed comet that somehow slipped through the contraction of the TV business. It is unlikely we will see something like it – politically radical with Disney budget carte blanche – ever again.Will win:SeveranceShould win:AndorBest comedy seriesNominees:Abbott Elementary,The Bear,Hacks,Nobody Wants This,Only Murders in the Building,Shrinking,The Studio,What We Do in the ShadowsAnother interesting race, with beloved veterans (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks) competing with popular new series (The Studio, Nobody Wants This). Though it’s still nominated as a comedy, most of Hollywood has finally dispensed with the pretense that The Bear – nominated for the season that came out in June 2024 – deserves to win as one. To be fair, last year’s winner, Hacks, was only questionably a comedy this season, as well. Netflix’s Nobody Wants This, created by Hollywood insider Erin Foster, could sneak in the low-key popular favorite everyone enjoyed binging. But never, ever underestimate Hollywood’s navel-gazing self-interest. Apple TV’s The Studio, starring Seth Rogen as a bumbling movie executive failing upwards, is Hollywood’s preferred flavor of self-roast, and there’s almost no way it won’t win.Will win:The StudioShould win:HacksBest limited or anthology seriesNominees:Adolescence, Black Mirror,Dying for Sex, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, The PenguinOf all the major series awards, this is most predictable; though The Penguin proved that the world of Batman can still be insightful and surprising (if still relentlessly dark), and Michelle Williams gloriously shatters taboos in the lovely Dying for Sex, Netflix’s Adolescence has this on lock. The four-part British series about a 13-year-old boy who murders a female classmate, motivated by online misogyny and toxic masculinity the adults don’t understand, was a genuine watershed cultural moment. It’s now the second-most viewed English-language program in Netflix history, and afixture in secondary school programsacross Europe. A technical achievement – each episode was filmed, impressively, as a continuous take – andthematic lightning rod, Adolescence deserves what it will almost certainly get.Will win:AdolescenceShould win:AdolescenceLead actor in a drama seriesView image in fullscreenNoah Wyle in The PittPhotograph: Warrick Page/APNominees:Sterling K Brown (Paradise), Gary Oldman (Slow Horses),Pedro Pascal(The Last of Us), Adam Scott (Severance), Noah Wyle (The Pitt)It is a crime that Diego Luna is not on this list for his occasionally sublime work anchoring the vast masterpiece that is Andor. Short of that, this is once again a race between Severance and The Pitt, though I wouldn’t discount affection for Gary Oldman as the sour washed-up spy boss in the cult-beloved UK series Slow Horses. Severance may have the edge in the drama category, but Adam Scott is more of a capable ensemble player in its labyrinthine plot than anchoring star. The Pitt, meanwhile, could not work without the flinty empathy and gravitas of Noah Wyle. Add to that the feel-good narrative of the ER veteran returning to a medical drama, and you have yourself a likely win.Will win:Noah WyleShould win:Noah WyleLead actress in a drama seriesNominees:Kathy Bates (Matlock), Sharon Horgan (Bad Sisters), Britt Lower (Severance), Bella Ramsey (The Last of Us), Keri Russell (The Diplomat)Likewise, the lead actress race is all about narrative. At 77, Kathy Bates is the oldest person to be nominated for a lead actress Emmy for Matlock; she put off retirement to star as a late-in-life lawyer motivated by the opioid death of her daughter. I, too, am caught in swell of goodwill for the Oscar-winning actor – star of Misery, Primary Colors, Titanic and many others – and for a network drama making Emmy inroads. Britt Lower may pull some votes for her subtle work in Severance, and Bella Ramsey deserves attention for the heavy burden that was The Last of Us season two, but Bates is the easy favorite.Will win:Kathy BatesShould win:Kathy BatesLead actor in a comedy seriesNominees:Adam Brody (Nobody Wants This), Seth Rogen (The Studio), Jason Segel (Shrinking), Martin Short (Only Murders in the Building), Jeremy Allen White (The Bear)If The Studio hadn’t rocketed into theEmmyswith 23 nominations, tying The Bear’s record for a first-time series, this may have been Martin Short’s year to deliver an excellent first-time Emmys speech for the consistently chuckle-worthy Only Murders in the Building. (Former winner Jeremy Allen White has simply grown wearisome as the overburdened, maximally stressed Chef Carmy in The Bear.) But the Studio is on a coke-fueled awards bender, and though the always charming Adam Brody may be the dark horse for Nobody Wants This, Emmys enthusiasm skews heavily to Rogen, whose inherent stoner-guy appeal makes his idiot-in-charge character bearable.Will win:Seth RogenShould win:Adam BrodyLead actress in a comedy seriesView image in fullscreenJean Smart in HacksPhotograph: APNominees:Uzo Aduba (The Residence), Kristen Bell (Nobody Wants This), Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary), Ayo Edebiri (The Bear), Jean Smart (Hacks)Jean Smart, a six-time Emmy winner, is in the same position as Julia Louis-Dreyfus in her Veep era: as long as she’s on the show, she will win. Smart has won thrice previously for her late career-defining role as the brittle, brassy comedian Deborah Vance. There’s no reason why she shouldn’t continue her streak for Hacks’ fourth season, for her portrait of just how awful it can be – how vengeful, vicious and wounded one can become – when they get everything they wanted.Will win:Jean SmartShould win:Jean SmartLead actor in a limited or anthology seriesNominees:Colin Farrell (The Penguin), Stephen Graham (Adolescence), Jake Gyllenhaal (Presumed Innocent), Brian Tyree Henry (Dope Thief), Cooper Koch (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story)This one is a toss-up, with strong performances across the board, and it’s nice to see the always excellent Brian Tyree Henry get a nod for Dope Thief, one of many Apple TV series that, like Gyllenhaal’s Presumed Innocent, disappear into the streaming ether soon after release. Given the Emmys preference for awarding shows in bulk, there’s a world in which Adolescence sweeps all of the limited series awards in which its nominated; Stephen Graham certainly deserves for the aching portrait of an aloof father faced with the worse-case scenario. But Colin Farrell, who won the Golden Globe and SAG awards earlier this year for his full vanity disappearance in The Penguin, may have the edge here.Will win:Colin FarrellShould win:Stephen GrahamLead actress in a limited or anthology seriesNominees:Cate Blanchett (Disclaimer), Meghann Fahy (Sirens), Rashida Jones (Black Mirror), Cristin Milioti (The Penguin), Michelle Williams (Dying for Sex)Look, Cate Blanchett is, indisputably, one of the best actors of her generation, but the muddled Apple TV show Disclaimer is not a worthy showcase of her talents. In a similar vein, I want awards for Meghann Fahy, who was the deceptively nuancedtrue star of the White Lotus’s second season, but Netflix’s Sirens was outright bad, and her performance in it iffy. Cristin Milioti is delivering career-best work in the Penguin, but voter preference will skew toward the perennially nominated Michelle Williams, whose performance in Dying for Sex is up to her very high standards – spiky, layered, vulnerable and totally convincing.Will win:Michelle WilliamsShould win:Michelle WilliamsScripted variety seriesNominees:Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,Saturday Night LiveI maintain that it is not fair to pit the thoroughly researched, impeccably delivered deep dives of Last Week Tonight against the deliberately loose sketch comedy of Saturday Night Live. I also maintain that Last Week Tonight is a singular television program whose constant drive to be better, to cut through bullshit, to be more empathetic and reasonable, deserves a 10th consecutive Emmy.Will win:Last Week TonightShould win:Last Week TonightTalk seriesView image in fullscreenThe Late Show with Stephen ColbertPhotograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesNominees:The Daily Show,Jimmy Kimmel Live!,The Late Show With Stephen ColbertAs someone who watches every late-night monologue every morning for work, I personally think the Daily Show – Jon Stewart plus a rotating cast of five correspondent-hosts (Jordan Klepper, Desi Lydic, Michael Kosta, Ronny Chieng and Josh Johnson) – is doing the best work at processing the day’s headlines in a way that is both informative and funny, with the appropriate amount of seriousness and cynicism. But this award will almost certainly be the first and only talk series win for the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, after CBS cancelled the flagship program during the middle of an $8bn merger seeking Trump administration approval. This will be one of the speeches to look out for, as I doubt Colbert will pull many punches.Will win:The Late Show with Stephen ColbertShould win:The Daily ShowSupporting actor in a drama seriesNominees:Zach Cherry (Severance), Walton Goggins (The White Lotus), Jason Isaacs (The White Lotus), James Marsden (Paradise), Sam Rockwell (The White Lotus), Tramell Tillman (Severance), John Turturro (Severance)Finally, we have the time-honored Emmy tradition of a White Lotus-off: Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs and much-ballyhooed guest star Sam Rockwell compete for the show’s middling third season, while John Turturro, Zach Cherry and Tramell Tillman represent the stacked Severance cast. Tillman deserves for his unnerving and unforgettable performance as a corporate henchman, but I bet voters prefer Goggins’s especially miserable tourist.Will win:Walton GogginsShould win:Tramell TillmanSupporting actress in a drama seriesNominees:Patricia Arquette (Severance), Carrie Coon (The White Lotus), Katherine LaNasa (The Pitt), Julianne Nicholson (Paradise), Parker Posey (The White Lotus), Natasha Rothwell (The White Lotus), Aimee Lou Wood (The White Lotus)Another, more exciting White Lotus-off! I would’ve liked to see Leslie Bibb nominated as well for her pitch-perfect portrayal of a secret Texas Republican, or for Katherine LaNasa to get more attention for her radiant calm on the Pitt. But this is a heavyweight supporting category between Aimee Lou Wood’s deceptively difficult work, Parker Posey’s North Carolina accent and Carrie Coon’s magnificent portrayal of feral love and jealousy in a friend triangle.Will win:Carrie CoonShould win:Aimee Lou WoodSupporting actor in a comedy seriesNominees:Ike Barinholtz (The Studio), Colman Domingo (The Four Seasons), Harrison Ford (Shrinking), Jeff Hiller (Somebody Somewhere), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Michael Urie (Shrinking), Bowen Yang (Saturday Night Live)The recognition of Jeff Hiller’s heartfelt and genuinely funny work on the under-sung Somebody Somewhere is a classic case of the nomination is the win. There’s a lot of love for Ike Barinholtz’s physical comedy as a coke-addled exec in The Studio, and residual affection for Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s beloved Cousin Richie on the Bear, but it’s hard to beat the narrative of national treasure Harrison Ford getting his first Emmy nomination at age 83.Will win:Harrison FordShould win:Jeff HillerSupporting actress in a comedy seriesNominees:Liza Colón-Zayas (The Bear), Hannah Einbinder (Hacks), Kathryn Hahn (The Studio), Janelle James (Abbott Elementary), Catherine O’Hara (The Studio), Sheryl Lee Ralph (Abbott Elementary), Jessica Williams (Shrinking)The Bear’s Liza Colón-Zayas won last year, likely because her standout episode in the Bear’s third season, Napkins, aired in June and was fresh in Emmy voters minds. Because of Emmy timing, she’s up for that deserving episode now, but the tide has shifted against the Bear. Hannah Einbinder has yet to win for her yin to Jean Smart’s yang on Hacks, and this is her year.Will win:Hannah EinbinderShould win:Liza Colón-ZayasSupporting actor in a limited or anthology seriesView image in fullscreenOwen Cooper in AdolescencePhotograph: Courtesy of NetflixNominees:Javier Bardem (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story), Bill Camp (Presumed Innocent), Owen Cooper (Adolescence), Rob Delaney (Dying For Sex), Peter Sarsgaard (Presumed Innocent), Ashley Walters (Adolescence)This is another tight lock – the power of Adolescence as a“wake-up call”on the influence of online misogyny on young boys does not work if the actor playing the boy doesn’t invoke both revulsion and empathy. Owen Cooper will and should win.Will win:Owen CooperShould win:Owen CooperSupporting actress in a limited or anthology seriesNominees:Erin Doherty (Adolescence), Ruth Negga (Presumed Innocent), Deirdre O’Connell (The Penguin), Chloë Sevigny (Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story), Jenny Slate (Dying for Sex), Christine Tremarco (Adolescence)Another likely Adolescence win for Erin Doherty as a child psychologist uncovering horrifying thoughts, though I’d like to see an award for Jenny Slate expertly balancing despair and silliness as the incredibly disorganized but emotionally reliable best friend to a terminal cancer patient.Will win:Erin DohertyShould win:Jenny SlateExplore more on these topicsEmmysAwards and prizesUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Far right: Fundi speaks with former champion James Muhindi (L) in the weighing room before the 1200m Alico Limuru Cup race.“This is one of those feelings that you can’t put in words,” he beamed in the parade ring after his award presentation.Fundi embodies the growing involvement of black Kenyans in horse racing, changing perceptions of a sport that has been synonymous with the country’s white minority since the British colonial era.“Growing up, that was a sport for other people, not me,” said Muturi Mutuota, who, like many other children in Nairobi in the 80s and 90s, was taken to the racetrack by his parents at weekends.Now, Mutuota, who is in his 40s, is a director at the Jockey Club of Kenya, which operates and regulates the sport. At this year’s Day of Champions, three of the seven trainers were black, as were 10 of the 13 jockeys.View image in fullscreenHorses cross the finish line.Raised in Nairobi by his grandparents, Fundi fell in love with horse racing when his grandfather started taking him to Ngong when he was 13. His grandfather persuaded Steve Njuguna, a former champion jockey and a trainer at the time, to teach Fundi how to race.Fundi briefly worked as a groom before starting racing when he became eligible – at 16 – coming last in his first race and winning in his fifth. The 2024/25 season, his fifth, was his best.The newly diverse scene, he said, has increased competition for jockeys and trainers.Black trainers are making their mark too.Joe Karari, 41, was one of those with horses racing on the Day of Champions.View image in fullscreenAbove: Joe Karari with a horse at his stables at Ngong Racecourse.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: The kit room at Karari’s stables. Far right: A groom washes a horse at Karari’s stables after training.Born and raised near the racetrack in western Nairobi in what he describes as a household of horse lovers, he used to visit the venue with his family to cheer racehorses belonging to his uncles. After completing college, he spent a lot of time in stables, getting a job as a groom and work rider under trainer Oliver Gray.He learned the ropes for five years and became a trainer in 2006, since when he has built his portfolio from six horses from one owner to 26 horses from 70 owners, including syndicates.A perennial runner-up for the champion trainer title, Karari finally won it in the 2024/25 season with five meetings remaining, becoming the first black Kenyan to win it in a decade.Karari is mentoring other black yard workers to become trainers. “This game is here to stay. And it belongs to everyone,” he said after a morning training session a few days before the last meet.View image in fullscreenJames Muhindi, a former champion jockey, checks the race card in the weighing room.The owners of the horses that Karari trained in the 2024/25 season embody the evolving landscape of upper-class Kenyan society. They number among them foreigners, and whiteand black Kenyans. “It’s a mix of all sorts of people here,” he said.K Bakor, a 54-year-old Kenyan businessman who joined the sport as a horse owner in 2022, is also helping diversify it by giving jockey opportunities to young, black stable workers. “We need to get a new generation,” said Bakor, who used to ride donkeys in races in the Kenyan coastal town of Lamu, where he was born.Horse racing was introduced in Kenya in the 19th century, with venues opening up in different parts of the country as the sport grew in popularity. But now, Ngong Racecourse, which opened in 1954, is the only racetrack left.During its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s in Kenya, the sport attracted thousands of spectators. However, its fortunes dwindled over time to a point a few years ago when, with near-empty stands, it was struggling to survive years of steady decline attributed to dwindling sponsorship and mismanagement.Now the situation is improving with more local participation.View image in fullscreenCrowds in the grandstand before a race.The sport had always been dominated by white people, but in recent years, as increasing numbers have left the country, their places have been taken by black Kenyans who had access to horses, stables and training facilities through working in support roles such as groom work.At the members’ lounge above the grandstand after the last race of the Day of Champions, Mutuotaacknowledged the need for change and for the club “to have an open mind for racing to succeed”.“We have to shed the traditional mentality that we’ve held on to,” said Mutuota, one of two black members of the club’s eight-person executive committee.The jockey club is making attempts to revive horse racing through partnerships.Kabir Dhanji, creative director at Kivuli Creative, an agency that the jockey club partnered with in 2023 to rebuild and grow the sport, said his company is treating horse racing as “a modern sport”. That has entailed marketing, advertising and social media content creation, as well as the introduction of pop-up restaurants and bars on the site, and between-race entertainment offers such as music and acrobatics.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFaces in the crowds at Ngong Racecourse.Dhanji said the agency wants to make horse racing inclusive, family-friendly, accessible and “a sport for Kenyans by Kenyans”.“The sport may have had a problematic past – not intentionally – and this was associated with colonialism, oppression, suppression, repression,” he said. “And Kenyans don’t want to be associated with that. They want to be able to come and express themselves.”The efforts are paying off. At Ngong on the Day of Champions, the grandstand was packed with a multiracial mix of young and older spectators. On the turf next to it, spectators strolled about in sunglasses and colourful clothes. A little further away, parents watched their children bounce on inflatable castles. And elsewhere, punters sat glued to TV screens, monitoring their bets. By the last race, there were 5,000 people in attendance. Many stayed on for an afterparty that went late into the night.“It’s become an event, and this is fantastic news,” said Michael Spencer, a British businessman who, alongside his wife, Sarah, is a benefactor of the jockey club and own a stud farm in central Kenya. “Now I’m not worried about the survival (of the sport). I just want to see it prosper, be more successful.”View image in fullscreenHorses gallop down the final straight in a race.The club will have to work harder, though, to maintain the momentum and retain talent. Professional jockeys earn £23 a ride. For the Day of Champions, there was about £4,000 up for grabs in total prize money for seven races. Some jockeys have in recent years relocated to Europe in search of the better pay they can get by exercising racehorses.Sitting on a bench with his friends at the top section of the grandstand, David Mukuria, a 48-year-old construction worker who has been attending meets for about 15 years, was delighted that Fundi had emerged champion jockey.“We feel happy when many black people are involved in the sport,” he said. “It shows that Africans have risen.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayHorse racingKenyaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We paddle into sea caves as stunning as cathedralsThe huge Pizzomunno rock, in the Puglian town of Vieste, feels warm from the September sun as I gaze southwards, watching Castello beach shrug off the weight of high summer. There are a few people in the water or lying on the sand, but the sunbeds and umbrellas have started disappearing, and this two-mile stretch of pale sand is getting back to its unspoilt self.The 25-metre Pizzomunno sea stack was once, according to legend, a handsome fisherman of the same name, who would meet his sweetheart Cristalda on this spot. Unfortunately, the local mermaids fancied the pants off him too, and in their jealousy dragged Cristalda to a watery death, leaving Pizzomunno petrified by grief.The ill-fated pair are said to come alive again once every 100 years on 15 August, but if they do so any summer soon, they’ll struggle to find a quiet spot for their tryst. For two or three weeks every August, Vieste – with its old town on a high promontory, its narrow streets and archways, and its newly restored romanesque cathedral – is a magnet for (mainly Italian) holidaymakers. The town receives 80% of its annual two million visits in the space of less than a month. By the time of theSettimana dell’Olioolive oil festival in late August, Vieste is noticeably quieter, and in September peace returns.View image in fullscreenMattinatella beach, near Vieste.Photograph: Cherry Blossom/AlamyWe’re staying 25 miles to the south in the small town of Mattinata. Here, about a mile from the coast, it’s “tranquil even in August”, a local tells us.Agriturismo Giorgio(doubles from €59 B&B in low season – 16 September to 31 October) stands on its western edge, walking distance from great restaurants such asLocanda del Maniscalco.Temperatures climb to 28C most days, and the summer’s heat has left the sea deliciously warm. On our first full day, we drive 10 minutes to Mattinatella beach, where we’ve rented a transparent canoe from local operatorDove Andiamo Sul Gargano(full day €60). We are aiming forBaia delle Zagare(Citrus Blossom Bay), a couple of miles up the coast, but it takes us half the day to get there because we stop to paddle into sea caves as stunning as cathedrals, and picnic on an otherwise inaccessible little beach. The bay itself is famous for its sea stacks, one called “the scissors” for its curious shape, eroded by sea and wind.The other advantage of early autumn in the Gargano is that it is, paradoxically, a livelier period. The hard graft of summer done, locals prepare to partyThis south side of the peninsula is sheltered from any northerly winds, so perfect in autumn. Another day, we swim out from Baia di San Felice to admire the natural sea arch that guards it, and particularly enjoy a trip onhired ebikes(half-day €30) to view these white beaches from the clifftopSentiero dell’Amore.The other advantage of early autumn in the Gargano is that it is, paradoxically, a livelier period. The hard graft of summer done, locals prepare to party. Every SeptemberVieste in Loveexpands on the tale of Pizzomunno and Cristalda, hosting free shows, concerts and children’s events across the historic centre. Mattinata celebrates its patron saint in mid-September with so many parades, concerts, magic shows and fireworks we catch just a fraction of what’s on. And that’s before it goes really mad with its Octoberolive harvest festival.September is also busy in Unesco-listed Monte Sant’Angelo, whose Archangel Michael festival on 29 September attracts pilgrims from all over the world. The fun bit is a torchlit reenactment the Sunday before, with splendidly costumed angels, archers, bishops and even God himself giving their all in the main square.Later in the autumn there’sleaf-peeping in the Foresta Umbraa few miles inland. Fast forward to spring in the Gargano and you’ll be rewarded with one of Europe’s highest concentrations ofwild orchids, plus more festivals – one celebrating rosé wine in Vieste, for example. Which makes it all the more strange that everyone crowds here in August.Liz BoulterAlentejo, PortugalView image in fullscreenPraia de Odeceixe.Photograph: Pawel Niemczyk/AlamyIt’s hard to beat as a base for catching late-summer sun – you may have a pristine beach to yourselfThe “queen offado”, Amália Rodrigues, said Portugal’s melancholic, passionate ballads “came from the sea, the vast sea in front of us”. No surprise, then, in the 1960s, that Amália chose an Alentejo clifftop overlooking the Atlantic to build a creative retreat.Small waves of artists and sun-seekers arrived in the 70s and 80s, and this south-western coastline continues to attract those looking for a different life; incomers who live side-by-side with locals whose families have been there for centuries, united by the rhythm of the land and the sea. The peaceful, slow ways of rural Portuguese life contrast with the raw natural landscape, and the best part is that it is still blissfully undeveloped.Take a look at a map and you’ll notice an absence of cities or large towns in this corner of Portugal. The main motorway south from Lisbon heads deep inland, before continuing down to Faro. Even the national roads steer away from the coast. There’s no fast way to reach Alentejo, and when you do, you’ll find time slows down.Odeceixe (pronounced “oh-deh-shay-sh”) is hard to beat as a base for soaking up late-summer sun. On its beach, black cliffs rise on both sides, the Algarve to the south, the Alentejo to the north. The large, golden beach is a tale of two halves, with the clear, shallow waters of the river ideal for paddleboarding and kayaking, and the sea offering consistently good waves for all surfing levels.Water Element offerssurf classes year round, plus hire of surfboards, bodyboards, canoes, kayaks, as well as umbrellas, sunloungers and a massage area.There’s no fast way to reach Alentejo, and when you do, you’ll find time slows downThose in the know return toBar da Praia, year after year, in a hidden-away spot (tip: follow the blue umbrellas) perched above the beach at Odeceixe with fabulous views. For 12 years it has been delivering a menu of classics such asAmêijoas á bulhão Pato(clams in garlic, coriander, white wine and lemon).The village of Odeceixe is two miles from the beach and has a life of its own. Social life moves to the village square after the sun goes down and its bakeries and cafes open early. The village is made up of small houses painted white with coloured borders around the windows and doors. There’s a working Iberian windmill, painted in white and Alentejo blue, with views of the River Seixe snaking through a flat valley to the Atlantic.With the intense summer heat subsiding, the temperature is ideal for daily walks on theRota Vicentina– a network of trails taking in nature and historical villages, with inland and coastal routes. Once used only by locals to access secluded beaches and fishing spots, the single-track Fisherman’s Trail is now a well-marked route. There are also24 circular routescovering more than 155 miles, and some shorter out-and-back stretches ideal for combining with an afternoon on the beach. In late summer, it’s not unusual to have a pristine beach to yourself.View image in fullscreenA section of the Rota Vicentina hiking trail passes through Odeceixe.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyFor those looking to pick up the pace,Adventure Ridingoffers horseback tours for all levels along clifftops and through the countryside (as of 2025, beach rides are no longer permitted in the nature park), including at sunset and in the moonlight.Tucked away are special places celebrating a simpler way of life, far from big cities and mass tourism. The pair behindCasa Ateliê, Samer Haidar and Lisa Müller, offer pottery workshops and Lebanese food at their bed and breakfast in a village setting to the north of Odeceixe – well positioned for exploring Zambujeira do Mar, Vila Nova de Milfontes and Almograve.Italian Filippo Pozzi arrived in the area with classical winemaking experience in south-west France and California’s Napa Valley. He set out to restore neglected parcels of land and is producing “unconventional” single vineyard wines. On top of a small hill, surrounded by olive trees, vineyards and cork oaks,Atlas Land quinta(from €100 a night, room-only) is bathed in sunlight from dawn to dusk. There are two double rooms and wine-tasting sessions can be arranged. The nearest town is Aljezur, with ruins of a 10th-century castle and a Moorish village.Inland from Odeceixe isMonte West Coast(from €104 B&B, two-night minimum), a collection of restored rustic buildings on a farm, with a saltwater pool, kitchen gardens, orchards, and tables and chairs dotted about the wild grass meadows.Emma BalchCorsicaView image in fullscreenBonifacio is perched on limestone cliffs.Photograph: Pascal Poggi/Getty ImagesI wander deeper into the maze of alleyways where restaurants spill out and diners clink glassesIt’s not just summer that clings on in southern Corsica, so too does the precipitous citadel that hangs on the cliff edge in Bonifacio. It’s a wonder that the walls haven’t tumbled into the Mediterranean in the intervening millennium, but this jumble of terracotta-roofed homes and shops stands proud atop 70-metre-tall white limestone cliffs, on a narrow promontory, to create one of Corsica’s most impressive sights.It’s a hot Saturday afternoon when I arrive and the narrow, shaded streets within the old town offer a welcome relief. After checking into theHotel Le Royal(doubles from €76 room-only), a bright, modern hotel, I wander deeper into the maze of alleys where restaurant terraces spill out on to the street and cheerful diners clink glasses. It isn’t long before I’ve reached what feels like the summit, but to get a better view I need to climb up the steps on the citadel walls.From the corner of Rue des Bocche, the view is spectacular: the inner harbour below and a jagged coast that zigzags into the distance, framed by a hazy backdrop of mountains. A few steps away on Rue du Palais, an enticing bar,L’Assaghju,is serving aperitifs, including the owner’s homemade chestnut liqueur, a sweet and moreish tipple I sip from a stool in the cool stone arches of the bar. She tells me about other liqueurs she’s created from the island’s many signature products, such as clementines. “Have you tried the local wine?” she asks, pouring me a glass of the muscat pétillant, a delicately sweet and gentle sparkling white.View image in fullscreenBonifacio’s port and citadel.Photograph: Nito/AlamyI make my way back to the hotel’s restaurant feeling a little tipsy, gazing at the towering palm trees in the Place Carrega and peering into the ladder-like stairways of the imposing buildings, so steep I wonder how they get any furniture into the apartments.The next morning, I venture west to the Plage de la Tonnara, 20 minutes’ drive along the coast, to enjoy a different side of Corsica. The surrounding landscape is rocky and arid, but the beach is a crescent of blond sand that descends into a shallow bay of crystalline water warm enough for swimming in October. I spend an hour paddling, reading and people-watching.Lunch is booked a further 50 minutes around the coast and inland towards the perched town of Sartène, where the landscape changes again. Steep mountains lie ahead and I stop atLa Bergerie d’Acciola, a laid-back bar-restaurant serving barbecued dishes under a rustic, timber-framed roof, with a terrace offering views of the surrounding peaks. I order a platter of cheese and charcuterie, including aprisuttuham, with fat that melts in the mouth like butter; the goat and sheep cheeses are salty and moreish. I banish the thought that my journey will end soon and savour the flavours of the island, clinging on to the joy of its many faces for as long as possible.Carolyn BoydEssaouira,MoroccoView image in fullscreenA bedroom in the Salut Maroc hotel in EssaouiraCamel rides, kayaking, surfing and horse riding are all on offer on the long, sandy beachVisitors beware. I went to Essaouira for a day trip and ended up living there for a year. I had driven down from Marrakech (it’s just three hours by road), where the temperature was in the high 30s. I swept round the final roundabout and on to the corniche. The sea was a deep, glittering blue framed by imposing maritime pines, and the sand was sprinkled with coloured umbrellas. A cool breeze wafted in through the window – such a welcome change from the furnace of Marrakech. At that moment, I decided to move and set up home there.In the summer, the city is rammed with Moroccans on their holidays, but by late September and October it’s much quieter with temperatures down to about 24C.I like to stroll along market street around 5pm, when all the locals are out shopping for dinner, tasting fat dates and spicy olivesEssaouira has two distinct parts: the medina, enclosed within high walls, and the new town, which has grown up around it. The medina is small and much more navigable than the Marrakech equivalent, but still with that heady African/Arab mix. Two main streets lead off Place Moulay Hassan, the main square by the port. Avenue Sidi Ben Mohamed Abdellah is known as “tourist street” and parallel is Avenue de L’Istiqlal, “market street”. I like to stroll along market street around 5pm, when all the Souiris (locals) are out shopping for dinner, and fat dates, spicy olives and fresh fruit from surrounding farms are out waiting to be tasted.To be in the centre of the action, base yourself in the medina atDar Adul(doubles £59 B&B), a typical riad; orSalut Maroc(doubles from €200), a riot of pattern and colour with rooftop bar and restaurant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Halfway up tourist street, traditional and fusion music plays from a shop whose knowledgable owner can introduce you to the rhythms ofgnaoua(alsognawa), the music brought to Morocco from west Africa. Dozens of small galleries sell work by local artists, and on Sundays many artists open their studios to visitors in thejoutiyaflea market in the new town.Essaouira is also a vibrant fishing hub, and at lunchtime stalls at the port sell a variety of seafood (the sardines are often freshest and cheapest – head to the less touristy stalls farthest away), which you then take to be cooked over charcoal for a few dirhams. Eat your catch with homemade bread and sweet tea, watching the seagulls and cats fight for the scraps.But it’s the long, sandy beach that attracts most visitors. There’s plenty for the active: kite surfing, surfing, kayaking, quad biking, camel rides and horse riding are all on offer. It is also a great beach for kids and swimming, as the waves and tides are not strong.View image in fullscreenSurfers on the beach at Sidi Kaouki, along the coast from Essaouira.Photograph: RnDmS/AlamyMy favourite thing to do is to walk along the beach to the town of Sidi Kaouki. It’s about 16 miles (25km) and will take most of the day (or jump in a taxi) but you’ll see horses galloping past and pass locals fishing for octopus perching patiently over the rock pools. Sidi Kaouki is becoming known for wellness as well as surfing. Little boutique hotels such asKasbah d’Eau(doubles from €340 B&B for two nights), which has just opened, offer lots of sea- and land-based activities.Every day in Essaouira has to be a sundowner day. You are in Morocco’s most westerly city and the sunsets are glorious. Sipping a chilled glass of wine at one of the beach restaurants, likeOcean Vagabond, while watching the camelteers take their animals home is the perfect prelude to dinner.There are some great small restaurants in the medina and new town, offering tagine, couscous and grilled sardines, but I love the beef wellington atUmiaand the grilled fish of the day atLa Coupole. If you’re up for some fun, try the fire show and magicians atCaravane Cafe.Essaouira has lots to offer but it doesn’t foist itself on you. The people are relaxed, the weather is mild and you get to enjoy Morocco at a slower pace. Writing this has made me realise that it is high time for another visit.Alice MorrisonAxarquía, SpainView image in fullscreenThe view from the village of Comares.Photograph: Barry Mason/AlamyThis is the highest of Andalucía’s pueblos blancos, in a land of caves, valleys and ancient trailsThere’s something delightful – and practical – about planning your next few days’ activities just by looking out from the terrace of your hotel. At theHotel Rural Olivia Verde(doubles from €90 room-only) in the village of Comares, you can do just that. Comares, an hour’s drive north-east of Málaga, is the highest of thepueblos blancos, the white villages that dot the Andalucian landscape. It’s in the heart of the Axarquía, a land of valleys, caves, limestone outcrops, white villages and ancient – Roman, Arabic and possibly Phoenician – trails that crisscross them.Thanks to the village’s many vantage points, including the terrace, you get a 360-degree view of your forthcoming activities.The hotel (also home to the best restaurant around) is a converted olive mill. From its terrace, there’s a steep 100-metre drop to a dusty road below and to the south is the glittering Mediterranean. But if you’ve made it up the winding road from the plain to Comares, then you’re likely here for the mountains, the walks and the adventure.Let your gaze drop down and turn inland along that dusty road. Round the bend, you will join up with one of the well-signposted paths that hem the village. Close to the aquifer that has sustained the village for centuries, you’ll probably see climbers scaling a rock face. The village also has its own zip wire.Now walkers can really get excited. Heading inland, the route called La Teja passes another huge outcrop. In about an hour you will reach the remains of an Arab settlement at Masmullar.Drop into a cafe in the hamlet of Los Ventorros, or head back to Comares up the track for rest and refreshments at the excellentMirador de la Axarquíarestaurant on the village outskirts. That should be enough for day one.View image in fullscreenHiking on La Maroma mountain.Photograph: David Sonder/AlamyLots of people know that the Costa del Sol is barricaded by mountains, but most tourists don’t venture further than crowded places like Ronda. That is a huge shame because the Axarquía needs visitors – no overtourism here – and because a lot of people who appreciate clean air and empty, epic country are missing out.If you have a bike, head into thecampo(countryside) and explore the villages of Cutar and Benarmagosa. If your tyres can take it, bump along the riverbed of the Riogordo towards Colmenar. It will almost certainly be dry, but if the rains do come, beware – the river and the villages that lie along its banks is flash-flood territory.Most villages have a bustle about them once the summer heat passes: gone is the ghost-town atmosphere of the remote pueblos blancosThe majestic peak of La Maroma, the local mountain, is walkable, but at over 2,000m, it’s best to get a guide. The quiet village of Canillas de Aceituno is a good base camp.To venture beyond, you will probably need a car. The main village on La Maroma’s southern flank is Cómpeta, which is good fun and bustling. I’ve always enjoyed a visit to the long-establishedEl Pilónrestaurant.But most villages have a bustle about them once the summer heat has passed: gone is the ghost-town atmosphere of the remotepueblos blancos, where everyone stays indoors with the blinds down in the hot weather.While many of the annual villageferias(fairs) take place in summer, Nerja’s is mid-October, Comares has its Night of the Candles in early September, while Cutar offers the Moorish-themed Fiesta del Monfi in October.And the season is lengthening. In late November I was still in my shorts. November used to be when the rains came.Mark JonesKonitsa,GreeceView image in fullscreenThe Konitsa bridge and Aoos River in autumn.Photograph: Vasilis Ververidis/AlamyThe river, fed by mountain springs, holds the most luminous blue when I open my eyes under waterA small bell still hangs beneath the Konitsa bridge to warn those crossing the cobbles of strong winds. Built in 1870 and curving 20 metres above the translucent green waters of the Aoos River, this astonishing stone bridge is thought to be one of the highest single-arched spans in the Balkans. I look upstream from it into the Aoos gorge as the sun rises over the towering mountains.The summer heat of Greece has mellowed to a warm September glow – and soon autumn will begin to yellow and bronze the leaves of the canyon trees. It’s my favourite time of year to be in this land of mountains, water and stone.About 40 miles north of the city of Ioannina in north-west Greece, the historic town of Konitsa spreads like an amphitheatre over the lower slopes of Mount Trapezitsa. A zigzagging road from the river leads to its leafy squares and evocative upper town with Ottoman-era mansions and Orthodox churches. I’m staying at the wonderful, family-runKonitsa Mountain Hotel(doubles from €90 room-only), and each afternoon I savour wild mountain tea on the terrace with a panoramic view of the Albanian mountains and the Aoos winding across the plain towards the border.As part of Unesco’s Vikos-Aoos Geopark, Konitsa is the perfect base for exploring the wider region. The next morning, I drive 15 minutes south to the Voidomatis River. There I follow a marked path along the riverbank upwards from another elegant stone bridge near the village of Kleidonia through a beautiful gallery forest of plane trees that bend low over the water. In the canyon walls above the trail are rock shelters once used by Palaeolithic hunters; below, fish fin slowly against the swift currents in the shadows of the trees. I always succumb to a swim in this river. Fed by deep mountain springs, it’s freezing whether high summer or late autumn, but holds the most luminous blue when I open my eyes underwater.View image in fullscreenThe Vikos canyon.Photograph: Traumlichtfabrik/Getty ImagesAfter a riverside lunch of grilled trout and fresh Greek salad at O Voidomatis taverna (open daytime only) I drive up into the Zagori region. The stunning stone houses and plane-shaded squares of Papingo and Mikro Papigko sit beneath the limestone mass of Mount Tyymfi, but my destination is the village of Vikos, on the edge of the Vikos Gorge – one of the deepest and most extraordinary geological forms in the world. The cooler temperatures of late September and October make walking the path down to the gorge’s turquoise springs far easier than in summer, and the reward after the ascent is a cold drink at the welcoming Viewpoint Garden cafe, set on a natural balcony above the chasm.Kingfishers fizz upriver and dippers dive into the flow, as the immense geological drama of the canyon and its current unfoldsDuring the years I’ve been coming to Konitsa I’ve visited the atmospheric monastery of Molyvdoskepastos near the border with Albania and explored the beautiful villages of Monodendri, Kipoi and Vitsa at the southern end of Zagori. I’ve watched river-rafters on the Voidomatis, swum in the rock pools of Papingo, and listened to long-distance hikers talk about the alpine lakes and mountain refuge on Mount Tymfi. But I always return to the remarkable bridge over the Aoos before leaving.I stop for coffee and traditional walnut cake at the cafe of theGefyri Hotelby the bridge, and then walk the path towards the Panagia Stomiou monastery perched on a promontory by the narrowest point of the gorge. Pale boulders break the green-blue torrents while still pools by the banks reflect the craggy cliffs. Kingfishers fizz upriver and dippers dive into the flow, as the immense geological drama of the canyon and its current unfolds. This is a place where the ancient contours of earth and water are close enough to touch.Julian HoffmanFor information about conservation work on the Aoos River, visitmed-ina.org.The accommodation prices quoted are for October 2025 and were correct at the time of publicationExplore more on these topicsBeach holidaysPortugal holidaysCorsica holidaysItaly holidaysGreece holidaysSpain holidaysMorocco holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The hills and vineyards are particularly lovely in autumn when they go orange and red. I moved here in 2018 to engage more with food producers. I opened my restaurant, Staġuni, in late 2024.A lot of German Lutherans settled here in the mid 1800s, fleeing religious persecution. Many Barossa families go back several generations.The next generation is coming up now. Newer winemakers are adopting more contemporary styles such as biodynamic farming. The big, robust reds that the Barossa is known for still have a place but the next-gen wines tend to be more delicate. Drinking trends have shifted and winemaking here is evolving too.FoodView image in fullscreenCasa Carboni: the chocolate bomboloni is my morning favourite.Photograph: Tony LewisArtisans of Barossais a co-op of seven small batch winemakers. Its restaurant, Essen, is a smart model because winery restaurants usually only pour their own bottles. But no one winery makes wines that work with every dish. At Essen, you can choose from many more and the tasting room has more than 100 wines.I really like the Italian wine barCasa Carboni, in Angaston. The chef, Matteo, mostly does lunches, with dinners on one Friday each month. The chocolate bomboloni is my morning favourite and the mortadella focaccia for lunch.

My family is Maltese so there’s a big emphasis on sharing. I keep the wine list to one page: it showcases traditional and natural wine making and everything in between. I’ll only grab a dozen or two at a time and, once they’re sold, I’ll replace them with something new.NatureAbout 25 minutes from Angaston isKaiserstuhl conservation park.

There’s a bacon and egg station, venison pies, dumplings, cakes and pastries.We’re lucky to have a fantastic independent bookshop,the Raven’s Parlour,in Tanunda. It often stocks new cookbooks I’m looking for, so I don’t need to go further afield. The employees know their stuff and give excellent reading tips.While its new location is being built,Barossa Regional galleryis a pop-up in Barossa museum, housed in the beautiful Tanunda Post Office and Telegraph station building, which dates back to 1866. The exhibitions are a response to the museum’s artefacts, which include more than 100 vintage cameras, ​a rare traditional black German wedding dress, a ​Kruger pipe organ and a full-size German wagon. It’s a real rabbit warren of antiques.The gallery is the custodian of the legendaryBarossa cookery book. In 1917, to raise money for South Australian soldiers, Barossa women collated 600 recipes into what was possibly the first Australian cookbook of collected recipes.

So I probably shouldn’t have messed with it, but I did, because I’m a tinkerer. I wanted a lot of spring onions, you see, because, together, cooked green onions and spinach are a bittersweet fantastic dream, especially when they’re tempered with some creamy ricotta. But then, to stop it from getting too sleepy, I escalated the fresh herbs, kept the sharp feta (I’m not a monster) and finished it with a fresh lemon and pine nut salsa. Same same, but actually quite a bit different.Spinach and feta galette with lemon and pine nut salsaPrep15 minCook45 minServes450g pine nutsExtra-virgin olive oil200g spring onions(about 2 bunches), greens and whites sliced and rinsed4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely mincedFine sea salt1kg frozen spinach, thawed25g fresh dill, leaves and tender stalks, choppedA grating of fresh nutmeg2 tsp dried mint1 lemon, zest finely grated200g feta, crumbled150g ricotta7 sheets filo pastry(270g)1 tsp nigella seeds60g parsley, leaves picked and very finely choppedPut the pine nuts in a large frying pan, put over a medium heat and toast for about five minutes, tossing every minute or so, until golden all over. Tip the pine nuts into a bowl.Heat four tablespoons of oil in the same frying pan and, when hot, add all the spring onions, the minced garlic and a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring, for five minutes, until the onions have wilted and turned emerald green.Add the thawed spinach, cook for 10 minutes, until all the water has evaporated, then add the dill and cook for a further two minutes. Add the nutmeg, dried mint, lemon zest, feta and ricotta, cook for two minutes more, then take off the heat.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lay a large sheet of baking paper (about 60cm across) on a worktop. Lay one sheet of pastry on the paper and brush all over with oil. Lay a second sheet of pastry on top angled at 1pm, oil that, too, then repeat at 3pm, 5pm, 7pm and all the way around until you’ve used all seven sheets of pastry.Spoon the spinach and cheese mixture into the centre of the top sheet of pastry, and spread out so it’s 20-22cm across. Pull up the sides of the pastry into the middle, then scrunch the edges back to leave most of the spinach mix exposed. Oil any visible pastry again, then sprinkle over the nigella seeds and pop in the oven for 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden. Remove and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the salsa. Pare off and discard all the pith from the zested lemon. Cut the flesh first into quarters and then into thin slices, add to the pine nut bowl, then stir in the chopped parsley, four tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt.When the galette has rested, spoon the salsa over the top and serve.Explore more on these topicsPieMeera Sodha recipesGreek food and drinkVegetablesFoodPastryCheeseBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

Gherkins also happen to be one of my favourite foods, though I usually eat them straight from the jar and rarely save any for all those recipes that benefit from their addition, from potato salads to bloody marys.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I like a gherkin that puckers the mouth with a sour smack to the gustatory cortex. It should also be salty, but not overpoweringly so – some of those I tested tasted of salt, vinegar and not much else. Aromatics such as onion, mustard and dill intensify when pickled, so how much is used needs to be well considered; too much mustard or black pepper, say, catches in the throat, while too much red pepper turns the liquor soupy. Dill, however, is essential.Ingredients aren’t everything, though. How a product is farmed and processed is the key to quality. Many producers claim their gherkins are packed within 24 hours of picking, to maintain that crucial crunch, while others add calcium chloride, a salt that’s used to keep pickles crisp. It’s considered safe, but is it really needed?This tasting reminded me how delicious and useful gherkins are, and only enhanced my adoration for this ugly fruit. I save the leftover brine for dressings, to punch up tartare sauce or asa brine for pork chops. Pickle juice is packed with flavour and perfect for cooking, so please don’t just pour it down the drain.The best supermarket gherkinsBestoverall:Baxters whole gherkinsView image in fullscreen£1.98 for 600g at Asda (33p/100g)£2.50 for 600g at Morrisons (42p/100g)★★★★☆Small and olive green. The jar is packed with dill and mustard seeds, and pieces of pepper. Very sweet at first, then the sourness cuts through, followed by complex mustard and ginger notes, and a fragrant dill finish. An impressively clean ingredients list and a very low salt content (0.86%). And the crunch? Spot on.

Even though they’re pasteurised, there’s a slight lacto-funk, too (either because they’ve started to re-ferment or these are residual flavours from pre-pasteurisation), which I like.Verysalty, though (3.75%).And the rest …Kühne gourmet gherkins with herbsView image in fullscreen£2.85 for 530g at Waitrose (54p/100g)£3 for 530g at Ocado (57p/100g)★★★★☆More cornichons than gherkins, so very different from the others tested. Yellowy-green, with a long flavour profile that moves from dill and onion to sourness, salt and, finally, mustard and black pepper. The crunch is perfect, too. A 10th-generation German brand with a simple recipe; the salt content is a little high, but no artificial stuff in here. Good value, given the sheer quality.Asda pickled gherkinsView image in fullscreen£1.13 for 680g at Asda (17p/100g)★★★☆☆Small, moss-green and with a very tangy flavour and sharp mustard heat. A simple flavour profile with a lovely, celery-like note that lingers. Not too salty, and the crunch is good.

The flavour also opens with sweetness, moves into a gentle sourness, then a touch of mustard. While there’s nothing to complain about, these don’t offer much in the way of complexity or interest, but, that said, they’re nicely crunchy.

Balanced, sweet-sour flavour with strong savoury notes of onion and red pepper, and not over salty. The crunch is OK, but not excellent. Contains “flavourings”. This product won two Great Taste stars in 2022, so perhaps the recipe has changed since?Mrs Elswood haimisha gherkinsView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 670g at Sainsbury’s (37p/100g)£2.90 for 670g at Waitrose (43p/100g)★★☆☆☆A good-sized, bendy “wally” (as my London-born stepdad used to say) with a golden olive hue. The flavour is dominated by salt, which overwhelms any nuance aside from lingering dill and onion notes. The crunch is decent, though. Mrs Elswood is a heritage brand,founded in 1947, that shows more consideration for sustainability than some. Uses additives, though, which detracts from the overall appeal.Sainsbury’s pickled gherkinsView image in fullscreen£1.35 for 340g at Sainsbury’s (40p/100g)★☆☆☆☆A cocktail-sized, mossy-hued green gherkin. Has a soupy and quite sweet preserved aroma, with strong capsicum and onion notes. Unfortunately, the spirit vinegar hits harshly at the back of the throat. The crunch is very good, though. These contain sulphites, which are unnecessary additives of potential concern, especially when simpler recipes are tastier.Dawtona pickled gherkinsView image in fullscreen£1.94 for 900g at Asda (22p/100g)£2.90 for 900g at Tesco (32p/100g)☆☆☆☆☆A decent-sized snozzcumber (as Roald Dahl’s BFG might say), ranging in colour from dark army-green to iridescent yellow chartreuse, but, sadly, I think I had a spoiled jar. There’s a slight saltiness, but it’s overshadowed by a stale flavour that’s hard to ignore, plus the texture is softer and moister than you’d expect. As a result, these are disqualified – sorry.Explore more on these topicsPickling, fermenting and preservingThe FilterFoodVegetablesSnacksfeaturesShareReuse this content"
