As Carrie Bradshaw returns, she talks about being an antihero – and the death of fashionFri 6 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareCarrie Bradshaw was undoubtedly not intended as a hate figure whenSex and the Cityfirst aired. But in recent years,a curious cultural shift has occurred: newer fans have started to see Carrie, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, as the most toxic thing about the horny, headline-grabbing show. An entirewebsite, Carrie Bradshaw Is the Worst, was devoted to explaining why Carrie sucked. (The most common complaints: she cheated on nice guy Aidan; talked about herself too much.) One viral essay posited that Carrie was TV’s first female antihero. Parker, 60 and still synonymous with pop culture’s most iconic single gal, has grown to love the term.“I prefer that to any other description of her, because it allows her to be as male as the men have been. I love The Sopranos so much, and I look at all the times [Tony] was unlawful, and we loved him. Carrie has an affair and everybody falls apart,” says Parker ruefully. “An antihero, to me, is somebody that’s not behaving in conventional ways, and she hasn’t ever.” She pauses. “Am I crazy?” Another pause. “A lot of people love her too, though!”Nobody could accuse Parker of being an antihero; in person, she is considered and endlessly gracious, eloquent in a way that puts her in stark contrast to Carrie, the garrulous character she made so indelible 27 years ago. In 2021, she returned to the role in spin-offAnd Just Like Thatwith the same fizz and magnetism. Seated in a Paris hotel room for the European launch of the show’s new season, Parker is tiny – her tininess magnified by the chicly gigantic grey V-neck she wears over a floral dress – and has impeccable posture, surely a holdover of her childhood years spent training as a ballet dancer.View image in fullscreen‘A lot of people love her too!’ … Parker in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBOAJLT is a hugely divisive show – a marker of how relevantSex and the Cityremains – largely because of its clunky handling of race and sexuality, though it arguably nails the way moneyed older people try, clumsily, to talk about progressive politics. Some fans hated the absence of Kim Cattrall’s Samantha Jones, and the introduction of Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), a non-binary standup who becomes Miranda’s (Cynthia Nixon) love interest. But for many, the revival is a deft exploration of life after grief – Carrie’s husband, Mr Big, dies in episode one – and a frothy ode to traditions that seem to be dying out: getting dressed up on a whim for brunch; finding romance in everyday life. This season – which focuses on Carrie’s relationship with on-again, off-again beau Aidan, a handsome new neighbour played by Jonathan Cake, plus hijinks such as Miranda accidentally sleeping with a virgin lesbian nun – is just as delightful.Front and centre, of course, are Carrie’s incredible outfits. She is always dressed to the nines, whether walking through the park in a gigantic hat that looks like a picnic basket or strutting through her apartment wearing a dress adorned with hundreds of jangly charms. (At one point, her proclivity for heels even becomes a key plot driver, as her downstairs neighbour asks her to invest in –gasp!– slippers.) This might be one of the show’s most fantastical elements: a version of New York where everyone isn’t just walking around in yoga sweats. How does Parker, a local style icon herself, feel about the city’s shift to athleisure?View image in fullscreenGingham style … Parker with Sarita Choudhury as Seema Patel in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBO“I mean, I see a lot of people – women in particular – in New York in leggings. They are often on their way to, it seems to me, an exercise experience of some kind. I’m slightly allergic to me criticising the commitment to athleisure wear … You can’t be a hypocrite about it if you believe in wearing what feels good when you walk out the door,” she says. “There are occasions when I think: ‘People should be dressed up, I want to see some effort,’ but the idea of legislating that is counter to a lot of stuff we’re meant to feel and live by. So, it’s not creative but if you’re comfortable, I mean, who am I?”Perhaps AJLT’s main function, then, is as an appealingly joyful piece of escapism in catastrophically dark times. But in the new season, Parker hopes, the show takes on new depth, too. “I was excited about the way the relationship with Aidan would sort itself out, because there’s a new maturity to both parties, especially Carrie,” she says. “It all sounded good to me – challenging, exciting, fun and hopefully funny.”Carrie’s growth is one of the show’s many changes that she welcomes with open arms. “It’s no surprise that at this point in her life, she’s just more equipped, like we all are. I’m reacting differently to things now because I have a decade more experience,” she says. If she were still an antihero … well,thatwould be a hard sell. “We’ve not seen Carrie at this point in her life – I think it’s developmentally correct, but not that surprising. You know, she’s not been a wildly hysterical person for the [entire] nine years spent on television!”View image in fullscreen‘People should dress up – I want to see some effort!’ … Parker in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBOThe complexity of a character such as Carrie may have caused some of AJLT’s new additions to seem one-note in comparison. Che Diaz, the “queer non-binary Mexican-Irish diva”, was one of its most controversial additions – a caricature of queer culture in stark contrast to the nuanced women who defined the original show. Che hasn’t returned for season three. Parker says she was “shocked” to discover the character was so widely reviled. “A friend of mine brought it up to me, and it’s like: ‘What are you talking about?’ And he said: ‘Yeah, there’s all this conversation,’” she recalls. “I’ve been an actor for 50 years, and I’ve almost never paid attention to peripheral chatter. I loved working with them.”Viewers and critics may have had a problem with Che, but if anyone’s flying the flag for Carrie, it’s gen Z. On social media, Carrie is seen as the ultimate messy protagonist; flighty and flinty in equal measure, she is the perfect avatar for a generation obsessed with debating (and subsequently ignoring) red flags and turning traumatic events into pithy one-liners. Barely a day goes by when I don’t see Carrie’s “Single & Fabulous?” New York magazine cover repurposed as aresponse to a modern embarrassment. Parker hasn’t seen this phenomenon first-hand (“I’m not on TikTok myself – I don’t say that pridefully, I’m just overwhelmed by the idea of it”) but hears about it from friends’ kids.“It’s curious, because their lives are so different – the language they use around dating is different,” she says. “They’re less patient. They’re more punitive. They’re not as forgiving of people’s shortcomings. I’m not condemning it, it’s just what I’ve heard. So it’s really interesting that they feel so spirited about it. It doesn’t mean they aren’t objecting to Big and Carrie’s relationship, or the way he treated her, or choices Carrie made. But people had those strong feelings back then, too.”Does she ever feel disheartened that the original show – a quarter century-old ur-text ofheteropessimism– still feels so relevant to audiences now, who find the carnival of dud men dated by Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha painfully relatable? “I think it would be a reason to feel disheartened, but the show is also about finding home and contentment, whatever home means to you,” says Parker. “I feel that 20- and 30-year-olds should be searching. There should be something in the distance that’s important and exciting, and worth the wait. Part of it is rather dreary that great women of all ages are still incredibly frustrated by the dating scene, but I also see a lot of happy endings.”View image in fullscreen‘Great women of all ages are still frustrated by the dating scene’ … Parker.Photograph: HBOThe culture around Sex and the City is cyclical in more ways than one. In the 2000s, the show was criticised for accelerating the gentrification of New York’s meatpacking district; now, New Yorkers are fretting about the arrival of the West Village Girl, a new city transplant who treats the neighbourhood as “a fabulous theme park … to live out Sex and the City fantasies”, is how New York magazinerecently describedit. I ask Parker if, as a longtime West Village resident, she’s heard of this stereotype, which has caused endless conversation online recently, and she immediately turns sheepish, admitting that her husband Matthew Broderick worded her up on the terminology the week prior.“We see it all the time. I mean, every single place has lines round the corner, there’s young girls dressed in very fine threads everywhere, and they’re all stopping in the street and taking their pictures, raising a camera up high,” she says, holding her arm up as if taking an 0.5 selfie. Parker is rattling off the West Village Girl description with ease; for a second, I feel as if I’m in one of Sex and the City’s brunch scenes in which the ladies pontificate, with relish, on the hot topics of the day. “But I remember they said that about the meatpacking, too – they said we ruined it. I recall being crucified for that. It happens – the West Village is a very charming advent calendar kind of neighbourhood, and it’s been through many versions of this, and the true born-and-raised West Villagers have always complained about it, and rightly so, because it’s priced people out.She continues: “Retail rent has gone way high, the price of a coffee – because they’re not going to the deli! If you would just go to the deli,” – she cups her hand around her mouth as if trying to reach the West Village girls through a megaphone – “Just go support Sam’s Deli on West 4th Street!But I think that’s the nature of these things … you’ve seen the lines for a croissant that’s not really croissant – is it a bagel? Is it a donut? Then they top it off with some whipped cream and olive oil and salt and people gomadfor it.”Today’s New York – exclusively a playground for the wealthy, some say – is a far cry from the New York Parker grew up in, after her family moved in an RV from Cincinnati to Roosevelt Island in 1977 in search of opportunity. She frets about the inaccessibility of the city to working-class people “constantly.” “It’s beyond a concern – New York has become impossible for artists, [whether] ballet dancers, photographers, whomever. We haven’t had the kind of political support in our city to really be smart and innovative about affordable housing and protecting culture. It’s our biggest export – so when we’re not able to offer shelter to the people producing that, and focus on tax breaks for big corporations, we lose what makes us singular,” she says. “It’s like an epidemic, this constantly untreated problem. We all do better for having [artistic] communities. Every study in the world shows it.”View image in fullscreen‘They said we ruined New York’ … Parker (left) with Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis in Sex and the City.Photograph: HBOIt was New York’s deep-rooted arts scene that nurtured Parker’s entire career, from her stint being directed – as a child – by Harold Pinter in a Broadway production of The Innocents to her time performing in experimental theatre to her role as Carrie. It’s somewhat surprising she was so game to return to the character given that she’s gone to such efforts to break free of the Carrie archetype with projects such as the 2016 dramaDivorceor last year’s stage revival ofPlaza Suite, with Broderick, in London – not to mention being a judge for the 2025 Booker prize. Was there ever, I wonder, any reluctance? I read her a quote from 2006 by her former co-worker Cattrall, in which she says there’s a “darkness” to playing an iconic character, because those around you can lose sense of where the character ends and you begin. Parker, who has famously fallen out with Cattrall in recent years, seems to stiffen slightly at the mention of her name, before relaxing when realising the question is not about her.“Being a public person is complicated,” she says. “It asks you to be generous of spirit at times in which you might have a child having a meltdown at an airport, or you’re having a tough conversation on the phone. But if that’s my cross to bear, I’m in a pretty enviable place.”And Just Like That is on SkyComedy and Now in the UK.

Just look at Reform UK’s surge in ScotlandOwen JonesThe party is making inroads among people who once chose not to vote. But as Zia Yusuf’s resignation shows, chaos still reignsFri 6 Jun 2025 08.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareIf you were doubting that Nigel Farage had a serious chance of heading a hard-right British government in 2029, thepeople of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehousejust poured a bucket of particularly icy water over your head. Though Labour won the Scottish parliamentary byelection, defying predictions it would be beaten into third place, Reform UK chalked up more than a quarter of the vote – trailing the victors by an unsubstantial 1,500 voters.This tells a devastating story. Nigel Farage’s outfit seriously outperformed the level of support indicated by Scottish polling: the last four surveys had Reform on between 12% and 19%, yet it secured 26% of the vote after standing here for the first time. This suggests it is mobilising previous non-voters whom pollsters are not picking up. The latestUK-wide YouGov poll, which asked people how they would vote if there were a general election tomorrow, put Reform in first place, eight points ahead of Labour. Imagine if that polling in fact underestimates their reach.There is, however, an important caveat. The multimillionaire businessman Zia Yusuf did an impressive job as Reform’s chair in professionalising its operations:his resignationspeaks to a perennial threat of internal chaos. Like Ukip, Reform may be hobbled by its excessive dependence on its frontman.The SNP, meanwhile, has ruled Holyrood for nearly two decades in an age in which most incumbents are clobbered. The party has lost its best asset, Nicola Sturgeon. Even so, it did not expect to lose 17 points in this byelection. Its activists are divided on whether this loss is down to the party soft-pedalling on the independence cause, or failing to address voters’ bread-and-butter concerns. It seems almost certain that it suffered the opposite phenomenon to Reform: its demotivated supporters stayed at home.The byelection offered up yet more striking evidence that the Tories are being replaced as the standard bearers of the right, as they bagged a paltry 6% of the vote. This is the end stage of a process kickstarted by David Cameron in 2010: try to placate the right of his own party by throwing them endless red meat, making them fatter and hungrier. It’s the same phenomenon that is unfolding across the west: the old centre-right is dying, and being replaced by a radical right that is increasingly contemptuous of democratic norms.Given Reform’s racist claim that the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, would “prioritise the Pakistani community”, its defeat is hardly reassuring, as it still finds popular support among hardcore Scottish unionists. As the pre-eminentpsephologist John Curtice notes, Labour was in fact down on its already weak 2021 performance in this seat, triumphing only because of the fragmentation of the electorate. The result shows Labour is not on course to retake the seat of Scottish power, he concludes. The big message, he says, is that if Farageism is making inroads even in Scotland, its strength has been underestimated.What next? Starmer’s foot soldiers have a strategy. Having achieved unparalleled unpopularity by attacking state provision for disabled people and elderly people, they are opting for a “squeeze” message. They believe Farage replacing the Tories is beneficial, because he has a lower ceiling of support than the traditional party of the right. Our electoral system will force voters to make a binary choice between aLabourgovernment they strongly dislike, and a Farage premiership most fear. The choice is between two bad options – and they’re hoping that voters will pick the least worse.Cast your mind back to the decision of Hillary Clinton’s team tointentionally promote Donald Trumpas the Republican standard-bearer for much the same reason. That didn’t go well. Labour must surely understand how Farage’s capacity to enthuse non-voters raises the ceiling to an unpredictable height. Starmer’s team clearly looks to Canada, where an incumbent liberal government was on course for electoral meltdown, until progressives abandoned the leftwing New Democrats to prevent the hard-right Conservatives triumphing. Yet there are key differences. One is the small factor of the US president openly planning to annex their country. Another is that although Justin Trudeau’s administration may have been deeply disappointing from a progressive perspective, it did not ceaselessly alienate its natural supporters, as Labour has done, including by adopting rhetoric on immigration associated with the far right.Labour won about two-thirds of the seats in the general election with only one-third of the overall vote share. Surely it recognises that Reform could do the same. This ability is only entrenched by our first past the post electoral system, which even the former Conservative minister Tobias Ellwood has described as“dated and unrepresentative”. Faced with a choice between lesser evils, the strategy for progressives ought to be clear: cement a pact between the Green party and other leftwing candidates, focus on 50 or so seats, and throw every resource at them. In a resulting hung parliament, they could force an end to this antiquated electoral system.But the central belt ofScotlandjust underlined an important lesson. The west is in crisis: the rise of the radical right is both a symptom and an accelerant, and nowhere is immune.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionLabourScotlandConservativesByelectionscommentShareReuse this content"

Those albums are powered by a gripping interplay between detachment and intensity; they sound, to me, like attempts to make pop albums without any sense of ego. As if she’s saying: this isn’t a Madonna record, it’s a pop record.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Addison.Photograph: APAddison Rae’s exceptional debut album reminds me of that unimpeachable run of Madonna records, understanding that supreme confidence and exceptional taste can sell even the most unusual album. It’s both familiar – Rae is an artist who unapologetically lives and dies by her references – and totally bold: I get the sense that she is less trying to say “this is who I am” as much as “this is what pop should be”.Rae’s vision of pop is formally traditionalist – she loves big choruses, euphoric key changes, huge builds – but undeniably influenced by her past life as an inhabitant of content-creation HQHype House, after her dance videos made her one of the most-followed people on TikTok. The 24-year-old sees no cognitive dissonance in putting together seemingly mismatched aesthetic or emotional sensibilities, a quality that, to me, suggests supreme comfort with the practically dadaist experience of scrolling TikTok’s For You page. Winsome opener New York explores frenetic Jersey club; on Headphones On, a warm-and-fuzzy 90s-style R&B track, she casually tosses off the lyric “wish my mom and dad could’ve been in love” as if it was an intrusive thought she just had to let out.Addison Rae: Headphones On – videoAlthough Addison covers a lot of ground musically, every song also sounds uncannily like it came out of the indie-electronica boom of the early 2010s; High Fashion, arguably the best song here, is a pitch-perfect throwback to early James Blake and second-album Mount Kimbie; Diet Pepsi is Lana Del Rey by way of Neon Indian. The record’s remarkable coherence can be chalked up to the fact that Rae worked with the same writer-producer duo, Elvira Anderfjärd and Luka Kloser, on every song – a rare feat for a major-label pop debut, made rarer by the fact that big-budget pop records made exclusively by women are practically nonexistent. But a quick scan of Anderfjärd and Kloser’s credits suggests that Rae is in the driver’s seat here; neither of them has ever made a song as laconically pretty as the EDM-scented Summer Forever, or as girlishly menacing as Fame Is a Gun.If Addison has a mission statement, it’s on the latter: “Tell me who I am – do I provoke you with my tone of innocence?” she asks at its outset. “Don’t ask too many questions, that is my one suggestion.” It’s an invitation to take Rae’s music at face value – there’s no self-conscious dip into wilful silliness or laborious camp. Most of the time, Rae is stringing together vague abstractions in a way that shuns overinterpretation, like when she sings: “No matter what I try to do / In times like these, it’s how it has to be”, or returns to the phrase “Life’s no fun through clear waters”.Addison arrives at a fortuitous time: Rae resists the 2020s impulse to intellectualise every pop album and is unencumbered by ham-fisted concepts, Easter eggs or ultra-prescriptive “lore” that tells listeners what to think. Its casually incisive tone suggests Rae might be a great popflâneusein the vein of Madonna or Janet Jackson, drifting through the scene with alluring ease and a gimlet eye. But she’d probably tell me I’m overthinking it.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Their feud is revealing a fatal flaw in the Maga projectFri 6 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe scriptwriters of Trump: the Soap Opera are slipping. The latest plot development – the epic falling-out between the title character and his best buddy,Elon Musk– was so predictable, and indeed predicted, that it counts as the opposite of a twist. Still, surprise can be overrated. Watching the two men – one the richest in the world, the other the most powerful – turn on each other in a series of ever-more venomous posts on their respective social media platforms has been entertainment of the highest order. X v Truth: it could be a Marvel blockbuster.But this is more than mere popcorn fodder. Even if theyeventually patch things up, the rift between the president and Musk has exposed a divide inside the contemporary right, in the US and beyond – and a fatal flaw of the Trump project.Naturally, much of it is personal. That’s why so many declared from the start that this was astar-cross’dbromance, whose destiny was only ever heartbreak. Even asMusk was declaring, back in February, that “I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man,” wiser heads knew it was doomed. The egos were too large, the narcissism too strong, for their love to survive. In the Trump universe, as in the Musk galaxy, there is room for only one sun.In their case, the personal combines with business. On this reading, Musk’s disenchantment began in his pocket, his opposition to Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”, or “BBB”, currently before Congress,fuelled chieflyby the legislation’s axing of a $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of electric vehicles. With Tesla sales plunging, Musk needed that incentive to lure potential Tesla customers and was furious with Trump for scrapping it. That’s certainly the storyTrump is telling. “I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted … and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted.The suggestion that Musk’s driving motive was profit seems to have particularly antagonised the billionaire, prompting him to call for his former paramour to be impeached andto claim thatTrump is named in the Jeffrey Epstein files, in effect implicating the president in a paedophile ring. Musk wants to present his objection not as self-serving but as ideological, casting himself as the fiscal conservative appalled by Trump’s“disgusting abomination”of a bill because it will increase the already gargantuan US deficit by trillions of dollars.Who’s right? It seems a stretch to argue that Trump’s hostility to electric cars was the problem: as Trump himself pointed out, Musk knew about that when he jumped on the Maga train last year. As for ballooning the deficit, you can see why that would irritate Musk. Adding trillions in red ink makes a mockery of the “cost-cutting” drive he headed up with his so-called department of government efficiency.The billionaire was already smarting from the failure of Doge to cut anything like the$2tn in spendinghe promised would be easy. All he succeeded in doing by, for instance, feeding the US agency for international development, or USAID, into “the wood chipper” was to take the lives of 300,000 people, most of them children, who had depended on that agency and its grants, according to aBoston University study. Even if you are minded, charitably, to accept Musk’s own estimate, he only shrank the federal budget by about$150bn. To watch as that effort was cancelled out by a $600bn tax cut to people earning more than $1m a year would be a humiliation indeed.Whatever its true cause, the Trump-Musk spat has illuminated a fault line in the right – and not only in the US. Battered and quieted by the Trump phenomenon, there still remain a few old-school conservatives with a vestigial presence in the Senate, for whom fiscal rectitude remains an article of faith. While Democrats oppose the “BBB” because its cuts to Medicaid will deprivemore than 10 millionAmericans of basic health cover, these traditional Republicans are queasy about the Liz Truss-style risks of a massive unfunded tax giveaway. Overnight, Musk has become their champion.Ranged against them are the forces of nationalist conservatism, embodied by former Trump strategist and ex-convict Steve Bannon. They don’t have a libertarian yearning for a minimal state; on the contrary, they quite like muscular displays of state power. WitnessTrump’s insistenceon a Pyongyang-style military parade to celebrate his birthday, and note Bannon’s response to Musk’s impudence in challenging the ruler – he called for Musk’s businesses, Starlink and SpaceX,to be nationalised. Indeed, nationalist conservatism might not be quite the right term for what Bannon offers: nationalist socialism might be more apt, though something close to that has already been taken.There have been other manifestations of this divide. Muskopposed Trump’s tariffs; Bannon is for them. Musk wanted to see the US remain open tohigh-skilled, tech-savvy immigrants; Bannon wants to shut the door on them. These, then, are the two camps. (You can see similar faultlines on the British right, dividing Thatcherite Conservatives from Reform UK.) For a while, the anti-woke loathing of DEI policies was strong enough to keep the opposing blocs – free traders and protectionists; deficit hawks and big spenders – together. But that glue, as Trump said of Musk, is “wearing thin”.That has some serious implications forUS politicsand Trump’s presidency. It is conceivable that Trump won’t have the numbers to pass this bill, his central legislative goal, in its current form: the Republican majority in the House is wafer-thin, and one more defecting Republican could sink the proposal in the Senate. Musk has given would-be dissenters cover. The gazillionaire had promised to spend big to help Republicans in the November 2026 midterm elections. Much can happen between now and then, but Trump may now need to look elsewhere for a patron. Who knows, Musk might even follow through on his threat to fund the president’s Democratic opponents. Even if he does not go that far, he controls a prime platform of the right: X could soon become hostile territory for Trump. The point is, Musk is not your usual Trump antagonist. He has as loud a megaphone, and more money, than the president.It all adds up to a sad tale of two men who once had so much in common – perhaps one thing above all. Each has been lucky enough to find themselves in charge of a brand that once enjoyed global admiration and clout – and each man has systematically set about trashing that brand in the eyes of the world. Musk has done it more than once. He bought what had become an admittedly imperfect meeting place of some of the planet’s most influential people, Twitter, and turned it into a sewer of bigotry and lies, X. He built a company, Tesla, whose most obvious customers were high earners concerned about the planet and repelled them by association with a nationalist authoritarian who wants to “drill, baby, drill”.Trump, meanwhile, has taken the US, once a magnet for talent from across the globe, and done his best to dismantle all that made it attractive: its stability, its protection of free speech, the independence of its institutions, the quality of its science and universities. This week’s moves – thetravel ban, the suspicion of overseas students, the war on Harvard – to say nothing of the ongoing hostility to democratic allies and coddling of foreign dictators, are just the latest instances of Trump doing to the US brand what Musk has done to Twitter and Tesla. No wonder Trump and Musk have broken up: they were always far too alike.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Despite a wardrobe bulging with dresses, you obviously don’t have anything to wear. If there’s a rigid dress code, you risk not feeling yourself; but if there is a dress code that reads “Big Lebowski meets Brat meets Blue Planet”, then there’s a very real possibility that you’re going to strike a bum note.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Of course, a big part of what you decide to wear will depend on where the nuptials will take place – church or country home, beach or barn – and the weather. Either way, the crucial thing is to choose a dress that guarantees comfort as well as style, one that will see you through from ceremony to best man’s speech and propping up the dancefloor for many hours after.So if you fear that your otherwise well-dressed self might pick out a dud this wedding season – one that will be worn once and then relegated to the depths of your cupboard – worry not. We’ve searched online and off to find you the best wedding guest dresses, with options that will not only work for a variety of settings but also can be worn many times over.The best dresses for summer weddingsView image in fullscreenPaintedKozo dress£185 at Emiko StudiosThis oversized linen dress might not be one that you’d normally have down as “wedding guest” attire, but it’s sure to be comfortable and forgiving long into a day of festivities. Plus, did I mention it has pockets? Statement jewellery and shoes are all that’s needed to take it from everyday to wedding-worthy.View image in fullscreenBias-cut maxidress£44 at John LewisAnother perfect example of a dress that’s what you make of it. It’s simple, but structurally it’s sound – elegantly cut on the bias in a chocolate brown that will look smart with this season’s butter-yellow trend. It’s also a bargain, although cheap comes at a price: it’s made of polyester.View image in fullscreenSlip dress£155 at Folk ClothingThis is the perfect example of a very lovely dress that would happen to work brilliantly as a wedding guest dress. The viscose cotton mix ensures it hangs beautifully, while the tulip print looks like it came straight from a Paul Gauguin artwork. Cinch in the waist with a belt and add some jewels for weddings; or wear with a T-shirt or shirt and flats for daytime chic.View image in fullscreenSilk dress£179 at ArketMade from silk with washing instructions that will be music to your ears – “do not dry clean” – this dress looks subtle, but the delicate reverse ombre adds just enough interest to make it a real winner. Paired with a blazer or a denim jacket, it can happily be adapted for work and play.View image in fullscreenYardeen brick striped cowl neck dress£65 at the MercantileIt might be the bold print that first grabs the attention – although I’d argue that if leopard print is a neutral, then why not zebra print, too? – but it’s the subtle, pretty cowl neck that keeps it. Ichi is a Danish company that’s available through a few UK stockists, and this dress has Scandi design DNA written all over it.View image in fullscreenRobin dress£249 at Sika DesignsA proper showstopper. Designed in London and handmade in Ghana from breathable batik cotton, the ruffles bring drama, and the asymmetric hem will inject some energy into any shapes you plan to throw to any Whitney Houston classic. Granted, it might not be the easiest dress to wear to the office afterwards, but the cotton lends itself to being dressed down with trainers on a summer day.View image in fullscreenA-line linen-blend maxidress£115 at Cos£115 at H&MSometimes the best option is the simplest. This elegant dress, made from lyocell and linen with a cotton lining, might not look the most interesting, but its clean lines and fluid movement will certainly give you an air of confidence – which can be half the battle when dressing for an occasion. Add bold bangles or sculptural earrings for a bit of zeal.View image in fullscreenSeamed dress in stretch linen£165 at EverlaneAnother simple style, this time from ethically andsustainably minded company Everlane, which is sure to look spectacular with the right accoutrements. Made with stretch linen, the construction is smart and will be flattering on various body shapes. Paired with a bag in a contrasting colour – bright pink, say – it will certainly pack a punch.View image in fullscreenPineapple stripedress£185 at Pink City PrintsIf you’re feeling wedding cocktails, then this piña colada-evoking number will certainly get you in the mood. Made from organic cotton block-printed by hand in India, the smock design will offer some forgiveness as that fourth course arrives. The fluted sleeves will spell relief for anyone who isn’t joyous about their upper arms, too. Again, I will never not laud a frock with pockets – for when the tiny bag you arrived with starts to feel like a burden, but you still want your lip balm to hand.View image in fullscreenDelphina watercolour floral dress£245 at KitriIf finding matching items is a headache you can do without, then this floral print dress is statement enough. Its asymmetric styling, frilled neckline and a just-above-the-knee side split mean you needn’t worry about having to style it up – let the dress do all the talking. It will be your wedding guest go-to for years to come.View image in fullscreenMilan midi£98 at Free PeopleSex and the City fans might see a striking resemblance to the DKNY SS/99 dress thatCarrie wore to Miranda’s interior designer’s wedding in series 2, episode 7. For everyone else, this vintage-inspired midi with full skirt will flatter countless shapes and keep you comfy through that second piece of wedding cake. Wear with sunglasses in a contrasting colour for a daytime do – I like the idea of grass-green with the pink.View image in fullscreenGreen bow backmidi dress£150 at Nobody’s Child£150 at AsosFair warning: this dress from the London-based womenswear brand Nobody’s Child could, in a certain light, look a little bridesmaidy.View image in fullscreenBut with its unusual sage colour, flattering bodice and sweetheart neckline, we think it’s interesting enough to take the risk. While repeat wear would be easy, it’s also available to rent via the Nobody’s Child link above.View image in fullscreenSandrine midi dress£195 at RixoA great bet for a wedding that you know will run into the wee hours, the leopard print also means you’ll be able to wear this dress to multiple dos. Beware, however, that Rixo is a classic wedding guest outfit go-to, so you run the risk of literally meeting your match – this does also mean thatthe rental market is rich with pickings, though.View image in fullscreenCommot gold smocked dress£105 at Kemi TelfordStretchy, soft and shiny, this dress ticks a lot of boxes. The work of a London-based fashion brand that draws inspiration from its founder’s Nigerian heritage, it’s a dress that demands a good time. A few words to the wise – go easy with the accessories; it sparkles plenty on its own.View image in fullscreenAlicia smock midi dress£169 at Baukjen£169 at John LewisMade from organic cotton poplin, you wouldn’t go far wrong turning up to anything but the smartest of nuptials in this.Polka dotsmight be enjoying particular plaudits right now, but this dress won’t feel past it even after the fashion pundits have moved on to something else.View image in fullscreenMini dress£153 at Farfetch£195 at GanniTraditionally seen as more funereal than fun, black is a controversial choice for a celebration of love. But hear me out. The short length of this cotton poplin dress, from sustainably minded Scandi brand Ganni, helps to make it less wake and more wedding, as does the ruffle hem and tie closure around the back. Team it with a few pops of bright colour – fuchsia or vibrant orange, perhaps – and I think you’ll be well on your way to a great wedding-guest look.View image in fullscreenSilk organza layered dress£350 at Rise & FallThe most expensive dress on the list, this number from Rise & Fall deserves a spot here, not least because it will work hard in your wardrobe for years to come. Made entirely from silk – including the organza silk overlay and sand-washed silk satin slip – in this red colour, it’s a special dress for special occasions.View image in fullscreenZelmacrinklesleevelessdress£195 at Vivere£195 at John LewisIf an interesting silhouette is what you’re after, with its sternum-adjacent cut-out and asymmetric hem, this dress delivers. We especially like the pre-crinkled finish, which means that any creases that come after a few hours of sitting won’t totally derail the look. It’s a style the likes ofGreta Gerwigknow well.View image in fullscreenV-neck frill detailmidaxidress£45 at Marks & SpencerOffering the kind of drop-waist that’s popping up (or down) a lot at the moment, this is floral brought right up to date. Its relaxed feel and flattering frill neckline will serve you well, from wedding dancefloors to casual dinners and summer lounging.View image in fullscreenSuki linen dress£145 at Beyond NineNot all weddings require you to dress super-smart. If you’re heading to a more relaxed event this wedding season, then this dress from the maternity-and-beyond brand Beyond Nine could be a good pick. It will make a statement with its bold stripes in coral pink and mustard, but in a more laid-back manner. Made in the UK from Oeko-Tex linen, the shirred back is a nice aesthetic and practical touch.View image in fullscreenTheFruitPicker sleeveless dress£208 at Les AnimauxThis dress won’t work for all weddings. For more formal ones, it’s out – but for a more casual summer wedding, it will be just the thing, and something you can then wear on repeat for many summers to come. Made from organic cotton drill in the UK, it’s hand-finished at the brand’s Margate studio. At first sight, it’s definitely more workwear than wedding, but a splash of silver jewellery will help up its ante.View image in fullscreenMaze print dress£155 at ToastWith a print that will befuddle bleary eyes late at night, this dress from slow-fashion champion Toast is a winner. I’m sounding another klaxon for the inclusion of pockets and also nodding to the pleasing corozo buttons – the kind of finishing touch for which Toast is well known. (It’s worth noting that Vinted is a bonanza of secondhand Toast, for a fraction of the price and fit for a big day. Seehereandhere.)View image in fullscreenDraped tie detail dress£255 at Jigsaw£255 at NextWhen it comes to sophistication, this dress wins hands down. For the cut, the drape, and most of all, the combination of oxblood and Jigsaw’s own Hockney Blue. It feels like the kind of hue play that would makeFrench chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, a 19th-century colour theorist and inventor of a complementary colour wheel, gleeful.View image in fullscreenBea cami andCharlotte midi skirtCami£65 at Damson Madder£65 at Urban OutfittersSkirt£75 at Damson Madder£80 at AnthropologieWith repeat wear in mind, separates are a great shout. Made largely of organic cotton, this cami and skirt from London-based brand Damson Madder are a particularly good option for weddings and beyond. Keep accessories to a minimum and let the colour and bows do the talking.View image in fullscreenAlexatop and Elisemidi skirtTop£150 at Harvey Nichols£169 at RevolveSkirt£250 at Harvey Nichols£262 at RevolveThe price of this skirt and top combination might set you back a pretty penny, but one or the other could work multiple ways alongside existing items in many wardrobes. Together is perhaps where the magic lies for a wedding outfit, though. Made of flax linen, this set is floral, but it feels fresh rather than bogged down in any weeds.View image in fullscreenMulticolour printdress£127.50 at Junior EditionThis dress, crafted from organic cotton, is the work of a Spanish brand that’s finding fans outside Spain, as well as outside its initial customer base in this case (Bobo Choses started out as childrenswear). Made from organic cotton, the print feels 80s. Although more subtle Memphis style thanboom boom.View image in fullscreenFluid short dress£240 at Selfridges£247 at FarfetchThe genius of this dress is that you can wear it with anything and it will feel special. I have worn a similar one, also from Scandi-brand Stine Goya, for weddings over slip-skirts as well as over jeans for bar nights out and birthday dos. Made of polyester, albeit some of it recycled, it’s one to buy with thought and treasure for life.View image in fullscreenBirds ofParadise maxidressand belt£225 at Me+EmBusy and graphic but still somehow simple, this dress is the work of the brand favoured by Victoria Starmer and Angela Rayner. Make of that what you will. The ruching will be a friend on a long day, and the necktie could double as a fun prop for dancing.View image in fullscreenIvymini dress£145 at AligneJust the right side of something Tinkerbell would wear, this dress is made from a jacquard material that will magically hold its shape. The structured silhouette is the draw here, but then so too is the Mountain Dew green. Puff sleeves and pockets make it a party staple.View image in fullscreenPriam draped dress£45 at Ninety PercentThis maxidress is made from MicroModal – a viscose fabric made from renewable wood sources –by a brand that puts thought into sustainability. While the brown might not feel super summery, the ruched detailing and draping effect of the lightweight fabric certainly is. Use it as a simple backdrop for bold accessories.Ellie Violet Bramley is awriter who has been delving into style and what it means for nearly a decade – mostly for the Guardian’s fashion deskExplore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterWeddingsWomen's dressesSkirtsWomen's topsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Malyuk had been his deputy.There have been high-profile successes over the last three years. One stunt – a photograph of Malyuk holding a bruised Dmitry Kozyura, the head of the SBU’s counter-terrorism department, by the scruff of the neck at the time of his arrest on suspicion of being a Russian double agent – attracted the coverage for which it was designed.View image in fullscreenMalyuk (right) and Dmitry Kozyura, head of SBU counter-intelligence, at the time of his arrest.Photograph: Security Services of UkraineWhen Zakhar Prilepin, a Russian paramilitary leader, survived a suspected SBU sponsored assassination attempt, one of a series targeting Ukrainian foes at the time, Malyuk made headlines by commenting that Prilepin’s “pelvis and legs were severely injured, and, sorry, he lost his genitals”. “Therefore, it is God’s will that he continue to live and enjoy life”, he added drily.Meanwhile, Sea Baby marine drones, the SBU’s own invention, are credited with striking 11 Russian military ships and pushing the Black Sea fleet “all the way to Novorossiysk”.Though none of this compares to the global attention drawn by the 1 June attacks that were said to have been masterminded by Malyuk.“I am confident that the SBU operations led by Vasyl Malyuk will be the subject of books and films,” said one SBU officer on condition of anonymity. “Because compared to what the security service is doing now, Hollywood is nervously smoking on the sidelines.”4:42Ukraine releases dramatic FPV footage of drone attack on Russian airbases – videoThe number of Russian aircraft permanently put out of action by the attack on four bases on Sunday is disputed, withUkraineclaiming to have destroyed 41. US intelligence officials suggest that 10 combat aircraft were destroyed and up to 20 damaged.Whatever the physical cost, the footage of the 117 drones flying out from the top of lorries to strike deep into Russia, and without the aid of western weaponry, has struck a psychological blow.Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, claimed it had “changed the paradigm and dynamics” of the faltering peace talks with Russia in Istanbul on Tuesday. It was followed by a massive underwater blast targeting the key road and rail bridge connecting the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula to Russia, damaging its supports.The attacks were serious enough forVladimir Putin to inform Donald Trump in a transatlantic call that he would “respond”. Four people in Kyiv were killed in the early hours of Friday morning afterthat vengeance was deliveredin the form of a heavy barrage and drone attack on the capital.View image in fullscreenMalyuk studying a map of Russia’s strategic aviation locations in his office in Ukraine.Photograph: Ukrainian Security Service via APSo who is the security chief who has got Putin’s attention?“He’s a bulldog,” said one senior Ukrainian official who has worked closely with Malyuk. “He isn’t an intellectual, he doesn’t reflect, or hesitate. He is purposeful.”“But he isn’t evil–that’s important,” the source added. “Often those heading these organisations are evil. Malyuk doesn’t want to hurt anyone but he knows that sometimes he has to.”Malyuk was born in the city of Korostyshiv, 80 miles (130km) west of Kyiv, and it is said he was determined to join the SBU after it emerged as an independent body from the KGB following the breakup of the Soviet Union. He enrolled at 17 and attended the SBU’s academy, finding friends most easily among those with a mutual appreciation of sport and exercise, and graduating with a degree in jurisprudence in 2005.“He was very calm in his youth,” said a source who knew him then. “He was always physically very strong. He was constantly training in the gym. He believes that when a person goes in for sports, he is disciplined and organised. He used to box, they say he injured his arm at some stage.”Unlike British or American domestic counter-intelligence, the SBU rolls up secret service operations with the sort of tasks that might fall to the police and special forces. Malyuk spent a large part of his career in anti-corruption and tackling organised crime. He rose to the position of deputy head of the SBU in his local city by 2019 which was when he first came across Zelenskyy, who was in the first months of his presidency.“He got into a helicopter with Zelenskyy and began to show him all the violations in the Zhytomyr region,” said an SBU source. “He showed him where amber was being illegally mined. Zelenskyy was impressed and said: ‘I give Malyuk the authority to deal with these problems.’”Operation Spiderweb: a visual guide to Ukraine’s destruction of Russian aircraftRead moreA few months before Russia launched its full-scale war, there was a brief sojourn into the world of politics when he was made a deputy to the interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky. Sources said he had never shown any ambition to have a political career, something that has recommended him to many in intelligence circles, and he swiftly rejoined the SBU after Russia’s invasion.The organisation was in a sorry state. The head of the spy agency in the Kherson region had withdrawn his agents ahead of Russia’s occupation against Zelenskyy’s orders.Bakanov, in what would turn out to be one of his last acts as chief, had enrolled his son in the service so ensuring he would avoid mobilisation. Russian agents were widely regarded to have penetrated the organisation. Malyuk is said to have set as a priority the task of turning out the moles.“One of the good signs of Operation Spiderweb is that it didn’t leak,” said one senior member of Ukraine’s security. “He has got rid of a lot of traitors. Not every one of them, as that’s not possible. But a lot.”Malyuk also personally took an interest in the so-called Alpha unit within the SBU that carries out operations on and behind the frontline, to which he is a regular visitor.According to the service, since February the SBU has been responsible for destroying nearly 2,000 tanks, more than 3,000 armoured vehicles and host of aircraft, rocket launch systems and military facilities, including ammunition depots, as well as over 30 oil refineries.It is widely accepted that Malyuk himself would not have dreamed up Operation Spiderweb but he had the ability to see the potential and have the ear of the president.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy holding a meeting with Malyuk.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“This idea was born deep inside the security services,” said Ivan Stupak, who was an SBU agent between 2004 and 2015. “And this idea went directly to Mr Malyuk. He liked this idea. And there was one more obstacle, President Zelenskyy. There was high chance that Mr Zelenskyy would reject this idea but Mr Malyuk convinced Mr Zelenskyy.”Yuri Butusov, a military journalist, said Malyuk had also enabled the operation by disregarding hierarchy and pushing forward young agents and risk-takers. Unlike some at the top of government, his focus was on winning the war rather than factional disputes within the administration, he suggested.The Guardian view on Ukraine’s spectacular attack: 21st-century tactics still require support from allies | EditorialRead more“Malyuk has given the freedom of action and resources to promote very decisive, very responsible leaders, some of them very young people,” Butusov said. “They are risk-takers. He is very different to other people in power. He sets aside political influence, economic and business interests.”Sources inside the government said they did not believe it was Malyuk’s decision to publicise the operations to this extent. “Zelenskyy is all about media attention, he eats and drinks it,” said one government source.Malyuk, in contrast, is said to keep his comments to the point when briefing ministers and expects a similar lack of verbosity from those within his service.Sources said the power and success had yet to go to Malyuk’s head. “If he sees problems in the heads of departments, he becomes tough,” said a second SBU officer. “But in general, he is constructive. He gives his subordinates the time he thinks they need to complete their tasks. It’s easier to govern when you have carte blanche. But you still need to earn carte blanche. And Malyuk earned this carte blanche.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropeprofilesShareReuse this content"

She made the remarks in an interview with the Guardian.“We’re in pretty big trouble,” Hill said, describing the UK’s geopolitical situation as caught between “the rock” of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and “the hard place” of Donald Trump’s increasingly unpredictable US.Hill, 59, is perhaps the best known of the reviewers appointed by Labour, alongside Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, and the retired general Sir Richard Barrons. She said she was happy to take on the role because it was “such a major pivot point in global affairs”. She remains a dual national after living in the US for more than 30 years.“Russia has hardened as an adversary in ways that we probably hadn’t fully anticipated,” Hill said, arguing that Putin saw the Ukraine war as a starting point to Moscow becoming “a dominant military power in all of Europe”.As part of that long-term effort, Russia was already “menacing the UK in various different ways,” she said, citing “the poisonings, assassinations, sabotage operations, all kinds of cyber-attacks and influence operations. The sensors that we see that they’re putting down around critical pipelines, efforts to butcher undersea cables.”The conclusion, Hill said, was that “Russia is at war with us”. The foreign policy expert, a longtime Russia watcher, said she had first made a similar warning in 2015, in a revised version of a book she wrote about the Russian president with Clifford Gaddy, reflecting on the invasion and annexation of Crimea.“We said Putin had declared war on the west,” she said. At the time, other experts disagreed, but Hill said events since had demonstrated “he obviously had, and we haven’t been paying attention to it”. The Russian leader, she argues, sees the fight in Ukraine as “part of a proxy war with the United States; that’s how he has persuadedChina,North KoreaandIranto join in”.Putin believed that Ukraine had already been decoupled from the US relationship, Hill said, because “Trump really wants to have a separate relationship with Putin to do arms control agreements and also business that will probably enrich their entourages further, though Putin doesn’t need any more enrichment”.When it came to defence, however, she said the UK could not rely on the military umbrella of the US as during the cold war and in the generation that followed, at least “not in the way that we did before”. In her description, the UK “is having to manage its number one ally”, though the challenge is not to overreact because “you don’t want to have a rupture”.This way of thinking appears inthe defence reviewpublished earlier this week, which says “the UK’s longstanding assumptions about global power balances and structures are no longer certain” – a rare acknowledgment in a British government document of how far and how fast Trumpism is affecting foreign policy certainties.View image in fullscreenHill testifying during the hearing into the impeachment of Donald Trump on Capitol Hill in Washington in 2019.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe review team reported to Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, and the defence secretary, John Healey. Most of Hill’s interaction were with Healey, however, and she said she had met the prime minister only once – describing him as “pretty charming … in a proper and correct way” and as “having read all the papers”.Hill was not drawn on whether she had advised Starmer or Healey on how to deal with Donald Trump, saying instead: “The advice I would give is the same I would give in a public setting.” She said simply that the Trump White House “is not an administration, it is a court” in which a transactional president is driven by his “own desires and interests, and who listens often to the last person he talks to”.She added that unlike his close circle, Trump had “a special affinity for the UK” based partly on his own family ties (his mothercame from the Hebridean island of Lewis, emigrating to New York aged 18) and an admiration for the royal family, particularlythe late queen. “He talked endlessly about that,” she said.On the other hand, Hill is no fan of the populist right administration in the White House and worries it could come to Britain if “the same culture wars” are allowed to develop with the encouragement of Republicans from the US.She noted that Reform UK had won a string of council elections last month, including in her native Durham, and that the party’s leader, Nigel Farage, wanted to emulate some of the aggressive efforts to restructure government led by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) before his falling-out with Trump.“When Nigel Farage says hewants to do a Dogeagainst the local county council, he should come over here [to the US] and see what kind of impact that has,” she said. “This is going to be the largest layoffs in US history happening all at once, much bigger than hits to steelworks and coalmines.”Hill’s argument is that in a time of profound uncertainty, Britain needs greater internal cohesion if it is to protect itself. “We can’t rely exclusively on anyone any more,” she said, arguing that Britain needed to have “a different mindset” based as much on traditional defence as on social resilience.Some of that, Hill said, was about a greater recognition of the level of external threat and initiatives for greater integration, by teaching first aid in schools or encouraging more teenagers to join school cadet forces, a recommendation of the defence review. “What you need to do is get people engaged in all kinds of different ways in support of their communities,” she said.Hill said she saw that deindustrialisation and a rise of inequality in Russia and the US had contributed to the rise in national populism in both countries. Politicians in Britain, or elsewhere, “have to be much more creative and engage people where they are at” as part of a “national effort”, she said.If this seems far away from a conventional view of defence, that’s because it is, though Hill also argues that traditional conceptions of war are changing as technology evolves and with it what makes a potent force.“People keep saying the British army has the smallest number of troops since the Napoleonic era. Why is the Napoleonic era relevant? Or that we have fewer ships than the time of Charles II. The metrics are all off here,” she said. “The Ukrainians are fighting with drones. Even though they have no navy, they sank a third of the Russian Black Sea fleet.”Her aim, therefore, is not just to be critical but to propose solutions. Hill recalled that a close family friend, on hearing that she had taken on the defence review, had told her: “‘Don’t tell us how shite we are, tell us what we can do, how we can fix things.’ People understand that we have a problem and that the world has changed.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinForeign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In an interviewwith ABC News, Trump was asked about reports of a potentially peacemaking phone call scheduled with Musk for later in the day, to which Trump responded, “You mean the man who has lost his mind?” and added that he was “not particularly” interested in talking to his former confidant right now.The president also spoke to CNN, saying: “I’m not even thinking about Elon. He’s got a problem. The poor guy’s got a problem,” andtold Politicothat the relationship with Musk was “going very well, never done better”.The New York Times reported, in private conversations, that Trump had attributed Musk’s behavior to drug use.As well as giving many people a reason to return to X – the social media site Musk owns and where he has recently been amplifying rightwing, pro-Trump views – the bitter fight could heavily affect the political landscape.Musk suggested starting a new political party, one “that actually represents the 80% in the middle”, and, given his wealth, he would be able to pump millions into next year’s midterm elections, potentially influencing races across the country.In the space industry, meanwhile, Nasa has become increasingly reliant on Musk’s SpaceX company, with the Dragon spacecraft being used to transport the agency’s astronauts to and from the International Space Station, and Musk pledged to decommission the Dragon in the wake of the Trump fight. He quicklysignalled an about-face, but it was a reminder of Musk’s influence, which is further bolstered by the key role the Starlink satellite broadband platform plays in Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion.Trump, meanwhile, threatened to cancel Musk’s US government contracts, and the president’s ally Steve Bannon suggested that Musk, a South African-born American citizen, “should be deported from the country immediately”. In a sign of the immediate impact on Musk, his net worth fell by $33bn on Thursday alone, whileTesla’s shares initially droppedby about 14.2%, wiping roughly $152bn off the value of the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump said he was “very disappointed in Elon” over the criticism, as Musk said Trump’s trade policies would cause a recession, before the dispute escalated wildly.Many had predicted that the relationship between Musk and Trump, two men known for their large egos and unpredictable behavior, could not last, but the sheer level of vitriol stunned Americans and would seem to make a reconciliation unlikely.Musk did at leastappear to profferan olive branch in a reply to a post from the hedge fund owner Bill Ackman, who called on Trump and Musk to “make peace for the benefit of our great country”, but on Friday Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, told NBC News “there are no plans” for a call between the two men.In the meantime, it was business as usual for Trump on Friday, with the president offering a series of misleading takes on the US job market, which new figures showslowed in May. Musk was unusually quiet on social media, as Tesla’s shares rebounded somewhat from Thursday’s loss,rising by 6%, although at least one customer seemed keen to divest from the company: the White House said on Friday that Trump plans to sell his Tesla Model S.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskTeslaTrump administrationSpaceXUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Muslim women who wear the headscarf in particular, are made to feel especially vulnerable and unsafe.”Her position was echoed by Akeela Ahmed, co-chair of the newly formed British Muslim Network, who said: “The resignation of Zia Yusuf is a stark illustration that many in Reform do not view British Muslims as valued equal members of British society and think it is acceptable to push anti-Muslim hostility and sentiments as part of their party polices and campaigns.View image in fullscreenA leading British Muslim said it was ‘stark illustration’ that many in Reform do not view British Muslims as valued equal members of society after Sarah Pochin’s call for a burka ban.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images“Free speech and expression is a fundamental principle of a healthy society and democracy. By the same token, so is freedom of religion and belief.“In this context, the demonisation and weaponisation of British Muslims and their religious practices as one homogenous group to politically point score is a deeply troubling trend that has become increasingly visible and normalised inReform UK, among both its senior politicians and supporters.“This kind of political behaviour foments division and isolates British people from each other.”Afzal Khan, a Labour MP and vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, said anti-Muslim rhetoric by politicians had the power to cause spikes in hate incidents towards Muslims, such as whenBoris Johnson had referred to women wearing burqas as letterboxes.“Picking on a very small minority within a minority who use the burqa, how does that make sense? It should be an important opportunity to ask the prime minister about serious issues facing this country. What does it say about their priorities?”Sayeeda Warsi, the former Tory cabinet minister, told Times Radio that Pochin calling for a debate on the burqa had been “dog whistle” politics.She said: “I just think this is such a fringe issue and literally I think Sarah Pochin on her first outing at PMQs in parliament used it as a way to gain a bit of attention and engage in a little bit of dog whistle politics.“Of the 50 odd thousand people in her constituency about 500 are Muslim which is probably about half a percent of which I presume half might be women, I presume maybe a tiny handful might wear the burqa.“You’d think she’d just been elected by the people of Runcorn to come to parliament to raise issues like the cost of living, like children in poverty, like the other challenges that her constituents face but she obviously decided to focus on this because it was just an attention-seeking dog whistle moment.”Yusuf did not mention the burqa row in his resignation statement on X but sources said they thought he had become increasingly disillusioned with the willingness of Reform to appeal to anti-Muslim sentiment when it could have been focusing on issues like the cost of living and migration.Some of the names tipped to be the party’s new chair include Arron Banks, the Brexit donor and Reform candidate, Richard Tice, the deputy leader, and David Bull, a TV presenter and former deputy leader.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageFar rightShareReuse this content"

Marco Silva of Fulham is also in the running.Postecoglou led Spurs toEuropa League gloryon 21 May, beating ­Manchester United in the final in ­Bilbao to end a 17-year trophy drought. It sparked delirium among fans, an outpouring of relief and the feeling among some of them that he deserved the chance to continue in the role.But the chair, Daniel Levy, and the rest of the board, having taken stock since the final game of the season against Brighton on 25 May, reached the unanimous conclusion that Postecoglou had to go based on performances in the Premier League over most of his two-year tenure.Ange-ball was breath of fresh air but Europa League alone could not save him | David HytnerRead morePostecoglou won eight and drew two of his opening 10 games in the league, having arrived from Celtic with Spurs at a low ebb on the back of an eighth-placed finish in 2022‑23. But his league record since then showed 78 points from 66 matches – a detail that Spurs printed in the ­statement they issued at a little after 5pm BST to confirm Postecoglou’s departure.The club also highlighted how the 17th-placed finish in this past season – with 38 points – was their worst of the Premier League era. Only once have they had a worse league record, in 1914-15.As reported earlier on Friday, Spurs have met with intermediaries to discuss a move for Frank, who has impressed with his stellar work at Brentford. The Dane took the reins in west London in October 2018 when they were in the Championship and got them promoted via the playoffs in 2020-21. He has established them in the top flight; they finished this past season 10th with 56 points.Spurs admire the job that Silva has done at Fulham but Frank appears to be the No 1. target. Every player and member of staff at ­Brentford has a price. Tottenham must decide whether to pay the £10m. The club have also shown an interest in Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and Oliver Glasner of Crystal Palace – both appear out of reach.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank has impressed Spurs with his work at Brentford.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAPostecoglou will go down as a hero at Spurs because of Bilbao and he released an emotional statement shortly after his sacking, saying he was “forever connected” to his players and staff, not to mention the supporters.

We have also laid ­foundations that mean this club should not have to wait 17 more years for their next success.”The Spurs statement ­acknowledged how Postecoglou had sought to return the club to a more attacking style while there was ­gratitude for the trophy he delivered, a line ­noting he was now “alongside ­legendary figures Bill Nicholson and Keith ­Burkinshaw” as managers who have triumphed in Europe.It said: “At times there were ­extenuating circumstances [for the poor league form] – injuries and then a decision to prioritise our European campaign. Whilst winning the Europa League ranks as one of the club’s greatest moments, we cannot base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph.

He is believed to be the first person to be charged with the specific offence.The art dealer, who has also appeared on the BBC’s Antiques Road Trip, was charged with failing to disclose information about transactions in the regulated art market sector on or before dates between October 2020 and December 2021.US prosecutors say Ahmad was a “major Hezbollah financial donor” who used high-value art and diamonds to launder money and fund the group.Ahmad is accused of evading terrorism sanctions by using front companies to acquire more than $160m (£118m) in artwork and diamond services.After the introduction of new money-laundering regulations in January 2020 that brought the art market under HMRC supervision, Ojiri is said to have discussed the changes with a colleague, indicating awareness of the rules.The court previously heard the total value of the artworks sold was about £140,000.Lyndon Harris, prosecuting, said the defendant was, at the relevant time, the owner and operator of Ramp Gallery, later known as Ojiri Gallery.Ahmad is understood to be based in Beirut, the court heard.Harris said: “The defendant engaged in discussions with and sales over a 14-month period with Nazem Ahmad and his associates, selling art to the value of £140,000 over that period.”The defendant knew that US sanctions had been placed on Ahmad, a previous hearing was told. Ahmad’s phone number was saved on Ojiri’s phone as “Moss”, the court heard.“[It] appears to have been a name deliberately chosen to disguise Mr Ahmad as being one of his contacts,” Harris said, adding that Ojiri was warned by others about his conduct “but proceeded to engage in dealings with Ahmad in any event”.Gavin Irwin, defending, said Ojiri was arrested while filming a BBC TV programme.He said: “He has lost the work he loves. He was arrested while filming a BBC television programme. He has already lost, of course, his good name; he was until recently a man of good character.”Irwin said the defendant had been “naive” in relation to his participation in Ahmad’s art market, but that he was “preyed on by more sophisticated others”.He also said the defendant had lost his business, accepted that he had done wrong, and wanted to “apologise for undermining trust in the industry” and “apologise for the distress that he has caused principally to those who know him, who love him, but also those who have supported him throughout his career”.Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb sentenced Ojiri to two years and six months in prison at the Old Bailey on Friday, with a further year to be spent on licence.She told Ojiri he had been involved in a commercial relationship “for prestige and profit” and that he had been “seeking the kudos of dealing with an eminent name in the dealing world”.She added: “You knew about Ahmad’s suspected involvement in financing terrorism and the way the art market can be exploited by someone like him.”Cheema-Grubb said that until these events he had been “someone to be admired”, and added: “This is the nadir – there is one direction your life can go and I am confident that you will not be in front of the courts again.”The judge said the offences were so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified.Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said: “The prosecution, using specific Terrorism Act legislation, is the first of its kind, and should act as a warning to all art dealers that we can, and will, prosecute those who knowingly do business with people identified as funders of terrorist groups.“Oghenochuko Ojiri wilfully obscured the fact he knew he was selling artwork to Nazem Ahmad, someone who has been sanctioned by the UK and US treasury and described as a funder of the proscribed terrorist group Hizballah.“Financial investigation is a crucial part of the counter-terrorism effort. A team of specialist investigators, analysts and researchers in the NTFIU [national terrorist financial investigation unit] work all year round to prevent money from reaching the hands of terrorists or being used to fund terrorist attacks.”Ojiri has appeared on a number of BBC shows including Bargain Hunt and Antiques Road Trip, and described himself as “absolutely obsessed” with collecting contemporary art in a BBC Q&A.Ojiri has previously worked as an auctioneer and is known for championing African and European contemporary art.Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political and militant group based in Lebanon, backed by Iran and known for its armed resistance against Israel.In the UK, the entire organisation – both its military and political wings – has been proscribed as a terrorist group since 2019.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCrimeBBCUK security and counter-terrorismThe art marketnewsShareReuse this content"

The claimant admitted using publicly available AI tools and his solicitor accepted he cited the sham authorities.When Haringey Law Centre challenged the London borough of Haringey over its alleged failure to provide its client with temporary accommodation, its lawyer cited phantom case law five times. Suspicions were raised when the solicitor defending the council had to repeatedly query why they could not find any trace of the supposed authorities.It resulted in a legal action for wasted legal costs and a court found the law centre and its lawyer, a pupil barrister, were negligent. The barrister denied using AI in that case but said she may have inadvertently done so while using Google or Safari in preparation for a separate case where she also cited phantom authorities. In that case she said she may have taken account of AI summaries without realising what they were.In aregulatory rulingresponding to the cases on Friday, Dame Victoria Sharp, the president of the King’s bench division, said there were “serious implications for the administration of justice and public confidence in the justice system if artificial intelligence is misused” and that lawyers misusing AI could face sanctions, from public admonishment to facing contempt of court proceedings and referral to the police.She called on the Bar Council and the Law Society to consider steps to curb the problem “as a matter of urgency” and told heads of barristers’ chambers and managing partners of solicitors to ensure all lawyers know their professional and ethical duties if using AI.“Such tools can produce apparently coherent and plausible responses to prompts, but those coherent and plausible responses may turn out to be entirely incorrect,” she wrote. “The responses may make confident assertions that are simply untrue. They may cite sources that do not exist. They may purport to quote passages from a genuine source that do not appear in that source.”Ian Jeffery, the chief executive of the Law Society of England and Wales, said the ruling “lays bare the dangers of using AI in legal work”.“Artificial intelligence tools are increasingly used to support legal service delivery,” he added. “However, the real risk of incorrect outputs produced by generative AI requires lawyers to check, review and ensure the accuracy of their work.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a UK tax tribunal in 2023, an appellant who claimed to have been helped by “a friend in a solicitor’s office” provided nine bogus historical tribunal decisions as supposed precedents. She admitted it was “possible” she had usedChatGPT, but said it surely made no difference as there must be other cases that made her point.The appellants in a €5.8m (£4.9m) Danish case this year narrowly avoided contempt proceedings when they relied on a made-up ruling that the judge spotted. And a2023 case in the US district courtfor the southern district of New York descended into chaos when a lawyer was challenged to produce the seven apparently fictitious cases they had cited. The simply asked ChatGPT to summarise the cases it had already made up and the result, said the judge was “gibberish” and fined the two lawyers and their firm $5,000.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

While the risk to the public is “low”, handling arsenic-containing books regularly can lead to health issues including irritation of the eyes, nose and throat along with more serious side-effects. The toxic pigment in the book bindings can flake off, meaning small pieces can easily be inhaled.View image in fullscreenSt Andrews’ device in action.Photograph: University of St AndrewsIn recent years, many libraries have prevented access to all suspect green books as a precaution, as testing has until now been costly and time-consuming. For example, the University of Bielefeld, along with several other German universities, isolated 60,000 books as a precautionary measure last year.The new device can quickly and cheaply detect the presence of toxic pigment. “A device used in the School of Earth Sciences to detect minerals in rocks was the starting point,” said Pilar Gil, who led the research. “The Eureka moment was discovering the unique reflectance pattern from emerald green pigment in the visible spectrum. The idea was then to apply this discovery to an instrument which we could use and share with the sector.”Two scientists from the university’s astronomy and physics school, Graham Bruce and Morgan Facchin, developed a portable tool. “Our device shines different colours of light on to the book,” said Facchin.“The amount of light reflected at each colour is like a fingerprint of the pigment in the book,” he added. “Through extensive work using books from the university’s collections, our team have found a way to identify the fingerprint of emerald green on a book.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The latest search for Madeleine McCann, the British toddler who vanished from a Portuguese holiday apartment 2007, hasended quietlywithout any apparent breakthrough.After 18 years of intermittent searches, this one, led by German police, may well be the last. In Praia da Luz, a seaside town etched into the world’s memory by the tragedy, that realisation lands with a mix of relief and weariness. Locals barely speak about the case now, if at all. The McCann investigation brought an unrelenting glare of media attention that many here would prefer to forget.But even as the formal search ends, the town’s association with the disappearance of Madeleine remains stubbornly intact, kept alive not just by police work but also the trickle of true crime tourists retracing a story they know from Netflix specials and acres of news coverage over the past two decades.View image in fullscreenThe Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz.Photograph: Wirestock, Inc./AlamySome pose for selfies outside the Ocean Club holiday apartment where Madeleine was last seen, or dine in the complex’s tapas restaurant where her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were eating when she vanished. Some play amateur sleuth in the town’s cobbled alleyways as though they were the famous sets of a long-running drama.When British friends Joanne Sheppard, 60, and Jane Thorp, 61, began planning a trip together, they settled on Praia da Luz partly for that reason. “When we decided to go on holiday, I said I would like to see the place where [Madeleine] went missing and I’d like to sit and see the scope of the area so we could get a feel of various routes where maybe Gerry McCann and Kate walked,” Sheppard said.The pair were outside the Ocean Club on Thursday morning to check if “anyone was milling around” the McCann apartment while German and Portuguese police werescouring scrubland and abandoned buildingsa mile away in Atalaia, near Lagos, which was once home to a farming community. They had already spent hours at the tapas restaurant on Tuesday and had made plans to return.“No one was speaking about Madeleine,” Thorp said of their first visit. As they entered the resort, reception staff asked the women not to take photos but that did not stop Thorp, who said she was not as interested in the case as Sheppard. “Someone is in that apartment at the moment, we saw them the other night,” the carer from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire added.View image in fullscreenJane Thorp (left) and Joanne Sheppard.Photograph: suppliedSheppard’s interest in Madeleine’s disappearance was piqued when she watched an eight-part Netflix documentary series in 2019.“I watched the Netflix series and then I started delving a bit deeper because something was amiss. And if you actually delve deeper … and start with the PJ [Portuguese Polícia Judiciária] files, you’ll see a whole new truth emerge,” the decorator from Nottingham said.She had been gripped by what she said were the “numerous holes” and “contradictions” in the case. She dismissed the latest searches as “a whole waste of time”, proffered theories and spoke of “hard evidence” and media “manipulation” before heading to the nearby beach for the day.Town residents feel uneasy about the ghoulish obsession with Madeleine’s disappearance. Metres away from the Ocean Club, at the Baptista supermarket’s cafe, a British businessman, Tahir, who splits his time between London and the Algarve said he came across some tourists outside the McCann apartment just last week. “They’d obviously spotted it or they’d known where it was, and they were taking pictures of the apartment. I felt like going up to them and saying: ‘That’s so morbid. What’s the matter with you people?’” the 45-year-old said.“They’ve been doing that for years,” replied David, 80, a British expat sitting at a nearby table. “A lot of people come down here and they want to drive past that [building], just to say this is where it was.”Simon Foy, the former head of the Metropolitan police’s homicide and serious crime command, who led Operation Grange to find Madeleine in 2011 before retiring in 2012, said the case had captured the public’s imagination because it embodied “every parent’s nightmare”.“When I was working in homicide investigations in the Met, occasionally these cases would come along which for some reason just connected around the public consciousness,” he said. “It’s a whole load of things: it’s a young blond girl, it’s a middle-class family, it’s a holiday, it’s every parent’s nightmare. All that sort of stuff very unpredictably would combine together and you would go from virtually minimal media interest and coverage to significant and substantial media coverage, and that was all before the days of social media.”Foy, who has not been involved in the investigation since retiring, said the popularity of true crime documentaries and dramas in which complex cases are neatly wrapped up in one-hour episodes had also contributed to the public’s enduring fascination with the case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are human beings, there’s pressure and people make mistakes. It’s different. It’s never as perfect as it’s portrayed in the media world. But people are absolutely fascinated by a story like that, it just happens that this one is a real-life tragedy.”It is this fascination with the case, and in turn Praia da Luz, that has led some residents to blame the McCanns for damaging the town’s reputation. Road signs in the town were once defaced with graffiti reading “McCann circus”. The signs have now been cleaned up but still bear traces of the town’s unease.Hundreds of journalists descended on the town to report on the mystery of the three-year-old girl, but tourism dropped and businesses suffered. “This place was like a ghost town at one point,” said Tahir, who did not want to give his surname.It is why he and many others hope the case can be solved. “Everyone has got an interest in what happens to Madeleine. For locals, it’s still closure that they’re looking for. It’s not just the family; everyone wants to know. It’s gone on so long. There was a point where locals wanted to bury the story because it was affecting businesses and all the rentals went down, but I think it’s got over that point,” Tahir said.A retired Portuguese businessman in his 60s, who did not want to give his name, said: “[It has been] 18 years and we’ve had enough. For the family it’s a pity, but it’s enough. This area was full of people, it was a joy, a happy family place that was completely transformed and completely dead after [Madeleine disappeared]. Now it’s OK but it took 10 years.”View image in fullscreenMadeleine McCann.Photograph: PA MediaThe search, the latest in a series of renewed efforts by German prosecutors, was said to have been the last chance to build a case against the prime suspect, Christian Brückner. He denies any involvement. The countdown is now on to the 48-year-old’s imminent release from a German prison, where he is being held for the rape of an American woman in Praia da Luz in 2005.After 18 years, hundreds of leads and still no trace of the missing girl, the emotional toll must weigh heavily on Madeleine’s family, who have not commented on this week’s search.And for a place that once hoped its name would be reclaimed by the sun, the sea and the quiet rhythm of local life, the McCann case still casts a long shadow, one that no end-of-search announcement can fully erase.Explore more on these topicsMadeleine McCannPortugalGermanyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Trump said.In 2024, the New York Times reported that Musk’s companies – which include electric vehicle maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX – have over the past year been promised $3bnacross nearly 100 different contracts with 17 federal agencies.Investigate Musk’s alleged drug useTheNew York Timesand theWall Street Journalhave made allegations ofheavy drug useby Musk, raising questions about Nasa requirements for its contractors – including SpaceX – to maintain a drug-free workforce. The Times alleged that Musk has received advanced warning of the tests. SpaceX has been contacted for comment.Responding to the Times allegations on X last month, Musk wrote: “to be clear, I am NOT taking drugs!” In 2024 hesaidhe sometimes used ketamine on a doctor’s prescription.Challenge Musk’s immigration statusSteve Bannon, a Trump ally and influential “alt-right” figure, told the Times on Thursday that Musk’s immigration status should be investigated.“They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status, because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,” Bannon said of South Africa-born Musk, who is a US citizen.Use general presidential powers against MuskWhen Trump was elected, observers pointed to themyriad waysin which a Musk-friendly White House administration could benefit the financial interests of the world’s richest person. That benign environment, which includes awarding of government contracts and directing federal agencies giving Musk’s businesses an easier ride, could of course be turned hostile.Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University and a specialist in government regulation, told the Guardian at the time: “All federal regulators and prosecutors work for the president. He can tell them to do something or not to do something with the understanding that he will fire them if they disobey.”Ostracise Musk from theMaga movementTrump, as the leader of the “Make America great again” vanguard, can close doors on Musk. The Republican congressman Troy Nehls excoriated the billionaire on Thursday, telling him: ““You’ve lost your damn mind.” He added: “Enough is enough.”Musk can handle such opprobrium and, given his considerable wealth, he is an important source of funding for Republican politicians.What Musk could do to TrumpTurnXagainst the White HouseMusk used his X platform, and his more than 220 million followers on it, to rally support for Trump’s victory in the 2024. It also provided a platform for rightwing views that helped publicise the Maga agenda.Theoretically, Musk could at least use his own X account to criticise Trump with as much regularity as he pumped the president’s policies (the Tesla chief executive is a prolific user of his own platform).However, this also depends on Musk’sinfluence with the US electorate. Five out of 10 US adults say they have an unfavourable view of Musk, according to the Pew Research Center. But it should be noted that seven out of 10 Republicans or Republican-leaning adults hold a favourable view – he’s not going to sway many Democrats who dislike Trump anyway.Form a new political movementMusk, who is worth more than $300bn (£220bn), could divert his considerable financial resources away from the Republican party and start a new political entity. Musk spent $250m on getting Trump elected in 2024, signalling his willingness to invest heavily in politics.On Thursday heposted a poll on Xand asked: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” More than 80% of the 4.8 million respondents voted “yes”.Create geopolitical problems with his businessesThe Starlink satellite broadband platform, owned by Musk’sSpaceX, is playing a key rule in Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion, while China is an important manufacturing and consumer base for Tesla. Through his businesses, Musk also has political contacts around the world and is regularly photographed in the company of global leaders. However, any damage Musk causes to Trump’s international standing or interests will have to be balanced with any knock-on effect on his own businesses.Create problems for NasaNasa has a close relationship with Musk’s SpaceX, with the company’s Dragon spacecraft being used to transport the agency’s astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Musk immediately pledged to decommission Dragon in the wake of the Trump spat on Thursday – before quicklysignalling an about-face. Nonetheless, SpaceX is a crucial part of Nasa’s ISS operations.Tell-all on TrumpMusk has been a fixture of Trump’s inner circle for a considerable period of time and, as the contents of his X account show, he is capable of taking multiple damaging swipes at people. However, members of Trump’s inner circle will have had the same access to Musk, whose personal life is becoming a media staple.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsDrugsSpaceXXSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But before he can contemplate that July milestone, he faces a busy month strewn with political bear traps.June has proven a difficult time for successive prime ministers: Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak all had to contend with deeply unhappy parliamentary parties reeling from heavy local and European election losses.While the mood among Labour MPs is nowhere near as mutinous, they too are bruised from adifficult set of local election resultsin England in May and the surge of Reform UK. “There is more than the usual amount of grumbling and discontent,” a government source said.One unexpected ray of light was the result of the Holyrood byelection inHamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouseon Friday. Labour secured a surprise victory, knocking the Scottish National party into second place and restoring some hope in Labour’s fortunes ahead of next year’s Holyrood elections. One MP said the result was “humiliating” for the SNP.It is certainly a welcome win for Downing Street asLabourMPs brace for more bad news and a series of contentious debates this month. “They know that the spending review is going to be really hard,” a government source said.The spending review on 11 June, which will set out multi-year departmental budgets after months oftense negotiationsbetween the Treasury and cabinet ministers, will be a make-or-break moment for Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves.Downing Street is trying to grasp the nettle by puttingplans for capital investmentin underserved parts of the country at thecentre of the narrative. But government strategists are braced for a wave of discontent once the data tables are published revealingcuts across unprotected departments.The most highly anticipated parliamentary moment is the first Commons vote on the government’s welfare measures, including deep cuts to disability benefits. Labour whips are seeking to minimise the size of the rebellion afterdozens of MPs signed a lettersaying they found the proposals impossible to support. Officials say the vote will take place in the second half of June and have repeatedly denied rumours that it could be delayed to the autumn.Officials have also pencilled in the publication of a number of government strategies and reviews that have the potential to draw backlash. The delayedChina audit, which fulfils a Labour manifesto commitment to appraise China’s role in UK supply chains and what challenges and opportunities that poses, is due this month.Downing Street is sensitive to criticism over its rapprochement with Beijing, which will come under scrutiny as a number of Chinese ministers and officials arrive in the UK on official trips this month. One question relates to China’s place in theforeign influence registration scheme, which remains unresolved amid long-running tensions between the Treasury and the Home Office.The government also plans to publish itsindustrial strategythis month. Strategists see this document as key to Labour’s political fightback against Nigel Farage and want to use it to build the narrative of drumming up investment after the spending review, including in defence.In the spring there were murmurings among business figures and government insiders who feared the document would be underwhelming and that Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, had been too busy negotiating a succession of trade deals with the US, EU and India. Ministers have been warned that the strategy must set out a plan toreduce the UK’s high energy costsfor companies, on the basis that these are a major obstacle to growth.Finally, the government’s 10-year plan for the NHS in England is expected either in late June or in July, and is also considered key to Labour’s electoral prospects. It is expected to set outplans to improve the NHS app.In the Commons there are three crunch votes expected to take place this month. One is over the assisted dying bill sponsored by the Labour backbencher Kim Leadbeater, which seeks to give terminally ill people with less than six months to live the right to end their own lives.The proposed legislation has opened abitter divide in the parliamentary Labour partyand sparked concerns in Downing Street that arguments over the bill are distracting from the government’s core agenda. Starmer, who in the past has expressed support for changing the law, voted in favour of the bill at its second reading and indicated recently that his position hadn’t changed. The Commons will consider amendments to the bill on 13 June and is expected to vote on it again on 20 June.Another difficult moral question due to be considered by MPs this month is whether to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales. Several women in recent years have found themselves in the dock for ending their pregnancies outside the strict legal parameters of the Abortion Act 1967. Two Labour backbenchers areputting forward amendmentsto the crime and policing bill, which is due to return to the Commons in a fortnight.“There’s lots of little bumps in the road – it’s quite an important few weeks,” a Labour source said. The upside for Starmer is that if he succeeds in overcoming this series of hurdles fairly smoothly, the mood in government and the PLP will start to improve before summer recess. If he doesn’t, any celebrations to mark his first year in power will be pretty muted.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I kind of looked at myself in the mirror …” She lets out a snort of laughter. “I feel like there’s so many film scenes where people write songs and I’m like, ‘that didn’t fucking happen like that’, but this one did. So I’m crying, grabbed my guitar and wrote I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby! in like 20 minutes. And that was that. I thought: ‘I know what I need to do now.’”A couple of years later, I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby! was one of a trio of smart, witty, country-inflected songs that catapulted Thompson to lockdown-era fame in her native Ireland, turning her into what she calls “a big fat pop star” in a matter of months. Her debut album, If My Wife New I’d Be Dead, entered the Irish charts at No 1, its success spreading to the UK,Europe, Australia and the US. Her second, Crazymad, for Me, featured a duet with John Grant and was nominated for an Ivor Novello award and the Mercury prize. Success all happened “purely because I’ve got better at writing songs”, and came surprisingly easily, she says. “Whenever someone’s like, ‘Oh, is it really difficult?’ There’s parts of it that are difficult, but in general, I’m just like ‘This is class, no issue at all. This is great.’”Take a Sexy Picture of Me – videoThere’s no doubt that CMAT is a fantastic pop star, and you can see why Sam Fender has her opening for him in a series of stadiums. Arriving at her record company offices direct from a photoshoot, she looks extraordinary. Her clothes are a riot of bright clashing colours, her enormous sunglasses initially hide eyes thick with glittering blue makeup: she manages to exude a certain chaotic glamour while eating a pasty as a late lunch.She is incredibly forthright on a huge range of topics. She stands up for trans rights – “If you think of social media as like a video game, you rack up the spoils really high when you decide to go for a group of people who are already at risk” – and confronts the culture of wellness and self-improvement or, as she calls it, “the rise-and-grind ethic which is making people insane and making them unable to communicate with other people because they’re so obsessed with focusing on themselves”. Sometimes she’s too forthright for her mum, though: a recent appearance on Adam Buxton’s podcast provoked a dressing down. “She told me it made her cringe: ‘That lovely posh Englishman, so well spoken, and you calling yourself a cunt the whole interview. And you’re not a cunt, you’re lovely.’”I’m crazy and I do crazy things, and I have crazy relationships with peopleAnd yet, she concedes there has been a significant downside to her breakthrough. “The kind of headspace that good songs come from is one of extreme emotion, extreme depth of feeling,” she says, “which has an impact on my life. I do live in that really heightened state of emotion all the time. I’m crazy and I do crazy things, and I have crazy relationships with people.” She doesn’t mean crazy as in wild or outrageous, she qualifies. She means crazy as in authentically unwell, or – as she puts it with characteristic bluntness – “mental”.Now 29, Thompson thinks she has always suffered from auditory hallucinations, but during the making of her third album, “I started actually hallucinating. I was in New York, writing. I didn’t realise for the first two months that was what was happening, but I basically imagined the entire apartment I was staying in was crawling with insects, that I had insects crawling on my skin all the time. I was calling the landlord, letting off bug bombs, I made them throw the couch out because I thought it was covered in fleas. I was itching all the time. I was texting a group chat of friends, sending them pictures of all the bug bites on me: New York’s disgusting, full of insects. And they didn’t exist. I went to the doctor and showed him my bites and he said: ‘Those are stress hives; you’re mental.’” (Possibly not an exact diagnosis.) “I was hallucinating the whole time.”View image in fullscreenCMAT on stage at Bergenfest 2024 in Norway.Photograph: Per Ole Hagen/RedfernsFor that reason, she worries that songwriting might not be a sustainable occupation for that reason, or that taking medication might cause the flow of songs to stop. But whatever the pains staked in writing its contents, her new album is superb. It pushes at the boundaries of her previous work’s sound: into synth-heavy territory on the title track, pop soul on Running/Planning and distorted alt-rock on The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, a song during which the constant sight of the TV chef’s face in Britain’s motorway services seems to bring about an existential collapse in the mid-tour CMAT.View image in fullscreenCMAT: Euro-Country.It arrives in a sleeve featuring its title, Euro-Country, written in the kind of Gaelic script beloved of Irish theme pubs, above an exceptionally striking photo based on Jean-Léon Gérôme’s 1896 painting Truth Coming Out of Her Well. It features Thompson emerging from a fountain in the middle of a shopping centre near her home town of Dunboyne. “Blanchardstown shopping centre,” she says. “For the first 10, 11 years of my life, it was like my local village. My sister, who lives in Blanch now, goes to the shopping centre every day. You drive there if you want to see other people and then you drive back home again and live in your house by yourself.”That’s the reality of much of Irish life, she says. “There’s a kind of space thatIrelandis occupying in western media culture right now, a little more fetishised and trendy than it’s ever been. Americans think it’s cute; English people are like, ‘Ooh, I love Guinness and Kneecap and The Banshees of Inisherin, and I’m getting my Irish passport and mmm, I love potato farl.’ People talking about Hozier like he’s a magical, delicate fairy from the bog. It’s a romanticised version of Ireland that doesn’t exist. It’s a really hard place to live, a really hard place to grow up, unless you have money, which we didn’t. So yeah, magical, beautiful, mystical Ireland: it’s a shopping centre, that’s what I grew up with. A shopping centre.”Ireland’s recent history suffuses Euro-Country, which features vocals in Irish, songs called Billy Byrne from Ballybrack, the Leader of the Pigeon Convoy and Tree Six Foive and a title track that she describes as “a collage, a mood board” about the financial crisis that engulfed the country in 2008. “I was about 12 and it all happened around me, it didn’t really happen to my family directly,” she says. “My dad had a job in computers, we didn’t really have any money, we weren’t affluent, but we were fine. Everybody else on the estate we lived in worked in construction, or in shops, and they all lost their jobs. Everybody became unemployed. Then, in the village I grew up in, there was a year or 18 months where loads of the people I went to school with, their dads started killing themselves because they’d lost everything in the crash.”Initially, Thompson thought she must have misremembered this. “But I dug deep, did research and the amount of male suicides that happened in Ireland at that time was astronomical. When I hit secondary school, teenage boys started killing themselves as well; that was very common where I grew up. I think it was a kind of chain reaction as a result of the economic downturn. I’m not blaming anyone – no one ever purposely tries to cause that much harm. It’s trying to get all this stuff together and think: ‘Why did all this happen and how do we stop it from happening again?’ I don’t have the answer but I think we all need to keep looking at it and really fucking try to hound ourselves into a position where we’re not just thinking about monetary gain all the time.”View image in fullscreen‘Capitalism is a force for bad. But pop stars won’t say that’ … CMAT. Styling by Mia Maxwell, grooming by Niall Candy.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianEuro-Country is a noticeably more political album than its predecessors, which tended to focus on relationships and the chaos of her personal life. Thompson says she couldn’t really see anyone else in her position doing it, so decided to take it on. “No one is dealing with capitalism as a force for bad, this really fucking horrible putrefied version of capitalism which has absolutely had a line of coke up its fucking hole since Covid, where the richest people in the world are so much richer than they used to be five years ago,” she says. “Pop stars won’t come out and say that because they’ll be absolutely shot for it, because they’ve all done brand deals: ‘Oh, I love my Dove moisturiser.’”View image in fullscreenCMAT at the 2024 Mercury prize awards.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesThompson was one of a number of artists to pull out of Latitude and other festivals over sponsor Barclays providing financial services to defence companies supplying Israel. She says that as soon as she removed herself from the lineup, an upcoming deal with a designer perfume brand disappeared. “They ghosted me. I lost a lot of money. But who fucking cares? I’m aware of the fact that my career is going to struggle as a result of this stuff, but I also think everyone else in music needs a kick up the hole. Where’s all the fucking artists? Where’s all the fucking hippies?”Of course, another reason why musicians might feel abashed about mentioning politics is fear of a social media backlash, something Thompson knows all about. Last year, an Instagram video of her performing at BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend festival attracted so much abuse – largely directed at her weight – that the BBC was forced to disable comments. She laughed it off at the time, suggesting she should be imprisoned for the crime of “having a big fat ass”, but returns to the subject on her current single, Take a Sexy Picture of Me (it has turned into that rarest of things: a song about body shaming that has provoked a TikTok dance trend, with it-girl Julia Fox and Chicken Shop Date host Amelia Dimoldenberg participating).“Prior to moving over to the UK I would never have thought I was plus size,” she says. “And then I started working with fashion directors in London for photoshoots and started hearing: ‘Wow, you’re so lucky I collect plus-size Mugler because no one else will be able to dress you.’ I thought: what are you talking about? I’m a size 14! I thought everyone was this size! Why are you being so weird? But truth be told, if someone on the internet calls me a big fat ugly bitch, I’m like ‘yeah, whatever’, I don’t fucking care. But I started realising that other people were witnessing it and other girls, young girls, were witnessing this happening to me on a fucking huge scale – what must they think of that? How is it going to make them feel, particularly if they’re bigger than me?”Ten-gallon hits! Why country is the biggest pop music craze of 2024Read moreShe brings it back to commerce. “In day-to-day real life, if you think being fat will stop people from ever wanting to have sex with you, let me tell you that is not the case in such an extreme way. I’ve seen the girlies out there doing unbelievably well for themselves, right? But [because] fatness is not commercially viable, it’s not in the realm of commercial attractiveness.” Online, she says, the body image discourse brings out “weak-willed, spineless people who have been brutalised by commercial viability, criticising someone for not falling within the realms of what is easily sellable”.Thompson says she is aware that the political bent of Euro-Country is a big ask of audiences in 2025, when pop seems to largely function as a means of temporary escape from a terrifying world. “It can be read as incredibly cringe and incredibly earnest and on the nose, right? It’s an embarrassing thing for me to be asking of people. Because it’s not trendy to be earnest any more. I’m aware of that, and …” She laughs again. “Actually I don’t care. I don’t care if I’m putting my foot in it, I don’t care if I’m saying something wrong. We’ve all been too measured, too careful because we’re being witnessed all the time. I think we need more willingness to fail. Even if it’s futile, you’ve got to fucking try. Because it’s fucking depressing otherwise.”Euro-Country is released via CMATBaby and Awal on 29 AugustThis article was amended on 6 June 2025.

But even though the splashy epic premiered in this same city back in November 1995, its themes of power, money, greed and ego are echoing in the modern ethos louder than ever.“You can go back to the ancient Greek tragedies,” said Scorsese, speaking alongside De Niro and moderated by the standup comedian W Kamau Bell on stage at the Beacon Theater before the screening. “It’s a basic story of hubris and pride, with the pride taking us all down.”“[Joe Pesci’s character] sort of takes nobody’s input,” said Bell to De Niro. “It’s his ideas or the highway, and that ultimately leads to his destruction. It’s almost an allegory for the times we live in. I don’t know if you guys ever thought about that?”Martin Scorsese no longer watches films in cinemas due to audience bad behaviourRead more“Yeah, a little bit,” De Niro snickered back to guffaws from the crowd. “Do you have a couple hours?”The release of Casino in the mid-90s, which focuses on the tragic exploits of the mafia that controlled Las Vegas and the excess that came with it, arrived at a time when that culture was on a downswing, with the decade seeing crusaders such as Rudy Giuliani bringing down organized crime one-by-one.Zooming out, it also arrived smack in the middle of the Clinton administration, all making the characters in Casino seem like fringe figures. But judging by the constant drumbeat of headlines from the current American political climate, 2025 depicts a starkly different world, and with that a Casino for fresh eyes.View image in fullscreenRobert De Niro and Joe Pesci in Casino.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarEven the style and culture of Vegas is entirely different. Or is it?“Now you can bring the family!” said Scorsese of its cleaner reputation present-day, as opposed to the era when it was Sin City; a town where anything goes.Still, Bell couldn’t help but ask: “Is Vegas better when it’s run by the mafia, or is it better now when it’s run by the corporations?”“Is there a difference?” Scorsese smirked as the crowd roared. “That’s all I’m saying.”“These days especially,” De Niro chimed in.Adapted from the book by Nicholas Pileggi and based on the true events of the Chicago transplant Frank “Lefty” Rosenthal, Casino was born during unique times in Scorsese’s filmography. The director had just helmed the lush and quietAge of Innocence, a subtle love story based on the Edith Wharton novel about 1870s New York. When Casino was released, audiences couldn’t help but relate it to the film-maker’s other story of mafia and hubris:Goodfellas, which came out five years beforehand and also starred De Niro and Pesci.“ It was compared, I would say, unfairly and lazily to Goodfellas, but in the 30 years since, I think it’s grown up quite well,” said Bell. As the years have ticked by, the gap between the two films’ comparisons has widened, yet again allowing the viewer to watch Casino not thinking of it as a sort-of follow-up, but a standalone film.“The idea was to take the last 15 minutes before [Ray Liotta’s character] Henry Hill gets arrested in Goodfellas and make that one film,” Scorsese said of the memorably manic sequence during which we see Hill stretched thin with nerves frayed, edited together with a series of quick cuts and a pulsating soundtrack.“In other words, take it even further and just go to the point where we can sustain that style, which really came from (the rhythm) of storytelling on a street corner. Some of the best actors we ever knew were the kids telling the stories on the street.”View image in fullscreenW Kamau Bell, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro speak on stage.Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Tribeca FestivalAs a result, the director and actor spoke about weeks of night shoots, loud casinos and the movie’s intense violence (they had to tone down a scene when a man’s eyes bulge out after his head is put in a vice). Scorsese also recalled trying to finagle having Rosenthal visit the set while the mobster was listed in the state’s Black Book; a persona non grata in Nevada. The director went as far as working with the former MPAA president Jack Valenti to use his vast connections at the time to lift the ban.“Jack called me and he said: ‘Martin, I’ve never had so many doors closing in my face so fast in my life,’” impersonating Valenti’s Texas drawl. “This man is a member of thema-fia.”De Niro was reliably quieter while Scorsese discussed the film, a hallmark of their relationship. When asked about his memorable wardrobe in the film; his flashy suits a trademark of the character, De Niro said an archive of his costumes are stored at the University of Texas at Austin.‘We have to stop what’s going on, it’s insane’: Robert De Niro on battling age, apathy and TrumpRead more“I was collecting all of this stuff for years and it started getting expensive,” said De Niro, who realized that after he filmed Scorsese’s musical New York, New York, all of his wardrobe was being pilfered and he realized he should preserve his costumes. “When I was getting fitted for my shoes for Godfather II, I think they were the shoes Warren Beatty wore in Bonnie and Clyde.”When asked about advice to the young film-makers in the audience, De Niro offered rallying words. “ I just say follow through on what you want to do. It might not be easy, but the only person you have is yourself to keep going. You just gotta keep doing it and believing in yourself. God helps those who help themselves.”Scorsese echoed those sentiments, noting it was never easy when it comes to the craft, even at his high level “[People will say:] ‘Oh, you have money and everything working for you’ and that’s never really the case. Often if you get a bigger budget, it’s worse in terms of the production. The more money, the more risk and therefore the pressure is on to take less chances aesthetically and artistically.“One thing [the director] Arthur Penn told me when I was a young film-maker was: ‘Remember, don’t lose your amateur status.’ He was right. You struggle feeling like an amateur, but it’samator, in Latin, which means love. That’s the thing you gotta hold on to.”However, Scorsese left the audience with this: “ The time is now to take advantage of whatever you can say,” said Scorsese. “Who knows what’s gonna happen. You have to really utilize what supposedly is called free speech.”Explore more on these topicsMartin ScorseseRobert De NiroTribeca film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What are the odds of a single man like me finding love in a hopeless place (Melbourne airport)?Tom GillFri 6 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTShareWhen John Nachlinger and Rafael Gavarrete accidentally collided with each other at the airport in Houston, Texas, “it was like a Hallmark Christmas movie,” Nachlinger, 44, says. He was travelling from New York to a funeral, while 27-year-old Gavarrete was returning home to Honduras – and despite only speaking for a few minutes, they exchanged numbers and kept in touch. Over the next year, they met up around once a month, taking turns to travel between New York and Honduras. In November 2022, they got married, and moved together to Princeton, New Jersey.Air travel has long carried a certain mystique. From the pioneering days of aviation to the glamour of the jet age, it has captivated imaginations with its promise of adventure, freedom and possibility. Perhaps that’s why pop culture casts airports as sites of grand romantic gestures. From When Harry Met Sally to Love Actually, they are often backdrops for unexpected meet-cutes and last-dash attempts for lovers to express their feelings.Nachlinger and Gavarrete’s story may sound like the plot of a romcom, but data suggests airport entanglements may be a case of art mirroring life. A2018 surveysuggested that, on any given flight, two couples will meet for the first time. And a2025 surveyof 3,000 single Americans by DatingAdvice.com found about athird of travellers reported flirting with a strangerat the airport, while 20% said they would alter their travel plans for someone they had just met. Meanwhile, thousands of TikTok #airportcrush videos document strangers locking eyes across departure lounges.The excitement of travel is very particular. It’s a novelty, it’s adventure, it’s something newWhy do we seem to be so open to romance while in transit? Psychologists point to the misattribution of arousal, a phenomenon where heightened emotions – such as stress, excitement and frustration – can be mistaken for attraction. Antonieta Contreras, a New York-based sex and trauma therapist, says: “The excitement of travel is very particular. It’s a novelty, it’s adventure, it’s something new. Combined with the anxiety of being on time or packing enough, the nervous system is very activated.” This heightened state can make us perceive those around us as more attractive than usual, especially when combined with the physical realities of air travel: being in close proximity with strangers, often from exotic places.There’s also something liberating about the perspective air travel offers. Looking down at the world in miniature from an altitude of 35,000ft literally shifts our point of view: fleeting connections may loom larger in our heads, and the possibilities of life feel more numerous.Contreras suggests that conversations struck up in transit also have lower stakes: “It feels that you can say whatever, and this person has no agenda in criticising or judging you. You may feel ‘this person has really seen me’ because there were no filters.” The same phenomenon may explain why people report being more likely to cry when viewing a movie in flight than on the ground.YouGov surveysin the UK suggest that most people would prefer to meet a partner in person despite, or perhaps because of, the dominance of dating apps. However, possibly due to the evolution towards phone-first dating culture, some people argue that “meet-cutes are going extinct”.The social script for making in-person connections is weaker than ever, and many singletons can get stuck in a paradox: frustrated with online dating but too socially cautious or nervous to start conversations in real life. Could air travel be the antidote? Single, and with science on my side, I took a trip to my local airport in Melbourne, Australia, to find out.The morning of my experiment, I feel nervous. I rarely go into the world completely sober while actively seeking a romantic connection. I start my journey on the tram and, in the spirit of openness, ignore my phone and observe those around me instead. As if sensing my willingness to engage, a more-than-eligible bachelor strikes up a conversation and asks for my number. This is the first time this has happened to me in broad daylight in many years. Am I already giving off a different energy?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charlie KinrossOnce at the airport, although I’m not travelling anywhere, I begin my experiment at check-in (in Australian airports you don’t need a boarding pass to get through security). I can’t usually relax until I’ve cleared security, and it seems others feel the same. Perched on a seat between rows of check-in desks for half an hour, I try to chat with strangers, but don’t get past simple niceties with most.I hope for better luck after security. Retail scientists use the term happy hour to describe the time people spend in departure lounges before their flight. Studies show we are more impulsive and open to suggestions airside, a phenomenon that influenced the advent of luxury airport shopping.In the security line, I notice no one is using their phone. Air travel is one of few domains where our phone use is restricted at various points, forcing us to make eye contact with others. I recognise someone from the airport bus, and we share a knowing smile. Are things looking up?As airports go, Melbourne’s isn’t the most inspiring. Its grey interiors don’t inspire connection and, once airside, my approaches feel forced. I settle with “Where are you off to today?”A group of friends enjoying a pre-flight drink chime in with their tales of travel romances. “The airport is its own world, closed off to the outside. There’s less choice, so someone you may not find that hot outside is hot in here,” says Jackson Gatto, who is in his 20s. There’s nothing like being trapped in a glass terminal with hundreds of strangers to lower your standards.Most people who’ve met someone at the airport believe they wouldn’t have made such a connection in a normal settingHowever, Gatto’s view isn’t shared by all of his fellow travellers. “It’s not the same when you’re travelling for work,” says Sally Hughes, a finance executive and regular flyer, who I meet in a bar typing away on her laptop. “I just want to get from A to B and catch up on emails. I don’t have time for romance.” If love is in the air, Sally’s wearing an eye mask and headphones to shut out the small talk.Our experience of airports has changed over time. Flying was once a glamorous and fairly exclusive form of travel. While budget airlines have made it more accessible, they have lowered comfort and service levels, which, along with tighter security rules, have made it less fun and freewheeling.But while baggage allowances may have shrunk, our capacity for emotional connection appears to have remained intact. Dr Steve Taylor, lecturer in psychology at Leeds Beckett University, says that as social rules in airports feel more relaxed, our sense of identity becomes more fluid: “We become disoriented, but also liberated … It predisposes us to be sociable. That feeling of disorientation you get at airports can be a pleasant experience.”Back in the departures lounge, passengers have been reunited with their phones and appear to be making up for lost screen time. They say comparison is the thief of joy – are phones the thief of connection? A gaggle of cabin crew waiting for their flight offer their thoughts. “Before mobiles, you used to be able to tell whether people were swapping numbers because they’d ask for a pen,” says one flight attendant. “Now people are buried in their phones.”Michael Davison, 63, who is retired and lives in France, met his ex-partner in the departures lounge at Istanbul airport in the late 1980s. They immediately hit it off, he says. “We didn’t know whether we’d be sitting together or not, but as fate would have it, we were.” They chatted for the whole four-hour flight home to London, and exchanged numbers in the arrivals hall. A few months later, they met up again, and went on to have two children and a 16-year relationship. Would their conversation have flowed as easily if they had been distracted by phones or in-flight entertainment? “Perhaps not,” Davison says.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charlie KinrossAs the day goes on, bars fill up and pre-flight drinks begin flowing more freely, making conversation easier. Most of my interactions start from small moments such as being asked: “Is someone sitting here?” Perhaps the physical proximity in airports lends itself to connection too.In a bar nursing a beer, I find Jordan, 32, on the final leg of his journey from London to Sydney, with two hours to kill in Melbourne. I strike up a conversation and we bond for a while about growing up in London. But he’s been awake for nearly 24 hours and I can tell romance isn’t on his radar.In a final attempt to find connection, I head towards the gate of a delayed flight, knowing that 30% of people surveyed by DatingAdvice.com think that bonding over frustration is a good way to meet a future partner. Looking at it optimistically, the difference between a long delay at an airport and a speed dating event is that at least at the airport you’ll eventually take off, even if a romance doesn’t.Now adept at assessing airport interactions, I see three people chatting and get the sense they have just met. “I noticed the programme Maddy was using on her laptop and asked what she was working on,” says Ben Tynan, 33, who admits he rarely speaks to strangers. So what made him spark up a conversation? It seems the proximity effect is at play: “I felt safe starting a conversation after I asked to move something next to her and she made a joke.”When the last flights of the day take off, I’m resigned to the fact none of my airport connections will result in lasting romance – apart from my suitor on the tram, perhaps (we are meeting up next week). When Nachlinger met his now husband, he says the connection was instant – normal social protocol seemed to melt away. “I didn’t even realise how old he was, I didn’t know his name, nothing,” and yet, “something told me I needed to get his number.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Charlie KinrossThroughout the day, I’ve heard many stories of romance blossoming airside. One common thread is that most people who’ve met someone at the airport believe they wouldn’t have made such a connection in a normal setting: sometimes we just need an excuse to spark up a conversation. Perhaps airports aren’t just transit points between locations, but between different versions of ourselves – the everyday self and the one emboldened to take bigger social risks. Maybe by replicating some of the social conditions of air travel in our daily lives – looking up more, using phones less, letting go of our fear of judgment – we’d make more connections landside.Taylor says it is possible: “When we live according to strict identity and routines, we can feel trapped. At the airport, that weight starts to lift. We can learn from that.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsDatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In our series,My feelgood movie, Guardian writers reflect on their go-to flick, and explain why their pick is endlessly rewatchable.This list will be updated weekly with further picks.Want more options?Here is our earlier list of the10 best escapist moviesand52 comforting, rewatchable titles.Angus, Thongs and Perfect SnoggingDirector:Gurinder ChadhaStarring:Georgia Groome, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Karen TaylorWhy our writer loves it:“That’s the magic of Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging for our generation. It reminds us of the joyous madness of our school days, when everything was awkward, messy and packed with heart.”(Anya Ryan)Read the full reviewAngus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging is available on Hoopla and Kanopy in the US or to rent digitally or on Amazon Prime and Paramount+ in the UKAmélieDirector:Jean-Pierre JeunetStarring:Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz and RufusWhy our writer loves it:“After completing several good deeds, Amélie falls in love with the elusive Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), a sex shop employee who likes to collect strangers’ photobooth pictures … Although Amélie’s kindness might be the apotheosis of whimsy, it’s radical in its own way – a quiet protest against the indifference and self-interest that seem to rule city life.”(Katie Tobin)Read the full reviewAmélie is available to rent digitally in the USThe Towering InfernoDirector:John GuillerminStarring:Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and William HoldenWhy our writer loves it:“Among the many reasons I’m long overdue for therapy would be that I consider a feature about a bunch of people trapped in a burning skyscraper a feelgood movie. But there it is: the stunning effects (which hold up to this day), the sprawling, larger-than-life cast and accompanying who-will-make-it-to-the-end? suspense, the earnest, cheeseball dialogue – whenever I feel anxious or down, something about The Towering Inferno offers solace.”(Matthew Hays)Read the full reviewThe Towering Inferno is available to buy digitally in the US and rent digitally in the UKWagon MasterStarring:Ben Johnson, Joanne Dru and Harry Carey Jr.Directed by:John FordWhy our writer loves it:“Wagon Master’s great appeal lies in the feel of the thing. ‘Be gentle’, Travis encourages a restless horse, and that spirit pervades the film. It is Ford’s gentlest picture and arguably his most beautiful, both on the surface and beneath it. The film is a plea for tolerance – most of its characters having just been run out of town – that is augmented by a thousand perfect details in word and image: the dialogue spare and true, Ford’s camera going to a square dance and focusing first on the wooden planks shifting in the dirt.”(Rick Burin)Read the full reviewWagon Master is on Tubi in the US and on BBC iPlayer in the UKJawsStarring:Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard DreyfussDirected by:Steven SpielbergWhy our writer loves it:“What makes a film ‘feelgood’? If it’s not a romcom, or otherwise setting out to impart warm fuzzies, familiarity plays a big part. I’ve seen Jaws so many times that watching it now truly feels like sinking into a warm bath.”(Elle Hunt)Read the full reviewJaws is available to rent digitally in the US and is on Amazon Prime in the UKI Wanna Hold Your HandStarring:Stars Nancy Allen, Bobby Di Cicco and Marc McClureDirected by:Robert ZemeckisWhy our writer loves it:“Even at the height of their parasocial hijinks, Zemeckis never treats girlhood obsession with a hint of mockery or condescension. Rather, it’s an affectionate celebration of what it means to be a fan – its heady thrills and innate universality – as hilarious as it is relatable. I wasn’t born anywhere near the 60s, but every time I rewatch I Wanna Hold Your Hand, I feel like I missed out on all the fun.”(Miatta Mbriwa)Read the full reviewThe Lizzie McGuire MovieStarring:Hilary Duff and Adam LambergDirected by:Jim FallWhy our writer loves it:“Nostalgia clouds the mind but I do think this movie is genuinely funny … While the film is undeniably a trite tableau of teen movie cliches, it avoids the harshest and grossest ones that were popular at the time. No one is mocked for having an eating disorder or stalked oh-so-romantically. It is aspirational in the silliest sense – while other movies might’ve inspired you to flirt like this or dance like that, nothing in The Lizzie McGuire Movie could be copied: you’re either in danger of being mistaken for an Italian pop star or you’re not. This means it didn’t make 11-year-old me feel bad about herself, and it still makes adult me feel good.”(Amelia Tait)Read the full reviewThe Lizzie McGuire Movie is available to watch on Disney+ in the US and UKSullivan’s TravelsStarring:Veronica Lake and Joel McCreaDirected by:Preston SturgesWhy our writer loves it: “Sullivan’s Travels reminds us there’s something inherently incorruptible about clinging to the scraps of happiness we’re given.”(Alaina Demopoulos)Read the full reviewSullivan’s Travels is available to rent digitally in the US and UKThe RebelStarring:Tony HancockDirected by:Robert DayWhy our writer loves it:“[T]there is something rather wonderful about seeing Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock in full and living colour, operating at the height of his powers, the man who his writersdescribedas ‘the best comic actor in the business’. And of course the film is a wonderful portal to a vanished world, a net-curtained Britain just on the cusp of its transformation by 60s pop culture. Lucian Freud called The Rebel the best film ever made about modern art; well, he should know, but for me it’s more than that – there’s an extra joy in remembering the hours I spent tittering at it with Dad as we lolled on the three-piece suite back in my gormless teenage years. If anything makes me feel good, it’s that.”(Andrew Pulver)Read the full reviewWithnail and IStarring:Paul McGann and Richard E GrantDirected by:Bruce RobinsonWhy our writer loves it:“The tape went back to Blockbuster. I bought my own. I took it to college and watched it drunk and sober, with friends and alone, in halls and in my desperate pit of a house. Through early adulthood, into fatherhood, on DVD then streaming. To watch Withnail is to discover it again.”(Martin Pengelly)Withnail and I is available on Max and the Criterion channel in the US and on Channel 4 in the UKRead the full reviewYou’ve Got MailStarring:Tom Hanks and Meg RyanDirected by:Nora EphronWhy our writer loves it:You’ve Got Mail “may be naive and soppy, but as a single person it keeps me optimistic that genuine connection may still be found by logging on to your computer (or unlocking your iPhone)”.(Alim Kheraj)Read the full reviewYou’ve Got Mail is available on Hulu in the US and on Now TV in the UKWhen Harry Met SallyStarring:Billy Crystal and Meg RyanDirected by:Rob ReinerWhy our writer loves it:“I sometimes ask myself whether I should love When Harry Met Sally as much as I do. I mean, isn’t the film a bit reductive when it comes to gender? Maybe. Yet at the same time, it’s a romantic comedy that’s actually romantic and actually funny, something few romcoms can boast today. But the reason it’s my feelgood film is because I discovered it at a time when I needed it most.”(Henry Roberts)Read the full reviewWhen Harry Met Sally is available to rent digitally in the US and UKKabhi Khushi Kabhie GhamStarring:Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Amitabh BachchanDirected by:Karan JoharWhy our writer loves it:“Scenes from this movie are seared in mind and I often quote its lines in my daily life – such is its hold on me. I am a complete sucker for the drama, the music, the pageantry, the familiar (though outdated) movie tropes, the costumes, the sets – after all, I grew up watching Bollywood movies (SRK is the love of my life, he just doesn’t know it). It is a heaping dose of nostalgia that instantly uplifts my mood and restores my spirit, no matter how in the doldrums the world around might seem.”(Tasneem Merchant)Read the full reviewKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is available on Netflix and Amazon Prime in the US and UKThe PaperStarring:Michael Keaton, Glenn Close and Robert DuvallDirected by:Ron HowardWhy our writer loves it:“Perhaps it’s all just borrowed nostalgia for the half-remembered 90s, to remix James Murphy’slyric. But I see it as a feelgood film that makes you feel good because it never shouts about it; there’s no need to force joy, it’s just there in all that messy exuberance. The maddening life happening relentlessly, the people at work in the loud city, the thrill of chasing down a story – this is what is actually joyful.”(Larry Ryan)Read the full reviewThe Paper is available to rent digitally in the US and UKThe Wedding SingerStarring:Adam Sandler and Drew BarrymoreDirected by:Frank CoraciWhy our writer loves it:“One thing I love most about The Wedding Singer is the soundtrack that includes You Spin Me Round (Like a Record), Blue Monday and Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic. Barrymore sings a bit of 99 Luftballons into her oversize headphones. Sandler gets to perform his own compositions: Somebody Kill Me (“I was listening to the Cure a lot when I wrote this”) and Grow Old With You – the latter he performs on a plane to stop Barrymore from marrying the evil Glenn. The ending features a brilliant cameo from 1998 Billy Idol playing 1980s Billy Idol, who wakes from his booze-addled slumber to shove Glenn in the airplane toilets. (“Excuse me, sir. I have to serve the beverages.”)”(Rich Pelley)The Wedding Singer is available to rent digitally in the US and on Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewMamma Mia!Starring:Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Pierce BrosnanDirected by:Phyllida LloydWhy our writer loves it:“Mamma Mia! isn’t a movie – it’s a holiday. It’s a film so divorced from subtext and intricacy that its only ask for viewers is to bask in the Greek sunshine as the sounds of Abba wash over them … It was never meant to be taken seriously; it’s a film without pretense. Much of what he complains about is precisely what makes Mamma Mia! the perfect cinematic comfort blanket.”(Jeffrey Ingold)Mamma Mia! is available on Max in the US and on Now in the UKRead the full reviewPink FlamingosStarring:Divine, David Lochary and Mary Vivian PearceDirected by:John WatersWhy our writer loves it:“The will to create a movie for the specific purpose of appalling anyone unaware of its true meaning turned Pink Flamingos into the ultimate litmus test. You either got its sick jokes or you didn’t. But those who did got something far more lasting than a laugh. We got a one-way ticket to an underground populated by parallel dissidents, an entire community of the unruly and free. That’s a lot to gain, which is why, even decades after I first saw Pink Flamingos, I return to it whenever I need to be reminded there’s a universe of possibilities out there not reflected in the world we know now.”(Jim Farber)Read the full reviewDefending Your LifeStarring:Meryl Streep and Albert BrooksDirected by:Albert BrooksWhy our writer loves it:“Life-affirming” is perhaps an overused adjective, but few movies have successfully illuminated the human condition as well as this one. Fear is commonplace in our daily lives, but Albert Brooks’s film might hold the key to ridding the worries of anxiety-ridden people such as myself. As the new year often brings about feelings of regret and unease, Defending Your Life is the warmest hug you can receive.”(Oliver Macnaughton)Defending Your Life is available to rent digitally in the US and the UKRead the full reviewNotting HillStarring:Julia Roberts and Hugh GrantDirected by:Roger MichellWhy our writer loves it:“What is so wonderful about the film is how effortless it all seems. The story isn’t complex; there are no gunfights or CGI raccoons; the greatest jeopardy in the film involves Grant having to catch Roberts before she goes back to America – a problem that reads as plausibly insurmountable in 1999 but today would be remedied with a few WhatsApps. But, despite the illusion of effortlessness, getting everything right in this way is deceptively tricky. Has a single romcom ever managed to marry all of the necessary elements – cast, script, timing, an intangible magic – so perfectly? (No. The answer is no.)”(Ralph Jones)Notting Hill is available on Netflix in the US and Channel 4 in the UKRead the full reviewMarried to the MobStarring:Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew ModineDirected by:Jonathan DemmeWhy our writer loves it:The movie is a long list of quirky pleasures, including a “starter kit of premium 80s college rock (New Order, Pixies, the Feelies), well-placed family dog reaction shots, and an FBI agent who dresses himself like Wallace in the Wallace & Gromit shorts. Few of the laughs in the film feel like punchlines or payoffs to some heavily orchestrated joke. Demme’s approach is more low-key and breezy, cruising confidently on the assumption that his DayGlo gangland will be fun enough without him having to push too hard. He catches a rhythm and does the mambo Italiano. It feels like your feet never touch the floor.”(Scott Tobias)Married to the Mob is available on Hoopla, Kanopy and Pluto in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewRush HourStarring:Jackie Chan and Chris TuckerDirected by:Brett RatnerWhy our writer loves it:“Rush Hour taps into something that stirred my heart then and now: an ease settles into the two actors, Chan and Tucker’s joviality feeling so genuine that the east-meets-west tropes evolve into characters who have something real at stake, and who are also having fun.”(Tammy Tarng)Rush Hour is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewFather of the BrideStarring:Steve Martin, Diane Keaton and Martin ShortDirected by:Charles ShyerWhy our writer loves it: “Why do I come back to this film again and again? As a girl and younger woman I was emphatically against marriage (though I’ve since softened) and watched it more as a comedy horror than anything aspirational. The only aspect of the Bankses’ life I’d want is the kitchen. And yet watching Franck and the family put on their ridiculous show makes me want to be part of it. I love ritual, and ceremony, and Steve Martin, and Martin Short, and Diane Keaton.”(Laura Snapes)Where to watch:Father of the Bride is available on Hulu and Disney+ in the US and on Disney+ in the UK and AustraliaRead the full reviewDiggstown AKA Midnight StingStarring:James Woods and Louis Gossett JrDirected by:Michael RitchieWhy our writer loves it:“Diggstown is the perfect feelgood movie – a breezy but exciting genre mashup with enough of a hangout vibe that you can have it on in the background, but also enough stakes that you will inevitably end up giving it your full attention.”(Zach Vasquez)Where to watch:Diggstown is available on Amazon PrimeRead the full reviewBurlesqueStarring:Cher and Christina AguileraDirected by:Steve AntinWhy our writer loves it:“Many of those who panned Burlesque on its release would feel punished by this cosmically appointed choice of comfort movie. A sequined patchwork quilt of all manner of backstage musicals and melodramas from various eras of Hollywood – starring, in a naked reach for cross-generational gay fandom, dual divas Christina Aguilera and Cher – the film inspired critical comparisons to A Star is Born, Cabaret and Showgirls, most of them unflattering. It made $90m at the global box office: not a flop but not a palpable hit either, least of all for a film where the feather budget alone could have funded a modest indie drama. Antin, whose long but scattered pre-Burlesque career ran the gamut from acting to screenwriting to stunt work to producing Pussycat Dolls reality shows, hasn’t directed another film since. The world, by and large, hasn’t mourned.”(Guy Lodge)Where to watch:Burlesque is available to watch on Netflix in the US, on Sky Cinema in the UK and ABC iView and Amazon Prime in AustraliaRead the full reviewHead of StateStarring:Chris Rock and Bernie MacDirected by:Chris RockWhy our writer loves it:“I’ve come back to this film so many times after the election for laughs, only to wind up seeing the whole picture as a clearer allegory for Kamala Harris’s defeat than Obama’s victory. Like Harris, [Chris Rock starring as Mays Gilliam, a small-time politician turned presidential hopeful] was a party sacrifice, offered up to make a certain loss look less bad on the cards, thrown into the fray at the 11th hour, plugged into a humming campaign apparatus, and touted as a history maker. It really makes you think about how close comedy is to horror.”(Andrew Lawrence)Where to watch:Head of State is available to stream in the US on Freevee, Tubi, Paramount+ and MGM+, in the UK on Paramount+ and on Amazon Prime in AustraliaRead the full reviewA Knight’s TaleStarring:Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon and Paul BettanyDirected by:Brian HelgelandWhy our writer loves it:“To me, watching a feelgood film is an intensely nostalgic exercise. That’s because whenever a film is special or timely enough to take up lodging in your heart, rewatching it is also an act of remembering an old version of yourself.A Knight’s Taleis shaded by the genuine sadness of Ledger’s death only seven years after its release, but when I watch it I also remember the way it used to make me feel, as a girl who loved the jousting because her older brother did, all the while secretly cherishing an action film for being so brazenly sentimental.”(Francesca Carington)Where to watch:A Knight’s Tale is available on Amazon Prime in the US and available to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaRead the full reviewAlita: Battle AngelStarring:Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz and Jennifer ConnellyDirected by:Robert RodriguezWhy our writer loves it:“My feelgood movie for when humanity lets me down is Alita: Battle Angel, a movie where much of humanity hangs out in a city-sized junkpile. And though I don’t press play with this aspect particularly in mind, it’s nice to imagine a future where things have gone terribly wrong (that just seems realistic at this point) yet unforeseen triumphs still emerge from the tech-nightmare garbage heap. There are plenty of more time-honored films that take a more direct path to temporary bliss, including sci-fi movies better-equipped to restore faith in humanity.”(Jesse Hassenger)Where to watch:Alita: Battle Angel is available to watch on Hulu in the US, on Netflix and Disney+ in the UK and on Disney+ in AustraliaRead the full reviewI Know Where I’m Going!Starring:Wendy Hiller, Roger Livesey, Pamela BrownDirected by:Michael Powell and Emeric PressburgerWhy our writer loves it:”I Know Where I’m Going! offers up such portentous moments of mystical and romantic significance lightly, alongside comical asides and colourful eccentricity. It’s a disarming strategy, which tends to leave the audience every bit as bewitched as (the film’s main character) Joan. In this corner of the universe, anything might be possible, even an ancient curse.”(Pamela Hutchinson)Read the fullreview for I Know Where I’m Going!Where to watch:I Know Where I’m Going! is available to watch on Tubi, Amazon Prime and the Criterion Channel in the US and is available to rent digitally Australia and in the UK and watch on BBC iPlayerRead the full reviewExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood moviefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Being an IMO competitor, it takes a lot of hard work and talent and gifts and, for them [in training for the IMO] they can exercise that, they can exercise some freedom inside the prison which isGaza.“For them [it should be] a life-changing opportunity where they can taste freedom for the first time.”The problem facing AlHajajla and his young Palestinians is logistical and political. Last year, four Palestinians – two from Gaza and two from the West Bank – were selected for the 2024 IMO in Bath, England, but were unable to take part.The closure of the Rafah crossing meant those in Gaza could not leave. Visas and passports for those in the West Bank were approved by British and Israeli authorities, but did not arrive in time.A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in Australia says they are “not aware of any evidence that Israel delayed or refused visas for the Palestinian team at the last IMO, nor do we have information suggesting this will occur now”.Mike Clapper is the interim chief executive of the Australian Mathematics Trust, which is organising the Sunshine Coast event. He says it is “very much our hope” that the Palestinian team will be able to come in person.“We are exploring all the avenues that we can to try to make it possible for the Palestinians to participate,” he says.‘A clearcut treasonous thing’Whether Palestinians can compete is only one part of the IMO’s problem. The other is whether Israelis should be allowed to do so.On 6 May a letter signed by more than 700 mathematicians was issued to the IMO under the heading “Mathematics and Moral Responsibility: the IMO and the Genocide in Gaza”.The letter calls on the IMO to do as it did when it suspended Russia’s membership after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine – while allowing its six students to compete remotely as private individuals. Russia remains suspended.Signatories come from a diverse range of countries, universities and career stages: from Australia to Morocco to Switzerland; from Oxford to Stanford to the University of Carthage; from PhD researchers to associate professors to three winners of the Fields medal – the award often referred to as the Nobel prize of maths.The letter – seen by Guardian Australia – has not been published, to protect signatories from harassment.Among them is an Israeli, a former IMO medallist, who asked for their name to be withheld.“I needed to think about it for a second because of the potential danger,” they say.“If I would tell this to random people in the street it would be, I would not say controversial, it would be considered a clearcut treasonous thing to do.”But, they say: “We see what is happening in Gaza: there’s war crimes, there’s starvation, the genocide. For me it is clearcut. It is the moral thing – it is the obligatory thing to do in this situation.”They hope the suspension of Israel would be a symbolic act that would help “put a mirror in the face of the Israeli nation”and cause their compatriots to reflect on “what direction this country is going”.The Israeli embassy in Canberra flatly rejected the call.“The embassy strongly opposes any call to suspend Israel’s IMO membership or to boycott its students,” its spokesperson said.“Mathematics must remain apolitical and inclusive.”The power to transform livesThe Israeli signatory, like so many young mathematicians, says competing at the IMO was a “transformative experience”.The first signatory of the letter is the research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, Ahmed Abbes. The son of a Tunisian high school maths teacher, he recalls the IMO as his “making as a mathematician”.Abbes won a bronze medal at his first IMO in Canberra in 1988. The following year in Braunschweig, Germany, he won silver, rubbing shoulders and making lifelong connections with teenagers who would go on to become some of the world’s most influential people.View image in fullscreenNicuşor Dan, Romania’s president and a two-time International Mathematics Olympiad gold medallist.Photograph: Robert Ghement/EPARanked No 1 in the world in 1988, for the second year running, was Nicuşor Dan, who won a second consecutive gold medal with his second perfect score. In May,he emerged from Romania’s political crisisas its new president.At that same IMO the Australian prime minister, Bob Hawke, presented a gold medal to an even younger prodigy, a 12-year-old Australian called Terence Tao. Tao remains the youngest ever IMO gold medallist and is now regarded by many as the greatest living mathematician.View image in fullscreenBob Hawke presents 12-year-old Terence Tao with the gold medal at the 1988 Canberra International Mathematical Olympiad.Photograph: Australian Mathematics TrustA more recent example of the IMO’s power to transform lives is Ihor Pylaiev. Pylaiev was plucked from war-ravaged Kharkiv in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to continue his studies in Paris. He won his second gold medal in Oslo, this time with a perfect score and the top world ranking. He is now studying at Cambridge on a scholarship with colleagues from the Ukrainian IMO team.Abbes, who led efforts to support Pylaiev and the Ukrainian students, says the mathematical community’s response to the Russian invasion is another chapter in its proud history of standing up for human rights.“When you accept that there are universal values, you just apply them, like you apply a mathematical theorem,” Abbes says.“When you see clearly the double standard [in not applying the same lens to Israel], as a mathematician you cannot accept this.”Australia has a proud history of standing up against human catastrophe. Gaza should be no exception | Ed HusicRead moreThe president of the IMO board, Gregor Dolinar, denies accusations of double standards.Since assuming the presidency in 2023, the Slovenian professor has overseen the incorporation of the IMO as an association, based in the Netherlands.“I wanted to make things more formal, more professional,” Dolinar says. “Now we have set up a government structure properly.”Dolinar says it is his “strong belief” that important decisions such as suspending nations should be made not by his board, but by the IMO jury, which includes representatives from more than 100 states and territories. The jury, he says, will meet at the Sunshine Coast in July and could make the decision to suspend Israel then.“Our primary goal is just focusing on [developing] young minds and, based on a very long tradition, doing a nice event,” Dolinar says. “We really do want to avoid any political issues. We really do want to be apolitical.“Our primary goal is to enable as many kids as possible to participate at the IMO.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMathematicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The world No 1 continued to demonstrate his superiority over all challengers at Roland Garros as he closed out a supremely clutch performance againstNovak Djokovic, the sixth seed, with a 6-4, 7-5, 7-6 (3) win to reach the final of the French Open for the first time.Sinner has now won 20 straight matches at grand slam tournaments and on Sunday he will attempt to win his third straight major title. He is the fifth man this century to reach three consecutive grand slam finals, following the path of the four legendary players before him: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray. He has still not dropped a set in Paris this year.French Open 2025 semi-finals: Sinner v Djokovic, Alcaraz battles past Musetti – liveRead moreA long-awaited first major final between the two leading players of the new generation awaits. Sinner, the No 1, will next face the second seed Carlos Alcaraz, who defeated Lorenzo Musetti 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0 ret, in what will be the first major final between two players born in the 2000s. Sinner has been untouchable on hard courts at the biggest events over the past 18 months, but he now will attempt to win his first significant title on clay, against an opponent who beat him on the surface in the final in Rome only three weeks ago. That was the fourth time in a row Alcaraz had prevailed against Sinner.Two days after producing a magnificent performance to scupper Alexander Zverev, the third seed, and advance to his second consecutive major semi-final, Djokovic returned to Court Philippe-Chatrier attempting to become the oldest Roland Garros finalist in history. Although the 38-year-old has continued to register wins over many of the best players in the world, Sinner has proven a step too far.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner plays a backhand return to Novak Djokovic.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesFrom the start, Sinner set the bar high by imposing relentless pressure on Djokovic with his suffocating pace and weight of shot, narrowing the court with his defence and offering so few errors. Under immediate pressure to match Sinner’s level, Djokovic struggled to find his range and the world No 1 took an emphatic first set.As the Serb tried to find a way back, he left his heart on Chatrier, throwing himself into every shot and maintaining his effort until the end. After years of battling adversarial crowds, Djokovic’s status as the tour’s elder statesman and an underdog against the new generation has earned him significant respect and support. He called on the crowd to contribute at every potential turning point. “I don’t think I have ever received this much support in this stadium in my career in big matches against the best players in the world,” said Djokovic. “So very, very honoured to experience that.”Quick GuideKlugman makes history in juniorsShowHannah Klugman has become the first British player to reach the French Open juniors final in almost 50 years.The 16-year-old from Kingston-upon-Thames battled through to her maiden grand slam final after a gritty 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over the Bulgarian Rositsa Dencheva.Klugman is the first Briton to achieve the feat since Michelle Tyler claimed the title in 1976, the same year Sue Barker won the women’s event.Klugman will face 17-year-old Austrian Lilli Tagger in Saturday’s final.Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski are through to the final of the men’s doubles.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Although Sinner was clearly nervous in numerous tense moments in the final two sets, and the crowd tried to pressure him, his focus and intensity never wavered. Every time the moment required it, he found his best tennis. After failing to serve for the second set at 5-4, Sinner responded with an immediate break and hold to close it out. In a tense third set, he saved three set points on his serve at 4-5 before sealing the victory with an excellent tie-break.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic screams in frustration during his battling performance at Roland Garros.Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite his tireless fighting spirit, Djokovic spent the entire match behind on the scoreboard, desperately fighting for a breakthrough. As is the case for almost anyone across the net from Sinner these days, the world No 1 did not allow that to happen.As he departed Philippe-Chatrier, a court that has witnessed three of his grand slam titles and his long-awaited Olympic gold medal, an emotional Djokovic placed his bags down and took a moment to thank all corners of the crowd before bending down to touch the red clay. “This could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don’t know,” said Djokovic. “That’s why I was a bit more emotional even in the end. But if this was the farewell match of Roland Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd.”Asked to elaborate, Djokovic shrugged. He does not know when his journey will come to an end. “I really don’t know what tomorrow brings at this point in my career,” he said, smiling. “I’m going to keep on keeping on.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Jannik SinnerNovak DjokovicFrench OpenTennismatch reportsShareReuse this content"

And it was a measure not only of his ability to own the narrative, to master it, but his body of work at Tottenham that he was able to do so with such conviction.The manager was charged with three tasks when he was given the job in June 2023. To overhaul the team’s playing style, essentially to make them more entertaining. To reboot the squad with an emphasis on youth. And to win. Actually, there was a fourth, which talked to pretty much everything. To reshape the culture around the club, unifying everyone behind a cause, an identity.Tottenham sack Ange Postecoglou as head coach despite Europa League gloryRead moreThe way that Postecoglou told it and will continue to tell it as he processes how he has becomethe latest statistic of the Daniel Levy erais he delivered on the principle three. And, despite all the external negativity, he struck a telling blow at the very end in the battle to tick the final box.Ange-ball was a breath of fresh air at Spurs, the counterpoint to the counterattacking of the previous three managers – José Mourinho, Nuno Espírito Santo and Antonio Conte. The club’s fans want their team to play on the front foot, to take chances and there is no doubt that Postecoglou has the same vision. It is how he always looks to set up, with pace and aggression, the change showcased to wide eyes from his first match – the pre‑season friendly against West Ham in Australia. The difference to what had been before was radical.Postecoglou bought into the selection policy, the bets on players with high ceilings for improvement, even if he knew that moving on a good number of experienced ones,starting with Harry Kane, was a risk. In a sense the approach has represented Levy going back to what he has long believed in. A part of Postecoglou’s legacy is the successful promotion of a host of young signings – including Micky van de Ven, Lucas Bergvall, Archie Gray and Brennan Johnson. You can also include Destiny Udogie, who was new to the squad when Postecoglou arrived and also Pape Sarr, who had not played much for the team.View image in fullscreenThe league form of Spurs last season was in stark contrast to the heights of early 2023-24.Photograph: Alex Morton/Tottenham Hotspur FC/ShutterstockThe most robust pillar of Postecoglou’s legacy is, of course, what he and the team achieved in the Europa League,beating Manchester United in the finalin Bilbao to draw a thick line under the club’s 17-year trophy drought. It was so much more than Postecoglou making good on his “I always win things in my second season” comment.The triumph brought a mass outpouring of emotion among supporters who have been mocked without mercy by their rivals in London and beyond. For those that made it to Bilbao, in particular, it was the night that will live for ever in their hearts. It has lifted a weight from the club, breaking a cycle that had almost become self-perpetuating, providing a riposte to the pundits who, as Postecoglou would have it, are quick to lead the pile-ons; to all of those who do.Elite-level football is about the do-or-die moments. One result really can change perceptions, how a club feels about itself; the same with people on the outside. Thanks to Postecoglou, Spurs can call themselves winners. They have even kicked down the backdoor into the Champions League. So, how has Levy made this decision, one that has triggered the inevitable backlash? Trust him to sack a manager who has actually won. It is because Levy does not like winners. It is not who Spurs are, mate.Here is the thing. When Levy weighed up the case against Postecoglou, he found that – weirdly, uniquely – it also carried an irresistible strength. The chair loved Bilbao. He is grateful to Postecoglou for it. But what Levy wants is more than a one-punch knockout. Consider the line in his programme notes from thelast game of the season against Brighton.“The Europa League is one trophy – our clear ambition as a club has always been long-term, sustained success … competing for top honours every year,” he wrote.For the majority of his tenure, Postecoglou sung from the same hymn sheet. He said that a cup victory would not be a “panacea”. Consistency in the Premier League was the priority. Do that and the rest would take care of itself. He changed his tune from around the turn of the year, a shift born out of circumstance – specifically an injury-hit squad being unable to fight on multiple fronts.Postecoglou would put everything on the Europa League, coming to rest and rotate for it; an all-or-nothing gamble, which he felt paid off handsomely. And yet – as even he admitted – not everyone at the club was happy with the strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Postecoglou made a thrilling start to his tenure, winning eight and drawing two of 10 league matches, his record in the competition read: P66 W23 D9 L34 Pts 78. Do the sums and it is 45 points per 38 games, the length of a season. This time out, Spurs collected just 38 points to limp home in 17th. Only once in their history have they had a worse record – in 1914-15 when they won eight and drew 12 of 38 matches.In the Europa League knockout rounds, Postecoglou’s team beat AZ, Eintracht Frankfurt, Bodø/ Glimt and the worst version of United since 1973-74 according to league statistics. In the cold light of day, Levy concluded that the run could not make up for the consistent vulnerability in the league.View image in fullscreenSergio Reguilón and James Maddison of Tottenham hold up a banner of Ange Postecoglou.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Uefa/Getty ImagesHe looked past Postecoglou’s assertion that 17th was a false position because of the bet on Europe; it was unacceptable, a failure to balance the demands. How could Levy be confident that Postecoglou would manage better in a Champions League season? Furthermore, were the injuries not a consequence of his full-throttle approach?Whither Ange-ball? It was to Postecoglou’s credit that he rowed back on some of his fundamentals – most notably in the Europa League. One of the defining images of his tenure was inthe early weeks against Chelseawhen, despite two red cards, he ordered all of his remaining outfield players to hold a defensive line on halfway. That seems like a long time ago, as did the giddy praise for such derring-do. Equally, we did not see much of the fast and incisive stuff in his closing months.“Are you not entertained?” Postecoglou once memorably asked, channelling his inner Gladiator. Yes, Ange, we were. The English game has lost a compelling character.Explore more on these topicsAnge PostecoglouTottenham HotspurAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now, finally, they are within 80 minutes of claiming their first domestic league title since 1995-96 after a storming second-half revival put paid to a gallantBristolside who had led by seven points at half-time.If the outcome was still theoretically up in the air at the interval there was not a shred of doubt by the hour mark, Bath launching a blistering fusillade that yielded four converted tries without reply and underlined their status as short-priced favourites to lift thePremiershiptrophy at Twickenham next Saturday. “This team is tough to beat,” confirmed their head coach, Johann van Graan. “Bristol asked some questions but effort-wise I couldn’t be prouder. That is what it takes to get to Twickenham.”Bath 34-20 Bristol: Premiership rugby union semi-final – as it happenedRead moreThe final margin was slightly harsh on a Bears team who played a full part in a stonking contest that, once again, ticked pretty much every box from an entertainment perspective. Bristol were thrilling to watch in the first half but never quite managed to build the kind of scoreboard pressure that might have caused a famous upset, eventually disappearing beneath a quartet of third-quarter tries from Ted Hill, Joe Cokanasiga, Will Muir and Max Ojomoh, all converted by a nerveless Finn Russell.The British & Irish Lion did limp off towards the end but Bath’s management insisted he was primarily suffering from cramp. Van Graan, though, was more direct regarding some of the pre-match remarks made by director of rugby Pat Lam, who referenced Bath’s more expensively assembled squad and advised his wife not to attend because of the probability of her being soaked if she sat out in the famously exposed – not to mention pricey – open stand at the Rec. “Our team certainly did their talking on the pitch,” retorted Van Graan. “We certainly got a lot of motivation from Bristol. It was brilliant all the commentary we got from the opposition. We didn’t say a word and the scoreboard speaks for itself.”It was always destined to be a passion filled evening on the banks of the River Avon and a fast and furious game matched the febrile atmosphere. Bristol had won 11 of the previous 14 matches between the clubs and it was the Bears who attacked with most relish in perfect dry conditions. Fly-half AJ McGintyslotted the game’s first points after Guy Pepper was slightly too enthusiastic at the breakdown and a shaken Bath found themselves 10 points down when a spectacular long-range counterattack launched by Kalaveti Ravouvou and some deft forward interplay ended with the second row James Dun galloping over by the posts.Dun’s father Andy was once a Bristol stalwart and the whole crackling occasion felt deeply personal, with more than simple bragging rights at stake. It was definitely not helpful to the Bears’ cause, then, when Ravouvou was shown a yellow card for trying to stop Bath taking a quick tap and cost his side a further three points in the process.View image in fullscreenFinn Russell was nerveless as he converted all four tries for Bath.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockEven with 14 men, though, Bristol kept on coming. Bath’s defence were pulled this way and that, the point of attack constantly shifting. Only a desperate rearguard action prevented the Bears from scoring another belting multi-phase try and a botched lineout drill five metres out then allowed Bath to escape again.When Bristol do flick the turbo switch they look irresistible but games of top-level rugby are not definitively settled inside the first 40 minutes, particularly at this venue. Bath’s strength in depth has frequently been their trump card this season so it was doubly worrying for the Bears when the effervescent Harry Randall was led away with a damaged shoulder and replaced by Kieran Marmion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Losing in the final is one thing but going down at home to Bristol in a massive semi-final? The onus was on Bath’s familiar matchwinners to come up with the antidote to the onrushing grizzly Bears for whom Viliame Mata, Steven Luatua and Benhard Janse van Rensburg were all exerting their usual influence.And, sure enough, in the first 19 minutes after the restart four servings of much-needed relief duly materialised. First the visitors messed up the restart, conceded a soft penalty and gave Bath the platform from which to launch a purposeful attack which ended with Hill scoring in the left corner. Russell’s wide-angled conversion was a further bonus and there was even better to come, a horrible bounce eluding Ravouvou and allowing Cokanasiga to strike.Now the tide was turning and some tight refereeing calls were also going Bath’s way. A pass by Noah Heward was adjudged fractionally forward and, once again, the home side were instantly energised. Muir crashed over in the left corner to extend the lead further and, within five minutes with Bristol again down to 14 players, Ojomoh inflicted further hefty damage. Even when sorely tested this stacked Bath squad, having already topped the regular season table by 11 points, tend to come up with a resounding answer.Explore more on these topicsPremiershipBathBristolRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Playing his first Twenty20 international since stepping down from the white-ball captaincy he struck a 59-ball 96 to set up England’s 21-run win against West Indies.If there was any glumness for the 34-year-old, it was in missing out on what would have been his first T20 international century at home. Nonetheless, Buttler top scored in a total of 188 before Liam Dawson got to work.England v West Indies: first men’s T20 cricket international – liveRead moreThe left-arm spinner has been the darling of the county game in recent seasons but this was his return to the England show after nearly three years away. His story has long been that of the drinks carrier, an unused member of the 2019 World Cup winning squad, there to play in case of emergency. Here he was part of the main cast, opening the bowling in West Indies’ reply, and celebrated his best international figures, four wickets for 20 runs, his control crucial.A new life begins for Dawson at this level, perhaps leading to a partnership with Adil Rashid at next year’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. England entered this contest with just two seamers, a nod to that upcoming assignment.“We don’t want to look too far ahead but I think we’ve got to trial some things like this,” said Harry Brook, England’s captain. “Not completely set on this structure of the team but it’s worth a go and thankfully it worked today.”Traffic had disrupted West Indies before the third one-day international at the Oval; this time it was British immigration policy. The recent introduction of a visa requirement for visitors from Trinidad and Tobago led to the absence of Akeal Hosein, the left-arm spinner still waiting to complete the process.CricketWest Indies “remains optimistic” that the matter will be sorted in the coming days, but this quickfire three-match series concludes on Tuesday.View image in fullscreenLiam Dawson celebrates after Jos Buttler stumps Johnson Charles to give him his first wicket of the West Indies innings.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesHosein, noted for his guile with the new ball, was missed as England unleashed early havoc on the opposition quicks, Jamie Smith and Buttler brutal in their 79-run second-wicket stand. The former, taking advantage of regular T20 opener Phil Salt’s paternity leave, feasted over long-on to compile a 20-ball 38. Butter was a treat when going straight down the ground but also showcased the scoop when taking 22 off four Alzarri Joseph deliveries.Gudakesh Motie’s slow stuff inevitably brought quiet, his four overs wicketless but conceding just 21, while Roston Chase snuck one through Brook’s defences. West Indies’ seamers recovered well as England fell to 116 for four and the surviving Buttler slowed down; after reaching 50 off 25 balls, his next 19 deliveries produced 16.But three figures remained on as he fetched a wide Jason Holder delivery and found the square leg rope. Then he reverse-swatted a fuller Romario Shepherd ball to go to 86. In the next over, an edge past the keeper yielded another four. One more along the carpet would have done it but Joseph found his pads.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The latter struggled with his line and conceded 24 runs before Lewis got a little too excited with the final ball, finding Brydon Carse’s hands by the longer leg-side boundary.Dawson then capitalised on the required rate, Sherfane Rutherford and Chase offering Duckett grabs in the deep, Rovman Powell a victim of the clever dart.

But he is aware that searing temperatures await at many of the venues for the finals in the US, Canada and Mexico next summer and, as such, it will be vital to be able to play in different styles.England looked jaded under Gareth Southgate at Euro 2024 with some players, including the captain, Harry Kane, below their best, though they did battle through to the final.Squad goals: Toney’s inclusion offers window into Tuchel’s England approachRead more“The tournaments are normally played after a long season and it is not maybe an advantage for us but it is just a fact,” Tuchel said. “It is maybe not a coincidence that players felt the most comfortable in the Qatar World Cup and suddenly the demands of the Premier League became an advantage because they were in the middle of it and they had an advantage over other players.“It can be that at some point we need to adjust our style when it comes to tournament football, knockout football. Everyone wants to win, everyone wants to win in style. Can you really play the same game in 40C heat and humidity that you play in 20C in an evening match? These are some questions and I don’t have all the answers and I don’t have to right now because we still have one year to go. But we are on it to answer them.”Tuchel reported that Bukayo Saka was a selection doubt for Andorra with an unspecified injury sustained on the final day of the Premier League season for Arsenal against Southampton. The winger trained fully only on Friday. He is expected to be fine for Tuesday’s friendly against Senegal in Nottingham. Ollie Watkins has a minor muscle problem and has withdrawn from the squad.The international window comes before the Club World Cup, when 10 of Tuchel’s squad will be involved, including five Chelsea players – Reece James, Levi Colwill, Trevoh Chalobah, Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke. The others are Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Conor Gallagher (Atlético Madrid), Kane (Bayern Munich) and Ivan Toney (Al-Ahli).View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham is one of 10 England players going to the Club World Cup.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesTuchel claimed he had felt no pressure from club managers over the use of these players against Andorra and Senegal, although he said they should not worry because he had many players to look at and so would be managing the minutes regardless. The point was that they would be his decisions. It may be Andorra, ranked 173rd in the world, but it would be vital to go strong and get everything out of the game; to work on establishing patterns and principles.“No coach has called me and there was no request from the FA,” Tuchel said. “We know the clubs have a lot of matches and the players go after to he Club World Cup. It can also happen that some players start twice for us but we have an interest to see a lot of players, so I think we will not upset anyone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that he had spoken to Grealish after the FA Cup final when the winger was an unused substitute for Manchester City in the defeat against Crystal Palace.Explore more on these topicsEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThomas TuchelAndorranewsShareReuse this content"

But Wales’s great run has put them in a good position to challenge Domenico Tedesco’s Belgium, who they play on Monday and have a history of upsetting, with a famous 3-1 win in the quarter-finals of Euro 2016.Iceland humiliate sorry Scotland on night of alarm for Steve ClarkeRead more“There was a lot I liked tonight,” Bellamy said. “I would really like us to make this [result] six, seven, eight. That’s what we have to push. These games have never been easy for our nation. We have a proven record of that. The chances we created, we can make this more. We will get to that …“We have got a very tough game coming Monday. I will watch the game back tomorrow and I’ll watch the North Macedonia-Belgium game just to recap that one. We race and get to work now to prepare for Belgium.”For Friday night, Bellamy’s side were firmly focused on the opposition in front of them and Liechtenstein made their presence known in Wales. While the visiting fans were heavily outnumbered, they were the ones in the car park pre-match who could be heard singing songs and shouting chants. They made the trip to see if their side could end a 35-game winless streak in competitive matches.The two nations have met three times previously, with Wales coming out victorious on all three occasions. The hosts were undoubtedly the favourites and under cloudy conditions they ensured Liechtenstein’s wait for a win continued.Harry Wilson, who returned after missing the March qualifiers with injury, took an early free-kick and went for goal but his attempt was fired wide. Wales kept up the pressure, particularly through the attacking spark of Sorba Thomas, but the visitors soaked it up.While it was all Wales in the early stages, it was not all good news for the hosts as they were forced into an early change with Neco Williams off with injury. He needed a stretcher with a suspected hamstring issue and was shaking his head as he was wheeled along the touchline.View image in fullscreenWales’s Neco Williams is taken around the touchline on a stretcher.Photograph: Nigel French/PAKieffer Moore and the captain, Ben Davies, had close chances but Brennan Johnson, the Spurs hero from the Europa League final, came closest with a deft touch. Goalkeeper Benjamin Büchel, who has won Liechtenstein’s player of the year three seasons in a row, made an incredible save. Ethan Ampadu, who also returned from injury, was the next to take a shot with a bicycle kick almost beating Büchel but the Vaduz keeper nudged it over the bar.Liechtenstein had been well-drilled in defence but the simplest of set pieces unpicked the deadlock. A good delivery from Thomas led to Joe Rodon heading it home and so the half-time score stood at 1-0. However, the Liechtenstein manager, Konrad Fünfstück, thought the goal-scoring opportunity should not have been given.“It was a wrong decision [to give the corner] but it’s one we can’t change,” Fünfstück said. “As the underdogs we have to give more. It was a bad situation but Wales did deserve to win.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Events since have included Nations League high points but umpteen chastening experiences. This proved another of the latter.For the second game in succession, Steve Clarke’s team lost three goals at home. The nature of Iceland’s success – a fully deserving one – in Glasgow felt ominous in respect of an upcoming World Cup qualifying campaign. With Germany and the Euros such a distant memory, Clarke does not have his troubles to seek. Scotland look a team that has passed its peak. There were no redeeming features at all in this display. Clarke must be alarmed.Wales brush aside Liechtenstein to maintain Bellamy’s unbeaten reignRead moreThe opening to the game was notable for the injury sustained by the Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn. When collecting a routine cross, Gunn’s ankle clattered into Andri Gudjohnsen with the consequences apparently serious. Gunn limped from the field after just six minutes.Gunn’s replacement, the debutant Cieran Slicker, was to endure an inauspicious arrival in international football. With just his second touch, Slicker kicked the ball straight to Stefán Teitur Thórdarson. Gudjohnsen was the gleeful recipient of Thórdarson’s header, the Gent an taking one touch before sending a glorious left-foot shot into Slicker’s top right-hand corner.Whether affected by the goalkeeper change or otherwise, the Scots were horribly ragged in the first quarter. The position has long been regarded as a problematic one, the consequence of negligence by clubs and the Scottish FA when the country did have a batch of fine keepers. Neither Gunn nor Slicker in truth are international class. The current best option, Craig Gordon, is 42.George Hirst should have levelled the scores, the Ipswich striker instead heading over when it looked easier to find the net from a John McGinn cross. As Hirst came close again, Scotland had found their pulse. John Souttar claimed the equaliser after meeting Max Johnston’s corner with a stooping header.Scotland were behind again before the interval, this time on account of hilariously incompetent defending. An Iceland corner flew off Lewis Ferguson and into Grant Hanley. As the ball rebounded off Ferguson again, Slicker chose to dive over the top of it. No Iceland player had touched the ball from the set play. All that was lacking was an appearance from the Keystone Cops. Scotland were booed off at half-time.Slicker’s night was to get even worse. Victor Pálsson met an Albert Gudmundsson free-kick with his head, a matter that should have provided no real problem for the goalkeeper. However, the ball flew right through Slicker’s hands. This had become a painful watch and a painful listen; Scotland’s support mocked Slicker when he picked up a loose ball soon after Iceland’s third. This was a cruel if calamitous scene for Slicker, whose only club first team appearance last season was as an 81st minute substitute for Ipswich against Bristol Rovers.

Sport England has raised this matter with British Rowing, and we will continue to monitor the situation.”A similar message was conveyed by UK Sport, which funds elite sport across Great Britain and Northern Ireland. “Our thoughts are with those affected by the allegations which have recently been reported, and we take matters of integrity and safeguarding extremely seriously,” it said.“We encourage any member of staff or athlete on Olympic and Paralympic performance programmes to report allegations of unacceptable behaviour to Sport Integrity, the confidential reporting line. In light of these deeply concerning allegations, we are in contact with British Rowing.”In a statement, the Leander Club said it took seriously all issues relating to the safeguarding of its athletes. “We have strict procedures in place to carefully examine any formal complaints and regularly review our club disciplinary processes to ensure they are fit for purpose, treating our athletes fairly and with respect,” it added.A British Rowing spokesperson said it was not able to comment on individual safeguarding concerns and processes conducted at clubs owing to their confidential nature. “As such there is a very limited amount that we can say when we are approached in connection with issues that fall into this category,” it added.“What we are able to say categorically is that the safety of people taking part in our sport is the very first item of importance on our agenda. We investigate anything reported to us fully and comprehensively, as you would expect and as it is our remit to do. This would have been the case if sufficient information had been raised with us to conduct an investigation in respect of the raised allegations.”Explore more on these topicsRowingnewsShareReuse this content"

Now its censorship has made that impossibleMartin BellToday foreign journalists stand on the ‘hill of shame’ overlooking Gaza, reliant on Palestinians for newsFri 6 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 17.12 EDTShareWatching the TV coverage of the conflict in Gaza with increasing dismay this week, my mind went back to the banks of the Suez canal inOctober 1973. I was filming the surrender of the entire Egyptian third army with a team from the BBC, without significant censorship or hindrance. The Israeli commander, Gen Avraham Adan, paused in whatever he was doing to give us an update.Crossing the canal on the Israeli pontoon bridge in a bright yellow Hertz car (not a wise choice of colour) we were even helped when we had to repair a tyre that had been punctured by the shrapnel that littered the battlefield.Censorship? Yes, the report was censored by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) back at the satellite feed point in Herzliya. But the censorship was limited only to matters of operational security. This was obviously helpful to the journalists, but also to the Israelis themselves. They had independent verification, with video to back it, of their remarkable achievement in turning around their initial setbacks in Sinai. And they could show, through scenes with a biblical resonance, that the Egyptians’ surrender was conducted humanely and in accordance with the Geneva conventions, the laws of war. As the great columns of the third army mounted a sand dune, they exchanged their weapons for bottles of water abundantly provided.Was it always this easy? Of course not. On another occasion, I rose early and reached a road block beyondGazaonly to be turned back, as all the press were that day, on the orders of southern command.But that was exceptional. The IDF operated a policy of relatively open access based on mutual advantage. Sometimes it would herd everyone into press buses, which was far from satisfactory. But it would regularly provide the major TV networks with an escort officer, armed and in uniform, to enable and supervise the coverage. One of my escorts in theYom Kippur warwasTopol, the actorfrom Fiddler on the Roof. He was something of a hero in Israel, and all roadblocks opened to him.On another occasion I was on my way to the Golan Heights, accompanied and with documents in order, when the great conductor and Israeli sympathiser Zubin Mehta asked for a lift. To my lasting regret I turned him down on the grounds that I had a press pass and he did not – I thought this may harm my chances of being allowed in.Nowhere that the IDF operated was off limits to us. We could film what we wanted and freely interview soldiers of all ranks. In the trenches of the Golan Heights, because of language difficulties, the other ranks tended to be South African immigrants.I was also free to make mistakes. In 1968, the year after thesix-day war, I returned to Israel and interviewed the chief of staff, Gen Haim Bar-Lev, who was busy building the defensive line that bore his name. I travelled to Jerusalem and was stopped at a roadblock outside the biblical village of Emmaus. It stood at the centre of the Latrun salient, a Jordanian outpost in the previous war of 1948. The Israelis were busy dismantling it brick by brick. I was not allowed to film it and could only have reported it by leaving the country, not to return. Such compromises are commonplace, but I regret this one. The village disappeared, to be replaced by a Canadian peace park.View image in fullscreenIsraeli troops crossing the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur war, 6 October 1973.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesI was also allowed, after 1967, to visit and stay in Gaza, and show the day-to-day reprisals by the IDF against Palestinians whom it held responsible for previous attacks. The same applied to the destruction of homes in the West Bank city ofQalqilya, and the sowing of landmines round the churches of St John the Baptist in the Jordan valley. All of this passed the IDF’s censorship without difficulty.Fast forward to today, and the coverage – or rather, the non-coverage – of the conflict between the Israelis and Hamas in Gaza. The broadcasts regularly start with the mantra that the IDF does not allow foreign media access into the Gaza Strip, and proceed with the most vivid coverage, shot bybrave freelancesand other civilians posting on social media from inside Gaza, of scenes of death and destruction with the commentary voiced remotely in Jerusalem, Ashkelon or London. Often, both print and broadcast media preface the numbers of the dead and injured with a reminder that they were provided by theHamas-run health ministry– sometimes the only source available.My former colleague Jeremy Bowen said on theToday programmeon Wednesday: “Israel doesn’t let us in because it’s doing things there … that they don’t want us to see, otherwise they would allow free reporting.” I’m inclined to agree with him.My sympathies are with Bowen, Fergal Keane and others at the BBC, especially when Donald Trump flings around baselessaccusations of bias. The BBC and other responsible news outlets have a difficult line to tread. I cannot speak for the American networks, but the British channels all have excellent reporters standing by in the region, not exactly there but thereabouts, sometimes on the high ground overlooking Gaza, which some reporters call the “hill of shame”. What is missing is the first-hand experience of the war, shared by reporters on the ground who can properly interpret what is happening. This gives free rein to rumour and falsehood.If you were shocked by my film on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, you haven’t been paying attention | Louis TherouxRead moreWhat Bowen and I know from our shared experience is that it is not enough to win the war of weapons without also winning the war of words and images. And the IDF must see that it is losing. It has historically had its ups and downs with the foreign press, but nothing like the present entrenched hostility. It is doing itself great damage, which it is beginning to feel diplomatically.I would urge the following: that the foreign press, especially the TV networks, continue to stand their ground, and that the Israeli press machine does itself a favour and relaxes the rules to allow some independent access to Gaza. This will not only limit the tides of propaganda (on both sides, it must be said) but perhaps hold the frontline troops to higher standards of behaviour, just as it did beside the Suez canal in 1973.It is important to both sides to reestablish at least the limited level of trust that used to exist between them. Here is an example. In the 1973 war, we were able transmit the news by satellite on the day that it happened. Our office was a chair beneath a palm tree near the feed point. In the 1967 war, the exposed news film was bundled into onion bags – blue for the BBC, red for NBC – and taken to the censor who stamped his approval on the masking tape around the neck, before it was air-freighted to London. But he had to take our word for what the film actually showed.The public had a more accurate account back then of events on the battlefield than it does today through the fog of war in Gaza. When access is denied, everyone loses. And, Israel, that includes you.Martin Bell is a Unicef UK ambassador.

For Democrats, the moment has comeFri 6 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 13.51 EDTShareEver since the world’s richest person,Elon Musk, threw his financial weight behindDonald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and appeared hopping around idiotically behind the candidate at a rally stage, political observers have wondered what would instigate the two men’s inevitable falling out.Would it be a matter of competing egos, with each man resenting the power and influence of the other? Would it be a matter of clashing cultures, with Trump’s sleaze rubbing the wrong way against Musk’s Silicon Valley creepiness? Would it be an ideological clash, with the paleocon nationalists of Trump’s dwindling inner circle turning against Musk’s cadre of teenage Doge hackers and cosmopolitan techno-reactionaries?It was bound to be something. Trump, after all, is not known for his ability to maintain cordial alliances – not even with those who have been as useful as Musk has been. Trump’s first term, to say nothing of his pre-presidency career, was marked by soured alliances, public remonstrances against onetime partners, and brief, disastrous tenures by employees and advisers who quickly left, angry. Musk, meanwhile, is known for his uncommonly odious personality, a management style that is euphemistically called “mercurial”, and his own increasingly erratic behavior, which includes clashes with a harem of women bearing his children, anallegedly problematic and escalating drug habit, and rumored bladder problems. It’s not just that these are not very smart guys; it’s that they are guys whose power and money has inflated their egos to such a pathological extent that they are no longer stable, or even especially functional. They would be sad enough cases if their personal deteriorations did not have world-historical consequences; if they hurt only themselves and did not create so much needless suffering for others. As it is, these men were bound to turn on one another and their inevitable fight was bound to reorient the Republican party – casting doubt on the unsteady coalition of new media types, manosphere influences and money that had carried them to victory in 2024.Trump v Musk: the two worst people in the world are finally having a big, beautiful breakup | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWhen it finally came this Thursday – with Trump and Musk posting increasingly hostile invective against one another on their respective proprietary social media platforms, Truth Social and X – the fight seems to have been largely about money. Trump posted that Musk had left the administration angry at cuts to electric vehicle subsidies and called for government contracts with Musk’s companies to be cancelled; for his part, Musk began a series of posts in which he claimed that Trump was named in the government’s Epstein files – “That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he said – and reposted tweets calling for Trump to be removed from office. Musk claimed credit for Republicans’ 2024 victory, and called Trump “ungrateful”. Tesla stocks plunged. Soon various rightwing media and Trump-world figures began getting in on the action, lining up behind Trump or Musk with the frightened, needful air of children whose parents are divorcing.Trump seems to have soured on Musk some weeks ago, when it became clear that Doge, Musk’s frenetic and aggressive extra-legal, cost-cutting venture that had sought to gut the federal bureaucracy in pursuit of the billionaire’s libertarian worldview, was chaotic, inefficient and, above all, wildly unpopular. Musk, meanwhile, was angered by Trump’s trade war, which threatened the value of his companies, and by the Trump domestic policy bill, which cut the federal subsidies for electric cars that have benefitted Musk’s auto company, Tesla.For his part, Musk has always had enemies within the Trump camp: Steve Bannon, the rightwing nationalist, had in fact always hated the South African billionaire, even if they shared a love of certain arm gestures. Unflattering leaks about Musk began appearing in the press, some of which seemed intended to embarrass him. Musk launched a media tour announcing his departure from theTrump administrationand hinted at his frustration with the Trump administration and a broader anti-Washington grievance. He began posting about his distaste for the president’s bill; on his last day at work in the Oval Office, he showed up with a black eye.The feud creates new pressures for Republican politicians, who must now choose between angering Musk, whose money could fund a primary challenge to any of them, and provoking Trump, whose approval can make or break their political careers. And it presents a unique opportunity for Democrats, who now have an unprecedented opening to kill the Trump bill, exploit instability in the Republican coalition and widening fractures within the Maga coalition, and remind their voters that the Trump regime is not only corrupt but also incompetent – spiteful, petty and unable to agree on anything except for a shared desire to loot the government and deprive the people for the sake of further enriching the billionaire class.The Democrats have long been tepid and uncertain in the face of Trump’s second term, with a gun-shy and easily spooked party leadership scolding progressive politicians and the activist base alike to not oppose Trump-Musk, but to let them implode on their own. Now they have. The moment has come. It is up to the Democrats not to waste it.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The Ballad of Wallis Island might just tell usGaby HinsliffRain, cardigans and puns: a melancholic new romcom set on a windswept island hints at a relatable British identityFri 6 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 03.24 EDTShareIt is, according to no less an authority than the romcom king Richard Curtis, destined to be “one of the greatest British films of all time”. But don’t let that put you off. For The Ballad of Wallis Island – the unlikely new tale of a socially awkward millionaire who inveigles two estranged former halves of a folk-singing duo into playing a private gig on his windswept private island – isn’t some floppy-haired Hugh Grant vehicle, but a reflection on our national character that is altogether more of its times.It’s a lovely, melancholic comedy about the acceptance of failure, loss and the slow understanding that what’s gone is not coming back: an ode to rain and cardigans, lousy plumbing and worse puns, shot in Wales on a shoestring budget in a summer so unforgiving that a doctor wasapparently requiredon set to check for hypothermia. Its main characters have not only all messed up at something – relationships, careers, managing money – but seem fairly capable of messing up again in future. Yet as a film it’s both gloriously funny and oddly comforting, taking a world where everything seems to be slowly coming adrift and making that feel so much more bearable.There’s no such thing as a national character really, of course; or at least no set of indisputably British traits on which 68 million people could ever all agree. Yet there’s a clear pattern to how we like to see ourselves represented on screen – endearingly hopeless, perennially mortified, well-meaning but liable to be eaten alive by Americans – which is telling.There was much flapping recently aboutpolling showingonly 41% of generation Z say they’re proud to be British, a steep decline on previous generations. But it remains unclear whether the issue here is gen Z, or the idea of Britain in which they have lately been expected to take pride. If Britishness didn’t seem quite so puffed-up and aggressive, so relentlessly focused on who is deemed not British enough; if it could simultaneously embrace a more self-deprecating, more tolerant, distinctly embarrassed sense of national identity, would that be one with which some people felt more comfortable?For we are not, fundamentally, a “make Britain great again” kind of place. Even when our politicians deliberately try to evoke the Maga spirit, they do it (thankfully) badly: Britain’s answer to Elon Musk’s terrifying Doge (“department of government efficiency”), aslaunched this weekby the Reform party, is headed by some tech dweeb you’ve never heard of whose role essentially boils down to poking round Kent county council looking for “waste”, before presumably discovering that he hasn’t really got the power to fire anyone.View image in fullscreenTom Basden as Herb McGwyer and Carey Mulligan as Nell Mortimer in The Ballad of Wallis Island.Photograph: Focus Features (c) 2025 All Rights Reserved/PAWith all due respect to Rachel Reeves’s mission to rebuild the nation, meanwhile, the most recognisably British part of her big speech on investing in infrastructure this week was that it revolved around regional buses. The pinnacle of our national ambitions is no longer to rule the waves but just to be able to get into Huddersfield a bit faster than previously, along a road with slightly fewer potholes, and it’s time to own that with pride: this is, goddammit, who we really are.For this is the nation that made a copper-bottomed hit out of How to Fail, Elizabeth Day’s podcast in which guests cheerfully spill the beans on all the ways they have screwed up at life; a nation that can’t accept a compliment to save its life, and knows that if by accident you ever become good at something then you’d better make up for it fast by stressing just how bad you are at something else. (In this week’s published extracts from How Not to Be a Political Wife, a British title for a memoir if ever there was one, the demonstrably successful and well-connected Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vinereturnsagain and again to the failure of her marriage and the impossibility of keeping up with high-powered friends: she’s been in the newspaper business long enough to know her readers would infinitely rather hear about the fall than the rise.)“Am I working class or insufferably bourgeois?” – podcastRead moreWe dwell with relish not just on our individual failings but on our glorious national defeats, memorialising all the football tournaments we ever lost on penalties and weaving heroic disasters – Scott dying in the Antarctic, the retreat from Dunkirk – into our national story. We are the country that turned “we’re shit, and we know we are” into a sporting anthem; that treats failure less as a necessary stage of innovation than as a steady state to be lived with, like the weather. Our tendency to assume things will go wrong certainly has its drawbacks – not least a tendency to regard unalloyed good news with crabby suspicion – but it perhaps makes us more philosophical when they do. Not so much a land of hope and glory, as one of perennial mild disappointment.In the past, this unerring ability to puncture our own balloons might have been a healthy trait, a safeguard against a world power getting carried away by its own importance. Of late, the same Eeyorish diffidence feels more like a way of coming to terms with inevitable decline. But either way, tucked inside The Ballad of Wallis Island is the germ of a national story: struggling to tell other people how we really feel about them, in the rain, but still somehow finding reasons to be cheerful.

Those ‘peace dividend’ days are goneHelen Miller is the incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal StudiesFri 6 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 13.46 EDTShareOn 11 June, the government will unveil its long-awaited spending review, laying out how it wants to spendmore than £600bnannually on public services over the next few years. That’s about a fifth of the entire British economy. The choices made over funding for the NHS, schools, courts, prisons and much more besides will shape life in the UK in the coming years. It’s no exaggeration to say this could be the defining domestic policy moment of this parliament.Rachel Reeves’s first budget included a big tax rise and atwo-year increasein borrowing to boost spending on public services. For future years, the chancellor has repeatedly reaffirmed her “ironclad” commitment toborrow only to invest. Such is the dismal state of the public finances that even with tax revenues that are high by historical standards, spending growth in the coming years will be relatively modest. Overall day-to-day departmental spending is set to rise by an average of just1.2% above inflationover the next three years. This will make the spending review tough. Allocating spending across departments will inevitably mean picking winners and losers.The single most consequential decision will be how much funding to allocate to theNHS. The NHS budget is big – it accounts for 40% of day-to-day spending on public services. That’s comfortably more than is spent on schools, universities, the police, prisons and defence combined.For decades, the savings from declining defence spending were effectively ploughed into the health service. Those “peace dividend” days are gone. The government has already committed to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income. It’s unusual for health and defence spending to grow at once – and unheard of for it to happen in a period of low growth and high interest rates. If the government also chooses to prioritise the NHS budget alongside defence, other departments’ budgets will see cuts.Consider this scenario: if the government increases defence spending as promised, and opts for a 3.4% annual increase in NHS funding –below the long-term averageand far short of the 6% growth seen under Labour in the 2000s – it would probably be enough to hire the staff the government’s workforce plan says the NHS needs and deliver improvements to NHS performance before the next election. But the wider implications would be stark: it would requirecuts of 1% a yearto the budget for all other departments.The government could, of course, allocate less to the NHS. That could jeopardise the promise to substantially reduce hospital waiting times by the next election and to build an “NHS fit for the future”. But it would free up resources for its other missions to “break down the barriers to opportunity”, “make Britain a clean energy superpower”, deliver “safer streets” and “kickstart economic growth”. When funding is tight, more money for a shiny new initiative inevitably means less money for something else.The prime minister noted that achieving thefive missions of his governmentwill demand “relentless focus and prioritisation”. We’ll soon find out, when push comes to shove, what this government’s priorities are.Some departments, and some ministers, are likely to be disappointed. Once the spending review settlements are revealed, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, may not be the onlyLabourMP calling for higher taxes to reduce pressure on spending. By autumn, however, disgruntled colleagues could be the least of Reeves’s concerns.At the spring statement in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was significantly more optimistic about growth prospects than most other forecasters. Since then, global developments have been bad news for the UK’s economic outlook.If the OBR downgrades its growth forecast, that could easily wipe out the chancellor’s limited wiggle room against her fiscal rules – perhaps several times over. Last November, Reeves was adamant that she would not be “coming back with more borrowing or more taxes”. But unless she gets lucky, she will have to come back with something to avoid a breach of her rules for borrowing.Assuming her fiscal rules remain “ironclad”, Reeves will have three options. She could cut departmental spending, just a few months after settling multiyear spending plans with her cabinet colleagues. She could make further cuts to the social security budget, when there is pressure – not least from some MPs – to do the exact opposite. Or she could raise taxes again to pay for the spending that has already been pledged. It’s clear why speculation about potential tax rises will continue.But we should not let speculation about the budget distract us from scrutinising the spending review itself. The government’s decisions on how to allocate more than £600bn of spending a year for several years will be of great consequence, whatever happens in the autumn.And, since speculation about the budget will inevitably continue, the discussion should shift from simply how taxes could be tweaked to raise more revenue to how they could be reformed to be less damaging to growth. Delivering higher growth deserves its place as the government’s number one mission and should be a central focus across all areas of policy. Reeves is yet to show any interest in tax reform. She is missing an opportunity. With challenging years ahead, we need a government that seizes every opportunity to drive up economic growth. Achieving that mission would make everything else easier.Helen Miller is the incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal StudiesExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionRachel ReevesLabourEconomicsNHScommentShareReuse this content"

The poorest nation in the UK is being let down. Repeatedly. But what is to be done?What we need is a hero. Someone whose job is to speak up forWalesin cabinet, to be Cymru’s voice in Westminster’s corridors of power. Luckily for Wales, there is such a person – the secretary of state for Wales. Unluckily for Wales, this role has long been utterly obsolete. Rather than being the voice of Wales in cabinet, it far more often represents the voice of the cabinet in Wales. It needs to go.Wales didn’t have its own secretary of state until 1964. The Scots, meanwhile, were given that voice more than 250 years before in 1707, though it was subsequently abolished three decades later and then recreated in 1926. When Wales did finally get one, it was a real cause for celebration and the culmination of much campaigning.The first two people in the post were Jim Griffiths and Cledwyn Hughes, who were highly respected and had great credentials within the Labour movement. The new role paid dividends and within the space of three years the Welsh Language Act was passed, giving Welsh legal status in Wales (amazing what happens when you give people a voice).But in the following decades there were some absolute stinkers in the job. The next one was George Thomas, who wasanti Welsh languageand described the setting up of the Welsh Office as the “greatest mistake”. The low point of his tenure came after the Aberfan disaster, in which a coal tip collapsed on to a school killing 116 children and 28 adults. Subsequent inquiries found that the National Coal Board was squarely responsible for these deaths after refusing to pay for the removal of the tips. After the disaster, 88,000 individual contributions were received for the victim fund but the Labour UK government decided to take money from that fund and use it to clear the remaining tips.Thomas put pressure on the fundto give in.Over the subsequent decades, many of the people holding the role were not even Welsh or in a Welsh constituency. (Imagine if they had tried to do that to the Scots.) The worst of these was the Conservative John Redwood, who was born in Kent and was MP for Wokingham in Berkshire. (If you want a treat, dig out the video of himfailing to mimethe Welsh national anthem.) Redwoodrefused to sign documentsthat were written in Welsh, and didn’t like to stay overnight in Wales, instead driving back to his constituency in England. But perhaps most damning was that, in a country with significant levels of poverty, he took great pride inreturning £100m of the Welsh Office’s budgetto the Treasury unspent. What an effective voice for Wales in cabinet.More recently, Wales has been blessed with some equally diligent secretaries of state. One was Alun Cairns, who resigned from the post after it emerged that one of his staff wasaccused by a judgeof deliberately sabotaging a rape trial. His best-known contribution was a supreme act of brown nosing when he got the Severn Bridge renamed the “Prince of Wales Bridge” – a decision thatonly 17% of people in Walessupported. Another was Simon Hart, whoadmits in his just-published diariesthat, at the official opening of the new Welsh parliament in 2020: “I skip the Senedd bit – partly in protest, and partly to have lunch with Adam.” He doesn’t say what he was protesting about. Another recent office holder was Robert Buckland who was, err, the MP for South Swindon …While Wales has had some shocking secretaries of state, this isn’t why the role should be ditched. It needs to be gone because, however principled, competent and driven the holder of the office, there is no way they can realistically do the job of being Wales’s voice. They have no power, barely any staff, are appointed by the prime minister and bound by collective responsibility. The current situation represents the worst of both worlds: it gives the illusion of Wales having a voice when it comes with a pre-installed mute button.The UK risks falling apart. Keir Starmer can mend it now – but he doesn’t have much time | Martin KettleRead moreThe current holder of the office is Jo Stevens. Speaking to people in other departments as well as the Wales Office, I get the impression that she is at least proactive in making Wales’s needs part of the conversation. I am told she has been focused in trying to get the historic injustices on rail funding remedied ahead of next week’s spending review. Whether it works remains to be seen – and she sadly failed this week to prevent the new rail project between Oxford and Cambridge being classed as an “England and Wales” scheme, meaning that Wales will not receive Barnett consequentials from it. But at least she isn’t openly contemptuous of Welsh democracy like many of her predecessors.The fact remains, however, that whether or not Welsh issues are raised in Whitehall is totally dependent on the whims of a cabinet member who is appointed and often living outside Wales. That’s a terrible status quo. Wales should appoint its advocates, not the prime minister, who has only once in the history of the UK been Welsh. The role of secretary of state for Wales needs to be replaced by a representative of theWelsh government, which is directly elected by the people of Wales. Better still, we need to properly reform the UK so the UK government doesn’t double as the English government.Devolution gave Wales and Scotland a voice, and that voice should reverberate around the cabinet table. It is long past the time that Whitehall needs to acknowledge that the UK is made up of distinct countries. Giving these nations a real voice doesn’t weaken the union, it strengthens it.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

Either way, the prime minister needs to commit and sell it to an impatient electorateFri 6 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 09.06 EDTShareAfter less than a year in power, Labour has reached a familiar place. Keir Starmer’s troubled government is at a fork in the road, wondering which direction to follow. With the delivery of its spending review next week after several acrimonious delays, and a Commons vote on its divisive welfare cuts expected later this month, the government’s unity and morale are fragile. The public finances are severely strained, with ever more competing demands, such as for extradefence spending. Though much more energetic than its Tory predecessor, this government often seems opaque, unable to explain its purpose in a compelling way.Many voters and journalists – even more impatient than usual after years of manic politics – are already considering what might replace Starmer’s administration. Atbarely 20% in the polls, Labour is as unpopular as in its most disliked daysunder Jeremy Corbyn– and unlike then, has been overtaken by Nigel Farage’s latest vehicle. Most ominously of all, perhaps, even the government’s successes, such as its trade deals, seem to make little or no difference to its public standing or sense of momentum.Both inside and outside the party, there is an increasingly widespread feeling that the strategy pursued by Starmer, his chief of staffMorgan McSweeneyand the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over the past five years – Reform UK-influenced, socially conservative, fiscally cautious and focused on rightwing pensioners and “working people” – has been tested to destruction. Even McSweeney, previously revered by centrist Labour MPs and political journalists as a “realist” about what the party needed to do to win power and hold on to it, is now being briefed against.But what alternative path might the government take? One ever more openly favoured bythe deputy prime minister,Angela Rayner, and the mayor of Greater Manchester,Andy Burnham, leads broadly leftwards: raising taxes on the wealthy, building much more council and social housing, and no longer echoing Reform’s reactionary rhetoric. The nationalisation of failing privatised utilities and the abandonment or loosening of Reeves’s fiscal rules are also increasingly popular in the party, even among the centre-left conservatives of Blue Labour.Yet the problem for anyone hoping that the government will radicalise in response to its political crisis is thatLabourgovernments rarely do. In opposition, when less cautious party activists and thinktanks have more influence, Labour does sometimes move to the left, as it did by making Corbyn leader after losing the 2015 election. But in office it more often does the opposite. The rightwing media, powerful business interests, conservative parts of the civil service, and voters and Labour politicians who believe that all leftwing policies are a risk: all these influences tell ailing Labour governments that their troubles are actually due to not being rightwing enough.In 1931, the Labour chancellor Philip Snowden – preoccupied, like Reeves, with making the government seem financially responsible – responded to the Depression and a growing budget deficit by rejecting expansive, more leftwing policies and proposing benefits cuts. Only a narrow majority of the cabinet backed him, and the government collapsed. At the election that followed, Labour was crushed.A similar story played out in the 1970s, when Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan’s Labour governments – which, like Starmer’s, had inherited a weak, inflation-prone economy from the Tories – cut public spending to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund. At Labour’s 1976 annual conference,Callaghan dismissedthose who wanted a less austere approach: “That option no longer exists.” It’s easy to imagine Starmer sternly saying that to a left-leaning minister now. Yet in the 1970s, as in the 1930s, Labour’s rightward shift didn’t save it from election defeat.Despite these discouraging precedents, today’s Labour centrists may not be deterred from pushing for another turn to the right, with further concessions to business in the name of economic growth and further clampdowns on immigration. One of the characteristics of Labour centrism, along with its lack of fresh ideas since Blairism, is a lack of self-doubt.Such a right turn could conceivably work this time. Labour could cobble together a new electoral coalition from voters who want to stop Reform at any cost, people who back Labour whatever its policies and former Tories who want to support a less chaotic party. Recruits could come from Reform, too, if Farage’s inexperienced party makes big mistakes – such as the suddenresignation of its chair, Zia Yusuf, after a public row about whether to call for a ban on the burqa –or loses its novelty in the long stretch until the next election. With politics unprecedentedly fragmented, an ever more conservative Labour government may not need many votes to get re-elected.If you find this prospect unlikely or just depressing, and want a frustrated Labour government to finally take the other, leftward fork in the road, there are some grounds for hope. The recent interventions by Rayner and Burnham reflect not just their own more left-leaning politics and possible leadership ambitions but also an awareness that Britain is in a less rightwing phase than many conservatives and centrists believe. Public attitudes to privatisation, nationalisation, inequality and trade unions have shifted leftward in recent years. During the Labour governments of the 1930s and late 1970s, public opinion was moving the other way.Moreover, Starmer’s suppression of the Labour left has inadvertently helped make the Greens more popular and radical, led to the election of five leftwing independent MPs and created a large pool of discontented socialists which may crystallise into a new party. With Labour losing as much support to these forces as to Reform, the pressure on the government to move left could soon become too large to totally ignore.In some policy areas, it can even be argued, the government is already on that path. Better workplace rights, the nationalisation of rail companies, removing or lessening the privileges of private schools andnon-doms, restrictions on the North Sea oil conglomerates andnew infrastructurefor neglected parts of England: a limited but much-needed redistribution of power and wealth is already under way.The problem is that Labour is too timid to say so. At the next general election, whether the government moved left or right when it hit trouble will matter less to Britain’s many unideological voters than whether it did so with a clear and convincing rationale. Democratic government is partly about confidence: having it, showing it and persuading enough voters to puttheir confidence in you. Labour looks far from confident right now.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerOpinion pollsReform UKJeremy CorbynConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Democrats passed the popcorn on Thursday night as the alliance between the world’s most powerful man and the world’s richest imploded via posts on their respective social media platforms.Less than a week ago they attempted a conscious uncouplingin the Oval Office. Then Elon Musk’s attacks on Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending plan escalated tofull-scale denunciationof a “disgusting abomination” – objecting to its effect on the deficit, not the fact it snatches essential support from the poor and hands $1.1tn in tax cuts to the rich.The president said that Mr Musk had “gone crazy” and was angry that electric vehicle subsidies were being removed, claimed he had fired him, threatened to terminate his government contracts, and mocked the billionaire’s recent black eye.Steve Bannonchipped in, suggesting that Mr Musk should be deported.Mr Musk said Mr Trump should be impeached and alleged the government had not released files on the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein because the president was in them. He threatened to immediatelystart decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft– now key to Nasa’s programme – and suggested it was time for a new political party. The ultimate insult: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” he wrote.Mr Musk laterappeared minded to limit the damage, backing away from the spacecraft threat – not surprising, perhaps, when he had just watched $152bnwiped off Tesla’s value. Each man knows thatthe other could hurt him, via government fiat or political war chest. Yet both are so unpredictable that the row could still reignite.Two narcissists used to imposing their will were never likely to coexist happily for long, despite the advantages of doing so: this was less a marriage of convenience than of naked self-interest. Mr Trump loathes sharing the limelight; the Tesla boss frequently grabbed it. The president is surely as resentful of as he is dazzled by Mr Musk’s spectacular wealth. He was angered to discover that Mr Muskhad arranged private briefingson the Pentagon’s plans for any potential war with China – not only a blatant conflict of interest, but perhaps more upsettingly, a sign of his growing power. Mr Musk’s behaviour has also appeared increasingly erratic. A recent New York Times report alleged he took large amounts ofdrugs including ketaminewhile advising Mr Trump prior to the election. Mr Musk hasdescribedthe story as “bs”.His departure from the president’s orbit is good news. Mr Musk implausibly claimed he would save $2tn annually – approaching a third of the federal budget – by taking a chainsaw to bureaucracy. Wild decisions by the so-calleddepartment of government efficiencyare mired in the courts. But he has nonetheless caused real damage which will not easily be remedied, gutting agencies and departments which took decades to build. People aredyingbecause of his demolition of USAID.Yet while the bond between the peak of power and the peak of wealth has been severed, politics remains in thrall to money. Mr Trump’s approach is particularly noxious, turning wealth directly into political favours and power, and power into further wealth. This is the new oligopoly. He oversees a cabinet of billionaires, and has directed his real estate tycoon friend Steve Witkoff, a man with no diplomatic experience, to bring peace in the Middle East and Ukraine. But though megadonors areheavily skewedtowards the Republicans, Democrats toodepend onbillionaires. Mr Musk is a symptom of the underlying malaise. Democracy requires better safeguards against the unhealthy marriage of wealth and power than the rampant egos of those who command them.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsDemocratsSteve BannonNasaSpaceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

A late flurry of welfare signalling, a dogged ground campaign and a carefully staged visit to aGovan shipyardby Sir Keir Starmer helped shore up Labour’s appeal to its traditional voters in Scotland’s industrial belt. Yet as Prof John Curtice hasnoted, Labour’s share of the vote actually declined compared with the last time voters cast ballots here in2021– a year in which the party was placed a distant third and was polling at the same dismal level of public support,20%, it has today.The prime minister will gladly pocket Davy Russell’s win inHamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse. But it is a foothold. There is still a steep climb to the summit. More telling is who lost. The Scottish National party’s poor showing reflects dissatisfaction with its record of governance and the diminishing appeal ofindependencein areas where Labour has deep roots. The real surprise was Reform UK, taking over aquarterof the vote and leapfrogging the Conservatives into third place. It drew from both main parties, fuelled by protest and unionist anger that flattened the Tories.If these trends continue, the Holyrood elections, scheduled fornext year, will not be good news for anyone but Reform despite the party losing its chairZia Yusufthis week. Labour is not yet credible as a government-in-waiting at Holyrood. But for the SNP the crisis is more acute. If its vote remains around 30% and opposition is split at the next election, the SNP would probably remain the largest party, but would be unlikely to bestride the Scottish parliament. The pro‑independence movement would be institutionally endangered, not by Westminster suppression, but by electoral mathematics.Scottish politicians have long held the belief that Nigel Farage has less sway in apro-EU, pro‑immigrationnation. That is now harder to sustain. On the campaign trail, Mr Farage defended a race‑baiting Reform advert that twisted Scottish Labour leaderAnas Sarwar’s wordsto suggest he had divided loyalties – a textbook use of identity politics to inflame division and resentment. It was a toxic, racist and dishonest dog‑whistle but that did not stop Reform’s rise.TheToriesface an existential crisis. In 2021 they became the official opposition as the strongestanti‑SNP, pro-unionistoption, a strategy that paid off on the regional list. But ifReformkeeps eating into that base, Thursday’s result suggests the Conservatives could ignominiously fall behind not just Reform, but also theLib DemsandGreens. With the constitutional question fading and Holyrood designed to favour horse-trading, 2026 looks like yielding a more divided chamber. Coalitions – Labour with the Lib Dems, or even across the divide – could yet emerge to focus on bread-and-butter issues and govern without Reform. Labour won the seat, not the argument. The SNP may still top the poll in 2026 – but as a weaker force in a far less predictable landscape.Explore more on these topicsLabourOpinionScottish politicsScotlandScottish National party (SNP)Reform UKLiberal DemocratsGreen partyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Four Indian nationals living in Canada have been charged with Nijjar’s murder.The summit, attended by key world leaders, runs from 15 to 17 June in Kananaskis, Alberta.Carney said becauseIndiawas the “fifth largest economy in the world, the most populous country in the world and central to supply chains”, he said it was important to invite the country’s leader despite the continuing investigation to discuss energy, artificial intelligence and critical minerals.“I extended the invitation to Prime Minister Modi and, in that context, he has accepted,” Carney said.Modi said he was glad to receive a call from Carney and congratulated the Liberal leader on his recent electoral victory.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi speaks in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, last year.Photograph: Dean Kassim/AFP via Getty Images“As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests. Look forward to our meeting at the summit,” Modi said in a statement.Canada and India expelled each other’s top diplomatslast year over Nijjar’s politically motivated murder in the British Columbia city of Surrey. Canadian law enforcement also alleged India was involved in extortion, gang violence and intimidation.Carney’s decision to invite Modi prompted an outraged response from the World Sikh Organization. “For Sikhs in Canada, this is a betrayal, not just of our community, but of core Canadian values. Prime Minister Carney’s decision to inviteNarendra Modi, while India continues to deny any role in the assassination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar and refuses to cooperate with Canadian authorities, is both shameful and dangerous,” its president, Danish Singh, wrote in a statement.“We would never welcome leaders from Russia, China, or Iran under such circumstances. Yet India has done far more on Canadian soil in terms of foreign interference and transnational repression, including orchestrating murders, and is being rewarded with a red carpet welcome.”Allegations of Indian interference rock Canada election campaignRead moreCarney’s decision comes as his new government looks to ease tensions with other countries feuding with Canada.Late Thursday, he posted a readout of a call with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, and said there was interest on both sides to “regularize channels of communication” amid a trade spat that has cost both sides billions through tariffs on seafood, electric vehicles, canola, pork and peas. In the call, the first high-level telephone communication since becoming prime minister in March, Carney said both sides were also fighting illegal production of the opioid fentanyl.Carney is also in direct talks with Donald Trump, the US president, to end a trade war between the two allies following economically damaging tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.Doug Ford, the Ontario premier, told reporters the Canadian prime minister was engaged in “deep, deep discussions” with Trump’s team – a development confirmed by Canada’s industry minister hours later.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaG7Mark CarneyNarendra ModiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

What’s wrong with that?” Netanyahu said in a shortvideohe posted on social media. “It only saves the lives of Israeli solders, and publicising this only benefits Hamas.”Strong criticism of the initiative has come from opposition parties in Israel. In a social media post on X, Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats in the Knesset, said: “Netanyahu is a threat to Israel’s national security. Instead of bringing about a deal … bringing the hostages home and providing security for Israeli citizens, he is creating a new ticking timebomb inGaza.”Israel accused of arming Palestinian gang who allegedly looted aid in GazaRead morePalestinians in Gaza marked the start of Eid al-Adha, one of Islam’s most important holidays, on Friday with prayers outside destroyed mosques and homes and food supplies dwindling. Food distribution points run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reopened on Friday before closing a few hours later.Work at the sites was previously halted this week in response to a series of deadly shootings by Israeli soldiers that on Tuesday killed 27 Palestinians and injured hundreds as they were waiting for food. The UN says more than 2,700 children in Gaza are suffering fromacute malnutrition.Israeli jets meanwhile continued to pound the territory and, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency, 38 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military on Friday, including 11 in a single strike in the north. Israel said four soldiers were killed in combat.On Thursday, after the allegations on arming Hamas-opposed clans in Gaza circulated in the media, Netanyahu’s office said Israel “was working to defeatHamasthrough various means, based on the recommendations of all the heads of the security establishment”.The former defence minister and opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman alleged that Abu Shabab’s group was affiliated with Islamic State. “The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister,” Lieberman, who heads the opposition Yisrael Beiteinu party, told Kan Bet public radio.The basis for Lieberman’s allegation of ties to IS was unclear. Abu Shabab’s group has previously been accused of involvement in smuggling operations linked to Egyptian jihadi groups.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Abu Shabab’s involvement with Israeli troops was confirmed last week through several videos circulating on social media in Gaza, showing him operating alongside Israeli soldiers in IDF-controlled areas.Last week, Abu Shabab’s family issued a statement disowning him, accusing him of collaborating with Israeli forces. “We, like everyone else, were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser’s groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces, who are brutally killing our people,” the statement said.“We affirm that we will not accept Yasser’s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.”On 28 May, Jonathan Whittall, the head of United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupiedPalestinian territories, said: “The real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point into Gaza.”When contacted by the Guardian, Whittall confirmed he was “referring to gangs such as Abu Shabab”.On several posts on Facebook, reported by local media, Abu Shabab denied the allegations of looting, saying he was taking the goods only to feed himself and his family.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Despite nationwide protests demanding a ceasefire deal and the release of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza after Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack, Netanyahu’s coalition remains solid, buoyed up by the steadfast support of far-right parties.That unity may soon be tested, however, after the ultra-Orthodox Shas party in Netanyahu’s coalition announced it would support dissolving the Knesset.The Shas party’s decision comes after no significant progress in advancing a law in effect exempting ultra-Orthodox citizens from the military draft.Israel has mandatory army service but for decades made anexemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews, also known as Haredi, who are allowed to continue full-time Torah study. But an alternative plan seeks to extend the duration of military service for conscripts and raise the age for reservists, while also urging an end to the customary exemptions granted to yeshiva students.Due to the war in Gaza, the IDF is saying yeshiva students must be drafted, as it urgently needs an additional 10,000 combat soldiers and about 3,000 soldiers for other roles..Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Nationals from those countries will not be allowed to enter the US unless they qualify for an exemption. Seven other countries will face partial restrictions.Asked whether she would ever consider implementing a similar system in the UK, Badenoch said: “Parliament needs to be able to decide who comes into the country, for how long, and who needs to leave, and that does include travel bans. On a country-specific basis it’s much tougher, it’s often more vague. But I think there are scenarios where that is viable.”She added: “That doesn’t mean that I agree with what Donald Trump has done, I haven’t actually seen the list of countries that he’s banned people from. I’m much more focused on … what’s happening here.”Badenoch was speaking at the Royal United Services Institute, a defence thinktank in Whitehall, where she announced the launch of a legal process to determine whether the Conservatives would endorse calls for the UK toleave the European convention on human rights(ECHR).The Tory leader faced questions about her party’s collapsing popularity compared with the surge of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. Her party came fourth in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse byelection for the Scottish parliament overnight.Labour beat the Scottish National partyin a surprise result, winning 8,559 votes and a majority of 602. Reform UK finished third on 7,088 votes and the Tories were a distant fourth on 1,621.Asked about the result, Badenoch said the Scottish constituency was “not the place where the Conservative party fightback starts”.She said: “We live in a very competitive political environment, and we have made it very clear that the situation has changed and we have to be different, and that is what my job is right now – to change the Conservative party to make sure we can fight in an era of multiparty politics.”Badenoch insisted that “every week it gets better and better”, amid questions about her performance as Tory leader.“People often assume that the minute you come into a job like the leader of the opposition, that’s it, you’re ready to do it,” she said. “It actually takes quite a while to learn how to do the job, and what I have been saying is that every week it gets better and better. Every week I have more experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bull could be seen galloping past cars on a road near a roundabout and running along pavements.It was unclear where the bull came from or why it was running loose.The city council said its staff “weren’t fazed when they came across a stray bull roaming the streets of Birmingham”. It said in a social media post: “When asked to help, our street cleansing crew were on the case, rapidly devising a plan to move this beautiful, albeit misplaced, animal to safety. It was checked out by our animal welfare team and is now in the care ofWest Midlandspolice.”The bull was spotted running around the Small Heath area of the city not far from St Andrew’s, home to Birmingham City football club.John Cooper, who works at Small Heath railway station,told BirminghamLive: “I saw something go past in the corner of my eye and thought it was a horse. I had to go for another look and thought ‘oh god, it’s a bull’. It was quite a shock, I didn’t know to react. It was casually trotting down the road. The bull didn’t seem dangerous, it just seemed lost.”West Midlands police said: “We were made aware of a bull in the road near New Bond Street in Birmingham at just before 9.30am today. We’re liaising with Birmingham city council and other agencies to ensure the animal is taken to a safe location.”Birmingham is famously associated with bulls, with its main shopping centre named the Bullring, and guarded by a large bronze bull statue at its entrance.In the city’s New Street railway station, a 10-metre mechanical bull built for the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony sits on the central concourse. It wasnamed Ozzyin a public vote – after the rock star Ozzy Osbourne, who comes from the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is based on the current mix of energy sources powering the National Grid.The datacentre will also create so much excess heat that glasshouses are being proposed with capacity to produce more than 10 tonnes of tomatoes a day.Global tech firms are struggling to meet their carbon-cutting goals. By 2030, carbon dioxide emissions from AI datacentres will be six times the 2023 level, according toresearchby the Öko-Institut in Germany. Greenpeace has called for commensurate renewable energy capacity to be added to national grids at the same time as new datacentres are built.Microsoft recently admittedthat five years after it committed to becoming zero carbon by 2030, its total emissions had risen by 23% due to factors including AI expansion. This week Meta signed a 20-year deal with anuclear power stationin Illinois, while Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy to fuel the race for AI dominance.Chart on datacentre energy useDatacentres are needed to train AI models and run AI searches, which are now routinely offered to billions of people by Google and Meta and which require four to five times more computing power,according to estimates.Climate experts believe AI could help the fight against global heating by making power grids work more efficiently or accelerating the development of new zero-carbon technologies.Martha Dark, a co-executive director of Foxglove, a non-profit organisation based in London campaigning for “a fairer tech future”, said the Elsham planning application put two key UK government missions on a collision course.“The prime minister has talked up datacentres powering generative AI as the magic beans to miraculously sprout Britain’s withered economy into life but also made a promise at the election to get toxic pollution out of our air and deliver net zero by 2050,” she said. “It’s decision time: does the government want an economic plan that’s best for Britain, or one that’s best for Amazon, Google and Meta?”Chart on datacentre emissionsPlanning documents state: “Elsham Tech Park Ltd will endeavour to purchase green power for the facility, where possible.” The backers believe CO2emissions could be lower than the 850,000 tonnes a year figure if the National Grid becomes greener by the time the datacentre is due to be switched on in 2029.The developer has ruled out on-site renewables as impractical. If the system ran on biomass energy it would require the daily delivery of 100 large lorry loads of wood chips. Wind energy would require 10,000 20-metre wind turbines, while an area five times the size of the Glastonbury festival site would be needed if it were to be powered by photovoltaic panels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is not just about Google search – AI is improving medical science and our productivity.”He cited the example of how the council was deploying AI chatbots to help older people stay on top of their medicines, enabling them to stay at home longer rather than moving into residential care.A spokesperson for Greystoke, which owns Elsham Tech Park Ltd, said the project would create 900 jobs. “The region is an ideal location for AI datacentres due to the significant investment already made in developing the UK’s most advanced clean energy cluster,” they said. “It has access to a third of the UK’s offshore wind energy as well as access to 66% of the UK’s licensed carbon capture and storage.”Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingLincolnshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It looks like iced tea, but in fact it’s secondary treated sewage, cleaned of any solids by the plant next door. In less than an hour, and after three steps of processing, we will be drinking it – as pure water.The Groundwater Replenishment System facility in Orange County,California, houses the pipes, filters and pumps to move up to 130m gallons each day – enough for 1 million people – processing it from dark to clear. The facility, which opened in 2008, is part of broader moves to help conserve water.Bilodeau, the president of the water district, says: “This is going to be a blueprint for any community that’s facing water scarcity, or wants to have more locally controlled water.”The idea is to take the water from the sanitation district next door and to push it through a three-step process – microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light purification – to make clean water. The facility provides 45% of central Orange County’s water and helps manage storm water inflows and reduce reliance on imported water.View image in fullscreenThe Orange County project generates about 130m gallons of clean drinking water each day –enough for 1 million people.Photograph: Mario Tama/GettyIn general, once sewage has been treated, the water is returned to our rivers, but extreme droughts and climate breakdown are pushing cities to consider using recycled sewage for drinking water. It is already done in Israel, Singapore and Kuwait, but Orange County has been a US pioneer in this area, hoping to reduce dependence on water piped from faraway rivers or pumped from shrinking aquifers under the ground.Orange County has a population of about 3 million and gets about 14 inches (35.5cm) of rain a year, some years far less, so recycling isnot only a way to reduce costs, it’s a way to make sure everyone has what they need. “Everything’s going to have to be reclaimed andrecycled,” says Bilodeau.When the liquid reaches the plant it has already been through some treatment and is clean enough to discharge into the oceans, but nowhere near clean enough to drink. The first step is to pump the water through bundles of hollow polypropylene fibres – which look like tiny plastic straws – to remove particulates as well as bacteria and other unwanted elements.Pipes then carry the filtered water to a building to undergo reverse osmosis, where it is pushed through membranes that squeeze out the salts, organic chemicals and any pharmaceutical leftovers.View image in fullscreenPipes carry the filtered water to a building to undergo reverse osmosis.Photograph: Mario Tama/GettyFinally, the water is blasted with high-intensity ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide to disinfect anything that might remain. “It’s concentrated sunlight,” Bilodeau says, “like what you would see in a tanning booth.” Except this would injure your eyes, because it is so strong.After walking around all three buildings, we reach a sink with running, clear water. I drink a cup of the stuff, expecting a whiff of what it used to be – but no, it’s super clean, with almost a flat taste. That’s because it no longer contains any salts or minerals – they have been blasted out by the cleaning process.On the cup is a motto, “Tastes like water … because it is water”, chosen because it is the number one comment, says Mehul Patel, the executive director of operations at the Orange CountyWaterDistrict, who oversees the facility. “There was a misperception that it tastes different or tastes like something,” he says. “We’re trying to show people scientifically, water is just water.”“We wanted full transparency,” adds Bilodeau, “because we’re talking about serving recycled wastewater to people.”Even though we are drinking the super-clean water out of the facility, the liquid will actually head back underground. Some of it will travel in pipes to the coastline of the Pacific Ocean where it will serve as a buffer to keep the salty water out of the coastal aquifer. Most will zoom 15 miles in pipelines to the city of Anaheim, where it will create lakes to percolate down into the aquifer and replenish the water that people drink in the county. “It’s the one that’s consistent, because we can control it,” says Bilodeau. “And that’s a big reason why we invested in recycled water so heavily.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The system consumes 17 megawatts of electricity and has a monthly electricity bill of $2.5m (£1.85m), while to run the place takes 26 operators.But the technology also offers some control over an increasingly climate-changed future: Bilodeau says the team estimates several years ahead in terms of what they think their water needs will be and what the water sources will be. “That’s one of the main reasons why we developed this,” he adds. “Because we wanted to sort of diversify our supply portfolio.”View image in fullscreenA sample of purified water, left, flows next to wastewater following the microfiltration treatment process.Photograph: Mario Tama/GettySome places are looking to the oceans for drinking water, but wastewater is more cost-effective as a source of water, Bilodeau says, because there are fewer salts in wastewater than sea water. That makes the energy costs of cleaning the water about half of what it would be to desalinate.‘Cathedral of crap’: is this the world’s most beautiful sewage treatment plant?Read moreThe model is increasingly being used in other water-scarce regions in the US. Los Angeles County is building a water recycling project in the San Fernando Valley to produce 20m gallons a day. Instead of sending treated wastewater out to sea, it will be cleaned for drinking water, just like in Orange County. There are also projects starting in Utah, Texas and Colorado.California’s State Water Resources Control Board approved regulations for direct potable reuse in October 2024, which allow purified water to go directly into drinking water systems instead of being mixed in with other water sources. The technology in the treatment process allows for the water to be even cleaner than most drinking water.The Orange County model has won awards, including a Guinness World Records title for the most wastewater recycled to drinking water in 24 hours on 16 February 2018. But the best praise is the public support for the water, says Bilodeau – and the economic argument behind it. “It’s now cheaper to make our own water than to buy imported water, or to clean sea water,” he says.Explore more on these topicsWaterThe alternativesRecyclingEthical and green livingWasteCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So how do you talk to young people about living sustainably and raise knowledgeable kids who care about the future of the planet?Here are some tips for engaging the next generation on the environment meaningfully.Start with conversation: get curious and stay positiveDamon Gameau, actor, film-maker and director of documentaries including 2040 and the upcoming Future Council, says we have built a system that doesn’t value nature – and that needs to change. “Very quickly, children aren’t encouraged to care. They’re encouraged to try and extract and conquer and win and compete.”Instilling care and empathy in children works in a similar way to teaching them most other things: through modelling, education and good conversations.Plan your menu, get kids involved and be realistic: how to pack better school lunchesRead moreSusy Lee, author of Raising Kids Who Care and an educator with 18 years’ experience, says the first step is being intentional about what you’re trying to teach. “We need kids who know [that they] don’t need to be suckered into buying more stuff [and] that generosity and compassion and helping others is actually what makes them happy.”Good conversations need two things, she says: curiosity and positivity. Don’t lecture, be collaborative and be guided by questions. Listen more, talk less.Involving kids in age-appropriate discussions about what matters, then modelling good choices, leads to positive outcomes. Some starting points are: discussing where to donate money and time, whether to get an electric vehicle or petrol car, or visiting your local MP to raise issues important to your community.Gameau says adults can also help by acknowledging the size and scariness of the issues, and letting kids feel anger, sadness and fear. Young people already know about the threats, he says, pointing to an international survey that foundnearly 60% of young peoplewere either very or extremely worried about the environment.Connect with natureThen connect kids (and adults!) with the living world again: spend time in nature, get to know the bird varieties and tree species around you, have adventures outside. It’s easier to care about things you know, see and experience. Take the time to stop, examine and discuss. Seek out joy, beauty and fun to counterbalance the gloom.Zena Burgess, CEO of the Australian Psychological Society, emphasises the importance of action and taking individual steps that build a community of people making positive progress. This is echoed by Lee and Gameau, and reflects Bob Brown’s catchphrase: action is the antidote to despair.Start where your kids are. If they love the ocean, take them snorkelling, watch documentaries, pick up rubbish on the beach. Look for ways to reduce plastic in the home and community, join campaigns against single-use plastic. Follow the children’s lead, show them hope and possibilities, and steer clear of overwhelm.Ditch the balloons and swap the plastic toys for cake: how to have a waste-free birthday partyRead moreTake action – and don’t forget to have funIt’s not the kids’ responsibility to fix things, it’s ours. But we can support them, combining their ideas, creativity and passion with our knowledge and experience. This help ranges from having good conversations to dealing with emotions, arranging logistics, finding information and joining organisations. And it extends beyond our own children: we’ll all be affected by the future we’ve created, and need to use our skills and connections to make a difference in any way we can.Look for ways to make it fun. Jump in the surf after you’ve cleaned the beach; revel in your results. You’re joining a community of billions of people taking action across the world. Spread the hope and joy of these stories; seek out the positives. Make sure there’s a clear link between doing good and feeling good and make it something others want to join. Make it cool to care.Raising kids who care is a matter of balancing the truth of where we are with the resilience of both the natural world and human endeavour. As Gameau says, “There’s something beautiful about the human spirit, particularly when its back is against the wall and innovation and creativity get unleashed. We’re capable of doing extraordinary and wonderful things.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingChange by degreesChildrenEthical and green livingConservationEnvironmental activismClimate crisisAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was reported missing two days later, on 9 May.The investigation has so far involved a large-scale search operation, including the use of helicopters, divers, and specialist digital and financial investigators.Police said almost 400 people had been spoken to as part of door-to-door inquiries, and more than 2,000 hours of CCTV footage had been reviewed.Detectives had previously said they were treating the case as a missing person inquiry rather than a criminal investigation.A major incident public portal set up to collect images, footage and information from the public had received numerous submissions, police said.Police added that inquiries were ongoing to establish the full circumstances.Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The balloon has burst, people think they are a busted flush and they want them out.”The byelection result proved to people acrossScotlandthat only Scottish Labour could beat the SNP in 2026, he added, as he praised the results of “the most significant and best ground operation in any constituency in the history of the Scottish Labour party”.Sarwar said: “Reform can make the noise. The Tories aren’t even at the races. It’s a straight choice between the SNP and ScottishLabour.”While continuing to condemn Reform’s “dirty campaign” – which involved increasingly personal attacks on him by Nigel Farage that were condemned cross-party as racist – Sarwar also attacked “the spin, nonsense, and misinformation from the SNP”. Their attempts to present the contest as a two-horse race between SNP and Reform had risked pushing voters towards the rightwing populists, he said.Swinney denied this, saying the SNP’s campaign messaging was informed by what voters were saying. “People were telling us on doorsteps of their anger and frustration at the Labour party because of things like winter fuel payments,” he told reporters at party headquarters in Edinburgh.“But also on the same sessions on the doorsteps [we heard] that people were planning to vote Reform. The confluence of those two things meant that I had to say our message for the SNP could stop Reform. I certainly don’t want the poisonous politics of Farage to be imported into the Scottish parliament.”1:14Scottish Labour celebrates 'incredible' byelection win and hits out at Reform – videoSwinney claimed his party had made progress in the byelection. “It’s not as much as I would like us to have made, but we’ve made progress against the backdrop of a really damaging [general] election last summer.”Although Reform came in third place, the party gained 26% of the vote share – a significant success for a party that still has minimal, though expanding, infrastructure north of the border and no dedicated Scottish leader. This mirrored levels of support it has enjoyed in recent central belt council byelections.Many of its votes appear to have come from a collapse in Conservative support, down from 18% in 2021 to 6% yesterday, but the SNP also lost almost 17% of its vote share while Labour was down 2%.Sarwar suggested that three blocks of voters had moved to Reform – former Conservatives, those making a protest vote against both Westminster and Holyrood incumbents, and some who believed “the frankly ludicrous campaign that this was a straight choice between Reform and the SNP”.At the rally, the Scottish Labour deputy leader, Dame Jackie Baillie, said the contest was a vindication of the party’s strategy, demonstrating that “talking to people and doing to work on the doorstep is absolutely vital to how we win”. Other Labour figures pointed out that the party had made a conscious decision to focus on the ground campaign, which is largely invisible to the national media but secured victory in the end.That ground campaign also paid off in terms of countering the dissatisfaction with the decision-making of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves that some voters were expressing on the doorstep. Labour politicians who were helping canvas described local people as having “a lot to get off their chests” and the need for lengthy engagement on the thinking behind unpopular Westminster decisions, which appears to have won over many voters.Explore more on these topicsScottish politicsScotlandAnas SarwarLabourReform UKScottish National party (SNP)newsShareReuse this content"

One of the officers, PC Peter Boxall, told the inquest he dragged Osei by his collar as this was the safest way to get him out of the narrow space. He argued that handcuffing him was justified for the safety of the officers and members of the public, including Osei.The inquest heard ABD presents with symptoms such as extreme agitation, paranoia, rapid breathing and sweating, and can be exacerbated by restraint. Boxall said he had been trained in ABD but had not recognised it in Osei.The inquest jury returned a narrative conclusion on Friday. It said: “Godrick’s death was caused by heart failure related to acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) and associated drug and alcohol misuse and mental health difficulties (PTSD).“His ABD was exacerbated by the use of illicit substances and alcohol and psychological distress he experienced with his interactions with the police.”In legal arguments during the inquest, the family argued that the jury should be given the option of reaching a conclusion of unlawful killing.They said that everything Osei experienced that night – including being dragged across the floor and sworn at – was “part and parcel” of the events that led to his death. Devon and Cornwall police argued that natural causes ought to be the conclusion.The case is particularly sensitive for the Devon and Cornwall force after the death of church caretaker Thomas Orchard, who died after a heavy webbing belt was placed over his face by police during a mental health crisis in Exeter in 2012. An inquest juryfound in 2023 that prolonged use of the belt may have contributed to his death.The charity Inquest, which has been supporting Osei’s family, said his death highlighted a “broader and longstanding pattern” of a disproportionate number of deaths of black men after police use of force, particularly those in mental health crisis. Research by Inquest in 2022 reported that black peopleare seven times more likely to die after police restraint than white people.After the conclusion of the hearing, Jodie Anderson, senior caseworker at Inquest, said: “The police response to Godrick was brutal and inhumane. Terrified and in crisis, he called 999 seeking help, fearing for his life. Instead, he was met with aggression and force.“Godrick’s death highlights a deeply embedded culture within policing: one that defaults to violence rather than compassion. From the Macpherson report to the Casey review, the warnings about institutional racism have been clear – yet nothing changes.”During his inquest in Truro,Osei’s family claimed he was treated “inhumanely” because of his race, which was denied by the officers involved in the incident.His relatives described him as a deeply loved son, brother, and father-of-two, a “gentle giant” who had struggled with his mental health after the death of his father.Una Morris, the family’s lawyer, suggested to PC Boxall that his attitude changed when he saw Osei was black. The inquest heard that he told a colleague to “red dot” Osei – aim a Taser at him, though the electrical weapon was not discharged – and said: “Fucking hell, look at the sight of his fingers.”The lawyer asked Boxall if dragging a black man by the collar across the floor and swearing at him was “inhumane”. Boxall replied that the man’s race made no difference. “We needed to gain control,” he said. However, he apologised for his language.Devon and Cornwall police have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In doing so they have shafted the creative industries, and they have proved willing to decimate the UK’s second-biggest industrial sector. They have lied to parliament, and they are lying to the sector.”She said the government’s action “adds another sector to the growing number that have an unbridgeable gap of trust with the government”.Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the NMA, said: “The government’s refusal to listen to the strong view of the Lords … risks undermining the legislative process.“There is still time for the government to do the right thing, and take transparency powers in this bill. This would be a key step towards rebuilding trust with a £126bn industry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four people were killed, including three emergency workers in Kyiv.The Ukrainian president wrote in a social media post: “If someone does not put pressure and gives the war more time to take lives, they are complicit and responsible. We need to act decisively.”Missiles and drones hammered the Ukrainian capital leading fires to rage through residential buildings and forcing the local metro system to close after a train was hit.It was part of a nationwide assault that ranks among the largest coordinated attacks in the three years of full-scale war, with 44 ballistic and cruise missiles and 407 drones launched. About 50 people were injured across the country.View image in fullscreenFirefighters extinguish a fire in Kyiv after the Russian drone-and-missile attack.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesYurii Ihnat, the Ukrainian air force spokesperson, said Ukrainian forces had shot down about 30 of the cruise missiles and up to 200 of the drones.Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had carried out the overnight attacks in response to what it called Ukrainian “terrorist acts” againstRussia. The Kremlin later described its three-year invasion of Ukraine as “existential” for Russia, casting it as nothing short of a battle for the “future” of Russia.“For us it is an existential issue, an issue on our national interest, safety, on our future and the future of our children, of our country,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters, responding to remarks by Trump on Thursday comparing Moscow and Kyiv to brawling children.On Friday night Trump was more critical of Ukraine, telling reporters on Air Force One that Operation Spiderweb had “given Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them”.Despite the efforts of Ukraine’s air defences, the authorities in Kyiv reported that three emergency workers had been killed and 20 people wounded, of whom 16 had been hospitalised. “Search and rescue operations are ongoing at several locations,” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram.Hegseth says Nato allies ‘very close’ to raising defence spending target to 5%Read moreAccording to the ministry of internal affairs, the three victimswere firefightersfrom the state emergency service who died while responding to the attack. “They were working under fire to help people,” the ministry said in a statement.Operation of the city’s metro transport system was disrupted after a Russian strike damaged a train travelling between stations, the city’s military administration said. The air attack also triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of Kyiv, authorities said.A residential block in the Solomianskyi district took severe damage to the upper floors with entire windows, balcony frames, and parts of an outer wall blown away. More than 2,000 households in Kyiv’s eastern bank remained without electricity on Friday morning.Russia had previouslyvowed to take revengeon Ukraine after Monday’s audacious drone attack, known as Operation Spiderweb, on its bomber fleet.Initially, two TU-95MC and two TU-160MC bombers were deployed by Russia on Thursday night. This was a lower number than had been feared and may have been the result of the Kremlin’s resources being reduced by the events of 1 June. Kalibr missiles were also fired from Russian warships stationed in the Black Sea.Putin informed the US president, Donald Trump, in a call on Wednesday that Russia would respond to the operation that Ukraine has claimed damaged or destroyed 41 aircraft. “They went deep into Russia and [Putin] actually told me we have no choice but to attack based on that, and it’s probably not going to be pretty,” Trump had told reporters.Trump said it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia“fight for a while”rather than pursue peace immediately. Ukraine and Russia met for talks in Istanbul on Monday with no headway to a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies.The barrage on Kyiv had begun with the buzz of Russian kamikaze drones followed by Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire. Through the night the city was shaken by large explosions.View image in fullscreenA man carries his dog in front of a residential building damaged after a Russian drone strike in Kyiv.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APTymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said drones had struck the upper floors of a high-rise apartment building and started a fire in Darnytskyi district on the east side of the city. One unofficial Telegram channel said a shopping centre in the area was ablaze.Tkachenko said a fire had also broken out in an apartment building in a western district. Drone fragments were found in three districts.Ukraine’s commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, demanded a strong international response to Russia’s latest attack. “Russia is acting like a terrorist, systematically targeting civilian infrastructure,” he wrote on Telegram. “The world must respond clearly and take concrete steps, including condemning the aggressor’s actions.”Elsewhere in the country, 10 people were reported injured in the western city of Ternopil, including five emergency workers, said the regional governor, Viacheslav Nehoda.Three people were injured in Ukraine’s central Poltava region after strikes on administrative buildings, warehouses and a cafe. Russian forces also struck the Khmelnytskyi region, damaging a private residential building, outbuildings, and several vehicles.Air defence forces shot down three Russian missiles in the western Lviv region overnight, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

For long-haul flights delays would have to be six or more hours. Current EU rules dictate that passengers can ask for compensation if their flight is delayed for more than three hours.The EU countries also agreed to increase the amount of compensation for those delayed on short-haul flights from €250 (£211) to €300, but plan to reduce compensation for long-haul flights from €600 to €500.Michael O’Leary to get €100m bonus under deal to keep him at RyanairRead moreThe revision of the EU’s air passenger rights was initially proposed in 2013 by the European Commission. It has taken 12 years of negotiations for member states to reach an agreement on changes to the timeframe for compensation, and the plans still have to be negotiated with the European parliament before they become law.The European Consumer Organisation, the BEUC, said the plan would deprive “the majority of passengers from their compensation rights”, as most delays are between two and four hours.The trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents companies such as Ryanair, easyJet and Lufthansa, also condemned the plan because it wanted delay times to be even longer before compensation payments kick in.Ourania Georgoutsakou, the A4E managing director, said: “Europe has been waiting for transparent and workable passenger rights for 12 years and member states have fallen at the final hurdle to deliver.“Rather than providing delay thresholds of five and nine hours that would save up to 70% of rescuable cancelled flights, member states have diluted the European Commission’s original proposal and introduced even more complexity.”The European Commission’s initial plan included extending the time to five hours for short-haul flights and nine for long-haul.The agreement also includes a “right to be rerouted” when there are long delays, automating forms for compensation and stronger rights for passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He wrote on X: “The text could have been more ambitious, but it is an important step towards improving the quality of service offered to air passengers.”The UK has its own rules on air passenger rights, based on EU regulation. Under these rules, airlines must compensate passengers if their flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late and extraordinary circumstances did not cause the delay.For short-haul flights under 1,500km (932 miles), passengers can be compensated up to £220. This rises to £350 for medium-haul flights between 1,500km and 3,500km. For long-haul flights of more than 3,500km, delayed passengers can be paid up to £520, although this can be lowered to £260 if the passenger arrives at the destination with a delay of less than four hours.However, an EU official said its changes could affect British travellers too, as it applies to passengers taking flights with an EU carrier. This means it could affect a passenger travelling to and from an EU country on an EU airline.Explore more on these topicsAirline industryFlightsConsumer affairsEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But he is discovering painfully and quickly that it has not bought him love, loyalty or even fear among many GOP members of Congress on Capitol Hill.Faced with the choice of siding with Musk, the world’s richest man, orDonald Trump, after the two staged a public relationship breakdown for the ages on Thursday, most Republicans went with the man in the Oval Office, who has shown an unerring grasp of the tactics of political intimidation and who remains the world’s most powerful figure even without the boss of Tesla and SpaceX by his side.The billionaire tech entrepreneur, who poured about $275m into Trump’s campaign last year, tried to remind Washington’s political classes of his financial muscle on Thursday during an outpouring of slights against a man for whom he had once professed platonic love and was still showering with praise up until a week before.Donald Trump says Elon Musk has ‘lost his mind’ and dismisses peace offeringRead more“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Muskpostedto his 220 million followers on X, the social media platform he owns – and which he has used ruthlessly to reshape the political agenda.It was a variation on a theme from a man who has repeatedly threatened to deploy his untold millions in funding primary challengers to elected politicians who displease him or who publicly considered blocking Trump’s cabinet nominations.But a gambit that had been effective in the past failed to work this time – and might not be enough to sink the “big, beautiful bill” that Musk this week condemned as a deficit-inflating “abomination”.One after another, Republican House members came out to condemn him and defend Trump, despite having earlier been told by Musk that “you know you did wrong” in voting for what has become Trump’s signature legislation that seeks to extend vast tax cuts for the rich.Troy Nehls, a GOP representative from Texas, captured the tone,addressing Muskbefore television cameras: “You’ve lost your damn mind. Enough is enough. Stop this.”It chimed with the sentiments of many others. “Nobody elected Elon Musk, and a whole lot of people don’t even like him, to be honest with you, even on both sides,” Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey congressman,told Axios.“We’re getting people calling our offices 100% in support of President Trump,” Kevin Hern, a representative from Oklahoma, told the site. “Every tweet that goes out, people are more lockstep behind President Trump and [Musk is] losing favour.”Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican, called Musk’s outburst of social media posts – that included a call for Trump’s impeachment, a forecast of a tariff-driven recession and accusation that the president is on the Jeffrey Epstein files – “absolutely childish and ridiculous”. Musk had “lost some of his gravitas”.There were numerous other comments in similar vein.They seemed to carry the weight of political calculation, rather than principled sentiment.Republicans were balancing the strength of Trump’s voice among GOP voters versus the power of the increasingly unpopular Musk’s money – and most had little doubt which matters most.“On the value of Elon playing against us in primaries compared to Trump endorsing us in primaries, the latter is 100 times more relevant,” Axios quoted one unnamed representative as saying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In April, Muskdiscoveredhow finite his influence was when a Republican judge he had backed with $25m of his own money lost by 10 percentage points in an election for a vacant supreme court seat in Wisconsin.It was a chastening experience that bodes ill for any hopes he has of persuading Republicans to change their minds on Trump’s spending bill.Yet Musk still has his sympathisers on Capitol Hill, even if they are a minority.With the “big, beautiful bill” still likely to pass through theSenate, Thomas Massie, a senator for Kentucky – who has been labelled “a grandstander” by Trump for his consistent criticism of the legislation – was unambiguous whenCNN askedwhich side he choose between Trump and Musk.“I choose math. The math always wins over the words,” he replied. “I trust the math from the guy that lands rockets backwards over the politicians’ math.”It was a rare case of economics trumping politics on a day when political self-interest seemed paramount.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansElon MuskUS politicsDonald TrumpUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS SenateanalysisShareReuse this content"

That’s what matters’Read moreThe city had argued the rule wasn’t specific to yoga, but commercial activity, as the instructors Steven Hubbard and Amy Baack’s free classes can draw as many as 100 people who give donations for each class ranging from $5 to $40.“The city’s legitimate governmental interests in this case include the preservation, safety, and orderly use of its parks and beaches by all visitors and residents who visit them,” San Diego’s attorneys wrote in court papers, adding that the city and county drew 32 million visitors in 2023.By Thursday, Hubbard had resumed teaching yoga to a dozen people underneath palm trees in the park at Pacific Beach. He said he was cited for his classes, which are free and open to all, at least 10 times since the ordinance took effect last year.He began holding classes on a live stream from his backyard, just across the street from the beach. Bryan Pease, a lawyer for both instructors, said a park official cited Hubbard for holding classes in the park even though he was not there.Outdoor yoga is a service to those who are disabled or cannot afford yoga classes elsewhere, said Pease.“It is a popular thing here. We’re a beach community, and it’s a way for people to access yoga that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to,” Pease said.At the Pacific Beach park, John Noack, who has attended Hubbard’s classes for four years, said he thought the group was targeted because wealthy homeowners in the area did not want people disturbing their oceanfront views.“I personally see this as a triumph of community over a handful of elites,” Noack said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSan DiegoYogaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Can Star Wars survive without him?The franchise’s last remaining connection to the original trilogy has appeared in a number of recent spinoffs. What’s next, now the 73-year-old actor says he has hung up his lightsaber for good?Ben ChildFri 6 Jun 2025 12.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 12.31 EDTShareMark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker has been Star Wars’ ultimate backup plan for at least half a decade. The original trilogy has faded into the distance, and the movies set in that galaxy far, far away have become so poor in recent years that we’d all rather watch Andor. But there was always the option of plugging in Hamill – a sort of human Star Wars USB stick, primed to conjure up 1970s vibes as required. Not quite getting your fill of Force nostalgia? Here’sLuke tutoring Baby Yoda in The Book of Boba Fett. And here he is again,whinging about past mistakes in The Last Jedi. It may not quite have been Binary Sunset, or Yoda lifting the X-wing on Dagobah. But for a few shimmering, quite-possibly-digitally-retouched moments, it felt like we were back in the real Star Wars again.Back in 2023, I wroteabout the weird emotional whiplash of falling for digi-Luke: the plasticky but strangely compelling CGI version of the Jedi master who turned up in those Disney+ TV shows like a hologram from a smoother-skinned age. At the time, Hamill had sounded lukewarm on returning to Star Wars, but left just enough ambiguity to keep the dream alive.That was all before this week’s revelation,in an interview with ComicBook.com, that Hamill has definitively closed the book on ever playing Skywalker again. Not even as a Force Ghost – the role he had been tipped to play in the forthcoming, utterly dreadful sounding Daisy Ridley-led film about a new Jedi order. “And by the way, when I disappeared in [The Last Jedi], I left my robes behind. And there’s no way I’m gonna appear as a naked Force ghost,” said Hamill. He added: “I had my time. I’m appreciative of that, but I really think they should focus on the future and all the new characters.”And you might think: fair enough. After nearly 50 years in and around a franchise that has de-aged, re-aged and resurrected him more times than Emperor Palpatine, the man has earned the right to float off into the Force unbothered. Hamill is now 73, and there comes a time in every Jedi’s life when they must hang up their lightsaber, and hope that the studio doesn’t resurrect them as a digital sock puppet 30 years later. For the man who will for ever be thought of as Luke Skywalker, that moment is now – and judging by his tone, not a moment too soon.View image in fullscreen‘I had my time’ … Hamill at the Rise of Skywalker premiere in 2019.Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/API am not even secretly hoping for more. After all, that episode of The Mandalorian – you know the one – hinted at a whole new chapter. For a brief moment, it felt likeStar Warsmight finally fill in the blank pages of Luke’s life between blowing up Death Stars and milking alien sea cows. Perhaps we’d get Star Wars: Jedi Academy, a kind of intergalactic Dead Poets Society. Maybe it would be terrible. Maybe it would be magnificent. Either way, it would have been something. But without Hamill, the grand plan of stitching together the post-Imperial timeline starts to wobble.Because the truth is, Skywalker had become the Mando-verse’s narrative gaffer tape, holding together a sprawling mess of side quests, animated spin-offs and character revivals. Whenever things got too niche, in came Luke.His absence leaves a big, Jedi-shaped hole. You can’t exactly call up Rey for a cameo in the Mando-timeline (she would still be a child, and the jury is decidedly out on whether Star Wars fans will even want to see her again after the debacle that was Rise of Skywalker). Leia and Obi-Wan have joined the blue-glow retirement club. Yoda has been replaced by a mini-me. Anakin long since turned to the dark side and died in the arms of a man he’d spent three films trying to kill. Luke’s departure leaves us lost in space, drifting in cosmic purgatory, wondering what the future might hold now the franchise has burned through its last original-trilogy safety net.It’s a strange place to be for long-term fans of the saga, yet finally we may be able to set ourselves on a new course. If it’s one that is miraculously free of Death Stars, Palpatine clones and even sand, we might one day find ourselves thanking Hamill for making a decision we should probably all have made peace with long, long ago.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekMark HamillStar WarsScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she is swapping Broadway for a powerful account of Britain’s broken prison systemFri 6 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareEach morning before filming Lollipop, Posy Sterling took a giant bucket outside, filled it with ice and climbed in. Never mind that it was November or that her call time was at 5am; the actor would take daily dips in the freezing water in the dark. In Lollipop, Sterling plays a headstrong mother who has recently been released from prison and is fighting to win back her kids.The role is heavy, but the ice baths meant she started the days feeling light. “I just found it euphoric,” she says. Tickled, her driver started bringing her more ice as part of her ritual.Today, Sterling, 32, is similarly full of beans, buzzing from two coffees and fresh from six weeks in New York. “I haven’t slept,” she says brightly. The actor has been quietly building her profile since Screen International named her one of 2023’s Stars of Tomorrow, with performances in the Saoirse Ronan addiction dramaThe Outrunand Benedict Andrews’s buzzy take onThe Cherry Orchard at the Donmar Warehousein London, which has just finished a run off Broadway. We’re meeting in an office in north London, where Sterling is excited to talk about her first leading role in a film.“I share a fire with Molly,” she says of her character in Lollipop. Sterling is breezy and charming, but there is an intensity to the way she speaks. She says she related to Molly’s “refusal to be reduced”, despite the difficulties she faces. In the film, Molly lives in a tent while on a waiting list for a one-bedroom flat. It is the only kind of accommodation she can apply for as a single, unmarried woman, but in order to live with both her children,she needs at least two bedrooms.View image in fullscreenMother load … Posy Sterling in Lollipop.Photograph: Tereza CervenovaAs if things weren’t hard enough, Molly has just spent the last four months in prison.According to the Prison Reform Trust, 58% of prison sentences given to women in England and Wales in 2022 were for less than six months. “And yet the repercussions of what someone like Molly is going through can last a lifetime,” Sterling says. “Usually they’re reacting to the environment they’re in,” she adds, listing poverty, addiction and domestic violence as typical contributing factors. “A different punishment could be served instead of a prison sentence.” She pauses and laughs darkly. “Orhelp, maybe?”The film is written and directed by Daisy-May Hudson, who made the 2015 documentary Half Way, about her and her family’s experience of homelessness, when she was just 24. Lollipop is Hudson’s first fiction film but it is driven by a similar mission: to expose the bureaucracy that punishes people who have fallen through the cracks of society, and to show their joy and resilience. Sterling is electric as Molly, blazing with intelligence and maternal rage.Lollipop review – impassioned, head-butting indictment of the social-care systemRead more“What I really like about what Daisy-May chose to do, is that she doesn’t ever say why Molly went to prison,” Sterling says. “That doesn’t define a person, and it doesn’t tell you anything, actually, about who they are,” though “it’s probably the first thing people would ask”. The film resists offering up Molly’s crime as a way of justifying her situation. Instead, Hudson presents a character study of a flawed, fiercely loving woman trying her best to be a “good” mum.Sterling doesn’t have children of her own but, before Lollipop, had already spent time researching pregnancy in prisons for another role. Sweatbox was produced by Clean Break, a celebrated theatre company whose cast and crew are made up of women affected by the criminal justice system. Set entirely in a prison van and following three women as they are transported between prison and court, the play was turned into ashort film, which caught the eye of Lollipop’s casting director, Lucy Pardee, a regular collaborator of Andrea Arnold. Sterling read the script for Lollipop seven times before her audition, because how prison affects mothers was something she “cared about already”.In order to build the character of Molly, Sterling had conversations with a woman who had fought to regain custody of her children after they were removed. “She would tell me viscerally what her body went through when this happened to her, which was something I was able to draw on when playing Molly,” she says. In the film’s most devastating scene, the stoic Molly finally crumbles, letting out an animal howl of pain on the floor of a social services building. Sterling tears up when I mention it. “It felt quite ancestral, to be honest,” she says. “It’s important that you see how something is just affecting someone. How much can one person take?”Sterling was born in Manchester in 1992, and spent her childhood in north London and, later, Market Harborough in Leicestershire. She is one of eight, including stepsiblings. Sterling and her younger siblings were born quite close together but have different accents because of where they grew up. She says she was “massively protective” of them. “I was separated from my siblings for a time,” she explains cautiously, and “was moved around quite a lot growing up”. The experience of being in so many different situations gave her a fascination with people-watching and quietly psychoanalysing behaviour.“I don’t want to say I was naughty,” she says, but at school, the label stuck. “I was always very passionate,” she adds, two deep dimples emerging. “But I was quite rebellious.” Performing was an escape while growing up and Sterling, a gifted singer, would put on shows and direct anyone within earshot. She applied to Italia Conti drama school, whose alumni includeLesley Manvilleand Naomi Campbell. “Basically I did get in, before Clean Break,” she says.View image in fullscreenKeeping it in the family … Lollipop.Photograph: Tereza CervenovaSterling declines to talk about the circumstances that led her to Clean Break, but explains that “to be a service user [at the organisation], you do have to tick some boxes” – Clean Break being for women who have either been affected by the criminal justice system or are at risk of offending. In 2015 she joined Clean Break’s Young Artists programme, which she describes as “a second chance for a lot of women”. When Sterling was referred there, she remembers that she didn’t want anything to do with acting. “I felt things deeply and had started to do my healing,” she says, and so the prospect of ploughing her emotions “felt like that would be too much”.The programme was an opportunity “to turn pain and experience into something”, as well as an instructive lesson that acting is not the same as therapy. “Sometimes at drama schools, they try to get you to dig and unearth all the worst things in your life, whereas somewhere like Clean Break, they are nurturing you as a person. It’s not always about ‘How do you get into character?’ but ‘How do you get out of character?’”Italia Conti “held my place” and Sterling graduated in 2016. To be an actor, she says, you need life experience – something that nobody can teach. “But you need to have the skill to approach characters, and to be able to access parts of yourself in a way that isn’t going to re-traumatise you.” In Lollipop, Sterling’s soulful performance feels authentic, but it is precise and crafted.View image in fullscreen‘It’s not always about how do you get into character, but: how do you get out of character?’ … Posy Sterling.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian. Dress: Laura Green; Earrings: Vintage Chanel by Circular Groove; Bracelet and ring: Astley Clarke; Socks: Tabio; Loafers: GH Bass; Jumper: Bella Freud.It impressed her former mentor,Zawe Ashton, who was introduced to Sterling through Clean Break. In an email, Ashton says Lollipopwas the first acting work she had seen from Sterling. She said her performance was “full of primal feeling and nuance” and left her “truly awestruck … Posy is that electrifying blend of trained technique and raw emotion.”Sterling is also a gifted vocalist and sings in the film. She is “learning the guitar at the moment” and has been “jamming the blues” with musicians she met in New York. During an early Clean Break performance, her rendition of a Frank Sinatra number caught the ear of Jane Winehouse, stepmother of Amy, who invited her to participate in the Amy’s Yard outreach programme, which supports vulnerable young musicians. Sterling wrote and recorded a song in Winehouse’s studio, and met the producer Mark Ronson at a gala 10 years ago. The experience was a turning point that “connected me to myself again”, she says.A few weeks ago in New York, at a performance of The Cherry Orchard, the actor Grace Gummer, daughter of Meryl Streep, was in the audience. She was so taken by the play that she brought Ronson, her husband, with her to see it again the following day. Sterling did a double take when she saw him while on stage. “They were meant to be going to another show, and she traded the tickets in to come back to see it a second time,” says Sterling. It was a full-circle moment, reminding her of just how much has happened during the last decade.Sterling credits Clean Break and the outreach programmes she took part in with instilling self-belief at a time when she had little. “They really want you to see what they see,” she says. “Then it feels like there’s been a reason for all of this.”Lollipop is in cinemas from13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmUK criminal justiceTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They decide to cast off their clothes and walk through the countryside as nature intended, only to be mistaken for poachers. The story’s combination of humour, transgression and ear for the Doric dialect of north-east Scotland were characteristic qualities of its author, Nan Shepherd (1893-1981), a writer unashamed by her nakedness and celebrated for her evocations of Scotland’s rural environment.Celebrated, that is, onceThe Living Mountain, her short book about walking in the Cairngorms, was published. That was in 1977, three decades after its completion, but more especially in 2011 when it was republished by Canongate, just as it was slipping back into obscurity.It had not always been that way. As the author of three interwar novels, Shepherd was considered a significant modernist writer in her day. But, having turned her attention to teaching, not to mention roaming the hills, she had been largely forgotten at the time of her death in 1981.As this one-act play by Richard Baron and Ellie Zeegen would have it, she is a woman with little concern for posterity. Played by Susan Coyle, Shepherd is resistant to flattery and modest about her achievements, coming most alive at the sound of poetry; sometimes her own, just as often not. At times in Baron’s production, she asks members of the audience to read her favourite passages aloud (which, at my performance, they do impressively).Part of a generation that included the novelist Neil M Gunn and the poet Hugh MacDiarmid, Shepherd enthuses about contemporaries such as Virginia Woolf, to whom she was compared. This literary passion, along with an unconventional private life, is at the heart of a play that swirls around her story, taking us from wide-eyed child, discovering the beauty of pine cones, to care-home resident, refusing to be patronised by the staff.Coyle switches from excitable youth to stiff-limbed old woman and all points in between, while Adam Buksh gamely plays lovers, academics and carers. If the play skims the surface of Shepherd’s appeal as a writer, it is nonetheless a warm-hearted evocation of a life led with self-determination in and out of the shadows.AtPitlochry Festival theatreuntil 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrePitlochry Festival theatrePoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its focus on the terrible grief of bereaved mothers makes it a cut aboveLucy ManganFri 6 Jun 2025 03.11 EDTFirst published on Thu 5 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareIhope you have had enough time to recover from Robyn Malcolm’s barnstorming performance as a harrowed wife and mother labouring under burdens no one should have to endure in the acclaimed After the Party, because here comes another one.The Survivors is a six-part adaptation of Jane Harper’s bestselling Australian crime novel of the same name, by Tony Ayres – who did the same for Christos Tsiolkas’s The Slap 10 years ago, which followed families fracturing under the weight of a moment’s lost control, and who co-created Stateless in 2020 about lives intertwining at an Australian immigration detention centre. This is a writer who doesn’t shy away from the pain human beings can inflict on one other. The Survivors is technically a murder mystery but its real subject is grief and terrible, terrible guilt.Ayres noted in a publicity interview that he wouldn’t dare start The Slap now as gently as he did then (it began with one of the characters easing into a seemingly ordinary day, by the end of which nothing would be easy again); the pressure to grab the audience immediately and hard is simply too great. Accordingly, we begin here at night with a teenage boy on the verge of drowning in the storm-lashed caves of his local bay. A boat crewed by his older brother and his friend comes riding out of the darkness, only to overturn at the last second. We cut to a funeral – the boy, Kieran (Ned Morgan) has survived but his brother Finn (Remy Kidd) and Finn’s friend and crewman Toby (Talon Hooper) were killed.We then cut to the present day, 15 years on from the tragedy, as Kieran (played as an adult by Charlie Vickers) returns to Evelyn Bay after years of – only technically self-imposed – exile with his wife Mia (Yerin Ha) and their new baby, his parents’ first grandchild. His father Brian (Damien Garvey) is now in the early stages of dementia and mistakes him for Finn. The air is thicker than ever with ghosts. His mother Verity (Robyn Malcolm) is seen in flashback berating young Kieran in his hospital bed for the death of his brother but here in the present busies herself with caring for Brian and making pass-agg remarks about Kieran and Mia’s parenting skills. The atmosphere alone makes you want to watch from behind your fingers.In a small town there is no escape. Everyone knows who he is, everyone has an opinion about the degree of his culpability, none more so than the owner of the local pub, which is owned by Toby’s father Julian (Martin Sacks) whose rage and sorrow has festered and been passed on to the son, Liam (Julian Weeks), Toby left behind.It is almost a relief when a corpse turns up on the beach to distract us all. But it is the body of Bronte (Shannon Berry), a young woman from out of town who had been researching the possible death of a third person that night 15 years ago. The drownings overshadowed the disappearance of teenager Gabby Birch (Eloise Rothfield) and Bronte was working with her mother Trish (Catherine McClements), giving as heartbreaking a performance as Malcolm to reignite interest in her case.Bronte was murdered and likely sexually assaulted. Her murder and the possible death/killing of Gabby pull the community into a fresh hell at the same time as resurrecting memories of the past. Clues are gathered, suspects are considered, tracked down, dismissed or arrested, and hopes, disappointments, red herrings and new possibilities abound as detectives try to reconstruct Bronte’s time in Evelyn Bay and discover who she might have upset and how. Meanwhile, the labyrinthine connections among the townsfolk are gradually revealed, offering up new motives and ruling out others. But we also see how the competing interests among people and the vulnerabilities left by the storm leave them open to blackmail from and by one other – how do you refuse anything to someone you bereaved? – and witness statements are retracted or massaged, evidence is concealed and the situation becomes increasingly dark for Kieran and his family especially.The Survivors is a study in how raw grief and festering resentment warp everything – and how surviving a tragedy rarely means getting away unscathed. At its centre is the particular pain of the three mothers – Finn’s, Bronte’s and Gabby’s – deprived of their children and for ever changed by it. Their suffering is almost palpable and marks The Survivors indelibly out from the murder mystery herd.The Survivors is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

For decades, the content-creating studio chief has beenroundly criticizedfor making the traumatization of Black women a persistent theme in his work. In Straw, his latest exercise in misogynoir for Netflix, he pulls out all the stops to break the camel’s back.The Life of Chuck review – unmoving Stephen King schmaltzRead moreThe guinea pig for this cultural stress test is Janiyah (Taraji P Henson), an apex Perry caricature who is past the point of exhaustion. Her loud, hot and dumpy apartment isn’t all that keeps her in perennial discomfort. There’s also a precocious young daughter (Gabrielle E Jackson) with nagging medical issues, and that eviction notice on the dining table. She can’t make ends meet despite working three jobs, and her cashier’s position at the local food desert grocery store is especially thankless. When an angry customer spikes a bottle of fizzy drink at Janiyah’s feet, her boss orders her to stand down from her busy checkout lane to clean up the mess. When Janiyah unwittingly cuts off an undercover cop in traffic after begging off the register to run a quick errand, he throws his ice coffee drink at her car and threatens to “find a legal way to blow your brains out”.In the end, Janiyah is ticketed for driving on an expired license, her car is impounded and she’s forced to find her way back to work on foot in the kind of surprise monsoon that Perry keeps in the forecast to further break down his female protagonists – and, verily, things do indeed get worse: her irascible boss (Glynn Turman) fires her for deserting her post, her landlord empties the meager contents of her dumpy apartment on to the curb, and her kid is confiscated from school after the principal squeals to child protective services. At her wits’ end, she treks back to the grocery store to urge her boss to release her last paycheck only for both of them to wind up held up at gunpoint when a band of robbers charge into the back office to empty the store vault.There’s a glimmer of hope when one of the robbers attacks Janiyah, and she fights him off and kills him with his own gun – but her boss is convinced she’s in on the heist because the attacker “knew her”. Turns out the guy only read her name tag, but the boss is already running with his story while on the phone with 911. When he threatens to take her down and twists the knife, Janiyah finally snaps and shoots him dead, too. It isn’t much long after that we find Janiyah in the middle of a hostage situation at the bank when her attempt to cash that bloody last paycheck raises alarm bells.The balance of the film plays like the Tyler Perry version of John Q, down to the Luigi Mangione-coded public rallying cry – trading injuryfor Spike Lee’s insult, perhaps. The third act is freighted with pointed digressions on the intractable racism in banking and healthcare systems, and the inescapable Perry twist at the film’s core is its own commentary on the Black mental health crisis. As ever, Perry – who takes top billing once more as this film’s writer, director and executive producer – engages with many ideas, but none that he seems to fully understand. That includes Black women, whom he does a tremendous disservice to once again.But the hatchet job may be lost on most viewers because Straw is one of the better films on Perry’s grade curve. The pacing could be better for what is ostensibly a 105-minute thriller. The day-night transitions in particular arewild,and again the rain comes out of nowhere. But Straw doesn’t meander as much as Perry’s other productions. (Looking at you,Duplicity.) It’s not soapy or camp either. There’s melodrama, sure, but Straw makes you take it seriously – and a lot of it is a credit to the actors playing it straight and, possibly, getting a few extra takes to refine their performances (weird flex, I know).Sherri Shepherd, who’s typically at her best going for laughs, shines as the sober bank manager who remains empathetic in crisis. Teyana Taylor was equally impressive as the detective hostage negotiator who advocates for Janiyah. (The only letdown in her performance was her wig, which is very muchon-brand for Perry.) But yet again it’s Henson who delivers the powerhouse performance while edging from distress to anger to winsome compassion. It’s just a shame that after hiring her for four films now, Perry is still treating her like a speed bag.In one of the scenes outside the bank, as the standoff at the bank deepens, a protest movement foments and one Janiyah supporter holds up a sign that reads, “Nevertheless she persisted”, amuch-memed feminist slogan. Sadly, the irony is probably lost on Perry – ultimately, a billionaire servant of the evangelical Christian patriarchy who is steadfastly committed to proving that the women of the world who make “bad” choices deserve all the pain and punishment they can get and then some. This certainly won’t be the last Straw.Straw is out now on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTaraji P HensonNetflixTyler PerryThrillersDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But Jesse Armstrong’s billionaire satire isn’t sci-fi fantasy. Nor is the ‘robotic Grampa’ Disney’s granddaughter so despisesStuart HeritageFri 6 Jun 2025 04.38 EDTShareFor years, the world’s most perfect urban myth was this: Walt Disney’s body was cryogenically frozen at the moment of death, waiting for technology to advance enough to bring him back to life. Started by a National Spotlite reporter who claimed to have sneaked into a hospital in 1967, only to be confronted by the sight of Disney suspended in a cryogenic cylinder, the myth prevailed because it was such a good fit.Disney – and therefore Walt Disney himself – was the smiling face of rigidly controlled joy, radiating a message of mandatory fun that is magical when you are a child and increasingly sinister as you age. This policy (essentially “enjoy yourself or else”) suits the idea of cryogenic preservation. After all, if you have the ego to successfully enforce a blanket emotion as a company mission statement, you definitely have the ego to transcend human mortality.However, not only has the cryogenic Disney myth been put to bed – he was cremated weeks before the National Spotlite hack claimed to find his body – but his family has issued a strongly worded rebuttal of the very idea of a post-human Walt Disney.The catalyst is the recently announced Disneyland show Walt Disney – A Magical Life, which will feature as its star attractionan animatronic recreationof Walt Disney. This, according to Josh D’Amaro, Disney experiences chair, will give visitors a sense of “what it would have been like to be in Walt’s presence”. However, Disney’s granddaughter Joanna Miller is convinced that this isnot what Disney the man would have wanted. In a Facebook post that was stinging enough to earn her an audience with the Disney CEO,Bob Iger,Miller said Disney was “dehumanising” her grandfather. “The idea of a robotic Grampa to give the public a feeling of who the living man was just makes no sense,” she wrote. “It would be an impostor, people are not replaceable. You could never get the casualness of his talking, interacting with the camera, [or] his excitement to show and tell people about what is new at the park. You cannot add life to one empty of a soul or essence of the man.”As recently as a decade ago, this would have been the stuff of bad science fiction – a woman worried that a multinational corporation is bringing a dead relative back to life against his wishes, like a warped nonconsensualWestworld– but no more. As an entertainment concept, post-humanism feels worryingly current.After all, the subject forms the backbone of Jesse Armstrong’s new filmMountainhead. Set in a world of bro-y tech billionaires that is only half a degree removed from our own – one in which AI-created misinformation has already caused society to start to erode – the inciting force of all the dark chaos that unfolds is Steve Carell’s character, who finds himself with a pressing need and an increasingly tight deadline to become transhuman. In other words, his body is failing and only technology can help him ward off the inevitability of death.And this is no flight of fancy. As recently as this year, scholars have been sounding alarms aboutNeuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant company. In aPoliticoarticle illuminating the growing tension between the religious right and Musk’s views on extending human life beyond normal mortality, Alexander Thomas, of the University of East London, pointed out that transhumanism ultimately means that “the 8 billion people alive today simply don’t matter – genocide and wars are mere ripples, as long as some survive, and Musk is the one that needs to survive”.View image in fullscreenIs there life after … Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFor those of us with certain genre interests, this is all starting to feel alarmingly eerie. Transhumanism may be the word of the moment, but it is a subject that has fascinated cinema for almost as long as the form has existed. Close to a century ago,Fritz Lang’s Metropolisrevolved around the idea of the Maschinenmensch, a robot expressly designed to carry a scientist’s dead lover past the point of her death. Decades later, Stanley Kubrick’s2001: A Space Odysseywas obsessed with what comes after humanity, either in the form of emotionless artificial intelligence or all-seeing Star Children.The theme has been played in countless different ways. InThe Matrix, transhumanism is a punishment, our beating hearts and warm bodies reduced to a power source for the robot uprising. InRoboCop– and especially in its less nuanced sequels – it is a weapon, upgrading fragile humans into unstoppable fighting machines designed to uphold justice at any cost.Neill Blomkamp’s Elysiumused it as a metaphor for class, with the monied haves using technology to perpetually augment their lives while the have-nots are doomed to a finite lifetime of toil.MeanwhileSpike Jonze’s Hertook a warmer approach, concerning itself with the confusing entanglements that occur when the human and transhuman collide. And Ridley Scott’sBlade Runnerfound outright sympathy for its transhuman replicants, who are vilified, hunted and searching for meaning beyond their programmed purpose.Obviously there have been duds along the way.Wally Pfister’s Transcendencefeatured an attempt to upload a scientist’s mind to the cloud so that he could fiddle around tediously with nanoparticles. The Lawnmower Man remains unwatchable, as doesJohnny Mnemonic, and the less said about Bicentennial Man the better.View image in fullscreenMorgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy and Rebecca Hall attempt to upload Johnny Depp’s mind in Wally Pfister’s Transcendence, 2014.Photograph: Peter Mountain/APBut all these films are science fiction. In Mountainhead, however, Carell’s urge to achieve transhumanity is not presented as mad science or wild ambition, but as a mundane tech-bro imperative. It hardly even seems speculative. He is a man who is afraid of death, and just needs to wait for five years so that one of his peers can iron out the kinks in the procedure. The notion is brought up with less ridicule than Jason Schwartzman’s character’s fondness for line-caught turbot.It is because science fiction has finally caught up with us. We live in an age where swathes of industries are about to be decimated by AI that is increasingly indistinguishable from human creation (although God knows how much more terrifying2001’s HALwould have been overlaid with ChatGPT’s chummy “yay you!” sycophancy). In retrospect, Elysium’s depiction of a transhuman ultraclass feels like it was torn directly from Elon Musk’s dream journal. Plus, transhumanism already exists, in a form. If you need proof, listen to theVirtually Parkinson podcast, in which a series of celebrities react with varying levels of dread to a series of questions barked at them by the reanimated AI voice ofMichael Parkinson.Perhaps this is to be expected. After all, the future depicted in movie sci-fi of old is already long past us. Blade Runner was set in 2019,Soylent Greenin 2022. Robocop was supposed to happen a decade ago and 2001: A Space Odyssey was set in, well, you get the idea. While we haven’t quite uploaded human consciousness or handed society over to emotionless lawbots, the scaffolding is all around us: facial recognition, neural implants, uncanny AI assistants that apologise like eager interns.That said, there hasn’t yet been a movie about the creator of a multinational entertainment corporation who dies of natural causes, only to be brought back to life against his will 60 years later as the result of a marketing department brainstorming exercise. And why should there be? After all, it isn’t science fiction. At this point in time, it’s barely even fiction at all.Explore more on these topicsFilmWalt Disney CompanyTheme parksBlade RunnerThe Matrix2001: A Space OdysseyArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

The first, Picking Flowers felt like the work of a female singer-songwriter who had dispensed with verses and choruses and was backed by a band on the verge of falling apart: woodwind, keyboards and guitar clashing, drums fading in and out of the mix, everything soaked in dub-influenced echo. Then it seemed to turn into a completely different song midway through. The second, Que?, offered a male rap-adjacent vocal over a chaotic sprawl of distorted guitar and drums before collapsing into noisy abstraction then stopping dead.It was the work of an eight-piece collective – all its members have other careers, both musical and otherwise (their ranks include a fashion designer and a visual artist) – formed in Brighton, but now dotted around south London: they apparently record in a disused shipping container and their social media presence consists of a solitary Instagram post. Their forthcoming mixtape Lightning Hit the Trees offers more of the pigeonhole-swerving same: music that veers from lulling and acoustic to nightmarish and noise-laden, from free jazzy improv to soundtrack atmospherics to prog-flecked post-rock, every one of its 29 minutes packed with ideas. How it might cohere live is an interesting point – it could easily just devolve into a mess – but there’s something hugely appealing about Parade’s disinclination to stay still, or provide an easy point of comparison.Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenTeyana Taylor.Photograph: Publicity imageTeyana Taylor – Long TimeOn her first release in five years, the actor/musician ethers an out-of-date relationship (“and the truth is, I didn’t end when it was over”), her cold poise blooming into gothic, vogue-ready house.LSCate Le Bon – Heaven Is No Feeling“You smoke our love like you’ve never known violence,” the Welsh musician sings witheringly on the first taste of her seventh album, atop a sea of dazed sax and murky, liquid guitar.LSKathleen Edwards – Say Goodbye, Tell No OneYet another hard truth:the Canadian songwriterfaces up to a relationship gone sour – how “you can get blisters from your favourite shoes” – on this wistful Americana epic.LSKasst 8 – Land of the ScousersProudly heavy Merseyside diction powers this rap track, which harks back to classic grime and garage with its lo-fi drums, ersatz strings and horns, and pirate-ready flow.BBTEditrix – The Big EThe New York guitarist makes thoughtful, knotty solo records, plays with Bill Orcutt and has a discordant, rumbling punk band in Editrix: in this skittish duck-and-diver, Eisenberg sings of aliens with joyful sharpness.LS​Laicositna – Sit & GoIt’s unusual to hear a British MC use such a fragile flow, so far off the mic.

Opening track A Tightwire sets the template for the album: urgent, off-kilter and even slightly disorienting. The youthful trio of Kai Slater (guitar, vocals), Asher Case (bass, baritone guitar, vocals) and Isaac Lowenstein (drums, synth) have played together since high school, which has meant they have a musical understanding and are as tight as the proverbial nut.View image in fullscreenLifeguard: Ripped and TornTheirs is angular, driving post-punk with audible echoes ofthe Pop Group, Wire, Gang of Four and the Wedding Present, but they’ve certainly brought their own spin to it. The songs blaze forth with hurtling, mostly indecipherable imagery. They could be yelling “I am the spy on your pillow” or “words like tonality come to me”. What does it all mean? Who knows – but it’s fun thinking it through.There’s a real sense of drama to the circular-saw guitars, slow builds and cascading basslines, from which spring effervescent tunes and interesting curveballs. Like You’ll Lose is post-punk with a hymnal quality. The weirdly compulsive Music for 3 Drums knowingly references Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians, but sounds as if it was recorded during a visit to a rivet-making factory. Some of their most distorted guitars, drones and screeching metal might prove too challenging for many palates, but it’s refreshing to hear a young band make such a bold racket.Explore more on these topicsPunkIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

No point saying how much I loved her books because everyone does, but Roberto Calasso makes a brilliant point in The Celestial Hunter by pairing “two great moments in the Victorian age” when Darwin “linked human beings to primates” and Potter “distributed human behaviour among a certain number of small domestic and rural animals”.My favourite book growing upThe Guns of Navarone. My first Alistair MacLean, the first of about 20 before I grew out of him at the age of 15. They were thrilling and addictive and it was possible, while reading, to visualise every scene so clearly (helped in part by the scene-enacting photos on the covers of the Fontana editions).The book that changed me as a teenagerI was being changed on a weekly basis by what I was reading from O-levels onwards. I could single out Jane Austen’sEmmaas the starting point, but more important than any particular book or writer was the acquired habit of reading, the solace of interiority.The writer who changed my mindThe big revelations and re-evaluations, respectively, took place in my 20s with Marx and Nietzsche.Freud, by contrast, seemed daft and cultish.The book that made me want to be a writerI never particularly wanted to be one; being a writer was one of many possibilities simmering away and this is the one that happened to come to the boil. Very different from Walt Whitman, who said he was simmering, simmering, and Emerson brought him to the boil.The bookI came back toI’ve rereadThe Names by Don DeLillomore than any other book. It remains a high point, not just in DeLillo’s career but in the history of the postwar novel.The book I could never read againUnder the VolcanobyMalcolm Lowry. I tried a couple of years ago, not because I’d loved it first time around, in my early 20s, but because I hadn’t really liked it then. Second time around it seemed complete tripe. I’m often struck by the consistency of my feelings about books.The book I discovered later in lifeEverything by Elizabeth Taylor. If I had to choose one it would beA Game of Hide and Seekbut her 12 novels and the hefty volume of short stories lit up my mid-60s. Also, the first 12 novels by Anita Brookner, a subtle and quietly pathological writer. When someone writes essentially the same book over and over you’re in receipt of an enacted philosophical consciousness. Having said that, Brookner’s persistent and gradually shrinking sameness led me to pause at about the halfway mark: 12 down, a dozen to go.The book I am currently readingRosamond Lehmann’sThe Weather in the Streets. One of those perennially bubbling-under modern classics – too good for the Championship, unable to sustain a place in the Premier league – which turns out to be way better than some of the canonical stalwarts permanently installed in the top flight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His radical approach earned him the nickname of “Red Pabst”, and when Hitler was elected to power in 1933, Pabst reacted by taking his family to the United States. He intended to emigrate permanently, but what was supposed to have been a brief trip back to Austria to visit his sick mother saw Pabst detained inside the Third Reich for the duration of the second world war. This unfortunate turn of events had a dramatically detrimental effect, not only on Pabst’s immediate situation but on his entire postwar career.Daniel Kehlmann has frequently used historical events as the basis for his fiction, most famously in his breakout 2005 novelMeasuring the World, which draws on the work of the German explorer and geographer Alexander von Humboldt, and more recently in 2017’sTyll, which brings to life the capricious exploits of the legendary jester Till Eulenspiegel during the thirty years’ war. But Kehlmann’s works are so much more than fictionalised biographies, and his new novel The Director is as imaginative and bold in its use of editing as Pabst’s own movies.In the opening chapter Franz Wilzek, the assistant director on Pabst’s lost 1945 film The Molander Case, is being interviewed on TV about his life and career. Wilzek, who is in the early stages of dementia, insists that this elusive film was never shot. The underhum of hostility around the subject from both the interviewer and his producer hints at something unspoken, the memory of an event that Wilzek either cannot or will not revisit. But Franz Wilzek did not really exist, and the film he is said to have worked on was left unfinished.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But nothing in Kehlmann’s world is accidental, and The Director is more interested in the unstable no man’s land between facts and the truth than in any point-by-point rehash of “what really happened”.Following a meeting with Joseph Goebbels that ricochets queasily between horror and comedy, Pabst tries to convince himself that “all he’d had to do was make a hand gesture and say a few words”. Meanwhile, in the decaying rural mansion that has become his prison, his son Jakob – a fictional amalgamation of Pabst’s two real sons, Michael and Peter – is forced by schoolfriends to enter a bottomless cellar where the Pabsts’ black-shirted caretaker Jerzabek scuttles in the cobwebby darkness like a giant spider. Trude Pabst – an actor and aspiring screenwriter before taking on the sacrificial duties of Great Man’s Wife – is caught in a web of her own, increasingly finding solace in alcohol, if only to avoid the society of her Nazi neighbours.Pabst himself seeks refuge in work, taking on subjects that are “German enough” not to offend the censor. The films he creates offer their own coded criticisms of the regime, though in the eyes of the postwar commentariat, his resistance is too covert, too artistic. The novel’s denouement takes us finally to the film set of The Molander Case, relocated to Prague in order to escape the allied bombing. Pabst is determined to finish the film by whatever means necessary, even as more and more of his support staff are forcibly conscripted into the Wehrmacht. He insists to Wilzek that “without us, everything would be the same, no one would be saved, no one would be better off. And the film would not exist.” This argument about the ultimate supremacy of art has been the position Pabst has occupied all along; in the midst of the falling bombs and the fleeing civilians, the teenage soldiers and the advancing Russians, it is an argument that is forced to its utmost and must surely break.Even at this distance of 80 years, the sense of claustrophobia and ultimate folly is all encompassing. One feels an aching sympathy for Pabst, caught in a situation so far beyond his control that “when he tried to breathe in, there was only icy water, and in the distance, he knew, monsters were moving … black and many-armed, at home in the darkness”. It would seem that Kehlmann also is prepared to cut him some slack, saving his bitterest condemnation for Leni Riefenstahl, who really did use concentration camp inmates as extras, and for Alfred Karrasch, the author of the novel on which The Molander Case is based and who, unlike Pabst, really did espouse Nazi ideology in his work. Kehlmann’s characterisation of both is hilarious, merciless and brilliant. The Director has all the darkness, shapeshifting ambiguity and glittering unease of a modern Grimms’ fairytale: it is Kehlmann’s best work yet.The Director by Daniel Kehlmann, translated by Ross Benjamin, is published by Quercus (£22).

Father stares opposite. A red snail / comes out of my mouth.” Queer angst abounds as the speaker moves to England, looking for romantic connection. Boix smooths copious, rarely stalling amounts of lived experience and research into taut, melodic poems that are thick with place: “Humboldt and Bonpland at the Chimbrazo Base / and behind them the highest mountain of Ecuador / rising up, all covered in snow like a tall dessert ice.” The “hidden thread that binds” this book together is the dominant feeling of connection and love for one’s land and others.View image in fullscreenAn Interesting DetailbyKimberly Campanello(Bloomsbury, £10.99)“Details aren’t automatically interesting,” writes Sarah Manguso in her book of aphorisms, 300 Arguments. Campanello’s sentences are comparable to Sarah Manguso’s: fierce, breathless, seducing the ear by rhythmic propulsion and monosyllabic control, and all while teetering on the blurred boundary between short story and prose poem: “It’s no surprise that at Thanksgiving we wish we had never happened upon the world.” She meditates on power, the environment, writing, and questions the supposedly redemptive power of chronic pain: “I continue to await / the perspective this feeling / ought to bring.” The opening gambit reveals a poet disenchanted with – or perhaps no longer satisfied by – poems situated in the stratosphere, amid “church” or “cathedral bells” ringing, nor in the dark, indescribable mystery that is “beneath the sea”. Campanello’s poetics are startlingly inventive, even as she admits “books don’t know what’s inside their covers, or they don’t care”. This is a work to care about.View image in fullscreenAutobiography of DeathbyKim Hyesoon, translated byDon Mee Choi(And Other Stories, £14.99)“In Korea, we believe that when someone dies, the spirit of the dead journeys to an intermediate space that is neither death nor life for 49 days.” Autobiography of Death enacts this limbo over 49 cinematic poems that counterpoint movement and action with empty inertness, a dramatisation of time’s fundamental dichotomy. “You head toward the life you won’t be living,” writes Kim on day one; and then, as if mortality’s meditation spiralled only in on itself, on day 28 “You are born inside death / (echoes 49 times)”. Black-and-white images, by turns cartoonish and macabre, created by the poet’s daughter, Fi Jae Lee, add a buoyant and surreal ghastliness.View image in fullscreenGoonieby Michael Mullen(Corsair, £10.99)Whether he is writing in Scots or standard English, Mullen’s descriptive-imaginative faculties are captivating and painterly, well beyond what one would expect of a debut. Listen to the beginning of Pish-the-beds: “Dragon-budded, rhubarb-stalked / juicy shoots propping up / the tapered mane, serrated sunburst.” Goonie’s music is consistently and hypnotically lush in an unabashed celebration of queerness, represented here through the digital culture of apps and social settings such as Pride and house parties. This stunning collection sings itself: “A red flower lacerated on the still-white / night villa, a bleed-creep / of frills (quals flors?) / I wandered the dusk / dust-feral & chaffing (what flower?) / my eyes stalking the black sweep of sea / on the promenade / where sure-boned boys / will know what to do with me.” One to watch.The Age of Olive TreesbyHaia Mohammed(Out-Spoken Press, £8)“My voice is louder than any bomb / my spirit deeper than any womb,” writes Gazan poet Mohammed in a pamphlet of candid honesty and bravery, documenting the physical and spiritual life of a poet threatened with death on a daily basis as a result of the Israeli offensive in Gaza. Her siblings are a balm, “the warmth / that shields from life’s coldness”. Mohammed describes a disrupted life: “War taught me. I was raised by it once again.” Through the pained voice of her poems, she poses an imperative to the world that she knows is watching: “If you’re going to defy, / don’t do it halfheartedly. Don’t walk in, / jump!” These are poems of survival and endurance: “Honestly the people of Gaza don’t need to study history / they live it.”Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Just talking to a cat could get you hanged, strangled or burned. We go behind the scenes of an outdoor dance triple-bill at an ancient burial siteLyndsey WinshipFri 6 Jun 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 11.17 EDTShareMont Orgueil is a medieval castle perched on the eastern coast of Jersey with beautiful views out over the shimmering sea. On a good day, you might even catch a glimpse of France. But the view won’t have been much consolation to those who were imprisoned here – locked up for a year and a day back in the 16th and 17th centuries – because they were accused of witchcraft. Such was the hunger for trying witches here that historian William Monter has called theChannel Islands“the witch-hunting capital of Atlantic Europe”.Jersey’s witchy history first caught the imagination of Carolyn Rose Ramsay when she worked as a tour guide on the island. A Canadian native and former dancer for major ballet companies in Europe and the Americas, Ramsay soaked up local myths such as the “witch ledge”, built on the side of chimneys so that anyone on a passing broomstick would rest there rather than come down your chimney. She visited Rocqueberg Point, known as Witches’ Rock, where you can supposedly see the footprints of dancing sorceresses. But then she came across the grimmer real-life history of the trials.View image in fullscreen‘Mass hysteria’ … a 1678 line engraving of the hanging of witches.Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/AlamyIn 2022, she set up Ballet d’Jèrri, Jersey’s own contemporary ballet company, and the stories of witches real and imagined, celebrated and persecuted, have inspired its new triple bill, with premieres from three female choreographers: Vidya Patel, Katya Bourvis and Cecilia Lisa Eliceche. It will be performed outdoors, against the atmospheric backdrop of La Hougue Bie, a neolithic burial site, or “passage tomb”, which is one of the oldest buildings in the world.When I arrive at the company’s studio at the Jersey Opera House in St Helier, the dancers are rehearsing with choreographer Eliceche, who is clearly enjoying herself. “Yes! I love that,” she calls out, beaming, as the dancers pull off a tricky warp and weft sequence. She shows me some of the props they’ve been using. “We have a witch’s hat!” she exclaims, holding out a beautiful straw creation with a long, pointed crown which she brought from her home in Salvador, Brazil.Women were accused, tried, tortured and murdered for supposed transgressionsEliceche has always loved tales of witches. Her mother’s family come from Zugarramurdi in Spain’s Basque Country, a supposed hotbed of witchcraft in the early 1600s, and she would visit the witches’ caves there. A self-described “experimental” choreographer, Eliceche has drawn on those memories to make her piece, alongside her own spiritual practice of Haitian vodou, tying in stories of present-day persecution, especially of the Mapuche women on the border of Chile and Argentina near where she was born, who have been put on trial for defending Indigenous land rights. Eliceche is having their names embroidered on to the dancers’ costumes.She feels this project was made for her, which is funny because that’s exactly what Bourvis says when we speak: “I feel like all the work I’ve been doing was preparation for this!” Many women today are enticed by the sense of magic, ritual, feminine power and connection to the natural world that witchcraft in its various forms offers. Inevitably, the truth of Jersey’s witch trials is more grisly. In parallel with what was happening across Europe in a period of of religious fervour, women were accused, tried, tortured and murdered for supposed transgressions.View image in fullscreen‘Intuition and sisterhood’ … Katya Bourvis’s Flux.Photograph: Rebecca Le BrunAt the Jersey Archive, collections director Linda Romeril carefully places a bound volume of 16th-century court records on a pillow in front of us, all delicate pages and spidery calligraphy. She translates from the French the case of Symon Vauldin, accused in 1591 of having discourse with the devil in the form of a crow and a cat. “It says he’s confessed to the crime of witchcraft and he will be hanged and his body burned and reduced to cinders,” says Romeril. This is the first surprise to me. Not all the accused were women – about 20% were men like Vauldin, who was married with four children.Many women were accused of diabolical acts, from casting evil spells to causing the deaths of humans and animals. From the scant surviving information, Romeril tries to put together a picture of who these women were. Some were from respectable families, with husbands and children. One, Andree Tourgis, was accused of killing her daughter’s illegitimate child and sentenced to death in 1608. Romeril wonders what the real story was: she may have been some sort of midwife – so was this a stillbirth or cot death, or even an illegal abortion?For having an affair, she was sentenced to be whipped ‘from the courthouse to the shore till the blood comes’In a small island community, there was also the possibility of family feuds, local disputes and jealousies being involved. And trials often coincided with periods of turmoil, such as the spread of plague in the late 1500s. Those accused of witchcraft may have practised some kind of alternative medicine, such as Jeanne Le Vesconte, who was accused of “infecting some and curing others”. They executed her nonetheless. Public hangings took place in what is now the Royal Square. “Hanged and strangled,” say some of the records.By the mid-1600s, the charges were more predictable. Elizabeth Grandin was accused of leading a life that was “lustful, wicked and scandalous” and of having an illegitimate daughter to boot, while Guillemette du Vaistain had an affair with her brother-in-law. These women could have been tried for a moral crime in an ecclesiastical court, but adding witchcraft meant a potentially harsher sentence. What Bourvis wanted to explore in her piece, Flux, was the archetype of the witch as a symbol of “everything that’s not allowed. She represents messiness and sexuality and desire, but also intuition and wisdom and sisterhood”.View image in fullscreen‘They may not be innocent of other crimes’ … prisoners at Mont Orgueil Castle.Photograph: Malcolm Walker/AlamyFlux is about womanhood and femininity, but also societal systems, “history continuing to repeat itself – and the way we are conditioned to behave because that’s the only way to survive”. Bourvis could be talking about any number of current social or geopolitical situations when she says: “The duality of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ creates this mass hysteria and insecurity, causing us to behave in the most harmful and heartless ways.”Dr Adam Perchard, dramaturg on Ballet d’Jèrri’s production, also points to the pertinence of the theme: “Fear and suspicion of the other, the patriarchy trying to control the masses – is that the 16th century or is it the present day?” Meanwhile, Ramsay talks about today’s social media witch-hunts and how little it takes for people to pile on, “to join in with their pitchforks”.Perchard is a writer-performer-cabaret artist and Jersey native who got hooked on the island’s witch trial history after hearing stories of resistance: of women who found loopholes in the law; refused to submit to the jury of 24 landowning men who would judge them; or endured their stay in Mont Orgueil without confessing, despite probably being tortured. (While Jersey has no evidence of the torture, in neighbouring Guernsey it is written into the court records: “Confessed under torture.”) Perchard cites the example of Du Vaistain, who did have her punishment downgraded. “But it wasn’t such a happy ending,” he says, “since she was sentenced ‘to be whipped all the way from the courthouse to the shore till the blood comes’. Then she’s banished for ever. But at least she had her life.”View image in fullscreenMont Orgueil Castle on Jersey, where suspected witches were imprisoned and tortured.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyFrom the 1560s to the 1660s, there were 65 trials, with 33 leading to execution. Others of the accused were banished, some died before trial, a handful were acquitted, and the fates of a few are unknown. It’s not a huge number across a century, but significant for a population of only 10,000. There are a lot of gaps in the records, which is partly why it’s such a fruitful topic for art: there is room for interpretation. We can’t assume that everyone was entirely innocent, says Romeril. “They’re all innocent of witchcraft, but they might not be innocent of other crimes. It’s just not black and white.”After the 1660s, with the rise of the Enlightenment in Europe, the witch trials came to an end in Jersey, although by then the idea had taken hold in America. The Salem witch trials were in 1692 and 1693. These days witchcraft has a more benign reputation. Patel found herself drawn to the witch’s connection to earth, nature and the seasons – themes she often uses in her own choreography, which is based in the Indian classical form kathak. She describes the piece she has made for Ballet d’Jèrri, Mark Our Ashes, as “a reimagined ritual” honouring the people who lost their lives. Perchard introduced Patel to some of Jersey’s flourishing community of modern-day witches, with whom they’ve been hanging out. “I’ve been getting my witch on!” says Perchard, who goes on to recount a “divination through cocktails” meeting. “Everybody was getting out their rose flowers preserved in vodka under an Aquarius moon. And by the time we tried them all, we never got round to any divination.”The sheer enthusiasm for the subject from the three choreographers proves that the figure of the witch captures imaginations still. Back at Mont Orgueil Castle, there is a decorative metal screen that pays tribute to the victims of the trials. You turn a handle and its mechanical parts creak into life. A small model of a witch on a broomstick twirls in jerky circles. The shrieking of the metal sounds just like a gleeful cackle.Ballet d’Jèrri: Witch Trials is at La Hougue Bie, Jersey, until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceWitchcraftJerseyChannel IslandsSexualityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fastidiousness of the presentation sits at odds with the inherent violence of the material; so do the expressions on most of the sheep’s faces, which range from serene to uncanny smiles.As if to dispel any false sense of quietude, the room’s lighting periodically switches to nightmarish red.This is We threw them down the rocks where they had thrown the sheep, an installation by Trawulwuy artist Nathan Maynard, part of this year’sDark Mofofestival – the first after the often controversial festival took a year off in favour of a “period of renewal”.View image in fullscreen‘Some entered the basement, saw the grisly cargo, and turned around and exited.’Photograph: Jesse HunnifordMaynard’s exhibition was the first announcement for the festival’s return, and it drew some scepticism from members of the local Tasmanian Aboriginal community at the time. When it was announced via ateaser postfeaturing the quote “What did you do with the bodies? – George Augustus Robinson, 1830”, Tasmanian Aboriginal heritage officer Fiona Hamilton criticised Dark Mofo’s “gory fascination with the pain of our people”. Academic Greg Lehman, a descendant of the Trawulwuy people of north-east Tasmania, compared the “ugly and tone-deaf” marketing of the project to the festival’s widely criticised 2021 commission by Spanish artist Santiago Sierra, who called for the donation of blood by First Nations people, in which to soak a union jack flag.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe festival cancelled Sierra’s work and apologised for the commission and their marketing of it, but its appetite for confronting – and gory – work is unabated.Visitors enter the space via a nondescript doorway on Collins Street marked by a red cross; an invigilator at the entrance warns them that the artwork “may or may not be confronting”.He’s been hanged, stabbed and cut in galleries – now artist Carlos Martiel is being buried aliveRead moreThere’s no explanatory text or artist statement, and the artist agreed to only one interview, with the Indigenous-run paper Koori Mail – and on Thursday evening, the festival’s opening night, visitors navigated the installation with varying levels of bemusement. Some entered the basement, saw the grisly cargo, and turned around and exited; others got their phones out and took pictures.When questioned by attenders, an invigilator at the room’s entrance gamely attempted to encapsulate the dark history that inspired the work, and the ongoing issues that motivated Maynard to create it.View image in fullscreen‘The presentation of the sheep’s heads in specimen jars points to a racist violence: the theft and trade of First Nations human remains, which occurred throughout Australia.’Photograph: Jesse Hunniford“We threw them down the rocks where they had thrown the sheep” is a quote from the journals of George Augustus Robinson, Tasmania’s “Chief Protector of Aborigines” from 1839 to 1849. Robinson was recounting an anecdote told to him with “perfect indifference” by a perpetrator of one of the state’s worst massacres: on 10 February 1828, four convict shepherds ambushed a group of Aboriginals at Cape Grim, in the island’s north-west, shooting and driving about 30 of them off a 60-metre cliff, supposedly in retaliation for the destruction of about the same number of sheep. In his journal, Robinson wrote that he had issued the perpetrators a warning.The Cape Grim massacre is one of many that took place in Lutruwita/Tasmania during a state-orchestrated genocidal campaign against the island’s First Peoples known as the Black War (1824-1832).

The campaign for their repatriation has been running since the 1970s.Meanwhile, just 200 metres from the basement where Maynard’s installation is held stands a statue of former governor Sir John Franklin, who is known to have collected the skulls of Aboriginal people.For visitors unaware of this context, the only clue is an audio track that plays in the corridor leading to the basement, featuring two voices – one Maynard’s – expressing condemnation, anger and distress over the historical and continuing treatment of ancestral remains. It’s hard to hear these voices clearly, but among the lines that cut through is the indelible exhortation: “Imagine it was your mother or your grandmother who was collecting dust in a museum basement!”Maynard told the Koori Mail he hoped the installation would educate non-Indigenous people on Tasmania’s violent past. It remains to be seen whether the work’s enigmatic presentation will have the desired effect.We threw them down the rocks where they had thrown the sheepby Nathan Maynard can be seen at Coogan’s Building (79 Collins St), Hobart, on Saturday 7 June from 6pm-10pm; Sunday 8 June from 4pm-10pm; 12-14 June from 6pm-10pm; Sunday 15 June from 4pm-10pm, as part of Dark Mofo festival.Explore more on these topicsCultureDark MofoArtInstallationIndigenous AustraliansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s there in the harness that allows deaf and hearing-impaired gig-goers to feel music as vibrations on their chest. It’s there in the vibrant clothes. It’s there – certainly – in the all-purpose hands-free vibrator (yes, really). But it’s not just the individual items that exude this joy. It’s the themes of community action and care that show up again and again, and the reframing of the very concept of disability – from the “medical problem” society sees to the proud identity we know it to be.This show, which takes a wide-ranging look at how disabled people have fashioned the world to better represent ourselves and better suit our needs, is divided into three parts: Visibility, Tools and Living. In Visibility, we see the evolution of accessible fashion from sterile to cool, and how disabled people have used photography to reclaim our images and bodies. In Tools, we see how disabled people have adapted everything from kitchen utensils to computers to allow us to get things done. And in Living, we see how we have demanded cultural and architectural change so that we can participate in society as equals.View image in fullscreenTools … disabled people have adapted everything from kitchen utensils to computers to allow us to get things done.Photograph: Peter KelleherThe exhibition does a great job of including the full range of impairments disabled people have. There’s a bike with a built-in leg brace and a video explaining the concept of deaf space (an architectural idea about how spaces can be designed to support lip-reading and the use of BSL). There’s a self-tightening shoe and the original fidget-spinner, designed to help autistic and other neurodivergent people.In this way, the exhibition goes far beyond the tired assumption that access means a ramp. It is also great to see disability-led design from all areas of life – not just care and housing, but also gaming, socialising, working, travelling, urban-planning and more. So often disability is treated as a monolithic experience, but the V&A is showing it in all its diverse, multifaceted glory.The exhibition also has a deliberate focus on design not onlyfordisabled people butbydisabled people. In a world in which people often make assumptions about our needs, and presume to speak on our behalf, this is very welcome. Many of the projects and products featured are DIY inventions, moulded out of necessity by disabled people who weren’t able to buy the tools they needed. Others are the work of grassroots organising groups, or individual disabled people leveraging their jobs at big companies to create change.View image in fullscreenSqueeze Chair (chaise longue), by artist Wendy Jacob, embraces the sitter between two mohair arms, providing comforting sensory feedback.Photograph: Ted DiamondTaken together, these items and their stories serve as a powerful reminder of disabled people’s often-overlooked agency, and a refutation of the idea that we are merely the recipients of help. We can and do help ourselves. As Tristram Hunt, the former Labour MP who is now the V&A’s director, emphasised at the exhibition’s launch, the idea is for it to embody the famous disability rights slogan: “Nothing about us without us.” It truly does.This slogan applies politically as well as culturally. And what I like most about the exhibition is that it does not shy away from the inherently political nature of disability. Many objects on display are directly linked to the long fight for disability rights: one of the first things you see is a T-shirt emblazoned with the “Piss on Pity” slogan from the 1990 Block Telethon campaign. There are photos of disabled people stopping buses during the Campaign for Accessible Transport, as well as pieces related to the more recent (and ongoing) cuts to disability benefits.View image in fullscreenInnovation … Xbox Adaptive Controller, developed by Microsoft.Photograph: V&A Museum, LondonBut beyond referencing these discrete historical events, the exhibition also recognises that existing, thriving and finding joy as a disabled person in an ableist world is a political – often radical – act. That radicalism is reinforced by the show’s emphasis on the intersection between disability and other marginalised identities, with pieces linked to the Black Panthers and queer culture. This will feel intimately familiar to many disabled visitors, for whom it will be lovely to see their lived experiences reflected at a prestigious arts institution, but will hopefully provide a new perspective for nondisabled viewers, many of whom will never have seen disability and disabled lives presented in this way.That’s what makesDesign andDisabilityso good. It takes what disabled people know to be true – that we are creative, that we are innovators, that our exclusion comes from a world not built for us, that our lives are political – and makes those ideas interesting and accessible for everyone. Disability culture is vibrant and fun, boundary-breaking and world-shaping. So is this exhibition.Design and Disability is at the V&A, London, from Saturday until 15 February 2026Explore more on these topicsDesignDisabilityV&AMuseumsreviewsShareReuse this content"

About 9,000 sweaty people crammed Under the K Bridge (yes, it’s literally under the Kosciuszko Bridge) on the 86F day to celebrate the release of the hardcore band’snew album, Never Enough.And there was plenty to celebrate for the Baltimore-based group, who have found themselves on the edge of the mainstream. Following their2021 album Glow On, where frontmanBrendan Yatestraded in some screaming for singing over a blend of heavy riffs, soul and even dream pop, Turnstile has picked up three Grammy nominations, opened for Blink-182, received the aforementioned Charli xcx shoutout at Coachella and, this past week, found themselves onJimmy Fallon’s Tonight Showto promote Never Enough.Their new album takes Glow On’s blueprint and expands on it with hints of the Police, jazzy flutes, and guest spots from Hayley Williams and Dev Hynes, but Turnstile is still a hardcore band at heart. The album release concert was a chaotic, wild affair – the kind of show where you can’t keep both feet on the ground at the same time (and if you do, you might end up losing your shoe, like the man next to me did).Turnstile: Never Enough review – flute solos and formidable tunes from hardcore punk’s great crossover bandRead moreThey opened with the title track, Never Enough, and even though the single had been released only weeks earlier, nearly every person in the audience sang it back to Yates as loudly as possible – ready to celebrate a new album and new era. The band wasted no time quickly launching into TLC (Turnstile Love Connection), and you could feel the energy reverberating off the bridge above the stage. The crowd exploded, feeding off Yates’s energy as he bounced around the stage, as fan after fan crowd-surfed toward the stage, limbs flailing everywhere.The end-to-end mosh pit didn’t let up for the 23-song set, the crowd hungry for more after each song. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief whenever a slight breeze would pass through the tightly packed crowd, only to quickly return to dancing, moshing and crowd surfing.The setlist was unsurprisingly heavy on Glow On, with Mystery and Holiday getting some of the biggest reactions from the crowd. Yates would hold the mic stand in the air, no need to sing, as the crowd was doing it loudly enough for him. Despite Glow On’s dominance, the band also pulled out some older cuts that had the crowd shouting in excitement, including 7 off of 2013’s Step 2 Rhythm.One of the few moments Yates spoke to the audience was to introduce I Care, which the band was performing for a live audience for the first time. It was clear a good chunk of the crowd saw their Fallon performance – or were just quick to pick up the simple chorus – repeating the hook back to him. Despite the crushingly emo lyrics of heartbreak (“But do you really want to fall apart? / And do you really want to break my heart in two?”), they were all dancing to the 80s-style pop groove.Beyoncé review – a hugely enjoyable concert that adds a ferocious potency to Cowboy CarterRead moreThe biggest surprise of the night came near the end of the show, as Williams kick-danced her way to the center of the stage in bright red boots to join the band for Seein’ Stars. While you can barely make her out on the studio version, Williams took center stage at Under the K Bridge, belting out the song as Yates bounced closer to the back of the stage. There’s no denying the cars on the bridge above must have heard the crowd’s reaction as the two sang the chorus together, arm in arm.The night ended with one of the first singles off Never Enough, Birds. The heavy guitar rhythm – reminiscent of No Doubt’s Hella Good – was the perfect endnote to a powerful show. As their previous album’s song No Surprise puts it: “You really gotta see it live to get it.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPunkNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

The weathermen are predicting a thunderstorm, the Tottenham Hotspur ground is noticeably lacking a roof, and she’s no sooner arrived onstage than she’s suggesting that the prospect of rain “ain’t gonna stop the party”.The thunderstorm never comes, but a cynic might suggest the glowering skies, and a sudden downpour – through which the singer will be required to fly on a giant neon-lit horseshoe – act as a kind of metaphor for the fortunes of the Cowboy Carter tour. It’s thus far attracted the usual laudatory reviews – such is the blanket critical acclaim for everything Beyoncé does, you rather get the feeling that were she spotted using a public convenience, there would be a spate of articles claiming she’d singlehandedly redefined going to the lavatory – but it has also been attended by news reports suggesting all is not well. There is talk of sluggish ticket sales and demands for refunds from fans who shelled out full whack for seats on release, only to see them going for vastly reduced prices as the gigs drew nearer. One headline-grabbing complaint noted that tickets for her LA show were now “cheaper than a McDonald’s Minecraft meal”.Tonight, Spurs’ stadium is visibly not sold out. Perhaps that has something to do with her country-inflected album of the same name. It certainly proved its point about its author’s ability to master any musical style she set her mind to – it made her the first Black woman both to have a No 1 album on the US country charts and win a Grammy for best country album – but its actual sales were about half those of its predecessor, 2022’s house music-themed Renaissance.View image in fullscreen‘Events in America since Cowboy Carter’s release have cast its contents in a noticeably different light: they sound less like an interesting stylistic detour and more like an act of protest.’Photograph: Parkwood Entertainment/PAWhatever you paid for your tickets, you do get an awful lot of Cowboy Carter for your money. The album’s contents take up almost half the set; the big hits, when they come, arrive in truncated form, as if she feels obliged to perform them and is keen to get them out of the way: Crazy In Love, If I Were A Boy, Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It).And yet, that doesn’t really matter. Events in America since Cowboy Carter’s release have cast its contents in a noticeably different light: they sound less like an interesting stylistic detour and more like an act of protest, particularly given that Donald Trump recently called Beyoncé’s support of Kamala Harris in the 2024 election “illegal”,making the evidence-free claimshe’d received $11m to appear at a rally. For all the show’s kitschy Nashville imagery – you’re never far away from a pair of leather chaps, or a Stetson, a neon bar sign or a flying pink Cadillac - Beyoncé is clearly keen to frame them that way. Early on, she sings The Star Spangled Banner along to Jimi Hendrix’s legendary feedback-strafed rendition of America’s national anthem from the 1969 Woodstock festival, while the screens behind her flash up messages: NEVER ASK FOR SOMETHING THAT ALREADY BELONGS TO YOU; HISTORY CAN’T BE ERASED, before tearing into a ferocious version of Ya Ya. Later, her performance is interrupted by the sound of Gil Scott-Heron’s The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, one of a series of interpolations that delve deep into African American musical history: Chuck Berry and Sister Rosetta Tharpe stare down from the screens; Leadbelly’s Looky Looky Yonder booms ominously from the speakers.‘Beyoncé and Solange tell me off all the time’: Tina Knowles on raising superstars, surviving cancer and growing up under segregationRead moreThe contextualising works, adding an extra potency to a performance that’s already pretty potent by default, Beyoncé’s ability to sing and dance up a storm being a given. If an extended section of acoustic ballads causes the excitement level to dip a little – Protector features a cameo appearance from her seven-year-old daughter, Rumi – it’s very swiftly restored. She performs Dolly Parton’s Jolene as if it’s a prelude to murder rather than a plea, and the songs from Renaissance – Thique, Cuff It, Alien Superstar – take on a punishing, relentless edge in their live incarnations.You don’t have to buy into some of the more hysterical claims made on Beyoncé’s behalf by her most ardent supporters to find the show variously moving, powerful, relevant and hugely enjoyable, to think it casts the material from her most recent album in a different light and lends it more potency in the process - or, indeed, to think that those who chose to skip on buying tickets might have missed out.Beyoncé’sCowboy Cartercontinues in London until 16 JuneExplore more on these topicsBeyoncéLondonreviewsShareReuse this content"

He reflects on his leap from dance to visual art and why he feels snubbed by BritainFri 6 Jun 2025 05.45 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 10.29 EDTShareAgang of young dancers, their black costumes offset by colourful hats, cascade down the sloping roof of Oslo’s opera house for a jubilant routine to a Prince song by the waterfront. The building’s huge glass facade has become an unlikely stage for sculptures, digitally scanned from dancers’ bodies, positioned as if they are plunging into the building like the nearby bathers in the fjord. Inside, there’s an eclectic bill of ballets including one inspired bya paintingfrom the Edvard Munch museum next door. In the wings of the theatre is an installation drawing on the Buddhist Zen symbol ensō. The studio space is screening short films veering from slapstick to the profound.But this sprawling festival, spanning more than two weeks and then partially touring, has a singular focus. These are all works by Jiří Kylián, the Czech choreographer-cum-renaissance man, who in one pre-show discussion declares himself “the happiest boy in the world”. There has never been such a celebration of his work and, he suggests with wry self-effacement, there will probably never be another.When we meet for coffee, Kylián elaborates on the opportunity given to him by Ingrid Lorentzen who, as artistic director of the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, enabled the festival. “I’m not a spring chicken,” he says. “I’m 78 and I know that the end of life is nearing. To be able, at my age, to have a major retrospective, but also show new things that I’ve created specifically for this festival, is huge.” After a choreographic career spanning around 100 pieces (a quarter of them now in the Norwegian Ballet’s repertory), it has brought a degree of affirmation, he says. “I must have done something right! I’m not a particularly confident person. It might look like I am, but I’m not really.”View image in fullscreenPlunge … Moving Still, an installation for the Kylián festival at Oslo Opera House.Photograph: Ilja C HendelWith an impish smile, he adds: “If I had to write reviews about my work, you would not want to read them. I don’t get so easily frightened by critics because I’m my worst critic.” There’s a pause before reconsidering: “My mother was, actually …” He trails off and winces in mock horror at her feedback: “If you do something like that one more time, I will disown you!”However, it was Markéta Kyliánová – a former child star – who directly inspired her son. “She was a Shirley Temple. A 10-year-old who sold out performances, dancing by herself, with her father accompanying on piano. So it must be somewhere in the genes.” Growing up in Prague, Kylián was swept away by the magic of circus acrobats, became a dancer and began to choreograph. Britain played a key part in his success. In the mid-60s,Jennie Lee– the first minister for the arts in Harold Wilson’s government – visited the Prague conservatoire and saw one of his earliest works. Kylián remembers her saying to him: “I can see that you do not only have it in your legs, but also in your head.”A scholarship at the Royal Ballet School was arranged. “I met Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, I had the time of my life,” he remembers of his stint in London. John Cranko invited him to work with the Stuttgart Ballet and then Kylián led Nederlands Dans Theater as artistic director from 1975 until 1999, continuing to choreograph for the company until 2009.View image in fullscreenStorm of feet … Forgotten Land.Photograph: Jörg WiesnerBut this “Praguer” who has long lived in the Hague is being feted in Oslo. “I was introduced to this country by a composer,Arne Nordheim, who wrote music for me,” he says. The Norwegian Ballet has been staging Kylián’s work for almost 40 years. Oslo’s long-awaited opera house opened in 2008 with his ballet programme. “There is no other house in the world” that could put on this festival’s installations alongside the performances, he says.Those sculptures bisected by the glass facade, modelled on eight of his dancers and rendered at 138%, provide another way to invite new audiences into this most playful of opera buildings whose openly accessible roof is a popular vantage point. The figures’ positioning, part inside and part outside, brings to mind the uprooted, upside-down tree that is suspended above the stage in Kylián’s Wings of Wax (1997) and continues his interest in transitional states. His choreography frequently gives dancers a winged position like resting marionettes – as in Petite Mort (1991), their heads bowed, shoulders hunched and elbows out, evoking a burden but also an imminent launch to liberation. Entitled Wings of Time, the festival is promoted with aposter of Kyliánas if taking flight, with one arm raised alongside its reflection, the image mirroring an airborne gull in the distance. “We are on the way constantly,” he says of this impulse in his work. “I say ‘now’,” he pauses, “and it’s already in the past.”View image in fullscreenUprooted … Wings of Wax.Photograph: Erik BergThe other installations on display evoke not just Kylián choreography but his previous productions’ set designs. In the meditative, healing Ensō, set to Arvo Pärt’s Spiegel im Spiegel, a mirror rotates above a calligraphic circle on the floor, casting shadows as well as a latticed light, the mirror rippling with the foaming crash of a wave that recalls the silvery wreckage of John Macfarlane’s set for Forgotten Land (1981). It is that piece, opening with the sound of the wind and featuring a storm of dancers’ feet and elemental percussion, that draws on the century-old Munch painting TheDanceof Life. Munch’s depiction of a woman at three ages – enigmatically wistful in youth, solemn in middle age, eventually mournful – gave Kylián goosebumps when he first saw it. “Munch was a troubled soul – that kind of fight with the canvas and with your own problems, it beams out of the paintings,” he says. “I tried to portray it as well as I could with Benjamin Britten’s music.”The exhibition’s use of backstage areas is fitting for a choreographer who has often challenged notions of where the playing space – and even a production itself – starts and finishes. No More Play (1988), uncannily set to Anton Webern, finds a dancer rolling across the very edge of the stage, arms spiralling into the orchestra pit, and ends with the full cast dangling there. Bella Figura (1995) begins when the audience are still finding their seats as dancers rehearse their moves, Kylián taking the stage to make the odd tweak. The performance gives a supporting role of sorts to the theatre’s layered curtains which in one illusion seem to hold a dancer in mid-air and are used for an effect akin to an iris film technique, framing certain dancers and obscuring others. Kylián plays with other silent cinema tricks in a quirky screen programme featuring his long-term partner, the dancer Sabine Kupferberg, who makes a superb bowler-hatted clown in the short film Between Entrance and Exit from 2013. (That title is telling for a choreographer who loves to bring dancers on in eye-catching ways, such as under billowing sheets.)Amid his elegantly fluid explorations of time and space, and his dancers’ sensitive partnering, Kylián can rarely resist a comic moment or trompe l’oeil gag such as the freestanding dresses with a mind of their own in Petite Mort. He tells me about his joy at recently spottingJohn Cleesein an Oslo restaurant. “I went to him and said, ‘Dr Livingstone, I presume?’” Cleese immediately played along. “‘Yes, absolutely!’” Kylián told him: “I’m a choreographer and I was inspired by your Ministry of Silly Walks.” Is that really the case? “Of course! The Czechs have a pretty good sense of humour. They’re really pretty crazy.”View image in fullscreenJubilant cascade … Chapeau is performed as a flashmob.Photograph: Ilja C HendelHis own sense of humour remains intact when we discuss his “more than catastrophic” reception from London’s dance world. That auspicious-seeming arrival in the 1960s was followed by “totally negligible” representation of his works and what he calls the “Royal snub” in the years since his choreographic debut at Covent Garden. In 2022, Forgotten Land wasstaged by Birmingham Royal Balletand his piece Gods and Dogs was performed in a mixed bill by NDT at Sadler’s Wells. But he picks up his tablet and shows a calendar of upcoming Kylián productions. “This is where they are doing my ballets in the world.” Dates come up for South Korea, Poland, the US, Albania … “Anywhere except Great Britain! I even got the Laurence Olivier award [for outstanding achievement in dance with NDT in 2000]. That didn’t do the job.” Maybe it’s not for him to answer but does he know why? He leans over and whispers: “I have no idea!”If Kylián is his own fiercest critic then the late Clement Crisp of the Financial Times came a close second. “I don’t mind to be criticised, but I don’t like to be insulted particularly,” he says of Crisp’s vociferous reviews, then paraphrases the kind of writeup he used to receive in London. “The first piece was by Ashton, it was like that and like that. The second piece was by Kylián, we don’t need to talk about it. And the third one was by Balanchine, it was great.”How did he find running NDT for such a long stretch? The company rocketed under his leadership but balancing the roles of choreographer and artistic director was surely draining. “It’s really rough. I’d want to do a piece for six dancers and I had 32 dancers in the company. You know what happened? Six happy people and 26 unhappy people. You have to cope with it.”As well as choreography, he has often provided his own design concepts including, unusually, for the lighting. “A terrible ballet well lit is better than a great ballet badly lit,” he says. “I work very closely with the lighting designers and set designers and composers. I’m one of those who sticks his finger in!” He assesses one of the pieces revived in Oslo. “The choreography is old, OK, it has maybe a bit of an old-fashioned touch. But it fits completely with the music, the choreography and the stage design. If you like it or not is another story. But it fits. It’s made of one mould.”His approach to the music has changed over the course of his career. “When I was young, I got inspired by a piece of music and tried to do steps as closely to it as possible. But later that wasn’t enough. I have things to say myself.” He did not seek to reflect “what the music is already saying” but rather add another layer. Later on, composers would create specifically for him. “What I do usually is take an existing piece, something extraordinarily beautiful by Beethoven or Mozart or baroque. And then give it to a composer and he recomposes it. I like this bridge between the past and the contemporary.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m one of those who sticks his finger in!’ … Gods and Dogs.Photograph: Erik BergIn Chapeau, the piece performed as a flashmob by the dance students tumbling down the opera house roof, he doffs his hat to Prince. “I love him. Genius. You know, he was in Holland and I was too shy to approach him and then he died a year or so after.” Chapeau was created for the silver jubilee of the hat-lovingQueen Beatrixof the Netherlands, where Kylián still resides. He and Kupferberg have been shooting a film on the Dutch island of Terschelling and he sees his future in such projects and visual art rather than creating new work for the stage. “I’m really getting on. The energy is not enough.”We consider the chicken-or-egg question about the choreographer’s job of matching music and movement. Kylián recalls creating a duet for Whereabouts Unknown (1993) to be used with Charles Ives’s piece Unanswered Question. “I choreographed it on a Sunday and did the whole six minutes in one day. Then I said, OK, let’s try it with the music now. It fit like a glove: they stopped dancing exactly at the end of the music. Sometimes I really don’t know how or why things happen. I look at it and think, I’m not sure if it’s by me.”He gives me a slightly bashful look about this mysterious, even mystical process which he manages to suggest with both modesty and curiosity. “I felt like it was saidthroughme.”Kylián festival: Wings of Timeis at Oslo Opera House until 14 June. Then touring 18-22 June. Chris Wiegand’s trip was provided by the festival.Explore more on these topicsDanceTheatreNorwayEuropeSculptureArtMonty PythoninterviewsShareReuse this content"

This time it will be auctioned by Sotheby’s with an estimated value of £200,000-300,000.“We are as certain as it’s possible to be that this painting is by Turner,” said Julian Gascoigne of Sotheby’s. The painting had been examined by “all the leading Turner scholars alive today who unanimously endorsed the attribution”.As well as the recently revealed signature, there were “clear references to a painting of this subject” in obituaries of Turner and in early literature on the artist in the years after his death in 1851.But in the second half of the 19th century, “a series of mistakes were made, which were repeated and compounded, with it described as a watercolour”, said Gascoigne. It was omitted from the first complete resume of Turner’s work published in 1901, and “over the course of the 20th century, it was forgotten about as just another relatively minor early watercolour”.The person who bought the painting last year initially thought it may have been the work of Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg, a French émigré painter living inLondonwhose studio Turner frequently visited. De Loutherbourg’s wife, suspicious that Turner was intent on appropriating her husband’s painting technique, eventually threw him out.The Rising Squall, Hot Wells, from St Vincent’s Rock, Bristol was the first oil painting exhibited by Turner, at the Royal Academy in 1793, the year after it was painted.View image in fullscreenThe Rising Squall, Hot Wells, from St. Vincent’s Rock, Bristol.Photograph: Sotheby’sBased on a drawing in his sketchbook and a watercolour, both held by Tate Britain, it depicts Hot Wells House in Bristol seen from the east bank of the River Avon, now the site of the Clifton suspension bridge, amid swirling storm clouds and tempestuous waters. Hot Wells was a hot spring and spa that was a popular attraction in GeorgianEngland.The painting was first acquired by the Rev Robert Nixon, a customer at Turner’s father’s barbershop who befriended and encouraged the young artist. Nixon was among the first to urge Turner to paint with oils.“It gives us a real insight into the ambition that Turner was clearly exhibiting at this early stage of his career, and shows a level of competency in oil painting, which is quite a technical medium,” said Gascoigne. “It changes a lot of what we know, or thought we knew, about Turner’s early work and our understanding of how his technique and style evolved.”Turner applied the oil paint thinly, almost like a watercolour. “He’s feeling his way through the medium, but bringing all the experience he already had as a watercolour painter to his application of oil.“This technique of washy, translucent glazes of paint is something he comes back to later in his career, in the 1830s and 40s, and is one of the things that allowed him to completely revolutionise the art of painting – breaking down forms, seducing them in light, taking his painting technique towards the level of experimentation and abstraction that we think of today with his late, great masterpieces.”At the time of last year’s sale, the painting was “very dirty, it hadn’t been touched for a long period of time, it had very old discoloured yellow varnish on it,” said Gascoigne.The Rising Squall, Hot Wells, from St Vincent’s Rock, Bristol will go on public display for the first time in 167 years later this month at Sotheby’s in London before being auctioned on 2 July.Explore more on these topicsJMW TurnerPaintingBristolLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2014, I was living in London when my dad, Eric, was diagnosed withmotor neurone disease(MND). I immediately moved back to my home town of New Plymouth in New Zealand, to help and spend time with him.When he passed away in October 2022, I wanted to find a way to process my grief, and I was desperate to get back out into the world.In early 2023, I took off to the Galápagos Islands for a much-needed break. While there, I visited Post Office Bay, on Floreana Island. There’s an old whisky barrel there that is used as a postbox. It was first used by sailors in 1793 to send mail back home: they would leave a letter and take any that were addressed to their next port of call to deliver them by hand. It’s still used by tourists. People will leave a letter and take one that they are able to hand-deliver to their next destination.The barrel was full to the brim with postcards waiting for delivery. I took a couple home with me and delivered them with glee: one to a teacher from their pupil, and another from a girl to her boyfriend. The recipients were incredibly grateful, and it felt wonderful to have brought such joy.I delivered a love letter to a man only to find he'd since broken up with his partner. Weeks later, they were back togetherWeeks later, I couldn’t stop thinking about the letters. I’d already planned to do some more travelling, but then I thought: what if I spent a year delivering more letters from that postbox? I realised I could keep my remote job, and at the same time travel the world delivering post, using air miles and working along the way.I decided to document my journey on social media, partly to keep a record of my adventures, but also to help raise awareness of MND. I had watched Dad lose his ability to travel and physically communicate, which was devastating, so I wanted to remember him by making meaningful human contact.In March 2024, I set off for Galápagos. I picked out 55 letters and postcards that covered a large geographic area. I aimed to deliver one a week, covering at least 52 countries and spanning all seven continents, starting in Central America and finishing in Europe.I avoided using social media to get in touch with people, going purely by address. If they weren’t there, I’d ask around locally, then use social media, doing my best to hand-deliver the letter. Sometimes, friends who had joined me for part of the trip could help translate, but I had to rely on Google Translate a lot. Usually, people were initially confused, but that would turn to complete joy as they read their letter.I was extremely nervous about the first few deliveries. I didn’t know how people would react to me knocking on their door unannounced. I’m 52 and very outgoing, but I’m aware that nowadays people are wary of speaking to one other.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The lady who answered the door didn’t believe my story and mistook my selfie stick for a weapon, so she called the police. I had to show the officers my Instagram journey to prove what I was doing, and we all ended up laughing together.In Belize, I delivered a love letter to a man, only to find he had broken up with his partner. Weeks later, I got a message to say they were back together.My favourite delivery was letter eight, in Mexico City, from a daughter to her mother, thanking her for letting her follow her dreams. The mother had been very ill, and her daughter wanted to come home from her travels to look after her, but she insisted her daughter continued with her trip. I’m still in touch with both of them.When I finished my challenge in March this year, I held a party in London and invited everyone I’d met along the way. People came from all over the world – I was so touched and humbled. I’ve made friends for life.Now my challenge is over, I’ve decided to write a book and help develop a film about my travels, but I’m already starting to get itchy feet. The only problem is finding a way to top my last adventure.As told to Heather MainDo you have an experience to share?

The council publishesa list of beaches, with all restrictions listed, that it’s important to check before heading out (there are still11 beaches where dogs are banned between 10am and 6pm, and there are three protected wildlife areas where they are banned at all times). One of the best beaches, we think, is atGunwalloewhere visitors can stay at the National Trust holiday cottage right by the beach and the cafe has water bowls for dogs.

Add the cream of tartar and carry on whisking to soft peaks. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking all the while, then beat for about five minutes, until the mix is thick and glossy. Turn down the speed to low, add the vanilla, vinegar, cornflour and a pinch of salt, and beat for another minute or two to incorporate.Dab a little meringue under each corner of the baking paper, so it sticks to the tray, then spoon the rest of the mixture into the centre of the traced circle. Using a small spatula, spread the meringue to the size of the circle, shaping it into a round with a slight dip in the centre. Transfer the tray to the oven and immediately lower the temperature to 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas ½. Bake for two hours, then switch off the oven and, with the door slightly ajar, leave the meringue inside for about two hours, until completely cool.When you’re ready to serve, put all the ingredients for the cream filling in the bowl of an electric mixer, and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-low for about a minute. Turn up the speed to medium and beat for another minute or two, until the cream makes smooth waves.To assemble, carefully transfer the meringue to a serving platter, then spoon the cream into the centre and spread it right to the edges. Top with the lychees and raspberries, some coulis if you like,and place a few elderflowers all over, if you managed to find some.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotDessertEggsFruitSpring food and drinkSummer food and drinkCakerecipesShareReuse this content"

However, we could not be more different. I approach things head on: if something is aproblem, I start working on it. She, on the other hand, is very passive. For the last 10 years three issues have been bothering her –her weight, her marriage and her dissatisfaction with her job. But she does nothing about any of them.I tried to help her in many different ways: direct advice – she gets offended and feels judged. Then I tried “tiptoeing” around her. For each suggestion, she always has an excuse why it won’t work. Additionally, she often has a victim complex, as if things are just happening to her and that she has no personal agency.Now I just listen because I gave up. But, because of this, I am feeling like a “dumping space” – my sister can talk for an hour about the same things. So I was wondering, what can I do? What other approaches can I try, so I can help my sister, while still being supportive and letting her do things in her own time and way? It hurts to see her stuck in life.Eleanor says:Does she feel like this all the time or does she store up the complaints and resentments to vent to you? It might be useful to get clear on this part first.How much of the total do you think you’re seeing? Does she truly think that her job, her marriage, her weight are all going badly, or is it just that she’s comfortable enough with you to tell you the bad bits? You’re siblings; she might feel she doesn’t need to be falsely sunny with you. This is a kind of closeness but it can easily lead to a misunderstanding. You think, “Why doesn’t she change, if she only has negative things to say?”, while she thinks, “Isn’t it great I can share the only negative things I have to say?”If she’s storing up the negatives to vent to you, she might not want practical help. She might just want to share the feelings and have your patience. It’s possible that the way you help your sister with the struggles she discusses is not by changing them – but by letting her discuss them. You say you just listen now because you gave up, but “just listening” may be precisely the kind of help she wants. Being really heard ismore than many people get in a lifetime.My friend is unreasonable with his four-year-old. How can I help him be a better dad? | Leading questionsRead moreI know it’s annoying to feel like a dumping ground. It’s quadruply annoying when every solution gets blocked or pooh-poohed before you’ve even finished offering it. But if you think of these conversationsasthe help you give her that might make them easier to endure. And it might make them easier to be deliberate about, too. For instance, it might help to ask: “What do you want me to do, when you share these things about work or your marriage? When do you feel like that chat has been helpful?” In time you might even suggest that if what she wants is a way to air frustrations, that might be better done with a professional, not just a sibling.On the other hand, say she isn’t just venting – say she’s just stably unhappy with her marriage, her work, her weight. Ten years is a long time to feel like that. And it’s a long time to go without changes. I think a person’s agency can atrophy; go long enough without making choices and our ability to do so gets weaker. We can start to feel as though we’re not the kind of person whocouldwant things or take steps to get them.When that happens, sometimes the only power we feel we have left is to block and say no. Shutting down suggestions, or insisting no change will work, can be a way of reclaiming a sour imitation agency when the real thing seems unavailable.If that’s the case, helping that can start with listening, too. When I’m in that horrible inertia of agency-less-ness I’ve always found it devastatingly galvanising to be asked: “Do you want things to feel different?” That’s not a solution, a proposed plan or somebody else’s idea of what needs to change. It’s just a question, and engaging with it long enough to answer it can remind you that there’s something inside you that is still at the controls.Sometimes helping someone isn’t a matter of finding a practical solution. Sometimes it’s about listening and talking to someone in ways that remind them that they want a solution too.The letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionDo you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Here is a roundup of the key studies.1.ImmunotherapyAn immunotherapy drug could help some cancer patients live years longer without the disease getting worse or coming back,a trial found.Pembrolizumab, sold under the brand name Keytruda, kept head and neck cancers at bay for five years, compared with 30 months with standard care. It also cut the risk of the disease returning in another part of the body.A second study showedpeople with a deadly form of skin cancer could live longer with an innovative one-time immunotherapy.Almost one in five patients with advanced melanoma survived for five years after receiving lifileucel, with tumours shrinking in the majority of cases, the trial found.2.Car T-cell therapyCar T-cell therapy is a new form of immunotherapy in which a patient’s own T-cells – a type of white blood cell – are tweaked in a lab to target and kill cancer cells. The designer cells are then infused back into their bloodstream to fight the disease.One trial foundcancer patients treated by Car T-cell therapy could live 40% longer.The therapy has already proved successful in treating blood cancers. Now results from the world’s first randomised controlled trial of Car T-cell therapy in solid tumours suggest it could be transformative in the fight against these cancers, too.Solid tumours represent about 90% of all cancers, including breast, lung and pancreatic cancer.In the trial hailed as a “milestone” by experts, patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer treated with Car T-cell therapy lived on average about 40% longer than patients who received standard care.A second Car T-cell therapy shrank tumours in 62% of patients with recurrent glioblastoma, a rare event for a fatal brain cancer with few treatment options,researchers reportedin Chicago.“Seeing recurrent [glioblastoma] tumours shrink like this is extraordinary, because the immunotherapy drugs that we’ve tried in the past have been unable to do that,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Stephen Bagley, of the University of Pennsylvania.3.Liquid biopsiesIn a world first,doctors announcedat the conference that thousands of cancer patients in England would benefit from a DNA blood test that saves lives by fast-tracking them on to personalised treatments.The liquid biopsy looks for circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) to find specific genetic variations of cancer. The NHS will offer it to patients with lung and breast cancer – two of the most common forms of the disease.Rapid results mean patients can immediately be offered drugs and treatments specifically tailored to the genetic profile of their disease, significantly increasing their survival chances and paving the way for a new era of precision medicine.4.ExerciseExercise cuts the risk of death in cancer patients by more than a third,a landmark trial found. Physical activity could also prevent the disease coming back and stop new tumours developing, as well as lifting mood, reducing fatigue and boosting strength.The world’s first randomised clinical trial to specifically evaluate if a structured exercise regime after treatment could reduce the risk of recurrence or new cancers in patients took place over more than a decade.Hailed as gamechanging by experts, the results show it could reduce the risks. The trial found patients had a 37% lower risk of death and a 28% lower risk of their cancer coming back or new cancers developing, compared with patients who received only health advice.“When we saw the results, we were just astounded,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Christopher Booth, of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada.Margaret Tubridy was one of 889 patients with colon cancer recruited to the trial from six countries – the UK, the US, Australia, France, Canada and Israel. Five years after her diagnosis,she told the Guardianshe was now free of cancer and healthy, with no signs of the disease coming back.5.Breast cancerAmid a series of breakthroughs aimed at tackling the most common cancer in women, doctors were told a new drug could stop some breast cancer tumours before they grow.A trial showedthat camizestrant stops cancer cells from using hormones to grow, which helps patients stay well longer and delays the need for chemotherapy. It was the first global study to show that using blood tests to find early signs of cancer resistance to treatment helps patients.The study looked at patients who had hormone-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, which is about 70% of cases. Results showed patients given camizestrant reduced their chances of cancer progression by 56%, compared with standard therapies.“This is going to be very impactful for our patients,” said Dr Hope Rugo, the head of breast medical oncology at City of Hope hospital in Duarte, California.A second trial foundthat a new triple therapy for aggressive, advanced breast cancer slows the progression of the disease, delays the need for further chemotherapy and helps patients live longer.6.Artificial intelligenceArtificial intelligence could help end a “postcode lottery” for a life-extending treatment for prostate cancer,researchers said.Abiraterone is a hormone therapy described as a “gamechanger” that works by blocking the production of testosterone, which fuels prostate cancer growth.It has already helped hundreds of thousands with advanced prostate cancer to live longer. But some countries, including England, have stopped short of offering the “spectacular” drug more widely to men whose disease has not spread.A team from the US, the UK and Switzerland have built an AI test that shows which men would most likely benefit from abiraterone. The breakthrough will enable healthcare systems to roll out the drug to more men, and spare others unnecessary treatment.Explore more on these topicsCancerMedical researchHealthNHSEnglandkey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It feels almost illicit to admit this, but for the past few months I’ve been in two very useful WhatsApp groups that exist to serve people who live in a certain corner of London interested in home improvement and gardening. I’ve come to find the patter of insight and community feeling around matters such as leftover boxes of tiles and how to solve a kitchen island conundrum strangely calming.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It took me years to visit famous historic gardens such asGreat DixterandSissinghurst– my love affair with gardening started with the well-tended window boxes on south London housing estates and the unruly front garden roses that you can smell from the pavement. Ordinary, not-enough-time, don’t-know-the-Latin-name gardening is my jam, and there’s plenty of it to be enjoyed in the group.Mail-order nurseries used to satisfy the avid gardener’s retail therapy needs, and the same is true now, only on the internetPlus, the other day someone asked a question that I thought it worth sharing here: where to buy plants if you don’t have a car and live in a city?Both apply to me. For the first few years of my gardening adventure, I would travel to local nurseries and carry cardboard crates home on the bus or back of my bike. These days, I make a couple of jaunts a year to one particular stall on Columbia Road flower market in east London for interesting perennials. I’ve not bought a single plant this year – I divided a lot of trusty perennials in the autumn, and they’ve filled up the beds instead.But when I am wanting to fill a bed or a tub or a micropond, I go online. Mail-order plant nurseries used to satisfy the avid gardener’s retail therapy needs, and the same is true now, only on the internet. There are specialist nurseries for whatever you may want: tryBluebell Cottagefor a well-curated mix of trusty hardy perennials, all peat-free with fantastic sustainability credentials;Crug Farm, which is one for the specialists and can’t be beaten for unusual plants (it’s worth buying with gardening friends to share the p&p costs); and always-amazing peat-free varieties fromBeth Chatto, whose site allows you to filter by situation and colour (their packaging and customer service is great, too).I get that it can seem intimidating – clinical, even – to buy living things on the internet, and it’s important that you’re around to give the plants a good drink when they arrive. But once you get into buying plants online it can totally shape your gardening.You can buy young plants in 9cm pots, for instance, which are cheaper and will grow better than the already-flowering more mature specimens on show at the garden centre. It’s also easier to stick to your colour scheme or planting plan. Newsletters and catalogues will remind you when to get into the seasonal habits of care and maintenance, and you’ll be introduced to all manner of plants you never knew existed.

Plus, a letter byCarole Ludlow MooneyFri 6 Jun 2025 12.08 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 12.18 EDTShareThe findings of the London Drugs Commission are welcome after a decade or more of static drug policy in the UK (Worried about weed: should London follow New York and decriminalise cannabis?, 31 May). While the report focuses on London, the suggestions resonate across the UK and beyond.Cannabis was reclassified from class B to class C in 2004, reducing the penalties for possession, after the home secretary (David Blunkett) took theadvice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. Unfortunately, the Labour government asked the council to reconsider its advice based on protests about the risks of cannabis to health. The council, headed by Sir Michael Rawlins,confirmed its advicethat the drug should stay in class C. The government disagreed this time and returned it to class B.PoliceScotlandsome years ago announced that it would concentrate on more serious issues and reduce attention on simple possession-of-cannabis offences. Returning the drug to a class with a lower sentencing tariff clearly makes sense.The requirements for a functioning education and health service regarding drug use and addiction are clearly the next target and at present it is hard to identify anything but inadequate provision in primary or specialist services.Scotland is innovating in the establishment of a safer injecting room and a heroin assisted-treatment programme in Glasgow, but across the addiction field progress is slow.The commission didn’t recommend legislation but without a national approach progress in addiction policy is fragmented and piecemeal.Roy RobertsonProfessor of addiction medicine,University of EdinburghYour article about decriminalising cannabis in London doesn’t take into account the impact on people who don’t want the smell of weed all around them. I’ve recently been on a short break toNew York, which was marred by the inescapable smell of weed everywhere. It was in the streets, the shop doorways and even permeated the shops and restaurants as people smoked their joints outside.It’s bad enough that we have to breathe in the sickly smell of vapes on the street without having to endure the pungent odour of pot everywhere. This is more than an issue about not prosecuting people for drug use, it’s a quality-of-life issue for everyone. If it’s decriminalised inLondon, the rest of the country is sure to follow suit.Carole Ludlow MooneyBacup, LancashireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He’s manufacturing it (It’s easy to dismiss Robert Jenrick’s fare-dodging stunt. But he understands something Keir Starmer doesn’t, 30 May). The issue isn’t whether people are annoyed by fare-dodgers or spooked by barber shops that stay open late. It’s why that resentment gets more political airtime than landlords hiking rents, billionaires dodging taxes, or private equity firms bleeding the NHS dry.What Jenrick is doing isn’t tapping into some universal British frustration with rule-breaking. He’s engaging in the oldest trick in the reactionary playbook. Inflate petty infractions into moral panics. Redirect public rage downward. Claim the mantle of common sense. It’s the politics of distraction, dressed up as concern for order.When Freedland suggests Keir Starmer could learn from this, not the policies but the presentation, he endorses the very performance of power that makes people feel unheard. It’s not that Starmer fails to appear tough enough on antisocial behaviour. It’s that he fails to speak to the real antisocial behaviours that define life under late capitalism. Wage theft. Housing precarity. Digital surveillance. Austerity itself.Fare-dodging is often an act of desperation or defiance in a system designed to extract. “Weird Turkish barber shops” is not a neutral observation. It is a dog-whistle wrapped in folksy suspicion. The real disorder is structural, not stylistic. Any politics that treats broken windows as more urgent than broken lives will only reinforce the rot.We don’t need Labour to better mimic Tory talking points. We need courage. Courage to name the real villains. Courage to refuse the scapegoat circuit. Courage to believe the public can handle more than tabloid moralism.Addie MarphenLondonJonathan Freedland is correct when he says it is “awkward to take lessons in politics from Robert Jenrick”. However, Jenrick glosses over his party’s part in the causes and thus has no understanding of what brought us here. The society that my and my parents’ generation knew had established, long-term employers, often with people working together on a large scale. We had mutuals, social societies, sports and social and working men’s clubs.What we offer my children’s generation is cellular working, the commodification of everything, self-absorption and social isolation. Margaret Thatcher started the decay of mutual support and shared interests, and it has worsened over the past 14 years, so it is no surprise that some see the expression of self‑interest in antisocial behaviour and low-level criminality.Andrew KyleEaling, LondonJonathan Freedland suggests that Keir Starmer might copy the populist gestures ofRobert Jenrick. But Starmer has already indulged in many of Freedland’s “nods to the right” with his gimmicky video showing the forcible deportation of asylum seekers, and then his Powellite “island of strangers” speech.Better by far to “nod to the left” by copying Bernie Sanders (Interview, 4 June), with his uncompromising opposition to all forms of bigotry while advocating traditional social-democratic politics of strong welfare and just redistribution. And nearer home, Starmer could listen to Gordon Brown (Opinion, 27 May) with his passionate commitment to ending child poverty, starting with the unhesitating end to the Tory two-child benefit cap.Gideon Ben-TovimUniversity of LiverpoolIt is so distressing to find that I’m impressed by the actions of a politician whom I usually despise. Jonathan Freedland is correct, it’s this kind of petty lawbreaking that infuriates those of us who think that as a society we all need to “play by the rules”.But having Robert Jenrick (of all people) point this out?

Literature offers an antidote: access to emotional nuance, empathy and self-reflection. But boys are rarely encouraged to see reading in this way.As a teenager, I rarely discussed books with male friends, even though I secretly read them. One long summer I immersed myself in Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina and Effi Briest. These novels (by male authors) opened up inner worlds I hadn’t been taught to name. That emotional expansion is a gift literature offers – one that boys in particular are too often denied.If we want to steer young men away from isolation or online extremism, we need more men to speak publicly about the books that moved them – and to reach out, to each other and to their sons. Dear men, when was the last time you read something to another man?Role models like Barack Obama and Bill Gates have shown the power of reading, but we need them to champion fiction too. And we must protect public and school libraries. The National Literacy Trust reports that children born into communities with the most serious literacy challenges have some of the lowest life expectancies in England. Those who enjoy reading are also happier with their lives. If men’s reading is in crisis, the solution won’t come from publishing alone. It must be cultural – and collective.Vincent StraubPhD candidate, University of OxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that the Ice officers began to fall ill “within 72 hours of landing” in Djibouti, and continue to suffer from suspected bacterial upper respiratory infections.Trump travel ban comes as little surprise amid barrage of draconian restrictionsRead moreTheTrump administrationhad attempted to send the eight detainees, who it said had been convicted of criminal offenses, to South Sudan, but ajudge intervenedto stop their flight in May, arguing that they were entitled to challenge the deportation in the courts.Mellissa Harper, a top official at the DHS and Ice, said in acourt declarationthat the detainees are being held in a shipping container that was previously converted into a conference room. The Ice officers are “sharing very limited sleeping quarters”, Harper said, with only six beds between 13 people.In the declaration, Harper said burn pits inDjiboutihave led to Ice officials experiencing “throat irritation”. She said the outside temperature frequently exceeds 100F (38C) in the daytime, and said Ice officials were at risk of malaria because they did not take anti-malaria medication before arriving in Djibouti.“Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,” Harper said, but they were unable to obtain proper testing for a diagnosis.Harper added: “Upon arrival in Djibouti, officers were warned by US Department of Defense officials of imminent danger of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. The Ice officers lack body armor or other gear that would be appropriate in the case of an attack.”White House asks supreme court to block challenges to deportations to South SudanRead moreThe declaration detailed the conditions that the detainees face, including only being allowed to shower once a day, and being subjected to “pat-downs and searches” during trips to the restroom, which is 40 yards from the shipping container where they are being held. Harper said there is limited lighting in the area, “which makes visibility difficult and creates a significant security risk for both the officers and aliens”.The Trump administration hadattempted to send the eight mento their home countries of Myanmar, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Mexico and South Sudan. Those countries declined to accept them, however, and US authorities then arranged to fly them to South Sudan in late May.Brian Murphy, a US district judge in Boston, intervened, ruling that the administration had“unquestionably” violated his earlier order, issued in April, which ruled that anyone facing deportation to third-party countries had the right to challenge it legally.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationDjiboutiTrump administrationSouth SudanLaw (US)US politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Four Indian nationals living in Canada have been charged with Nijjar’s murder.The summit, attended by key world leaders, runs from 15 to 17 June in Kananaskis, Alberta.Carney said becauseIndiawas the “fifth largest economy in the world, the most populous country in the world and central to supply chains”, he said it was important to invite the country’s leader despite the continuing investigation to discuss energy, artificial intelligence and critical minerals.“I extended the invitation to Prime Minister Modi and, in that context, he has accepted,” Carney said.Modi said he was glad to receive a call from Carney and congratulated the Liberal leader on his recent electoral victory.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi speaks in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, last year.Photograph: Dean Kassim/AFP via Getty Images“As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests. Look forward to our meeting at the summit,” Modi said in a statement.Canada and India expelled each other’s top diplomatslast year over Nijjar’s politically motivated murder in the British Columbia city of Surrey. Canadian law enforcement also alleged India was involved in extortion, gang violence and intimidation.Carney’s decision to invite Modi prompted an outraged response from the World Sikh Organization. “For Sikhs in Canada, this is a betrayal, not just of our community, but of core Canadian values. Prime Minister Carney’s decision to inviteNarendra Modi, while India continues to deny any role in the assassination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar and refuses to cooperate with Canadian authorities, is both shameful and dangerous,” its president, Danish Singh, wrote in a statement.“We would never welcome leaders from Russia, China, or Iran under such circumstances. Yet India has done far more on Canadian soil in terms of foreign interference and transnational repression, including orchestrating murders, and is being rewarded with a red carpet welcome.”Allegations of Indian interference rock Canada election campaignRead moreCarney’s decision comes as his new government looks to ease tensions with other countries feuding with Canada.Late Thursday, he posted a readout of a call with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, and said there was interest on both sides to “regularize channels of communication” amid a trade spat that has cost both sides billions through tariffs on seafood, electric vehicles, canola, pork and peas. In the call, the first high-level telephone communication since becoming prime minister in March, Carney said both sides were also fighting illegal production of the opioid fentanyl.Carney is also in direct talks with Donald Trump, the US president, to end a trade war between the two allies following economically damaging tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.Doug Ford, the Ontario premier, told reporters the Canadian prime minister was engaged in “deep, deep discussions” with Trump’s team – a development confirmed by Canada’s industry minister hours later.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaG7Mark CarneyNarendra ModiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

After abolition in 1888, religions of African origin were still criminalised.It was only with the adoption of the country’s most recent constitution, in 1988, that practitioners of umbanda and candomblé gained some form of state protection – at least in theory. In recent years, however, they haveagain faced persecution, this time from extremist Catholics and evangelicals and evendrug traffickers who claim to have embraced Christianity.Santos said that although followers of Afro-Brazilian religions still represent a small minority of the population, the rise in self-declared adherents may reflect both people who previously identified with other religions out of fear and actual migration.She sees the growth as a potential result of “all these movements to celebrate Afro-Brazilian culture in recent years … with prominent figures in society, influencers and artists identifying with these religions … and also a massive campaign against religious intolerance”.Explore more on these topicsBrazilCatholicismAmericasReligionChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

Escobar had a hand in murders, kidnappings and bombings before Colombia’s special forces shot him to death in 1993.As he told it to Walton, Dominguez only became involved in drug smuggling in the late 1970s after his father, a southFloridareal estate developer, unexpectedly died from cancer in the middle of building a sugar mill in Haiti.View image in fullscreenA contemporary photo of Tirso ‘TJ’ Dominguez.Photograph: Courtesy of the Cocaine Air podcastDominguez says he was 20 at the time, and he was subsequently scammed out of $100,000 by two ruthless Miami bankers who refused to give him the $14m loan his father had secured before dying. Desperate to raise capital for the sugar mill, Dominguez – whose mother was a homemaker – learned to fly airplanes so he could earn some money from drug dealers by illicitly smuggling marijuana into the US from the Bahamas andColombia.He says he graduated to illegally flying cocaine over American skies after he dropped $800,000 worth of marijuana into the wrong smuggling boat, prompting his suppliers to kidnap him and threaten to kill him along with his family if he did not quickly make them whole. The quickest path to regaining the lost investment was to fly a planeload of coke to be dealt on behalf of another supplier, so Dominguez did it, according to his account.“I never wanted to get into cocaine because cocaine [smugglers] were the bad guys … doing all the killing,” Dominguez says on Walton’s podcast, which is unrelated to an upcoming Netflix documentary of the same name but on a different subject. “I don’t condone drugs. I’ve never done any drugs. I was the victim of a con which actually pushed me in the direction that I ended up in.”Nonetheless, that first flight brought Dominguez a cool $1m to pay back his irate weed suppliers, he says. He says that was lucrative enough for him to decide to begin flying smuggled cocaine full-time, proving himself to be someone who was punctual as well as professional – and he never lost a shipment.Dominguez said his reliability ultimately captured the attention of Escobar, who tried to recruit him to his cartel. Yet Dominguez, also nicknamed Tito, initially was unmoved, saying he was fine with four flights a month at $1m a pop.Pepe review – inside the beautiful mind of Pablo Escobar’s hippoRead more“I’ll be honest with you – Pablo Escobar didn’t mean anything to me,” Dominguez says on Cocaine Air. “I [was] full of myself. I walk on water, you know? I’m making $4m a month. What the hell’s wrong with that?”Escobar then offered to pay Dominguez for four flights a month at $5m a trip. Dominguez thought $20m monthly – the equivalent of $60m today when factoring in inflation – was too much to pass up. And he says that was when he opted to begin flying for Escobar exclusively.That fee evidently became too much even for Escobar, who later started paying Dominguez in cocaine. Dominguez at that point went from a cocaine smuggler to a dealer, meaning he could fly the product, sell it, collect the proceeds, launder the money and invest the funds – all on his own, without needing to count on middlemen.“I did what no other smuggler had ever done in the history of smuggling,” Dominguez bragged to Walton, whose prior projects include the hitQueen of the Con: The Irish Heiresspodcast series.View image in fullscreenA past photo of Tirso ‘TJ’ Dominguez and his pet mountain lion, Top Cat.Photograph: Courtesy of the Cocaine Air podcastIn a particularly noteworthy moment on Cocaine Air’s series opener, Dominguez reads from a memoir co-authored by Escobar’s brother – his accountantRoberto Escobar– that asserts TJ had a fleet of 30 airplanes and was one of the “main transporters” for Pablo’s drug empire.Dominguez recalled accumulating a mansion, a company that sold cellphones at a time when the devices cost $5,000 a piece, a housing development, a charter airplane and boat business, and an exotic car dealership at the peak of his powers. He even raised a pet mountain lion whom he dubbed Top Cat.But it all came crashing down one early morning in April 1988 when federal investigators – equipped with rifles and helicopters – descended on his house and arrested him. Prosecutors had charged him and 12 associates with illegally bringing more than five tons each of marijuana and cocaine into south Florida from at least July 1984 to December 1985, as the Miami Herald and Sun Sentinel newspapersreported.Officials contended that Dominguez’s exotic-car dealership in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and his other businesses in the area were fronts for a multimillion-dollar drug-smuggling ring. They seized two dozen luxury cars – Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Excaliburs and Panteras – and five airplanes collectively worth nearly $3m to auction them off, among other consequences for Dominguez.View image in fullscreenA past photo of Tirso ‘TJ’ Dominguez with his soon-to-be wife Veronique Jokinen on his lap while they sit on the hood of a sports car and a large stuffed bear sits on the vehicle’s roof.Photograph: Courtesy of the Cocaine Air podcastIn 1991, about two years before Escobar’s slaying, Dominguez pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine and marijuana as well as illicitly laundering money. He spent 13 years imprisoned, including two in solitary confinement after one of his fellow inmates reported Dominguez after he managed to buy a helicopter from within his cell and plotted to be flown out to freedom.Dominguez explains on Cocaine Air that, before being caught, he had instructed the helicopter pilot to land on the grounds of the prison and then “just jump me over the fence”.“There was a canal, not too far away – I had a car waiting for me,” Dominguez says on Cocaine Air, which premiered on Wednesday with plans to release new episodes weekly through 23 July on podcast platforms such as Apple andSpotify.Now aged 73, Dominguez told the podcast that he considers his debt to society repaid and aspires to become a legitimate entrepreneur.“Failing is when you quit,” Dominguez says of his desire to write a new chapter in his life. “You’re going to fall? You fall forward. That means you gained two steps already.“The glass is always half full for me.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaPodcastsColombiaAmericasDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Social media is a key battleground in China’s information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict.The DoubleThink Lab report claimed the more active TikTok users showed stronger correlations with an openness to Chinese propaganda and the idea that unification with China is inevitable and democracy should be sacrificed for peace.There was also correlation with unhappiness about current domestic issues, including opposition-driven accusations of judicial unfairness and erosions of free speech. Differences were stark among supporters of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which the CCP has labelled illegal separatists.“Our analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users’ political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic establishment and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,” said the report’s author, Eric Hsu.The percentage of DPP supporters who used TikTok and thought it was acceptable to give up Taiwan’s democratic system “for the sake of cross-strait peace” was 10 points higher than non-users, at 26.8%, the report said. And in response to statements that the DPP was “no different from the CCP and Taiwan lacks freedom of speech”, 23.9% of DPP supporters who used TikTok agreed, compared with 9.3% who were not active on the app.TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of outright bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices.TikTok ban deadline looms in US amid last-minute takeover bidsRead moreIn 2019, theGuardian revealedhow ByteDance used TikTok to advance Beijing’s foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content. A 2023 study, by Rutgers University’s Network Contagion Research Institute in the US, found TikTok’s algorithms consistently amplify pro-CCP content and suppress anti-CCP narratives, with much of the pro-CCP content originating from state-linked entities.ByteDance has long denied the allegations.“From the CCP’s founding, there has always been a strong emphasis on both the ‘pen’ and the ‘gun’ – meaning propaganda and force,” said Yu-hui Tai, an assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.Tai said Taiwan was on the frontline of China’s propaganda efforts, and its digital environment was “complex”. She added: “TikTok is not the only app young people use”, noting that Douyin – the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, which some Taiwanese also use – is very different in content and moderation to TikTok.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The departments of Loire and Puy-de-Dôme were among the hardest hit, experiencing significant damage from a particularly violent supercell thunderstorm that produced hailstones measuring up to 6cm in diameter – larger than ping-pong balls.The storm system also generated flash flooding, strong wind gusts, and reports of a localised “mini-tornado”, leaving widespread damage to infrastructure and vehicles in its wake.The storms were fuelled by warm, saturated air rising from the Mediterranean clashing with cooler air descending from northern Europe. This temperature contrast created significant atmospheric instability. Additionally, theorographicinfluence of the Vosges and Jura mountain ranges probably contributed to storm intensification by enhancing uplift.The powerful supercell formed under conditions of high wind shear, where changes in wind speed and direction with altitude encouraged the development of a rotating updraft. These intense updrafts lifted raindrops high into the atmosphere, where they froze and coalesced into large hailstones before falling to the ground with destructive force.Meanwhile, southernChinahas once again experienced heavy rainfall, triggering landslides, emergency evacuations, and widespread disruption to transport networks across the region. In Quanzhou County, approximately 300 cubic metres of debris, including soil and large boulders, tumbled down a hillside, blocking a major roadway and bringing traffic to a standstill. In Guilin’s Lingui district, rainfall totals exceeded 207mm on Monday alone, highlighting the severity of the ongoing weather system and its impact on the local infrastructure and communities.Canada is currently battling more than 200 active wildfires, primarily across Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with approximately 2.3 million hectares burnt, most within the past week. At least half of these fires are classified as out of control, and have led to widespread evacuations. Thick smoke from the fires has significantly reduced air quality, spreading across a third of the US, and more recently have reached Europe. Hot, dry conditions, intensified by climate change, have been worsening the situation, and are expected to help fuel the fires over the coming days.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherWeather trackerEuropeFranceChinaAsia PacificCanadaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But he expressed doubts about how the Tasmanian parliament got here, and what lay ahead.Based on the reaction online and on talkback radio, many Tasmanians agree.Liberal premier Jeremy Rockliff to request Tasmania election after no-confidence voteRead moreFrom the outside – and to many on the inside – the events in parliament this week look like a form of collective madness that was entirely avoidable and, despite all the strong words, largely pointless.The vote of no-confidence in Rockliff, moved by the Labor leader Dean Winter, passed on Thursday afternoon by the barest of margins: 18-17. It has pushed the state to the brink of a fresh election just 15 months sincethe last one.Bizarrely, the state finds itself in this position despite all the major players – Liberals, Labor and the Greens – declaring loudly that an election is a bad idea and should not happen. Each had the power to prevent one. Which is not to say all are equally to blame.Rainbow parliament quickly fadesWe need to briefly rewind 15 months.On 23 March last year, Tasmanians chose what some have called a rainbow parliament, and others have described as chaos: 14 Liberals, 10 Labor, five Greens, three MPs from the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) and three independents.No party was close to the 18 seats needed for a majority government, but the Liberals had a clear plurality of support. Winter declined to try to lead the state despite the crossbench being made up largely of progressive MPs, declaring he would never deal with the Greens.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsRockliff won a promise of support on confidence and budget supply from JLN and the independent David O’Byrne, a former Labor leader, who would prefer an ALP government but wanted the parliament to work. In the months that followed JLN fell apart and the government’s position became more precarious.The sole remaining JLN MP, Andrew Jenner,refused to vote for a budgetreleased in September, breaking his commitment to ensure the government survived. The then treasurer and deputy premier, Michael Ferguson,was forced to resign and move to the backbenchwhen he faced what would have been a successful no-confidence vote over mismanagement of new Spirit of Tasmania ferries.And the Greens moved two no-confidence motions in Rockliff – one over a shelved gambling harm minimisation promise, the other overa controversial AFL stadium planned for Macquarie Point, on Hobart’s waterfront.Despite the noise, the premier appeared relatively safe. Just last month, Labor argued the stateneeded a period of stability. That changed on Tuesday, when Winter surprised observers bytabling a no-confidence motion at the end of a budget reply speech, and declaring he would move it when it was clear it had enough support.It was a dare to both the crossbench and the government. But it was a tactic without a clear endgame.View image in fullscreenTasmanian Labor leader Dean Winter moved a no-confidence motion in the Liberal government led by premier Jeremy Rockliff.Photograph: Ben Mckay/AAPThe motion was ostensibly about the budget, arguing Rockliff had wrecked the state’s finances, planned to sell public assets and had mismanaged the ferries. Handed down five days earlier, the budget had beenwidely criticisedfor increasing debt and spending, and failing to provide solutions to structural problems. Some government supporters said it was the worst they had seen.But the opposition leader did not make a case for what Labor would do differently, and did not make a pitch to become premier if the no-confidence motion carried.The goal was to either push the Greens to side with Rockliff to prevent chaos or, more likely, claim the premier’s scalp by forcing the Liberals to replace him, almost certainly with someone less popular.Neither happened.The motion quickly won backing on Tuesday from Garland, Jenner, and the independent Kristie Johnston (who had backed earlier no-confidence motions). The Greens declared their support after meeting on Wednesday morning.But the Greens did not want the motion to just be about the budget. The minor party tried to amend it to include a rejection of the stadium – one of the biggest issues dominating public debate in the state over the past year given the likely $1bn-plus cost, and because admission of the Tasmania Devils to the AFL hinges on it being built. Their leader, Rosalie Woodruff, alsooffered to work with Labor to try to form an alternative government.Both steps were rejected. The Greens knew they would be. They backed the motion anyway.Stadium divide drives resentmentSome commentary over the past week assumed the motion would lead to a Labor-Greens minority government. But the relationship between the two parties in the state is hostile, and they are ideologically miles apart. Winter’s defining position since becoming Labor leader last year has been to argue for “traditional industries” – including native forest logging, salmon farming and mining – and to reject suggestions he would work with the minor party.Winter did not speak with crossbenchers before tabling the no-confidence motion, and Labor and the Greens mostly voted against Rockliff for different reasons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Labor and the Greens fell out after governing in partnership from 2010 to 2014, a period in which two Greens held ministries. The relationship has become more distant under Winter, who is close to the former premier Paul Lennon, an assertively pro-industry and anti-green figure.It doesn’t take much analysis to realise this raises questions about whether Labor can form government anytime soon, given it has lost four straight elections and has less than a third of seats in the state’s lower house. It continues to argue it could win a majority.Labor and the Greens are also sharply divided over the stadium, which has become the most politically charged issue facing the state and driven significant public resentment against the government.Polls suggest a majority of the public are opposed to it in every electorate, especially in the state’s parochial north. But the stadium has the support of both major parties – not least because neither wants to stand accused of killing thelong-held dream of a Tasmanian AFL team, which still has overwhelming public support.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s impression of an AFL stadium planned for construction in Hobart.Photograph: Grimshaw Architects/AFL AustraliaThere is a compelling case that a new stadium will be needed in the state’s capital for the club to be a success. But the state government spectacularly stuffed up the argument.It signed a lopsided deal under which the AFL pays a meagre $15m of the direct funding for the stadium’s construction. Predictably, the cost of the stadium to taxpayershas blown out beyond Rockliff’s initial pledgeit would be capped at $375m. And thesite itself is controversial.The premier has broken promises on the issue, including introducing legislation to circumvent a drawn out independent assessment process. Meanwhile, the AFL has refused to budge from its line – no stadium at Macquarie Point, no team.Critics including most non-major party MPs accuse the government of caving to AFL pressure, point to crises on housing, health and the budget, and argue a stadium cannot be justified. Some have claimed, without obvious evidence, that the AFL could be forced to redraw the deal. Some vocal critics don’t care if the state has a team. Butthat’s not where most of the public is.It’s a mess that has hurt the government, but doesn’t necessarily win support for Labor. As the no-confidence motion was debated, Tasmania Devils executive Kath McCannbroke down at a press conferenceas she argued the future of the club was uncertain if Rockliff was removed.AFL’s Tasmania expansion on a knife edge amid state political uncertaintyRead moreWhile it wasn’t the subject of the no-confidence motion, you could make a decent case that the stadium – including the AFL’s refusal to accommodate genuinely held Tasmanian concerns – will cost Rockliff his job.But that hasn’t happened yet, and it is not clear if it will.Election possibility clouded by uncertaintyThe Liberals have backed Rockliff, for now at least, rather than replace him with one of a list of potential contenders. Liberal MPs have argued the budget was backed by the government, not just Rockliff, and supported his push for an early election if the no-confidence motion was passed.They may yet change their minds. Business leaders warn an election would hurt confidence and stall investment. Some senior Liberal figureshave urged the parliamentary party elect a new leaderto avoid forcing Tasmanians vote again. The parliament has to return on Tuesday to pass a short-term supply bill before Rockliff plans to speak with the governor, Barbara Baker, so they have a few days to work it out.If there is an election, it is difficult to see either major party approaching a majority of seats. Themost recent ERMS pollhad Labor on 31% support, ahead of the Liberals, who fell five percentage points to just 29%. But 37% said they preferred someone else.This doesn’t bode well for the major parties, which have struggled to come to grips with the reality ofan expanded 35-member parliamentin which no one has control. The Liberals failed to maintain the support of enough MPs. Labor has done little to develop a relationship with the crossbench.Tasmanians might soon tell them that’s not good enough, and to try again.Explore more on these topicsTasmanian politicsTasmaniaTasmania DevilsLabor partyLiberal partyAustralian GreensanalysisShareReuse this content"

Paramedics treated him at the scene, but he died.Police said initial inquiries showed the man was attempting to cross the light rail track between two carriages when the tram began moving and trapped him.In May 2023, a teenage girl died after attempting to cross a street in Sydney’s CBD between two tram carriages. She became trapped underneath one of them when the tram started moving, suffering fatal injuries.View image in fullscreenPeople cross the tram lines at Surry Hills tram stop the day after a person was killed while crossing the tracks.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianThat two similar deaths occurred just two years apart meant police, the premier, and transport bureaucrats fielded questions from the media this week over whether the light rail network, and the trams themselves, should be made safer.Dr Geoffrey Clinton, a senior lecturer in transport management at the University of Sydney, said it was “probably wise” for the government to investigate additional safety measures to stop people from attempting to climb over them.Sydney’s light rail network uses a few different tram models – what bureaucrats call “rolling stock”. What they have in common is that they typically have separate carriages that are coupled together to form a longer vehicle, unlike trams in Melbourne, which have only one carriage.Australian high-speed rail has barely left the station – some experts say a new US project shows a better wayRead moreMany of the trams now have “danger” signs on the joinery between the carriages, warning people not to try to climb over them. Clinton said the state government or the network’s private operator, Transdev, could consider additional signage.“Or even something like a net between the two carriages to discourage people from trying to clamber through,” he said.He posed the idea of running the trams twice as frequently with only one carriage, making them half as long, but said it didn’t “seem like a feasible solution”.“[That] would very expensive to do and wouldn’t add to the capacity of the network, but it would double the labour cost,” he said.The transport minister, John Graham, declined to comment. ATransportfor New South Wales (TfNSW) spokesperson said the man’s death was “extremely distressing”.The NSW police inspector Anderson Lessing on Thursday said that after speaking to witnesses and reviewing CCTV, it appeared the man had stepped between the tram carriages off the platform at the light rail stop on Devonshire Street.View image in fullscreenThe Surry Hills light rail stop in inner Sydney on 6 June, 2025.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian“There’s obviously risk involved, but it comes back to personal responsibility when you do cross the tram line, and it’s that balance that we have to get right,” he said.The TfNSW coordinator-general, Howard Collins, expressed his condolences to the man’s family and first responders.He said the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR) would work with Transdev to establish whether any safety recommendations could be made or whether the death was “a case of really unfortunate misadventure”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hobart is set for a chilly low of 4C on Sunday and maximum of 15C on Saturday.Snow cover declineDespite what looks to be a snowy beginning to the ski season,a warm winter is forecast for Australia.Professor Emeritus David Karoly, from the University of Melbourne and the Australian Climate Council, said there is clear evidence of snow cover declining and snow season length reducing due to global warming.“It’s long-term warming due to human-caused climate change from burning fossil fuels,” he said.Karoly said last year’s snow season started similarly to this year, with relatively good snow early on, but due to high temperatures and low snowfall there was not enough to maintain snow for the whole season.He said the impact of climate change from Australian and global emissions, with a new world record for climate pollution set in 2024, will cause continued decline in snow cover and snow season length until at least2050 – the current target date for net zero emissions.“By that stage there will be very, very few commercially viable ski areas in Australia even with increases in snowmaking on the resorts,” he said.He said lack of action from powerful countries like the US to reduce their emissions and the Australian government’s expansion of the North West Shelf pas project “will make it virtually impossible to meet its commitments for zero emissions by 2050”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherSnowNew South WalesVictoriaSouth AustralianewsShareReuse this content"

She made the remarks in an interview with the Guardian.“We’re in pretty big trouble,” Hill said, describing the UK’s geopolitical situation as caught between “the rock” of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and “the hard place” of Donald Trump’s increasingly unpredictable US.Hill, 59, is perhaps the best known of the reviewers appointed by Labour, alongside Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, and the retired general Sir Richard Barrons. She said she was happy to take on the role because it was “such a major pivot point in global affairs”. She remains a dual national after living in the US for more than 30 years.“Russia has hardened as an adversary in ways that we probably hadn’t fully anticipated,” Hill said, arguing that Putin saw the Ukraine war as a starting point to Moscow becoming “a dominant military power in all of Europe”.As part of that long-term effort, Russia was already “menacing the UK in various different ways,” she said, citing “the poisonings, assassinations, sabotage operations, all kinds of cyber-attacks and influence operations. The sensors that we see that they’re putting down around critical pipelines, efforts to butcher undersea cables.”The conclusion, Hill said, was that “Russia is at war with us”. The foreign policy expert, a longtime Russia watcher, said she had first made a similar warning in 2015, in a revised version of a book she wrote about the Russian president with Clifford Gaddy, reflecting on the invasion and annexation of Crimea.“We said Putin had declared war on the west,” she said. At the time, other experts disagreed, but Hill said events since had demonstrated “he obviously had, and we haven’t been paying attention to it”. The Russian leader, she argues, sees the fight in Ukraine as “part of a proxy war with the United States; that’s how he has persuadedChina,North KoreaandIranto join in”.Putin believed that Ukraine had already been decoupled from the US relationship, Hill said, because “Trump really wants to have a separate relationship with Putin to do arms control agreements and also business that will probably enrich their entourages further, though Putin doesn’t need any more enrichment”.When it came to defence, however, she said the UK could not rely on the military umbrella of the US as during the cold war and in the generation that followed, at least “not in the way that we did before”. In her description, the UK “is having to manage its number one ally”, though the challenge is not to overreact because “you don’t want to have a rupture”.This way of thinking appears inthe defence reviewpublished earlier this week, which says “the UK’s longstanding assumptions about global power balances and structures are no longer certain” – a rare acknowledgment in a British government document of how far and how fast Trumpism is affecting foreign policy certainties.View image in fullscreenHill testifying during the hearing into the impeachment of Donald Trump on Capitol Hill in Washington in 2019.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe review team reported to Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, and the defence secretary, John Healey. Most of Hill’s interaction were with Healey, however, and she said she had met the prime minister only once – describing him as “pretty charming … in a proper and correct way” and as “having read all the papers”.Hill was not drawn on whether she had advised Starmer or Healey on how to deal with Donald Trump, saying instead: “The advice I would give is the same I would give in a public setting.” She said simply that the Trump White House “is not an administration, it is a court” in which a transactional president is driven by his “own desires and interests, and who listens often to the last person he talks to”.She added that unlike his close circle, Trump had “a special affinity for the UK” based partly on his own family ties (his mothercame from the Hebridean island of Lewis, emigrating to New York aged 18) and an admiration for the royal family, particularlythe late queen. “He talked endlessly about that,” she said.On the other hand, Hill is no fan of the populist right administration in the White House and worries it could come to Britain if “the same culture wars” are allowed to develop with the encouragement of Republicans from the US.She noted that Reform UK had won a string of council elections last month, including in her native Durham, and that the party’s leader, Nigel Farage, wanted to emulate some of the aggressive efforts to restructure government led by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) before his falling-out with Trump.“When Nigel Farage says hewants to do a Dogeagainst the local county council, he should come over here [to the US] and see what kind of impact that has,” she said. “This is going to be the largest layoffs in US history happening all at once, much bigger than hits to steelworks and coalmines.”Hill’s argument is that in a time of profound uncertainty, Britain needs greater internal cohesion if it is to protect itself. “We can’t rely exclusively on anyone any more,” she said, arguing that Britain needed to have “a different mindset” based as much on traditional defence as on social resilience.Some of that, Hill said, was about a greater recognition of the level of external threat and initiatives for greater integration, by teaching first aid in schools or encouraging more teenagers to join school cadet forces, a recommendation of the defence review. “What you need to do is get people engaged in all kinds of different ways in support of their communities,” she said.Hill said she saw that deindustrialisation and a rise of inequality in Russia and the US had contributed to the rise in national populism in both countries. Politicians in Britain, or elsewhere, “have to be much more creative and engage people where they are at” as part of a “national effort”, she said.If this seems far away from a conventional view of defence, that’s because it is, though Hill also argues that traditional conceptions of war are changing as technology evolves and with it what makes a potent force.“People keep saying the British army has the smallest number of troops since the Napoleonic era. Why is the Napoleonic era relevant? Or that we have fewer ships than the time of Charles II. The metrics are all off here,” she said. “The Ukrainians are fighting with drones. Even though they have no navy, they sank a third of the Russian Black Sea fleet.”Her aim, therefore, is not just to be critical but to propose solutions. Hill recalled that a close family friend, on hearing that she had taken on the defence review, had told her: “‘Don’t tell us how shite we are, tell us what we can do, how we can fix things.’ People understand that we have a problem and that the world has changed.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinForeign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

For long-haul flights delays would have to be six or more hours. Current EU rules dictate that passengers can ask for compensation if their flight is delayed for more than three hours.The EU countries also agreed to increase the amount of compensation for those delayed on short-haul flights from €250 (£211) to €300, but plan to reduce compensation for long-haul flights from €600 to €500.Michael O’Leary to get €100m bonus under deal to keep him at RyanairRead moreThe revision of the EU’s air passenger rights was initially proposed in 2013 by the European Commission. It has taken 12 years of negotiations for member states to reach an agreement on changes to the timeframe for compensation, and the plans still have to be negotiated with the European parliament before they become law.The European Consumer Organisation, the BEUC, said the plan would deprive “the majority of passengers from their compensation rights”, as most delays are between two and four hours.The trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents companies such as Ryanair, easyJet and Lufthansa, also condemned the plan because it wanted delay times to be even longer before compensation payments kick in.Ourania Georgoutsakou, the A4E managing director, said: “Europe has been waiting for transparent and workable passenger rights for 12 years and member states have fallen at the final hurdle to deliver.“Rather than providing delay thresholds of five and nine hours that would save up to 70% of rescuable cancelled flights, member states have diluted the European Commission’s original proposal and introduced even more complexity.”The European Commission’s initial plan included extending the time to five hours for short-haul flights and nine for long-haul.The agreement also includes a “right to be rerouted” when there are long delays, automating forms for compensation and stronger rights for passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He wrote on X: “The text could have been more ambitious, but it is an important step towards improving the quality of service offered to air passengers.”The UK has its own rules on air passenger rights, based on EU regulation. Under these rules, airlines must compensate passengers if their flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late and extraordinary circumstances did not cause the delay.For short-haul flights under 1,500km (932 miles), passengers can be compensated up to £220. This rises to £350 for medium-haul flights between 1,500km and 3,500km. For long-haul flights of more than 3,500km, delayed passengers can be paid up to £520, although this can be lowered to £260 if the passenger arrives at the destination with a delay of less than four hours.However, an EU official said its changes could affect British travellers too, as it applies to passengers taking flights with an EU carrier. This means it could affect a passenger travelling to and from an EU country on an EU airline.Explore more on these topicsAirline industryFlightsConsumer affairsEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Four people were killed, including three emergency workers in Kyiv.The Ukrainian president wrote in a social media post: “If someone does not put pressure and gives the war more time to take lives, they are complicit and responsible. We need to act decisively.”Missiles and drones hammered the Ukrainian capital leading fires to rage through residential buildings and forcing the local metro system to close after a train was hit.It was part of a nationwide assault that ranks among the largest coordinated attacks in the three years of full-scale war, with 44 ballistic and cruise missiles and 407 drones launched. About 50 people were injured across the country.View image in fullscreenFirefighters extinguish a fire in Kyiv after the Russian drone-and-missile attack.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesYurii Ihnat, the Ukrainian air force spokesperson, said Ukrainian forces had shot down about 30 of the cruise missiles and up to 200 of the drones.Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had carried out the overnight attacks in response to what it called Ukrainian “terrorist acts” againstRussia. The Kremlin later described its three-year invasion of Ukraine as “existential” for Russia, casting it as nothing short of a battle for the “future” of Russia.“For us it is an existential issue, an issue on our national interest, safety, on our future and the future of our children, of our country,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters, responding to remarks by Trump on Thursday comparing Moscow and Kyiv to brawling children.On Friday night Trump was more critical of Ukraine, telling reporters on Air Force One that Operation Spiderweb had “given Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them”.Despite the efforts of Ukraine’s air defences, the authorities in Kyiv reported that three emergency workers had been killed and 20 people wounded, of whom 16 had been hospitalised. “Search and rescue operations are ongoing at several locations,” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram.Hegseth says Nato allies ‘very close’ to raising defence spending target to 5%Read moreAccording to the ministry of internal affairs, the three victimswere firefightersfrom the state emergency service who died while responding to the attack. “They were working under fire to help people,” the ministry said in a statement.Operation of the city’s metro transport system was disrupted after a Russian strike damaged a train travelling between stations, the city’s military administration said. The air attack also triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of Kyiv, authorities said.A residential block in the Solomianskyi district took severe damage to the upper floors with entire windows, balcony frames, and parts of an outer wall blown away. More than 2,000 households in Kyiv’s eastern bank remained without electricity on Friday morning.Russia had previouslyvowed to take revengeon Ukraine after Monday’s audacious drone attack, known as Operation Spiderweb, on its bomber fleet.Initially, two TU-95MC and two TU-160MC bombers were deployed by Russia on Thursday night. This was a lower number than had been feared and may have been the result of the Kremlin’s resources being reduced by the events of 1 June. Kalibr missiles were also fired from Russian warships stationed in the Black Sea.Putin informed the US president, Donald Trump, in a call on Wednesday that Russia would respond to the operation that Ukraine has claimed damaged or destroyed 41 aircraft. “They went deep into Russia and [Putin] actually told me we have no choice but to attack based on that, and it’s probably not going to be pretty,” Trump had told reporters.Trump said it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia“fight for a while”rather than pursue peace immediately. Ukraine and Russia met for talks in Istanbul on Monday with no headway to a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies.The barrage on Kyiv had begun with the buzz of Russian kamikaze drones followed by Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire. Through the night the city was shaken by large explosions.View image in fullscreenA man carries his dog in front of a residential building damaged after a Russian drone strike in Kyiv.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APTymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said drones had struck the upper floors of a high-rise apartment building and started a fire in Darnytskyi district on the east side of the city. One unofficial Telegram channel said a shopping centre in the area was ablaze.Tkachenko said a fire had also broken out in an apartment building in a western district. Drone fragments were found in three districts.Ukraine’s commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, demanded a strong international response to Russia’s latest attack. “Russia is acting like a terrorist, systematically targeting civilian infrastructure,” he wrote on Telegram. “The world must respond clearly and take concrete steps, including condemning the aggressor’s actions.”Elsewhere in the country, 10 people were reported injured in the western city of Ternopil, including five emergency workers, said the regional governor, Viacheslav Nehoda.Three people were injured in Ukraine’s central Poltava region after strikes on administrative buildings, warehouses and a cafe. Russian forces also struck the Khmelnytskyi region, damaging a private residential building, outbuildings, and several vehicles.Air defence forces shot down three Russian missiles in the western Lviv region overnight, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A glacier collapsed above the village on 28 May, triggering a landslide. The 300 residents had been evacuated a week earlier, but a 64-year-old man who is believed to have stayed is missing.Tess McClure, the Guardian’s commissioning editor for theAge of Extinction, reported on the aftermath.“The Birch glacier, which sits above Blatten, is this ancient slab of ice,” she tellsHelen Pidd. “It had been loaded up with rocks and debris from the mountain above and just gave way and crumbled.“The millions of tonnes of rock, enormous chunks of ice, all of the mud and trees and debris that it had swept up along the way, all of that just fell down the mountain on to Blatten village.”It will take time for scientists to determine the role that the climate crisis may have played in the collapse, but Tess explains why global heating will make events like this more common.“What we can say is, basically, climate change is affecting all of the ingredients for a disaster like this. So we’re seeing glaciers around the world melt at an incredible rate. They’re shrinking, they’re cracking, they’re growing more unstable.“We’re also seeing permafrost and ice, which in an environment like this is just the glue that holds parts of the earth, parts of the mountain, is kind of holding it all together, that permafrost is also melting.“And we also know that climate change, higher temperatures and mountains are linked, from scientific studies, to higher rates of rockfall and higher rates of that kind of disintegration. So we can’t sort of say yes, the Birch glacier was climate change and climate change alone, but we can look at all of these factors, and all of them are related to global heating.”Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Michael Buholzer/APExplore more on these topicsGlaciersToday in FocusClimate crisisSwitzerlandLandslidesEurope"

What’s wrong with that?” Netanyahu said in a shortvideohe posted on social media. “It only saves the lives of Israeli solders, and publicising this only benefits Hamas.”Strong criticism of the initiative has come from opposition parties in Israel. In a social media post on X, Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats in the Knesset, said: “Netanyahu is a threat to Israel’s national security. Instead of bringing about a deal … bringing the hostages home and providing security for Israeli citizens, he is creating a new ticking timebomb inGaza.”Israel accused of arming Palestinian gang who allegedly looted aid in GazaRead morePalestinians in Gaza marked the start of Eid al-Adha, one of Islam’s most important holidays, on Friday with prayers outside destroyed mosques and homes and food supplies dwindling. Food distribution points run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reopened on Friday before closing a few hours later.Work at the sites was previously halted this week in response to a series of deadly shootings by Israeli soldiers that on Tuesday killed 27 Palestinians and injured hundreds as they were waiting for food. The UN says more than 2,700 children in Gaza are suffering fromacute malnutrition.Israeli jets meanwhile continued to pound the territory and, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency, 38 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military on Friday, including 11 in a single strike in the north. Israel said four soldiers were killed in combat.On Thursday, after the allegations on arming Hamas-opposed clans in Gaza circulated in the media, Netanyahu’s office said Israel “was working to defeatHamasthrough various means, based on the recommendations of all the heads of the security establishment”.The former defence minister and opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman alleged that Abu Shabab’s group was affiliated with Islamic State. “The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister,” Lieberman, who heads the opposition Yisrael Beiteinu party, told Kan Bet public radio.The basis for Lieberman’s allegation of ties to IS was unclear. Abu Shabab’s group has previously been accused of involvement in smuggling operations linked to Egyptian jihadi groups.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Abu Shabab’s involvement with Israeli troops was confirmed last week through several videos circulating on social media in Gaza, showing him operating alongside Israeli soldiers in IDF-controlled areas.Last week, Abu Shabab’s family issued a statement disowning him, accusing him of collaborating with Israeli forces. “We, like everyone else, were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser’s groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces, who are brutally killing our people,” the statement said.“We affirm that we will not accept Yasser’s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.”On 28 May, Jonathan Whittall, the head of United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupiedPalestinian territories, said: “The real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point into Gaza.”When contacted by the Guardian, Whittall confirmed he was “referring to gangs such as Abu Shabab”.On several posts on Facebook, reported by local media, Abu Shabab denied the allegations of looting, saying he was taking the goods only to feed himself and his family.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Despite nationwide protests demanding a ceasefire deal and the release of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza after Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack, Netanyahu’s coalition remains solid, buoyed up by the steadfast support of far-right parties.That unity may soon be tested, however, after the ultra-Orthodox Shas party in Netanyahu’s coalition announced it would support dissolving the Knesset.The Shas party’s decision comes after no significant progress in advancing a law in effect exempting ultra-Orthodox citizens from the military draft.Israel has mandatory army service but for decades made anexemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews, also known as Haredi, who are allowed to continue full-time Torah study. But an alternative plan seeks to extend the duration of military service for conscripts and raise the age for reservists, while also urging an end to the customary exemptions granted to yeshiva students.Due to the war in Gaza, the IDF is saying yeshiva students must be drafted, as it urgently needs an additional 10,000 combat soldiers and about 3,000 soldiers for other roles..Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Within hours of taking office, the president suspended the asylum system at the southern border as part of hiswide-ranging immigration crackdown. His administration has ended temporary legal residency for 211,000 Haitians, 117,000 Venezuelans and 110,000 Cubans, and moved to revoke temporary protected status for several groups of immigrants. It has moved to restrict student visas and root out scholars who have come to the US legally.Trump’s new travel ban: the countries chosen and how it differs from the last oneRead more“It’s death by 1,000 cuts,” said Faisal Al-Juburi of the Texas-based legal non-profit Raices, which was among several immigrants’ rights groups that challenged Trump’s first travel ban. “And that’s kind of the point. It’s creating layers and layers of restrictions.”Trump’s first travel ban in January 2017, issued days after he took office, targeted the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The order came as a shock – including to many administration officials. Customs and Border Protection officials were initially given little guidance on how to enact the ban. Lawyers and protesters rushed to international airports where travellers were stuck in limbo. Confusion spread through colleges and tech companies in the US, and refugee camps across the world.This time, Trump’s travel ban came as no surprise. He had cued up the proclamation in anexecutive ordersigned on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidate countries for a ban by 21 March. Though he finally signed a proclamation enacting the ban on Wednesday, it will not take effect until 9 June – allowing border patrol officers and travellers a few days to prepare.The ban includes several exemptions, including for people with visas who are already in the United States, green-card holders, dual citizens and athletes or coaches traveling to the US for major sporting events such as the World Cup or the Olympics. It also exempts Afghans eligible for thespecial immigrant visa programfor those who helped the US during the war in Afghanistan.But the policy, which is likely to face legal challenges, will undoubtedly once again separate families and disproportionately affect people seeking refuge from humanitarian crises.“This is horrible, to be clear … and it’s still something that reeks of arbitrary racism and xenophobia,” Al-Juburi said. “But this does not yield the type of chaos that January 2017 yielded, because immigration overall has been upended to such a degree that the practice of immigration laws is in a state of chaos.”In his second term, Trump has taken unprecedented steps to tear down legal immigration. He has eliminated the legal status of thousands of international students and instructed US embassies worldwide to stop scheduling visa interviews as it prepares to ramp up social media vetting for international scholars.The administration has arrested people at immigration check-ins, exiled asylum seekers to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, and detained scholars and travellers at airports without reason. Although Trump’s travel ban excludes green-card holders, his Department of Homeland Security has made clear that it can and will revoke green cards as it sees fit – including in the cases of the student activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I think, unfortunately, there’s much more staying power for this ban.”Experts say the new ban is more likely to stand up to legal challenges than his first ban. It also doesn’t appear to have registered the same intense shock and outrage, culturally.“The first time, we saw this immediate backlash, protests at airports,” said Costello. “Now, over time, Trump has normalized this.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The claimant admitted using publicly available AI tools and his solicitor accepted he cited the sham authorities.When Haringey Law Centre challenged the London borough of Haringey over its alleged failure to provide its client with temporary accommodation, its lawyer cited phantom case law five times. Suspicions were raised when the solicitor defending the council had to repeatedly query why they could not find any trace of the supposed authorities.It resulted in a legal action for wasted legal costs and a court found the law centre and its lawyer, a pupil barrister, were negligent. The barrister denied using AI in that case but said she may have inadvertently done so while using Google or Safari in preparation for a separate case where she also cited phantom authorities. In that case she said she may have taken account of AI summaries without realising what they were.In aregulatory rulingresponding to the cases on Friday, Dame Victoria Sharp, the president of the King’s bench division, said there were “serious implications for the administration of justice and public confidence in the justice system if artificial intelligence is misused” and that lawyers misusing AI could face sanctions, from public admonishment to facing contempt of court proceedings and referral to the police.She called on the Bar Council and the Law Society to consider steps to curb the problem “as a matter of urgency” and told heads of barristers’ chambers and managing partners of solicitors to ensure all lawyers know their professional and ethical duties if using AI.“Such tools can produce apparently coherent and plausible responses to prompts, but those coherent and plausible responses may turn out to be entirely incorrect,” she wrote. “The responses may make confident assertions that are simply untrue. They may cite sources that do not exist. They may purport to quote passages from a genuine source that do not appear in that source.”Ian Jeffery, the chief executive of the Law Society of England and Wales, said the ruling “lays bare the dangers of using AI in legal work”.“Artificial intelligence tools are increasingly used to support legal service delivery,” he added. “However, the real risk of incorrect outputs produced by generative AI requires lawyers to check, review and ensure the accuracy of their work.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a UK tax tribunal in 2023, an appellant who claimed to have been helped by “a friend in a solicitor’s office” provided nine bogus historical tribunal decisions as supposed precedents. She admitted it was “possible” she had usedChatGPT, but said it surely made no difference as there must be other cases that made her point.The appellants in a €5.8m (£4.9m) Danish case this year narrowly avoided contempt proceedings when they relied on a made-up ruling that the judge spotted.

He was reported missing two days later, on 9 May.The investigation has so far involved a large-scale search operation, including the use of helicopters, divers, and specialist digital and financial investigators.Police said almost 400 people had been spoken to as part of door-to-door inquiries, and more than 2,000 hours of CCTV footage had been reviewed.Detectives had previously said they were treating the case as a missing person inquiry rather than a criminal investigation.A major incident public portal set up to collect images, footage and information from the public had received numerous submissions, police said.Police added that inquiries were ongoing to establish the full circumstances.Explore more on these topicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

In doing so they have shafted the creative industries, and they have proved willing to decimate the UK’s second-biggest industrial sector. They have lied to parliament, and they are lying to the sector.”She said the government’s action “adds another sector to the growing number that have an unbridgeable gap of trust with the government”.Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the NMA, said: “The government’s refusal to listen to the strong view of the Lords … risks undermining the legislative process.“There is still time for the government to do the right thing, and take transparency powers in this bill.

He is believed to be the first person to be charged with the specific offence.The art dealer, who has also appeared on the BBC’s Antiques Road Trip, was charged with failing to disclose information about transactions in the regulated art market sector on or before dates between October 2020 and December 2021.US prosecutors say Ahmad was a “major Hezbollah financial donor” who used high-value art and diamonds to launder money and fund the group.Ahmad is accused of evading terrorism sanctions by using front companies to acquire more than $160m (£118m) in artwork and diamond services.After the introduction of new money-laundering regulations in January 2020 that brought the art market under HMRC supervision, Ojiri is said to have discussed the changes with a colleague, indicating awareness of the rules.The court previously heard the total value of the artworks sold was about £140,000.Lyndon Harris, prosecuting, said the defendant was, at the relevant time, the owner and operator of Ramp Gallery, later known as Ojiri Gallery.Ahmad is understood to be based in Beirut, the court heard.Harris said: “The defendant engaged in discussions with and sales over a 14-month period with Nazem Ahmad and his associates, selling art to the value of £140,000 over that period.”The defendant knew that US sanctions had been placed on Ahmad, a previous hearing was told. Ahmad’s phone number was saved on Ojiri’s phone as “Moss”, the court heard.“[It] appears to have been a name deliberately chosen to disguise Mr Ahmad as being one of his contacts,” Harris said, adding that Ojiri was warned by others about his conduct “but proceeded to engage in dealings with Ahmad in any event”.Gavin Irwin, defending, said Ojiri was arrested while filming a BBC TV programme.He said: “He has lost the work he loves. He was arrested while filming a BBC television programme. He has already lost, of course, his good name; he was until recently a man of good character.”Irwin said the defendant had been “naive” in relation to his participation in Ahmad’s art market, but that he was “preyed on by more sophisticated others”.He also said the defendant had lost his business, accepted that he had done wrong, and wanted to “apologise for undermining trust in the industry” and “apologise for the distress that he has caused principally to those who know him, who love him, but also those who have supported him throughout his career”.Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb sentenced Ojiri to two years and six months in prison at the Old Bailey on Friday, with a further year to be spent on licence.She told Ojiri he had been involved in a commercial relationship “for prestige and profit” and that he had been “seeking the kudos of dealing with an eminent name in the dealing world”.She added: “You knew about Ahmad’s suspected involvement in financing terrorism and the way the art market can be exploited by someone like him.”Cheema-Grubb said that until these events he had been “someone to be admired”, and added: “This is the nadir – there is one direction your life can go and I am confident that you will not be in front of the courts again.”The judge said the offences were so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified.Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said: “The prosecution, using specific Terrorism Act legislation, is the first of its kind, and should act as a warning to all art dealers that we can, and will, prosecute those who knowingly do business with people identified as funders of terrorist groups.“Oghenochuko Ojiri wilfully obscured the fact he knew he was selling artwork to Nazem Ahmad, someone who has been sanctioned by the UK and US treasury and described as a funder of the proscribed terrorist group Hizballah.“Financial investigation is a crucial part of the counter-terrorism effort. A team of specialist investigators, analysts and researchers in the NTFIU [national terrorist financial investigation unit] work all year round to prevent money from reaching the hands of terrorists or being used to fund terrorist attacks.”Ojiri has appeared on a number of BBC shows including Bargain Hunt and Antiques Road Trip, and described himself as “absolutely obsessed” with collecting contemporary art in a BBC Q&A.Ojiri has previously worked as an auctioneer and is known for championing African and European contemporary art.Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political and militant group based in Lebanon, backed by Iran and known for its armed resistance against Israel.In the UK, the entire organisation – both its military and political wings – has been proscribed as a terrorist group since 2019.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCrimeBBCUK security and counter-terrorismThe art marketnewsShareReuse this content"

Musk stepped back from his government work last month and is nowpublicly feudingwith Trump.TheTrump administrationsaid Doge needed access to the information to fulfill its goal of targeting waste and fraud in the federal government and saving taxpayer money.Musk had identified social security as an area he claimed was rife with fraud. The billionaire tech executive once said social security – which provides benefits to more than 70 million Americans, including retirees and disabled Americans – was “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”. He and Trump have repeated inaccurate claims that millions of people born over a century ago are collecting social security checks.US supreme court sides with heterosexual woman in ‘reverse discrimination’ caseRead more“Today, the court grants a stay permitting the government to give unfettered data access to Doge regardless – despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards, and all before we know for sure whether federal law countenances such access,” Jackson wrote in her dissent.“The court is thereby, unfortunately, suggesting that what would be an extraordinary request for everyone else is nothing more than an ordinary day on the docket for this administration.”The lawsuit was brought by labor unions and an advocacy group, which sued to block Doge from accessing the agency’s databases, which store the personal information of nearly every American, including financial information, medical history and school records.“This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs, said. “This ruling will enable President Trump and Doge’s affiliates to steal Americans’ private and personal data. Elon Musk may have left Washington DC, but his impact continues to harm millions of people.“We will continue to use every legal tool at our disposal to keep unelected bureaucrats from misusing the public’s most sensitive data as this case moves forward.”In April, Judge Ellen Hollander, of the US district court for Maryland, imposed strict restrictions on access to the records, citing the agency’s “abiding commitment to the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information entrusted to it by the American people”.“For some 90 years, [the] SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records,” she wrote. “This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation.”Her order directed Doge employees, and social security employees working with them, to “disgorge and delete” any personal information already in their possession.News that the Doge team had sought access to the data raised alarms among federal workers, privacy advocates and Democrats who charged that Musk could use the information to benefit his private companies. At town halls, many constituents demanded their elected leaders protect their data from Doge.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtData protectionTrump administrationPrivacyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s what matters’Read moreThe city had argued the rule wasn’t specific to yoga, but commercial activity, as the instructors Steven Hubbard and Amy Baack’s free classes can draw as many as 100 people who give donations for each class ranging from $5 to $40.“The city’s legitimate governmental interests in this case include the preservation, safety, and orderly use of its parks and beaches by all visitors and residents who visit them,” San Diego’s attorneys wrote in court papers, adding that the city and county drew 32 million visitors in 2023.By Thursday, Hubbard had resumed teaching yoga to a dozen people underneath palm trees in the park at Pacific Beach. He said he was cited for his classes, which are free and open to all, at least 10 times since the ordinance took effect last year.He began holding classes on a live stream from his backyard, just across the street from the beach. Bryan Pease, a lawyer for both instructors, said a park official cited Hubbard for holding classes in the park even though he was not there.Outdoor yoga is a service to those who are disabled or cannot afford yoga classes elsewhere, said Pease.“It is a popular thing here. We’re a beach community, and it’s a way for people to access yoga that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to,” Pease said.At the Pacific Beach park, John Noack, who has attended Hubbard’s classes for four years, said he thought the group was targeted because wealthy homeowners in the area did not want people disturbing their oceanfront views.“I personally see this as a triumph of community over a handful of elites,” Noack said.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaSan DiegoYogaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, unchanged from last month.May’s jobs report was dragged down by the loss of 22,000 federal workers’ jobs as theTrump administrationused the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to cut government positions. Since January, 59,000 Federal jobs have been cut.The Bureau of Labor Statistics also cut the numbers of jobs created in March and April. In an update, the bureau said a total of 95,000 fewer jobs had been created over the two months.After the report was released, Trump once again called on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell (whom he has nicknamed “Too Late”), to cut interest rates.Donald Trump to meet Xi Jinping in China after ‘very good’ call on tradeRead more“‘Too Late’ at the Fed is a disaster! Europe has had 10 rate cuts, we have had none. Despite him, our Country is doing great.

In April, the annual inflation rate was at 2.3%, a slight decrease from March, though economists said that the impact ofTrump’s tariffswill be gradual and probably will not impact data until the summer.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataUS economyEconomicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

In an interviewwith ABC News, Trump was asked about reports of a potentially peacemaking phone call scheduled with Musk for later in the day, to which Trump responded, “You mean the man who has lost his mind?” and added that he was “not particularly” interested in talking to his former confidant right now.The president also spoke to CNN, saying: “I’m not even thinking about Elon. He’s got a problem. The poor guy’s got a problem,” andtold Politicothat the relationship with Musk was “going very well, never done better”.The New York Times reported, in private conversations, that Trump had attributed Musk’s behavior to drug use.As well as giving many people a reason to return to X – the social media site Musk owns and where he has recently been amplifying rightwing, pro-Trump views – the bitter fight could heavily affect the political landscape.Musk suggested starting a new political party, one “that actually represents the 80% in the middle”, and, given his wealth, he would be able to pump millions into next year’s midterm elections, potentially influencing races across the country.In the space industry, meanwhile, Nasa has become increasingly reliant on Musk’s SpaceX company, with the Dragon spacecraft being used to transport the agency’s astronauts to and from the International Space Station, and Musk pledged to decommission the Dragon in the wake of the Trump fight. He quicklysignalled an about-face, but it was a reminder of Musk’s influence, which is further bolstered by the key role the Starlink satellite broadband platform plays in Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion.Trump, meanwhile, threatened to cancel Musk’s US government contracts, and the president’s ally Steve Bannon suggested that Musk, a South African-born American citizen, “should be deported from the country immediately”. In a sign of the immediate impact on Musk, his net worth fell by $33bn on Thursday alone, whileTesla’s shares initially droppedby about 14.2%, wiping roughly $152bn off the value of the company.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump said he was “very disappointed in Elon” over the criticism, as Musk said Trump’s trade policies would cause a recession, before the dispute escalated wildly.Many had predicted that the relationship between Musk and Trump, two men known for their large egos and unpredictable behavior, could not last, but the sheer level of vitriol stunned Americans and would seem to make a reconciliation unlikely.Musk did at leastappear to profferan olive branch in a reply to a post from the hedge fund owner Bill Ackman, who called on Trump and Musk to “make peace for the benefit of our great country”, but on Friday Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, told NBC News “there are no plans” for a call between the two men.In the meantime, it was business as usual for Trump on Friday, with the president offering a series of misleading takes on the US job market, which new figures showslowed in May. Musk was unusually quiet on social media, as Tesla’s shares rebounded somewhat from Thursday’s loss,rising by 6%, although at least one customer seemed keen to divest from the company: the White House said on Friday that Trump plans to sell his Tesla Model S.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskTeslaTrump administrationSpaceXUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

While Britain quickly moved to try to cushion the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs witha deal agreed last month– and US-Chinese relations area tit-for-tat situation– the EU has taken a different stance. “We are positioning ourselves between ‘rollover UK’ and ‘retaliatory China’,” said a Brussels source.The stakes are not just the £706bn in transatlantic trade between the EU and US but the fallout from what diplomats and businesses say is a dangerous assault on the global rules-based system that governs western democracy.“The only thing that appeals to Trump is power. Amid all the nausea and uncertainty here, there is a significant chance the EU will go the whole way and not do a deal,” said a diplomat in the Belgian capital.“If the EU doesn’t stand up to Trump or demand the rigours of rules, the question will be: what is left of the international rules based system?” the source added, noting the risk to employment rights, free speech, social welfare and public care.The EU’s steadfast strategy is high-risk, and has weeks to play out before the 90-day pause in Trump’s threat to impose 20% tariffs on all EU imports ends in July. He has already slapped a 10% tariff on all exports, with more on autos and steel, which this weekwent to 50%.View image in fullscreenThe volatility in the transatlantic relationship on European business is unprecedented.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images“If in the end, if we are the only ones on the pitch, people will start to say we should have been more like the Chinese,” said one EU official, with demands for retaliation expected to arise “very quickly from member states”.The biggest pothole in what threatens to be a bumpy road ahead may bea Nato summit on 24 Junewhen Trump, who has shown visceral antipathy towards the EU, may find fault in what he considers freeloading allies.Right now, EU member states are united in their resolve not to capitulate in the face of his demands, which include the removal of non-tariff barriers such as food standards.“What the US is doing has brought us together, and there’s a sense of urgency of that cooperation within the 27 that is quite important,” says one diplomat.There is even a growing acceptance that US tariffs of more than 10% are a long-term reality. “Ideally less than 10%, so it doesn’t look like we have rolled over,” says one Brussels official. Before Trump took office for the second time the average tariff on US imports in the EU was about 2.5%.View image in fullscreenBefore Trump took office for the second time the average tariff on US imports in the EU was about 2.5%.Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe EU’s chief negotiator, Maroš Šefčovič, said on multiple occasions this week that he was “optimistic” a deal would be done, but back at base, trade war preparations continue. “We are keeping the gun on the shelf. We don’t want to use it, but we want them to know it is there,” said one diplomat.Šefčovič said on Friday he had held another call with the US secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick. “Our time and effort fully invested, as delivering forward-looking solutions remains a top EU priority. Staying in permanent contact,” he wrote on X.View image in fullscreenUrsula von der Leyen and Kaja Kallas (back)Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAMeanwhile, twin talks took place this week in Paris at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and in Washington with a team of EU officials led by Tomas Baert, trade adviser to theEuropean Commissionpresident, Ursula von der Leyen.Those talks helped “clean the slate, clear the table”, Šefčovič told a conference organised by the European Policy Centre, a thinktank, on Thursday in Brussels.He added that he had also discussed the continued threat of sectoral tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors with the US trade representative Jamieson Greer in Paris.Šefčovič said his message was that the US and the EU had mutual interests in re-industrialisation on both sides of the Atlantic, and in minimising China’s unstoppable rise in key sectors such as electric vehicles and steel.“Any obstacle in the middle of the Atlantic would simply make them less competitive and more vulnerable. This is the diplomatic, political but also very technical discussions we are having,” he said.Up to now negotiations have been somewhat hampered by the parallel universe occupied by the US president, and White House and EU officials.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU is taking a different approach to Trump’s tariffs.Photograph: Lisa O’CarrollThe volatility in the transatlantic relationship on European business is unprecedented.“I have been here 10 years and I have never seen this level of nervousness, not during the pandemic, not after the invasion of Ukraine,” said a director at one trade group representing dozens of multinationals in Brussels, who declined to be named.Luisa Santos, the deputy director general at Confederation of Business Europe, which represents 42 national business federations, said trade would, like water, find its course but investment could prove the collateral damage.“The whole basis of trade is WTO [World Trade Organization] rules,” she said. “We agreed on the rules and they were accepted the consequences. Now the rule is the power game: ‘I will impose what I think is best for me, and the bigger players with more power determine the rules and that is a huge change.”Santos added: “I think the biggest shock in Europe is that we were supposed to be the traditional allies. But now we are basically put on the same basket as China.”Kyle Martin, the vice-president of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, whose members include Boeing and Airbus, said tariffs would end a 45-year-old US-EU agreement that aviation construction, which relies on a global supply chain, was duty-free.A Boeing 787 gets its front fuselage from Italy, its wings from Japan and doors from France, with assembly at home in Seattle, he pointed out.“I don’t see this having a positive [outcome] for either Boeing or Airbus or any other manufacturer. Everyone will be impacted because everyone’s got an interconnected supply chain.”But while negotiations with the US continue, new EU agreements with India, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Africa and Australia are also on the cards.Ultimately it is the profound shift in the world order that is bothering many in Brussels.The US was behaving “like a very unevolved state”, said one EU source, like a developing country that relied on customs duties for national revenue in the absence of income tax, corporate tax and VAT. “Maybe this is what Trump wants, a smaller, leaner weaker state where everybody has to pay for themselves,” they said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTrump tariffsInternational tradeDonald TrumpEuropean CommissionGlobal economyTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For long-haul flights delays would have to be six or more hours. Current EU rules dictate that passengers can ask for compensation if their flight is delayed for more than three hours.The EU countries also agreed to increase the amount of compensation for those delayed on short-haul flights from €250 (£211) to €300, but plan to reduce compensation for long-haul flights from €600 to €500.Michael O’Leary to get €100m bonus under deal to keep him at RyanairRead moreThe revision of the EU’s air passenger rights was initially proposed in 2013 by the European Commission. It has taken 12 years of negotiations for member states to reach an agreement on changes to the timeframe for compensation, and the plans still have to be negotiated with the European parliament before they become law.The European Consumer Organisation, the BEUC, said the plan would deprive “the majority of passengers from their compensation rights”, as most delays are between two and four hours.The trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents companies such as Ryanair, easyJet and Lufthansa, also condemned the plan because it wanted delay times to be even longer before compensation payments kick in.Ourania Georgoutsakou, the A4E managing director, said: “Europe has been waiting for transparent and workable passenger rights for 12 years and member states have fallen at the final hurdle to deliver.“Rather than providing delay thresholds of five and nine hours that would save up to 70% of rescuable cancelled flights, member states have diluted the European Commission’s original proposal and introduced even more complexity.”The European Commission’s initial plan included extending the time to five hours for short-haul flights and nine for long-haul.The agreement also includes a “right to be rerouted” when there are long delays, automating forms for compensation and stronger rights for passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He wrote on X: “The text could have been more ambitious, but it is an important step towards improving the quality of service offered to air passengers.”The UK has its own rules on air passenger rights, based on EU regulation. Under these rules, airlines must compensate passengers if their flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late and extraordinary circumstances did not cause the delay.For short-haul flights under 1,500km (932 miles), passengers can be compensated up to £220. This rises to £350 for medium-haul flights between 1,500km and 3,500km. For long-haul flights of more than 3,500km, delayed passengers can be paid up to £520, although this can be lowered to £260 if the passenger arrives at the destination with a delay of less than four hours.However, an EU official said its changes could affect British travellers too, as it applies to passengers taking flights with an EU carrier. This means it could affect a passenger travelling to and from an EU country on an EU airline.Explore more on these topicsAirline industryFlightsConsumer affairsEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The world No 1 continued to demonstrate his superiority over all challengers at Roland Garros as he closed out a supremely clutch performance againstNovak Djokovic, the sixth seed, with a 6-4, 7-5, 7-6 (3) win to reach the final of the French Open for the first time.Sinner has now won 20 straight matches at grand slam tournaments and on Sunday he will attempt to win his third straight major title. He is the fifth man this century to reach three consecutive grand slam finals, following the path of the four legendary players before him: Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray. He has still not dropped a set in Paris this year.French Open 2025 semi-finals: Sinner v Djokovic, Alcaraz battles past Musetti – liveRead moreA long-awaited first major final between the two leading players of the new generation awaits. Sinner, the No 1, will next face the second seed Carlos Alcaraz, who defeated Lorenzo Musetti 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0 ret, in what will be the first major final between two players born in the 2000s. Sinner has been untouchable on hard courts at the biggest events over the past 18 months, but he now will attempt to win his first significant title on clay, against an opponent who beat him on the surface in the final in Rome only three weeks ago. That was the fourth time in a row Alcaraz had prevailed against Sinner.Two days after producing a magnificent performance to scupper Alexander Zverev, the third seed, and advance to his second consecutive major semi-final, Djokovic returned to Court Philippe-Chatrier attempting to become the oldest Roland Garros finalist in history. Although the 38-year-old has continued to register wins over many of the best players in the world, Sinner has proven a step too far.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner plays a backhand return to Novak Djokovic.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesFrom the start, Sinner set the bar high by imposing relentless pressure on Djokovic with his suffocating pace and weight of shot, narrowing the court with his defence and offering so few errors. Under immediate pressure to match Sinner’s level, Djokovic struggled to find his range and the world No 1 took an emphatic first set.As the Serb tried to find a way back, he left his heart on Chatrier, throwing himself into every shot and maintaining his effort until the end. After years of battling adversarial crowds, Djokovic’s status as the tour’s elder statesman and an underdog against the new generation has earned him significant respect and support. He called on the crowd to contribute at every potential turning point. “I don’t think I have ever received this much support in this stadium in my career in big matches against the best players in the world,” said Djokovic. “So very, very honoured to experience that.”Quick GuideKlugman makes history in juniorsShowHannah Klugman has become the first British player to reach the French Open juniors final in almost 50 years.The 16-year-old from Kingston-upon-Thames battled through to her maiden grand slam final after a gritty 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over the Bulgarian Rositsa Dencheva.Klugman is the first Briton to achieve the feat since Michelle Tyler claimed the title in 1976, the same year Sue Barker won the women’s event.Klugman will face 17-year-old Austrian Lilli Tagger in Saturday’s final.Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski are through to the final of the men’s doubles.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Although Sinner was clearly nervous in numerous tense moments in the final two sets, and the crowd tried to pressure him, his focus and intensity never wavered. Every time the moment required it, he found his best tennis. After failing to serve for the second set at 5-4, Sinner responded with an immediate break and hold to close it out. In a tense third set, he saved three set points on his serve at 4-5 before sealing the victory with an excellent tie-break.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic screams in frustration during his battling performance at Roland Garros.Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite his tireless fighting spirit, Djokovic spent the entire match behind on the scoreboard, desperately fighting for a breakthrough. As is the case for almost anyone across the net from Sinner these days, the world No 1 did not allow that to happen.As he departed Philippe-Chatrier, a court that has witnessed three of his grand slam titles and his long-awaited Olympic gold medal, an emotional Djokovic placed his bags down and took a moment to thank all corners of the crowd before bending down to touch the red clay. “This could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don’t know,” said Djokovic. “That’s why I was a bit more emotional even in the end. But if this was the farewell match of Roland Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd.”Asked to elaborate, Djokovic shrugged. He does not know when his journey will come to an end. “I really don’t know what tomorrow brings at this point in my career,” he said, smiling. “I’m going to keep on keeping on.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Jannik SinnerNovak DjokovicFrench OpenTennismatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Marco Silva of Fulham is also in the running.Postecoglou led Spurs toEuropa League gloryon 21 May, beating ­Manchester United in the final in ­Bilbao to end a 17-year trophy drought. It sparked delirium among fans, an outpouring of relief and the feeling among some of them that he deserved the chance to continue in the role.But the chair, Daniel Levy, and the rest of the board, having taken stock since the final game of the season against Brighton on 25 May, reached the unanimous conclusion that Postecoglou had to go based on performances in the Premier League over most of his two-year tenure.Ange-ball was breath of fresh air but Europa League alone could not save him | David HytnerRead morePostecoglou won eight and drew two of his opening 10 games in the league, having arrived from Celtic with Spurs at a low ebb on the back of an eighth-placed finish in 2022‑23. But his league record since then showed 78 points from 66 matches – a detail that Spurs printed in the ­statement they issued at a little after 5pm BST to confirm Postecoglou’s departure.The club also highlighted how the 17th-placed finish in this past season – with 38 points – was their worst of the Premier League era. Only once have they had a worse league record, in 1914-15.As reported earlier on Friday, Spurs have met with intermediaries to discuss a move for Frank, who has impressed with his stellar work at Brentford. The Dane took the reins in west London in October 2018 when they were in the Championship and got them promoted via the playoffs in 2020-21. He has established them in the top flight; they finished this past season 10th with 56 points.Spurs admire the job that Silva has done at Fulham but Frank appears to be the No 1. target. Every player and member of staff at ­Brentford has a price. Tottenham must decide whether to pay the £10m. The club have also shown an interest in Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and Oliver Glasner of Crystal Palace – both appear out of reach.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank has impressed Spurs with his work at Brentford.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAPostecoglou will go down as a hero at Spurs because of Bilbao and he released an emotional statement shortly after his sacking, saying he was “forever connected” to his players and staff, not to mention the supporters.

We have also laid ­foundations that mean this club should not have to wait 17 more years for their next success.”The Spurs statement ­acknowledged how Postecoglou had sought to return the club to a more attacking style while there was ­gratitude for the trophy he delivered, a line ­noting he was now “alongside ­legendary figures Bill Nicholson and Keith ­Burkinshaw” as managers who have triumphed in Europe.It said: “At times there were ­extenuating circumstances [for the poor league form] – injuries and then a decision to prioritise our European campaign. Whilst winning the Europa League ranks as one of the club’s greatest moments, we cannot base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph.

While the tournament’s name may allude to a glory conferred by the most valuable of precious metals, the whole thing remains among the ugly ducklings of global continental championships.If you’re the US, lifting the biennial Gold Cup this summer would amount to winning it for an eighth time overall and a sixth in a quarter century. There’s no novelty to it, no real sense of upward momentum on the long-sought ascent to a higher international plane. Fail to win it, however, and there will be an inquest and existential questions, even though this incarnation of the American roster ismissing a half dozen-or-so key pieces, depending on how you count them.But if the optics of the Gold Cup are zero-sum, it retains an intrinsic value to the Yanks less in the thing itself than in what it simulates: aWorld Cup. Squint, and pretend that you’re playing, say, Poland and South Korea instead of Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago, and there’s something useful in going through the cadence of a competitive summer tournament. Even if the opponents are just the same old regional foes – fellow Group D denizens Saudi Arabia excepted, as they’re a guest team – the slow boil and gathering momentum of an unspooling tournament offers helpful experience.In an inexperienced US squad, Chris Richards’ presence will be keyRead moreCertainly, the hope was that the 2025 Gold Cup would be an exercise in putting the finishing touches on a supposed golden generation, positioning all the piecesjust soas the team prepared for a career-defining summer next year while hosting the 2026 World Cup. Going through a tournament one last time would be a final chance to spot and address the flaws and fissures in the foundation. Winning it, if at all possible, would be a kind of byproduct of all that finessing and finetuning.Instead, the Americans will spend the summer trying to rehabilitate their battered reputation afterMarch’s Concacaf Nations League debacle. The discourse willprobably be dominatedby who isn’t thereas much as who is.Yet there can still be some real use in this exercise. It’s even feasible that the USMNT could have a good summer by showing some signs of life.“I don’t think there’s any denying that some of our performances have fallen short over the past year to 18 months,” said defender Walker Zimmerman. “It’s something that us, as players, we obviously aren’t satisfied with, and it’s a big focal point for this camp. It’s always such a great opportunity to have a month in front of the staff, get a lot of quality trainings in together, and find yourself hopefully getting into a rhythm of playing multiple games where you can put everything on the line to try to make a World Cup team in a year’s time. It’s a massive opportunity.”All the absences underscore just how prone a summer tournament is to the flukes of form and fitness. But head coach Mauricio Pochettino has a chance to scour his overhauled roster for a few new depth pieces and tactical alternatives in among all the fresh faces, sourced inunexpected number from Major League Soccer. The USMNT’s lineup has been largely ossified going back a half decade or so now, and when given a chance, more pleasant surprises like Real Salt Lake’s spitfire midfielder Diego Luna might well present themselves. Or players who can offer the American attack a different look anyway, on the semi-regular days when Plan A isn’t working.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Malik Tillman, the Bayern Munich castoff, has established himself as one of the best players in the Dutch Eredivisie in an attacking midfielder role where the U.S. could really use a spark. While contributing hugely to PSV’s second straight league title, however, Tillman has been largely anonymous for the national team. This is also true of the New Jersey-born, Brazilian-raised Johnny Cardoso who, like Tillman, is 23. So impressive in his season-and-a-half with Real Betis has Cardoso been that a move to mighty Atlético Madrid is reportedly imminent.With a full national team complement in camp, Tillman and Cardoso would have gotten lost in the shuffle, either the odd men out in the midfield logjam or pushed out of their best positions. Here, now, is a chance for them to make their case, or at least pose some questions about whether the incumbents really ought to be automatic starters.The importance of identity and tactical systems probably gets overstated at the national team level, where a dearth of time means that an awful lot of teams play broadly the same way. But the coming month does offer Pochettino a chance to cultivate some of the closeness and feistiness that his best club teams displayed. There is perhaps a larger exploration to be undertaken at some point about the ways in which the improved conditions and job security of the modern American player have undercut the existential belligerence the Yanks used to play with, but, for now, any kind of low-level aggravation will do.Some bite. A little more getting-after-it intensity, even when the stadium is half-empty and the opponent unthreatening, on paper at least. There would be as much value in unlocking any of those intangibles as there would in winning the Gold Cup, even if that’s the macro expectation.“I think I’d be lying if I didn’t say, ‘Lifting that trophy on the final day’ would be what we would consider success. I think that’s the standard we’ve set for ourselves,” said goalkeeper Matt Turner. “But at the same time, things happen in soccer, and I think what we need to control is what we bring to the table every single day: the intensity, the way we push each other, the passion, the energy, the connection with the fans, with each other, with the staff. We’re going to be together for a long period of time and it’s a really good opportunity for us to put a lot of things together, tactically, technically, emotionally.”Taken together, these alternative accomplishments would probably make for a satisfying summer of national team soccer. They might even compensate for a failure to win the Gold Cup.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

In recent years, the later rounds of theNBAplayoffs – and the finals in particular – have felt rote. They’ve gone chalk. The drama was minimal, even under the brightest lights of the league’s biggest stage. This year has been different: a playoffs filled with suspense, tension and plot twists galore. But at the start of the finals, the scene was set for a regression to the intrigue-less mean. Every roundtable pundit, basketball expert and barbershop patron outside of Indiana state lines had Oklahoma City – basketball’s best team from wire to wire – winning the series easily.But Tyrese Haliburton, the instigator of several of this postseason’s most jaw-dropping twists, knows a thing or two about drama. It oozes out of his pores. And he and his Indiana Pacershad other plans.Quick GuideNBA finals 2025ShowScheduleBest-of-seven-games series.

On a night when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the regular-season MVP, scored 38 points and no Indiana player topped 19, it should have been a wrap. The Thunder’s suffocating defense, among the league’s best, forced a famously ball-conscious Indiana team – one that averages just 12 turnovers a game – into coughing it up 19 times in the first half alone. That’s hardly a recipe for success. Yet somehow, the Pacers came out victorious, against the odds, against the physics, against conventional basketball logic. Because that’s what they do. You can’t beat the Pacers by playing 47 minutes and 59.7 seconds of winning basketball. They demand all 48.Tyrese Haliburton’s moment of reflection sheds light on stars’ secret struggles | Sean IngleRead moreThis was the fifth comeback victory of 15 or more points for the Pacersthis postseason alone,themost by any NBA teamin the play-by-play era. Haliburton has hit a game-winning shot in all four rounds of these playoffs, each feeling more improbable than the last: his Pacers have been underdogs in each of those series and never more so than they were when they entered the Paycom Center on Thursday. For all the talk heading into the series about how Indiana had never seen a defense like the Oklahoma City’s, we seem to have forgotten, as a general basketball viewing populace, about another key factor: Oklahoma City have never seen a team like Indiana in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter.“They have a lot of belief,” Oklahoma City head coach Mark Daignault said, after his team’s dispiriting loss, of his ballsy Indiana opponent. “They never think they’re out of it. So they play with great belief, even when their backs are against the wall.” That belief – unwavering, unshakable – is Indiana’s secret sauce. And with every impossible comeback, it compounds on itself. The more they pull off, the less impossible it all feels.After Thursday’s win, Haliburton reflected on where that belief started: last year’shumiliating sweep in the Eastern Conference finals. “After you have a run like last year but end up getting swept – and all the conversation is about how you didn’t belong there, how you lucked out, how it was a fluke – guys are gonna spend the summer pissed off,” he said. “Then you come into this year, and after an unsuccessful first couple of months, it’s easy for everybody to clown you. I think, as a group, we take everything personal.”View image in fullscreenIndiana’s Tyrese Haliburton rises up for his game-winning shot on Thursday night in Oklahoma City.Photograph: Nathaniel S Butler/NBAE/Getty ImagesOn the character of his team, which has left opposing crowds stunned at every turn this postseason, he sums it up simply: “We don’t give up until it’s zero on the clock.”Haliburton says being the underdog, proving people wrong, has become part of the team’s identity. “It’s fun,” he says, to win when you’re not supposed to. And this win, like all of Indiana’s wins have been , was a true team effort – even if Haliburton’s flair for the dramatic grabs most of the headlines. It was a true win by committee, whether it was Aaron Nesmith muscling his way to a critical rebound on a bad ankle, Andrew Nembhard coming up with late-game heroics on both ends (including a huge stop on Gilgeous-Alexander), or Obi Toppin scoring 11 of his 17 points in the second half off the bench. All five Pacers starters scored in double figures – so did Toppin – but none cracked 20.It’s probably not the platonic ideal for a basketball team to rely on procuring its biggest wins in such white-knuckle fashion, but the Pacers sure are good at it, and it makes for a hell of an entertainment product. And in the highly competitive and intense NBA postseason, where wins become harder and harder to come by, teams will take them however they can, messy and chaotic as they may be. After Thursday’s instant classic, Haliburton summed up the Indiana ethos succinctly: “Come May and June, it doesn’t matter how you get ‘em. Just get ‘em.”Explore more on these topicsNBA finalsBasketballNBAIndiana PacersUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he is aware that searing temperatures await at many of the venues for the finals in the US, Canada and Mexico next summer and, as such, it will be vital to be able to play in different styles.England looked jaded under Gareth Southgate at Euro 2024 with some players, including the captain, Harry Kane, below their best, though they did battle through to the final.Squad goals: Toney’s inclusion offers window into Tuchel’s England approachRead more“The tournaments are normally played after a long season and it is not maybe an advantage for us but it is just a fact,” Tuchel said. “It is maybe not a coincidence that players felt the most comfortable in the Qatar World Cup and suddenly the demands of the Premier League became an advantage because they were in the middle of it and they had an advantage over other players.“It can be that at some point we need to adjust our style when it comes to tournament football, knockout football. Everyone wants to win, everyone wants to win in style. Can you really play the same game in 40C heat and humidity that you play in 20C in an evening match? These are some questions and I don’t have all the answers and I don’t have to right now because we still have one year to go. But we are on it to answer them.”Tuchel reported that Bukayo Saka was a selection doubt for Andorra with an unspecified injury sustained on the final day of the Premier League season for Arsenal against Southampton. The winger trained fully only on Friday. He is expected to be fine for Tuesday’s friendly against Senegal in Nottingham. Ollie Watkins has a minor muscle problem and has withdrawn from the squad.The international window comes before the Club World Cup, when 10 of Tuchel’s squad will be involved, including five Chelsea players – Reece James, Levi Colwill, Trevoh Chalobah, Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke. The others are Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Conor Gallagher (Atlético Madrid), Kane (Bayern Munich) and Ivan Toney (Al-Ahli).View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham is one of 10 England players going to the Club World Cup.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty ImagesTuchel claimed he had felt no pressure from club managers over the use of these players against Andorra and Senegal, although he said they should not worry because he had many players to look at and so would be managing the minutes regardless. The point was that they would be his decisions. It may be Andorra, ranked 173rd in the world, but it would be vital to go strong and get everything out of the game; to work on establishing patterns and principles.“No coach has called me and there was no request from the FA,” Tuchel said. “We know the clubs have a lot of matches and the players go after to he Club World Cup. It can also happen that some players start twice for us but we have an interest to see a lot of players, so I think we will not upset anyone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And how good is our reaction to ball losses to play counter-pressing. I don’t get lost in thinking about formations at the moment. It’s more about behaviour and giving headlines for certain matches.”Tuchel said it was a “big loss” for the England under-21s to have been denied the services of Liam Delap for the European Under-21 Championship finals; the striker has just moved from Ipswich to Chelsea and will go with them to the Club World Cup.Tuchel also sought to reassure Jack Grealish, who he has left out of his squad, saying he still loved him and considered him a part of the future with England. He added that he had spoken to Grealish after the FA Cup final when the winger was an unused substitute for Manchester City in the defeat against Crystal Palace.Explore more on these topicsEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThomas TuchelAndorranewsShareReuse this content"

Bellamy was appointed head coach in July 2024 and the national side have drawn four and won five since he was named. Wales leapfrogged North Macedonia, who drew 1-1 against Belgium. The Red Devils are only just getting their qualifiers under way because they were involved in Nations League playoffs in March.Belgium are the favourites to top the group and qualify automatically for next year’s tournament. But Wales’s great run has put them in a good position to challenge Domenico Tedesco’s Belgium, who they play on Monday and have a history of upsetting, with a famous 3-1 win in the quarter-finals of Euro 2016.Iceland humiliate sorry Scotland on night of alarm for Steve ClarkeRead more“There was a lot I liked tonight,” Bellamy said. “I would really like us to make this [result] six, seven, eight. That’s what we have to push. These games have never been easy for our nation. We have a proven record of that. The chances we created, we can make this more. We will get to that …“We have got a very tough game coming Monday. I will watch the game back tomorrow and I’ll watch the North Macedonia-Belgium game just to recap that one. We race and get to work now to prepare for Belgium.”For Friday night, Bellamy’s side were firmly focused on the opposition in front of them and Liechtenstein made their presence known in Wales. While the visiting fans were heavily outnumbered, they were the ones in the car park pre-match who could be heard singing songs and shouting chants. They made the trip to see if their side could end a 35-game winless streak in competitive matches.The two nations have met three times previously, with Wales coming out victorious on all three occasions. The hosts were undoubtedly the favourites and under cloudy conditions they ensured Liechtenstein’s wait for a win continued.Harry Wilson, who returned after missing the March qualifiers with injury, took an early free-kick and went for goal but his attempt was fired wide. Wales kept up the pressure, particularly through the attacking spark of Sorba Thomas, but the visitors soaked it up.While it was all Wales in the early stages, it was not all good news for the hosts as they were forced into an early change with Neco Williams off with injury. He needed a stretcher with a suspected hamstring issue and was shaking his head as he was wheeled along the touchline.View image in fullscreenWales’s Neco Williams is taken around the touchline on a stretcher.Photograph: Nigel French/PAKieffer Moore and the captain, Ben Davies, had close chances but Brennan Johnson, the Spurs hero from the Europa League final, came closest with a deft touch. Goalkeeper Benjamin Büchel, who has won Liechtenstein’s player of the year three seasons in a row, made an incredible save. Ethan Ampadu, who also returned from injury, was the next to take a shot with a bicycle kick almost beating Büchel but the Vaduz keeper nudged it over the bar.Liechtenstein had been well-drilled in defence but the simplest of set pieces unpicked the deadlock. A good delivery from Thomas led to Joe Rodon heading it home and so the half-time score stood at 1-0. However, the Liechtenstein manager, Konrad Fünfstück, thought the goal-scoring opportunity should not have been given.“It was a wrong decision [to give the corner] but it’s one we can’t change,” Fünfstück said. “As the underdogs we have to give more. It was a bad situation but Wales did deserve to win.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Fulham forward is the top scorer under the head coach.Moore then got his goal with a tap-in before a ripple of applause came over the crowd in the 68th minute in memory of the Alarm’s Mike Peters, who sang Wales’s Euro 2020 anthem and was an avid supporter of the team. Peters died in April. The 68th minute was chosen in honour of the Alarm hit song 68 Guns.The pace of the game slowed for the rest of the match but the result was already sewn up.

Events since have included Nations League high points but umpteen chastening experiences. This proved another of the latter.For the second game in succession, Steve Clarke’s team lost three goals at home. The nature of Iceland’s success – a fully deserving one – in Glasgow felt ominous in respect of an upcoming World Cup qualifying campaign. With Germany and the Euros such a distant memory, Clarke does not have his troubles to seek. Scotland look a team that has passed its peak. There were no redeeming features at all in this display. Clarke must be alarmed.Wales brush aside Liechtenstein to maintain Bellamy’s unbeaten reignRead moreThe opening to the game was notable for the injury sustained by the Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn. When collecting a routine cross, Gunn’s ankle clattered into Andri Gudjohnsen with the consequences apparently serious. Gunn limped from the field after just six minutes.Gunn’s replacement, the debutant Cieran Slicker, was to endure an inauspicious arrival in international football. With just his second touch, Slicker kicked the ball straight to Stefán Teitur Thórdarson. Gudjohnsen was the gleeful recipient of Thórdarson’s header, the Gent an taking one touch before sending a glorious left-foot shot into Slicker’s top right-hand corner.Whether affected by the goalkeeper change or otherwise, the Scots were horribly ragged in the first quarter. The position has long been regarded as a problematic one, the consequence of negligence by clubs and the Scottish FA when the country did have a batch of fine keepers. Neither Gunn nor Slicker in truth are international class. The current best option, Craig Gordon, is 42.George Hirst should have levelled the scores, the Ipswich striker instead heading over when it looked easier to find the net from a John McGinn cross. As Hirst came close again, Scotland had found their pulse. John Souttar claimed the equaliser after meeting Max Johnston’s corner with a stooping header.Scotland were behind again before the interval, this time on account of hilariously incompetent defending. An Iceland corner flew off Lewis Ferguson and into Grant Hanley. As the ball rebounded off Ferguson again, Slicker chose to dive over the top of it. No Iceland player had touched the ball from the set play. All that was lacking was an appearance from the Keystone Cops. Scotland were booed off at half-time.Slicker’s night was to get even worse. Victor Pálsson met an Albert Gudmundsson free-kick with his head, a matter that should have provided no real problem for the goalkeeper. However, the ball flew right through Slicker’s hands. This had become a painful watch and a painful listen; Scotland’s support mocked Slicker when he picked up a loose ball soon after Iceland’s third. This was a cruel if calamitous scene for Slicker, whose only club first team appearance last season was as an 81st minute substitute for Ipswich against Bristol Rovers.

Technically, those results barely matter. The standard of Scotland’s play does, though.

Thursday lunchtime had just passed and Tirana was gearing up for a match that could have filled the national stadium at least 10 times over. There was no trouble identifying Albania’s flag, the double-headed black eagle spreading from its centre. The second banner being hoisted has become common currency too. It bore the word “Autochtonous”, presenting a version of the “Greater Albania” map that transformed a football match into a major diplomatic incident in 2014.By Friday morning that flag had been replaced with its less incendiary alternative. Perhaps the authorities had popped in for a quiet word. They want to eliminate potential triggers for the kind of chaosthat erupted in Belgrade 11 years ago, when a drone lowered the controversial image into Partizan Stadium during a European Championship qualifier between Serbia and Albania. The ramifications of that night stretched far beyond sport and there were sighs of relief when, the following November, a rematch in the provincial Albanian city of Elbasan passed without major incident.Faces surely plunged into palms at both countries’ football associations last December, though, when they were drawn together in World Cup qualifyingfor 2026. Eyebrows were raised externally but there was nothing to prevent them meeting again: despite a long and bloody history whose freshest scars were inflicted during the war in largely ethnic Albanian Kosovo, the nations are not in active conflict. Neither had asked to be kept apart from the other. It was inevitable that the problem of navigating their relations around the football stadium would resurface one day.No resources are being spared in solving it. About 2,000 police personnel will be deployed for the sides’ first Group K meeting on Saturday night, including special forces and counter-terrorism operatives. Additionally, sources suggest as many as 500 plainclothes officers will be situated among the 22,500 crowd. Away fans will be absent. Anti-drone equipment is being installed in the surrounding area and potential miscreants have been warned their devices will be shot out of the sky.Presumably any planned disruption would take a different form; drones were not quite commonplace in public life when that tiny craft unleashed hell in Belgrade. But those measures revive memories of Ismail Morina, the bearded and outwardly harmless crane operator whose willingness to admit responsibility for the 2014 incident brought national hero status. Although not widely reported at the time, Morina had an accomplice who has since preferred to remain in the shadows.Morina’s openness came at a cost: he was arrested before Serbia’s visit in 2015 for illegal possession of weapons, keeping him safely out of view for the game. Later he was imprisoned in Croatia and Italy, where he has residency, on a Serbian arrest warrant issued through Interpol. He has returned to Albanian stadiums, being held aloft in the Arena Kombetare stands at a match against Czech Republic in 2023 and exchanging shirts with the goalscorer Jasir Asani. Recently he has been seen at domestic games but, in the buildup to Saturday’s meeting, his previously active social media accounts have disappeared. If any of his old associates know where he is, they will not say. The assumption must be that he would not risk approaching the venue on Saturday.He would not be the only ultra, past or present, who is kept away. The Albanian FA has not sold tickets en bloc to supporters’ groups, instead allocating them by random draw from more than 200,000 applications and hiking up prices. It appears a deliberate attempt to sanitise the atmosphere; the Tifozat Kuq e Zi group, which provides the most vibrant spectacle at national team games, responded furiously and pointed to an “organised farce” aimed at the wealthy. They will host an alternative gathering by the Pyramid of Tirana, 400 metres from the stadium, where permission has been granted for a big screen. Match ticket prices on an intensely active black market have exceeded £1,000 at the top end.View image in fullscreenStefan Mitrovic of Serbia seizes the flag depicting ‘Greater Albania’ that sparked ugly scenes and the abandonment of a European Championship qualifier.Photograph: Marko Đurica/REUTERSThe fact Albania and Serbia will co-host the Uefa Under-21 Championship in 2027 adds another dimension. If the stakes are high for Saturday’s hosts, there is plenty riding on the occasion for European football’s governing body. Such an ambitious arrangement, driven largely by the Albania FA president and Uefa executive committee vice-president, Armand Duka, may appear untenable if anything goes wrong. Tifozat Kuq e Zi has expressed its views on the co-hosting by verbal and visual means; it senses this has contributed to its ostracisation.The only distraction during Albania’s training session on Thursday evening was a set of zealously deployed sprinklers, their presence hardly unwelcome in temperatures touching 30C. Elseid Hysaj, the Lazio full-back, is the only squad member who played in the Belgrade fiasco. “We should not repeat the images of past years,” he said. “The coach has asked us not to panic about this match. We need calm and emotional balance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The same can be said of Dragan Stojkovic, his opposite number. England, who complete the Group K quintet with Latvia and Andorra, are deemed near-certain group winners by both camps. Albania and Serbia know they are jostling for a playoff spot and that their meetings, the second of which takes place in four months, will be decisive.At 1.40pm local time on Friday, Serbia’s players arrived at their hotel a mile to the west of Tirana’s city centre. Armed officers from RENEA, Albania’s anti-terrorism force, flanked two buses that had travelled from the airport under escort. The first step of a weekend-long operation had passed smoothly. Should that remain the case, perhapsthe spectre of 14 October 2014will finally begin to fade from view.Explore more on these topicsAlbaniaSerbiaWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is something to win from it: Patek and Rolex watches,” he joked after he scored the winner in theTrophée des Champions in January. The more goals, the more watches was the bet made. But his 25 goals in 2025 have earned him more than expensive wrist pieces.They brought PSG their holy grail, the Champions League, and they could yet bring him the Ballon d’Or. In France, there is some heavy lobbying for Dembélé to win the award, starting with his own manager Luis Enrique and extending to Marquinhos, who had crowds of fans chanting “Dembélé, Ballon d’Or” during the open-top bus parade around Paris, and artist DJ Snake, who did the same at the Parc des Princes later that day.Dembélé turning from a dazzling but profligate winger to a clinical No 9 was not on anyone’sLigue 1bingo card this year but his metamorphosis has taken PSG to the next level. His goal output fell short of Kylian Mbappé’s total last year but, in terms of his overall play and particularly his dogged pressing, he has proven an upgrade on the France captain. Who would have thought that at the start of the year?Best manager: Luis Enrique, PSGIt is tempting to make this a hipster’s choice and reward Liam Rosenior’s transformative season with Strasbourg, Christophe Pélissier’s exploits at Auxerre, orFranck Haise taking an injury-hit Nice side into the Champions League, but picking anyone other than Luis Enrique would be ignoring a historic and unprecedented treble for his team. Moulding a young group of players, which had lost Mbappé, into a combative team was impressive at every turn.He spared no effort in improving youngsters, such as Doué, and he gave Dembélé the confidence to be the frontrunner for the Ballon d’Or. He also was instrumental in helping new faces bed in quickly. There were nervy moments in Europe – highlighted by some scruffy performances early in the Champions League – but PSG are now being spoken of asthe next dynasty in European football.View image in fullscreenLuis Enrique made a group of players the best team in Europe.Photograph: Fabrizio Carabelli/IPA Sport/ShutterstockBest young player: Andrey Santos, StrasbourgDésire Doué might have a word here but let’s put aside the recency bias of the Champions League final, and Rayan Cherki finally finding form for Lyon. Both of their achievements took place largely in the season’s second half. Andrey Santos and João Neves, however, were consistent throughout the campaign.Santos was a talismanic player forStrasbourg, scoring vital goals in a season in which striker Emanuel Emegha struggled with injury at times, while also displaying a ferocious all-action style that was perfectly suited to Rosenior’s style. He had shown flashes of his ability last season, but his improvement this season cannot be ignored. He was comfortably the best midfielder in the league outside Paris.Neves comes a close second, even if he might have gone about his business slightly more quietly than his fellow Lusophone. A true No 8, he made PSG’s midfield a bear pit for opposing players while showing plenty of inventiveness going forward, no small matter for a player in a new league who was only 19 when the season started.Best match: Lyon 4-3 StrasbourgPierre Sage came out on the winning end of this match, even if he did not last much longer in his job at Lyon after a middling run of performances domestically. This match should be celebrated as an early example of what Rosenior was building at Strasbourg. While not yet fully formed – Diego Moreira only came off the bench and Djordje Petrovic, only just arrived, was not even in the squad – Rosenior’s high-octane style was impressive indeed, and it would be a template for the team’s run to the European places in the second half of the season.Best signing: Mika Biereth, MonacoThere was a lot riding on Monaco’s signing of Mika Biereth in January. The prolific goalscorer Wissam Ben Yedder had left on a free in the summer and his long-term replacement, Folarin Balogun, was sidelined for several months with a dislocated shoulder. Biereth, having left Arsenal permanently in the summer, had been scoring for fun in Austria with Sturm Graz, but Ligue 1 was a step up.“Of course, he has surpassed expectations. Nobody could predict that a young player would arrive and score as many goals as he has,” said the Monaco CEO Thiago Scuro. The Denmark international scoredan incredible 13 goals in the second half of the season, including three hat-tricks in his first three home games in the league; talk about hitting the ground running. His contribution was vital to ensuring the club qualified for the Champions League.View image in fullscreenMika Biereth scored three hat-tricks in his first three home games in Ligue 1.Photograph: Nathan Barange/DPPI/REX/ShutterstockBiggest shock: Strasbourg reaching EuropeThe omens for Strasbourg’s campaign were not positive. Their youth-centric transfer policy was criticised by the club’s fanbase after BlueCo’s arrival and Patrick Vieira’s own misgivings saw him leave his post just before the start of the season. Rosenior didn’t have time to get his bearings but he didn’t need it. The language barrier didn’t prevent him from getting his ideas across and turning a side that was in a relegation scrap the previous season into European challengers. Under his guidance, players such as Andrey Santos, Dilane Bakwa and Emanuel Emegha have made significant strides. Ultimately, their development will largely benefit Chelsea, but in the meantime, it has allowed them to secure an unlikely qualification for the Europa Conference League.Best goal: Amine Gouiri for Marseille v BrestIn a campaign littered with worldies (one only need look at those nominated for the UNFP award), our goal of the year isan impressive effort from Marseille’s Amine Gouiri. In a crucial match against Brest late in the season, with the club’s Champions League status yet to be secured, Gouiri controlled a high cross with his chest, sending the ball up in the air before swiveling and firing in a sublime overhead kick. From the bravura of the attempt to the technique to pull it off, it was a masterful moment.Best save: Marcin Bulka for Nice v PSGMarcin Bulka became a one-man entertainment act in the dying stages of Nice’s shock win against PSG. There was a stoppage-time barrage on theNicegoal but Bulka was equal to Gonçalo Ramos’ close-range effort then two spectacular driven efforts from Vitinha. All three were worthy contenders for save of the season and they came within just minutes of each other. No wonder Bulka celebrated each one like a goal scored. Arguably the best goalkeeper in Ligue 1 last season, the Poland international did not reach the same heights this season but his performance against PSG was a timely reminder of his skills before a transfer window in which he is expected to depart.Biggest flop: Youssoufa Moukoko, NiceSome loan spells are mutually beneficial for all parties involved; others are mutually detrimental. Youssoufa Moukoko’s loan to Nice falls into the latter category. Once the prodigy of German football, Moukoko looked to get his fledgling career back on track in France, on loan from Borussia Dortmund, but he spent much of the campaign wasting away on the bench. His only two goals for the club came in the 8-0 demolition of Saint-Étienne in September. His last game for Nicewas back in February and his last start in Ligue 1 dates all the way back to October. When given chances in Nice’s torrid Europa League campaign, Moukoko failed to take them and he leaves the Côte d’Azur with his career at a crossroads.Biggest flashpoint: Paulo Fonseca’s banIt could be nothing other than Paulo Fonseca’s moment of apoplexy for Lyon in late March.Les Goneshad battled hard and were leading Stade Brestois in stoppage time. With a busy fixture list (Lyon were still involved in the Europa League at the time) and key players missing through injury, what looked to be a valuable win nearly turned into a draw as match official Benoît Millot signaled for a penalty for the Bretons. He eventually changed his mind thanks to the intervention of VAR, but not before the Portuguese manager went head-to-head with the referee, earning himself a nine-month touchline ban, something that surely played a role in his side’s immature elimination from Champions League contention in France and the Europa League.View image in fullscreenPaulo Fonseca confronts referee Benoît Millot.Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty ImagesDeparture of the season: DAZNUnlike last year, when Mbappé left PSG to join Real Madrid, no major superstar is guaranteed to leave Ligue 1 this summer. Some household names will move on, including Alexandre Lacazette and Jonathan David, as well as bright young talents such as Rayan Cherki. But the biggest departure this year is not a player or a manager; it is a broadcaster.Having initially demanded €1bn for their TV rights, Ligue 1’s governing body received less than half that figure. But even that fee was too much for DAZN, who took the tender for the five-year cycle before quickly offloading it just months later. The consequences of DAZN’s ill-fated short stint are far-reaching and damaging, with many clubs on the brink. The league will now create its own channel and try to sell rights to established broadcasters, but it is a situation that remains unresolved and one that elicitsa great deal of concern in the French game.Team of the season (4-3-3)Yehvann Diouf; Achraf Hakimi, Leonardo Balerdi, Willian Pacho, Nuno Mendes; Andrey Santos, João Neves, Vitinha; Rayan Cherki, Ousmane Dembélé, Bradley Barcola.Bench: Gianluigi Donnarumma, Diego Moreira, Bafodé Diakité, Guéla Doué, Adrien Rabiot, Corentin Tolisso, Mika Biereth, Désiré Doué, Maghnes Akliouche.This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsLigue 1Guardian Sport NetworkEuropean club footballParis Saint-GermainNiceStrasbourgfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Those eight minutes of added time on Thursday in Abu Dhabi were long but then it has been a long wait and a long road to qualify for a first World Cup.Uzbekistan have snatched summers of rest from the jaws ofWorld Cupappearances more than once in the past, so the goalkeeper Utkir Yusupov could be forgiven for taking his time and faking an injury or two. He was the star of a 0-0 draw against the United Arab Emirates that was dull – deliberately and deliciously so for those in Central Asia – but provided the necessary point. Yusupov went down once more at the end, this time in tears as reserve goalkeepers came on for a group hug.Not pretty, not fun but Socceroos slog ends with miraculous win amid late drama | Joey LynchRead moreThe coach, Timur Kapadze, was embracing his coaching staff. The former midfielder, who looks the same as he did in his playing prime, because he had the appearance of a 43-year-old once he was halfway through a career that brought him 119 Uzbekistan caps, has been in the job since Srecko Katanec stepped down in January owing to ill health. The man who led his native Slovenia to the 2002 World Cup deserves plenty of credit.So does Kapadze. As “Mr Uzbekistan football”, he knows all about past heartbreaks and was part of the team that made it as far as a playoff against Bahrain during the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. In the first leg at home in Tashkent, Uzbekistan were leading 1-0 when Server Djeparov thought he had scored a penalty to make it 2-0. The Japanese referee, spying encroachment, blew his whistle but, instead of ordering a retake, gave Bahrain a free-kick.View image in fullscreenAbdukodir Khusanov (right), the Manchester City defender, helps to squeeze out the UAE.Photograph: Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty Images“Nobody could believe what was happening,” said Uzbekistan’s coach, Bob Houghton, a globe-trotting Englishman who had led Malmö to the final of the 1979 European Cup final, which they lost 1-0 to Nottingham Forest. “People were just looking at each other, confused and scratching their heads. If that penalty had counted, we were so dominant that I think we would have won three- or four-nil and then we are almost there.”It would have meant a final playoff against Trinidad & Tobago for a place in England’s group in Germany. “Everyone was very angry and it was a tragedy for the country,” Houghton said. “The federation was very upset, of course. I remember the original game and leaving the pitch at half-time. I saw the fourth official and said to him: ‘What the hell is that?’ And he said: ‘It’s a new rule.’ I then saw the head of the Uzbek referee commission … he just said: ‘I don’t think that is right.’ And soon we were on the phone to Fifa.”Uzbekistan demanded a 3-0 win and had arrived in Manama for the second leg when they were told by Fifa, which said the retake had been a technical error, to turn around to Tashkent to replay the first. They ended up going out on away goals (that Bahrain were eliminated from 2026 qualification on Thursday at the same time Uzbekistan were celebrating was another little bonus for the White Wolves).For the 2014 tournament there was a more conventional disappointment, with South Korea going to Brazil because of a goal difference better by one. Four years later revenge would have been sweet had Uzbekistan beaten South Korea in Tashkent but it ended goalless. Given that the former Soviet republic, which joined Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation in 1994, have reached the last eight in four of the past five Asian Cups but got to the last four once, questions about their mentality were understandable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their five wins from nine games in this third round of qualification have come by a single goal, and four have been 1-0. A solid defence, led by Manchester City’s Abdukodir Khusanov, who arrived in Abu Dhabi from his wedding, has been the foundation. Roma’s Eldor Shomurodov is the talisman in attack and CSKA Moscow’s Abbosbek Fayzullaev, a 21-year-old winger, is one of Asia’s most exciting talents.Whereas a growing number of nations have naturalised in pursuit of World Cup dreams – most of the UAE’s starting XI were not born in the country – Uzbekistan have done it the other way and have a national team with a club atmosphere. Recent success in youth tournaments in Asia is not a coincidence, the country having invested time and money in development in the past decade. The support came from the very top, facilities were built or improved, coaches were educated, players found and chances given, helped by the formation of Olympic Tashkent in 2021, a top-tier club reserved for young talent.Their coach until last summer? Kapadze. He also led the under-23s to the Asian final in 2022 and 2024, earning a first Olympic appearance. Only one point was earned in Paris but the defeats by Spain and Egypt came by a single goal. Two months ago, the under-17s became continental champions. In 2023, the under-20s did the same and qualified for the World Cup, where they made the last 16.That would do nicely next summer but how Uzbekistan will get on in North America is a question that can wait. This is a time for celebrating a new beginning as well as the loss of that label of “Asia’s chokers”.Explore more on these topicsUzbekistanWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld Cup 2026World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

TGP Europe, as a so-called white label provider (provision of services under one company), took care of everything. As it was licensed in the UK, it could register .co.uk domain names for its customers. This is how Kaiyun, for example, was able to display its name on the fronts of Nottingham Forest’s shirts and the sleeves of Crystal Palace’s jerseys despite it not having any working British operation. Its .co.uk website remained “under construction” until it disappeared for good last month.It didn’t matter; what mattered was that the Chinese and Asian customers of Kaiyun saw its brand name publicly displayed on the fields of the world’s most popular football club competition. This brought them exposure in their primary market, where gambling advertising is prohibited, and a degree of legitimacy as they could claim – incorrectly – that they were “licensed” through TGP Europe by the Great Britain Gambling Commission (GBGC).TGP is not the only British-registered company to have used this loophole, but what made them stand out is that they had been set up by one of Macau’s biggest junkets (casino groups), SunCity, which was owned and run by gambling tycoon Alvin Chau until a Macau court found him guilty of running a criminal organisationand sentenced him to 18 years in prisonin January 2023. The links between TGP and Chau’s SunCity were first publicised when sports betting firm SBTechannounced a strategic partnershipwith the Isle of Man-based company in 2014.Yet TGP and its clients were allowed to prosper on the back of their lucrative relationships with Premier League clubs, despite a growing number of media reports highlighting the problematic nature of their business.At least two Asian-facing betting partners of English clubs – BK8, formerly associated with Aston Villa and Burnley, and 8XBet, partners of Manchester City, Chelsea, Bournemouth, Leicester and Ipswich – have been accused of running their operations from compounds in Cambodia and Myanmar, countries where theUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crimeestimates that at least 200,000 people have been trafficked and enslaved to service the gambling and scamming industries, all of which are intimately connected. BK8 and 8XBet, whose ultimate beneficial owners are unknown, have never responded to these allegations.View image in fullscreenLeicester City have been warned over their partnership with betting company BC.GAME.Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/ShutterstockYet TGP was allowed to carry on – until now. A first fine of £316,250 for non-compliance with anti-money laundering regulations was imposed by the GBGC in February 2023. This time, further investigation into the company’s affairs, which claims to operate from a minuscule and apparently abandoned office, “revealed failures to carry out effective due diligence on each entity involved in the ownership of the third party, carry out due diligence on the source of funds for business arrangement, sufficiently consider money laundering risks, [and] sufficiently consider any activity by a third party that is illegal, in either GB or the territory in which it is conducted”.TGP Europe has not responded to a request for comment.The clubs have not broken any regulations but the GBGCsent a letterto some – but not all – of the Premier League clubs who, during the 2024-25 season, had unlicensed partners. This was courtesy of TGP warning “of the risks of promoting unlicensed gambling websites” and “that club officers may be liable to prosecution and, if convicted, face a fine, imprisonment or both if they promote unlicensed gambling businesses that transact with consumers in Great Britain”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leicester (partner of BC.GAME among others) and Everton (Stake) had already been warned. Aston Villa, who have partnered with Nova88, were not contacted, as the bookmaker in question does not have a UK incarnation.While campaigners and regulators will hail a victory over illegal gambling, Premier League clubs will be wondering how to make up for the financial shortfall TGP’s disappearance from the British market will cause. It is unlikely that another white label company will step into the breach, especially since the Premier League ban on front-of-shirt betting sponsorship is only one season away.It is not just that sports betting brands, especially Asian-facing ones, pay a premium of 20-40% above the usual rate for their partnerships, the fear within football is that an entire income stream which cannot be replaced may have gone.This is not necessarily the case, however. Spain imposed a far stricter ban on sports betting advertising at the start of the 2021-22 season. Asian-facing betting operators disappeared from the stadiums of La Liga but they didn’t leave Spanish football altogether, as the Spanish regulators only concerned themselves with Spanish gamblers. So while people in Spain can’t see the advertising, Real Madrid, for example, is taking Kaiyun’s money with a partnership outside the country.“We will be carrying out checks without further notice to ensure these sites remain blocked,” the GBGC said in itsstatement on TGP. “We will also conduct ongoing spot checks as necessary to ensure they are not accessible to consumers in Great Britain by any means. Should any of these sites be available to GB consumers, we will take appropriate action.”This, however, only addresses the visible part of the problem. It fails to deal with the global dimension of football’s toxic relationship with illegal betting operators.Explore more on these topicsFootballcommentShareReuse this content"

The former Spice Girls singer was six months pregnant with her fourth child, and photographers captured the moment when her husband rested a hand on his wife’s bump and grinned.2013Beckham wasappointed an OBE for services to football in June 2003in the late queen’s birthday honours list. “This is just an amazing day,” he said afterwards. The queen was a football fan, said Beckham at the time. “I know Her Majesty is a football fan because when I was at a Number 10 reception, the prime minister told me he had watched a World Cup game on television with the queen and William and Harry.”Also in 2013, Beckham was named as one of the many celebrities allegedly caught up in Ingenious financing schemes, which funded films such as Avatar and Life of Pi. In June 2017,more than 1,000 people, including Beckham and other celebritiessuch as Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney, lose a court battle against a £700m tax bill from HM Revenue and Customs, after it successfully argued such schemes were not legitimate investment opportunities but a means of avoiding tax.Sources close to Beckham at the time reportedly said the former footballer had no knowledge of the scheme. Ingenious wassuccessful in appealing against HMRCin 2021.2017Despite an injunction,multiple European newspapers leaked emailswritten by Beckham in which he expressed anger – in rather spicy terms – at not being granted a knighthood in 2013. Emails between Beckham and his spokesperson Simon Oliveira refer to a “red flag” HMRC had put on his nomination for a knighthood.Among the choice phrases was Beckham’s labelling of the honours committee as “a bunch of cunts”. Beckham’s team said the emails had been doctored by hackers, including the insertion of extra swearwords, but they confirmed others as genuine, including his insult about the honours committee. They stressed such emails were heat-of-the-moment communications between close associates.2018The Beckhams attended Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding alongside a slew of celebrities including Serena Williams, Oprah Winfrey and George Clooney.View image in fullscreenDavid and Victoria attend the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Windsor.Photograph: Lauren Hurley/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock2022Beckham queued for 13 hours to see the late Queen Elizabeth’s coffin at Westminster Abbey in September 2022, saying it was “special to be here”. He added: “Every time that we stood there when we wore those three lions shirts and I had my armband and we sang God Save the Queen, that was something that meant so much to us. Every time that we did it, it was something special.”Also in 2022, Beckham, who also played a key role in England’s 2018 World Cup bid,faced backlash for accepting the ambassadorshipat the Qatar World Cup in 2022. A deal with the Gulf state – which has oppressive laws against same-sex relationships – was said to be worth £150m. Beckham took part in a promotional film for Visit Qatar in which he spoke of Qataris’ pride in their culture. “The modern and traditional fuse to create something really special,” he said.2024The Beckhams attended a banquet to mark the state visit of the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla at Buckingham Palace. Friends said he was “humbled” by his invitation and “very happy” to be there.2025In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia,Beckham’s former PA Rebecca Loos repeated that she had had a short affair with the former footballer in 2003. Beckham has always denied the affair, calling the idea “ludicrous”. In the 2023 Netflix documentary Beckham, he said: “I don’t know how we got through it, in all honesty. Victoria is everything to me. To see her hurt was incredibly difficult … We needed to fight for each other and for our family. What we had was worth fighting for.”Also in 2025, Beckham chatted to the king and queen at the Chelsea flower show, which he attended as part of his role as ambassador to the King’s Foundation. According to his website, Beckham supports its education programmes and “efforts to ensure young people have a greater understanding of nature”.The former footballer turned model has spoken about his love of nature in recent years, revealing his passion for beekeeping on the couple’s Cotswolds estate near Great Tew in Oxfordshire.Explore more on these topicsDavid BeckhamMonarchytimelinesShareReuse this content"

Sport England has raised this matter with British Rowing, and we will continue to monitor the situation.”A similar message was conveyed by UK Sport, which funds elite sport across Great Britain and Northern Ireland. “Our thoughts are with those affected by the allegations which have recently been reported, and we take matters of integrity and safeguarding extremely seriously,” it said.“We encourage any member of staff or athlete on Olympic and Paralympic performance programmes to report allegations of unacceptable behaviour to Sport Integrity, the confidential reporting line. In light of these deeply concerning allegations, we are in contact with British Rowing.”In a statement, the Leander Club said it took seriously all issues relating to the safeguarding of its athletes. “We have strict procedures in place to carefully examine any formal complaints and regularly review our club disciplinary processes to ensure they are fit for purpose, treating our athletes fairly and with respect,” it added.A British Rowing spokesperson said it was not able to comment on individual safeguarding concerns and processes conducted at clubs owing to their confidential nature. “As such there is a very limited amount that we can say when we are approached in connection with issues that fall into this category,” it added.“What we are able to say categorically is that the safety of people taking part in our sport is the very first item of importance on our agenda. We investigate anything reported to us fully and comprehensively, as you would expect and as it is our remit to do. This would have been the case if sufficient information had been raised with us to conduct an investigation in respect of the raised allegations.”Explore more on these topicsRowingnewsShareReuse this content"

Desert Flower’s class was enough to carry her into third place, four lengths behind Whirl, but she did not threaten to pick up the leaders at any stage after coming under some pressure with three furlongs still to run.The victory was O’Brien’s 11th in the fillies’ Classic, which puts him within sight of Robert Robson’s all-time record of 13 Oaks victories, set between 1802 and 1825.“She was just ready to run at Chester,” O’Brien said. “She barely made it, but she made abnormal improvement from Chester, which we thought she might. It was all class rather than stamina or fitness, she just has a lot of class.“Ryan gave her a beautiful ride, he loved her the last day and he loved her again today, so it’s very exciting. She’s still a bit green. Obviously at Chester she learned a lot, but she was always going to improve with racing.“What you love about her is she’s a great traveller with a lot of class. Ryan said he was going very easy early on, so usually that means she can step up a couple of grades, into even higher class races. She could take on the boys if the lads [in the Coolmore ownership syndicate] decide it.”View image in fullscreenJockey Ryan Moore returns in triumph on Minnie Hauk after victory in the Oaks.Photograph: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty ImagesMinnie Hauk’s win completed a 23-1 Group One double on the day for her trainer after Jan Brueghel’s defeat of Calandagan, the odds-on favourite, in the Coronation Cup.Mickael Barzalona came with a strong run on Calandagan and was alongside the winner inside the final furlong but Ryan Moore found a final effort from Jan Brueghel to win by half a length.“They started to race from a long way out and it was incredible in the straight how he carried on,” O’Brien said. “He’s a very brave horse, and if you pass him slowly, you’re in trouble.”Share"

Ferguson is fourth behind Wollaston, 14 seconds off Faulkner’s mark, with two stages to go.“My team was really good in the first half of the race, just keeping me safe at the front.

After her breakthrough in the preceding years, and the intense hype and scrutiny that accompanied her as she tried to build her career, Gauff’srun to the 2022 French Open finalproved to herself and the world that she was ready to live up to those expectations.Although she did not win the title, her experience at Roland Garros then was an essential lesson that has guided her over the past few years. In the buildup to that final against Iga Swiatek, she struggled badly with her nerves and her intense fear of failure. “At first I thought it would be the end of the world if I lost, and the sun still rose the next day,” said Gauff after beating Loïs Boisson in their semi-final on Thursday. “So knowing, regardless of the result, the sun will still rise. Especially being in a city like Paris, I was walking around the next day, and no one knew that I lost [in 2022], and no one cared. Some people know who I am, but not a lot and not everyone. Just realising that however big the moment seems in our lives, [it] is not as big in the grand scheme of things.”Sabalenka ends Swiatek’s reign on clay to set up French Open final against GauffRead moreSo now, Gauff will contest her secondFrench Openfinal at a completely different point in her career. This year has proved to be a significant learning curve in itself. In the first week of 2025, she produced some of her best performances in the United Cup and her level in beating Swiatek, particularly, remains some of the best tennis by anyone this year. It seemed clear she had positioned herself for a great season.Instead, things became tough. After a quarter-final loss at the Australian Open, Gauff struggled badly. Across February and March, from the Middle East to the United States, she did not reach a single quarter-final. She has found her way again on the European red clay, piecing together an extremely consistent series of results,reaching finals at the Madrid Openand Italian Open before another stellar run in Paris has taken her to the final against Aryna Sabalenka.This tournament places Gauff at an interesting intersection. She has already enjoyed her first breakthrough, winning her first major titleat the 2023 US Openand then backing it up by triumphing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh last year. At a time when two players – Sabalenka and Swiatek – have distanced themselves from the field by consistently racking up big titles on the biggest stages, the next question for Gauff is whether she is ready and capable of taking another leap forward and consistently competing for every grand slam.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka had to battle past Iga Swiatek to reach her first French Open final.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockOn Saturday, Gauff will have a chance to measure herself against the best player in the world. Although both have developed into well-rounded players, with the American improving offensively and Sabalenka employing greater variety and restraint, this is fundamentally a battle between the best defence and the best attack in the sport.Their contrasting styles have made for a tight, intense rivalry over the years. They have played each other for five years now, their first meeting when Gauff was only 16. They are tied at 5-5 and half of their meetings have been bruising three-set tussles. When Sabalenka is in full flow, striking the ball with total confidence, her heavy weaponry will usually be overpowering. However, Gauff, who was 21 in March, can unsettle anyone. The 2023 US Open final was their only other meeting in a grand slam final and the American narrowed the court with her phenomenal defensive skills, eventually driving Sabalenka to one of the most painful losses of her career.Quick GuideKlugman makes history in juniorsShowHannah Klugman has become the first British player to reach the French Open juniors final in almost 50 years.The 16-year-old from Kingston-upon-Thames battled through to her maiden grand slam final after a gritty 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over the Bulgarian Rositsa Dencheva.Klugman is the first Briton to achieve the feat since Michelle Tyler claimed the title in 1976, the same year Sue Barker won the women’s event.Klugman will face 17-year-old Austrian Lilli Tagger in Saturday’s final.Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski are through to the final of the men’s doubles.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Although the Belarusian, 27, has risen only one spot in the rankings since August 2023, from two to one, she seems like a completely different competitor today. Not only is she a more complete player, she has gained so much confidence and contentment in her daily work. She has only been emboldened by her performances this week, particularly her impressive semi-final victory over the four-time champion Swiatek. The sun will rise again regardless of how the match pans out, but the stakes are high. Under these circumstances, a win for Gauff would signify the most significant achievement in her career.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffFrench Open 2025French OpenUS sportsTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With a minute remaining they had made it a one-point game at 110-109. With a second to go it was still 110-109 and Tyrese Haliburton had a chance to steal the game for the Pacers in outrageous fashion. Just as he had against the New York Knicksin Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, he did not miss when it mattered. His basket put the Pacers up 111-110 and won them the game. Remarkably, the Pacers led for just 0.3 seconds – the blink between Haliburton’s shot and the buzzer.Haliburton’s shot was the latest game-winner in an NBA finals contest sinceMichael Jordan’s buzzer-beaterto sink the Utah Jazz in 1997, also in Game 1.“We’ve just had to figure out how to win in so many ways all year,” said Haliburton. “We’re just a really resilient group, I’m just really proud of this group. We keep believing and we stay together. It ain’t over ‘til it’s over.”Once again, Indiana had found a way back in these playoffs. On 29 April, they trailed Milwaukee 118-111 with 34.6 seconds left in overtime and won 119-118. On 6 May, the Pacers trailed Cleveland 119-112 with 48 seconds left and won 120-119. On 21 May, they trailed New York 121-112 with 51.1 seconds left in regulation and won 138-135 in overtime. Thursday’s comeback was the Pacers’ fifth from 15 or more points down this postseason, an NBA record.“That’s a really good team,” Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. “Credit them for not only tonight but their run. They’ve had so many games like that that have seemed improbable. And they just play with a great spirit and they keep coming. They keep playing.”The Pacers had staged the biggest fourth-quarter comeback in a finals game since Dallas came from 15 down to beat Miami in 2011. The coach of those Mavericks: Rick Carlisle. The coach of these Pacers: Rick Carlisle. His decisions on Thursday certainly helped. When the Pacers were 15 points down early in the fourth, Carlisle called time and subbed out all five players, seeking a spark. It worked. The Pacers outscored the Thunder 15-4 over the next 3:26 to make it 98-94 with a little over six minutes remaining. It was a foundation that would help them stage their remarkable comeback.Haliburton’s last-gasp heroics spoiled a brilliant outing by Gilgeous-Alexander, whose 38 points were the third-most in an NBA finals debut behind onlyAllen Iverson (48 in 2001)and George Mikan (42 in 1949).Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is on Sunday night in Oklahoma City. Both teams may just about have recovered by then.“Man, basketball’s fun,” Haliburton said, reflecting on the end of the game.It was hard to disagree.Explore more on these topicsNBA finalsBasketballOklahoma City ThunderIndiana PacersUS sportsNBAnewsShareReuse this content"

The companies cannot advise customers how to make the purchase elsewhere, under Apple rules.Ina paper releasedlast November the government outlined a proposal to “designate” digital platforms like the Apple App Store.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThis would compel those platforms to comply with obligations that target what the government deems to be anti-competitive conduct.The paper highlights the in-app payment scheme favoured by Apple as an example of the type of behaviour the competition regulator could target once a platform is designated, as well as allowing users to download apps from places outside the official App Store – known as sideloading.In its response to the paper, Apple said the government should not use theEU’s Digital Marketsas “a blueprint” for the scheme.Tech trial for Australia’s social media ban ‘broadly on track’ amid concerns under-16s could circumvent systemsRead more“The DMA requires changes to Apple’s ecosystem that bring increased privacy and security risks to users, opening the door for malware, fraud and scams; illicit and harmful content; and other threats,” the company said.Apple argued that the 30% rate was only charged to the highest-earning apps, with 90% of the US$1.3tn in sales and billings generated through iOS apps being paid without Apple taking a slice. It said most developers who did pay were charged 15%.The company has also warned against sideloading apps. In addition to the security risks Apple said would come with it not being able to vet the apps that users install, the company said in the submission that, in the EU, pornography apps and apps allowing copyright infringement can be installed.Users have long been able to download apps on to MacBooks and other traditional computer devices this way.

I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Trump said.In 2024, the New York Times reported that Musk’s companies – which include electric vehicle maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX – have over the past year been promised $3bnacross nearly 100 different contracts with 17 federal agencies.Investigate Musk’s alleged drug useTheNew York Timesand theWall Street Journalhave made allegations ofheavy drug useby Musk, raising questions about Nasa requirements for its contractors – including SpaceX – to maintain a drug-free workforce. The Times alleged that Musk has received advanced warning of the tests. SpaceX has been contacted for comment.Responding to the Times allegations on X last month, Musk wrote: “to be clear, I am NOT taking drugs!” In 2024 hesaidhe sometimes used ketamine on a doctor’s prescription.Challenge Musk’s immigration statusSteve Bannon, a Trump ally and influential “alt-right” figure, told the Times on Thursday that Musk’s immigration status should be investigated.“They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status, because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately,” Bannon said of South Africa-born Musk, who is a US citizen.Use general presidential powers against MuskWhen Trump was elected, observers pointed to themyriad waysin which a Musk-friendly White House administration could benefit the financial interests of the world’s richest person. That benign environment, which includes awarding of government contracts and directing federal agencies giving Musk’s businesses an easier ride, could of course be turned hostile.Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University and a specialist in government regulation, told the Guardian at the time: “All federal regulators and prosecutors work for the president. He can tell them to do something or not to do something with the understanding that he will fire them if they disobey.”Ostracise Musk from theMaga movementTrump, as the leader of the “Make America great again” vanguard, can close doors on Musk. The Republican congressman Troy Nehls excoriated the billionaire on Thursday, telling him: ““You’ve lost your damn mind.” He added: “Enough is enough.”Musk can handle such opprobrium and, given his considerable wealth, he is an important source of funding for Republican politicians.What Musk could do to TrumpTurnXagainst the White HouseMusk used his X platform, and his more than 220 million followers on it, to rally support for Trump’s victory in the 2024. It also provided a platform for rightwing views that helped publicise the Maga agenda.Theoretically, Musk could at least use his own X account to criticise Trump with as much regularity as he pumped the president’s policies (the Tesla chief executive is a prolific user of his own platform).However, this also depends on Musk’sinfluence with the US electorate. Five out of 10 US adults say they have an unfavourable view of Musk, according to the Pew Research Center. But it should be noted that seven out of 10 Republicans or Republican-leaning adults hold a favourable view – he’s not going to sway many Democrats who dislike Trump anyway.Form a new political movementMusk, who is worth more than $300bn (£220bn), could divert his considerable financial resources away from the Republican party and start a new political entity. Musk spent $250m on getting Trump elected in 2024, signalling his willingness to invest heavily in politics.On Thursday heposted a poll on Xand asked: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” More than 80% of the 4.8 million respondents voted “yes”.Create geopolitical problems with his businessesThe Starlink satellite broadband platform, owned by Musk’sSpaceX, is playing a key rule in Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion, while China is an important manufacturing and consumer base for Tesla. Through his businesses, Musk also has political contacts around the world and is regularly photographed in the company of global leaders. However, any damage Musk causes to Trump’s international standing or interests will have to be balanced with any knock-on effect on his own businesses.Create problems for NasaNasa has a close relationship with Musk’s SpaceX, with the company’s Dragon spacecraft being used to transport the agency’s astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Musk immediately pledged to decommission Dragon in the wake of the Trump spat on Thursday – before quicklysignalling an about-face. Nonetheless, SpaceX is a crucial part of Nasa’s ISS operations.Tell-all on TrumpMusk has been a fixture of Trump’s inner circle for a considerable period of time and, as the contents of his X account show, he is capable of taking multiple damaging swipes at people. However, members of Trump’s inner circle will have had the same access to Musk, whose personal life is becoming a media staple.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicsDrugsSpaceXXSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Democrats passed the popcorn on Thursday night as the alliance between the world’s most powerful man and the world’s richest imploded via posts on their respective social media platforms.Less than a week ago they attempted a conscious uncouplingin the Oval Office. Then Elon Musk’s attacks on Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending plan escalated tofull-scale denunciationof a “disgusting abomination” – objecting to its effect on the deficit, not the fact it snatches essential support from the poor and hands $1.1tn in tax cuts to the rich.The president said that Mr Musk had “gone crazy” and was angry that electric vehicle subsidies were being removed, claimed he had fired him, threatened to terminate his government contracts, and mocked the billionaire’s recent black eye.Steve Bannonchipped in, suggesting that Mr Musk should be deported.Mr Musk said Mr Trump should be impeached and alleged the government had not released files on the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein because the president was in them. He threatened to immediatelystart decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft– now key to Nasa’s programme – and suggested it was time for a new political party. The ultimate insult: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” he wrote.Mr Musk laterappeared minded to limit the damage, backing away from the spacecraft threat – not surprising, perhaps, when he had just watched $152bnwiped off Tesla’s value. Each man knows thatthe other could hurt him, via government fiat or political war chest. Yet both are so unpredictable that the row could still reignite.Two narcissists used to imposing their will were never likely to coexist happily for long, despite the advantages of doing so: this was less a marriage of convenience than of naked self-interest. Mr Trump loathes sharing the limelight; the Tesla boss frequently grabbed it. The president is surely as resentful of as he is dazzled by Mr Musk’s spectacular wealth. He was angered to discover that Mr Muskhad arranged private briefingson the Pentagon’s plans for any potential war with China – not only a blatant conflict of interest, but perhaps more upsettingly, a sign of his growing power. Mr Musk’s behaviour has also appeared increasingly erratic. A recent New York Times report alleged he took large amounts ofdrugs including ketaminewhile advising Mr Trump prior to the election. Mr Musk hasdescribedthe story as “bs”.His departure from the president’s orbit is good news. Mr Musk implausibly claimed he would save $2tn annually – approaching a third of the federal budget – by taking a chainsaw to bureaucracy. Wild decisions by the so-calleddepartment of government efficiencyare mired in the courts. But he has nonetheless caused real damage which will not easily be remedied, gutting agencies and departments which took decades to build. People aredyingbecause of his demolition of USAID.Yet while the bond between the peak of power and the peak of wealth has been severed, politics remains in thrall to money. Mr Trump’s approach is particularly noxious, turning wealth directly into political favours and power, and power into further wealth. This is the new oligopoly. He oversees a cabinet of billionaires, and has directed his real estate tycoon friend Steve Witkoff, a man with no diplomatic experience, to bring peace in the Middle East and Ukraine. But though megadonors areheavily skewedtowards the Republicans, Democrats toodepend onbillionaires. Mr Musk is a symptom of the underlying malaise. Democracy requires better safeguards against the unhealthy marriage of wealth and power than the rampant egos of those who command them.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsDemocratsSteve BannonNasaSpaceeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Their feud is revealing a fatal flaw in the Maga projectFri 6 Jun 2025 12.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe scriptwriters of Trump: the Soap Opera are slipping. The latest plot development – the epic falling-out between the title character and his best buddy,Elon Musk– was so predictable, and indeed predicted, that it counts as the opposite of a twist. Still, surprise can be overrated. Watching the two men – one the richest in the world, the other the most powerful – turn on each other in a series of ever-more venomous posts on their respective social media platforms has been entertainment of the highest order. X v Truth: it could be a Marvel blockbuster.But this is more than mere popcorn fodder. Even if theyeventually patch things up, the rift between the president and Musk has exposed a divide inside the contemporary right, in the US and beyond – and a fatal flaw of the Trump project.Naturally, much of it is personal. That’s why so many declared from the start that this was astar-cross’dbromance, whose destiny was only ever heartbreak. Even asMusk was declaring, back in February, that “I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man,” wiser heads knew it was doomed. The egos were too large, the narcissism too strong, for their love to survive. In the Trump universe, as in the Musk galaxy, there is room for only one sun.In their case, the personal combines with business. On this reading, Musk’s disenchantment began in his pocket, his opposition to Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”, or “BBB”, currently before Congress,fuelled chieflyby the legislation’s axing of a $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of electric vehicles. With Tesla sales plunging, Musk needed that incentive to lure potential Tesla customers and was furious with Trump for scrapping it. That’s certainly the storyTrump is telling. “I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted … and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted.The suggestion that Musk’s driving motive was profit seems to have particularly antagonised the billionaire, prompting him to call for his former paramour to be impeached andto claim thatTrump is named in the Jeffrey Epstein files, in effect implicating the president in a paedophile ring. Musk wants to present his objection not as self-serving but as ideological, casting himself as the fiscal conservative appalled by Trump’s“disgusting abomination”of a bill because it will increase the already gargantuan US deficit by trillions of dollars.Who’s right? It seems a stretch to argue that Trump’s hostility to electric cars was the problem: as Trump himself pointed out, Musk knew about that when he jumped on the Maga train last year. As for ballooning the deficit, you can see why that would irritate Musk. Adding trillions in red ink makes a mockery of the “cost-cutting” drive he headed up with his so-called department of government efficiency.The billionaire was already smarting from the failure of Doge to cut anything like the$2tn in spendinghe promised would be easy. All he succeeded in doing by, for instance, feeding the US agency for international development, or USAID, into “the wood chipper” was to take the lives of 300,000 people, most of them children, who had depended on that agency and its grants, according to aBoston University study. Even if you are minded, charitably, to accept Musk’s own estimate, he only shrank the federal budget by about$150bn. To watch as that effort was cancelled out by a $600bn tax cut to people earning more than $1m a year would be a humiliation indeed.Whatever its true cause, the Trump-Musk spat has illuminated a fault line in the right – and not only in the US. Battered and quieted by the Trump phenomenon, there still remain a few old-school conservatives with a vestigial presence in the Senate, for whom fiscal rectitude remains an article of faith. While Democrats oppose the “BBB” because its cuts to Medicaid will deprivemore than 10 millionAmericans of basic health cover, these traditional Republicans are queasy about the Liz Truss-style risks of a massive unfunded tax giveaway. Overnight, Musk has become their champion.Ranged against them are the forces of nationalist conservatism, embodied by former Trump strategist and ex-convict Steve Bannon. They don’t have a libertarian yearning for a minimal state; on the contrary, they quite like muscular displays of state power. WitnessTrump’s insistenceon a Pyongyang-style military parade to celebrate his birthday, and note Bannon’s response to Musk’s impudence in challenging the ruler – he called for Musk’s businesses, Starlink and SpaceX,to be nationalised. Indeed, nationalist conservatism might not be quite the right term for what Bannon offers: nationalist socialism might be more apt, though something close to that has already been taken.There have been other manifestations of this divide. Muskopposed Trump’s tariffs; Bannon is for them. Musk wanted to see the US remain open tohigh-skilled, tech-savvy immigrants; Bannon wants to shut the door on them. These, then, are the two camps. (You can see similar faultlines on the British right, dividing Thatcherite Conservatives from Reform UK.) For a while, the anti-woke loathing of DEI policies was strong enough to keep the opposing blocs – free traders and protectionists; deficit hawks and big spenders – together. But that glue, as Trump said of Musk, is “wearing thin”.That has some serious implications forUS politicsand Trump’s presidency. It is conceivable that Trump won’t have the numbers to pass this bill, his central legislative goal, in its current form: the Republican majority in the House is wafer-thin, and one more defecting Republican could sink the proposal in the Senate. Musk has given would-be dissenters cover. The gazillionaire had promised to spend big to help Republicans in the November 2026 midterm elections. Much can happen between now and then, but Trump may now need to look elsewhere for a patron. Who knows, Musk might even follow through on his threat to fund the president’s Democratic opponents. Even if he does not go that far, he controls a prime platform of the right: X could soon become hostile territory for Trump. The point is, Musk is not your usual Trump antagonist. He has as loud a megaphone, and more money, than the president.It all adds up to a sad tale of two men who once had so much in common – perhaps one thing above all. Each has been lucky enough to find themselves in charge of a brand that once enjoyed global admiration and clout – and each man has systematically set about trashing that brand in the eyes of the world. Musk has done it more than once. He bought what had become an admittedly imperfect meeting place of some of the planet’s most influential people, Twitter, and turned it into a sewer of bigotry and lies, X. He built a company, Tesla, whose most obvious customers were high earners concerned about the planet and repelled them by association with a nationalist authoritarian who wants to “drill, baby, drill”.Trump, meanwhile, has taken the US, once a magnet for talent from across the globe, and done his best to dismantle all that made it attractive: its stability, its protection of free speech, the independence of its institutions, the quality of its science and universities. This week’s moves – thetravel ban, the suspicion of overseas students, the war on Harvard – to say nothing of the ongoing hostility to democratic allies and coddling of foreign dictators, are just the latest instances of Trump doing to the US brand what Musk has done to Twitter and Tesla. No wonder Trump and Musk have broken up: they were always far too alike.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’ll pass on the movie, but that description seems pretty apt to what living under thisTrump administrationfeels like: a gratuitously more violent sequel to a ghoulish original.Consider the Muslim ban. Back in late 2015, candidate Donald Trumpcalledfor “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on”. He signed the first version of the Muslim ban on 27 January 2017, and protests erupted at airports across the nation at the revival of a national policy, similar to the Chinese Exclusion Act, that bars entry of whole swaths of people based on our national prejudices. It took the Trump administration three attempts at crafting this policy before the supreme court tragically greenlit it.Trump’s tariffs have become his Vietnam – and the right is breaking ranks | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreWhile Joe Biden later reversed the policy, congressional moves to restrict the president’s ability to institute these blanket bans – such as theNo Ban Act– have not succeeded. And on the first day of his second term, Trumpindicatedhe was prepared to institute a wider-reaching travel ban. He hasnow done just that. The newexecutive orderwill “fully restrict and limit the entry [to the US] of nationals of the following 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen” and will also “partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 7 countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela”.Yes, there are key cutouts in the latest travel ban that make it a different animal from the original 2017 ban, but it still derives from the same family. Green-card holders, those with valid visas issued before the executive order was proclaimed, and professional athletes representing their countriesin the forthcoming World Cup, for example, are exempt, illustrating how the administration has learned to write more litigation-resistant immigration exclusion orders.But make no mistake. Such a policy is alienating, counterproductive and simply racist. For one thing, Trump claims that the ban is necessary because the selected countriesexhibiteither “a significant terrorist presence”, a lack of cooperation in accepting back their nationals, or high rates of visa overstays. According to theEntry/Exit Overstay Reportfor fiscal year 2023 (the last one available), the number of people from Equatorial Guinea, a small African country, who overstayed their B1/B2 visas (travel to the US for business or pleasure) was 200. From the United Kingdom, it was 15,712.It’s true that the percentage (as opposed to the number) of people overstaying their visas from Equatorial Guinea is significantly higher than UK overstays. But Djibouti, whichhoststhe primary US military base in for operations in Africa, has an even higher percentage of B1/B2 visa overstayers than Equatorial Guinea – yet it isn’t part of the ban, illustrating how much it is based on narrow political calculations and cheap theatrics.The capriciousness of the policy was immediately evident after Trump released a video explaining his decision. “The recent terrorattack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed for our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstayed their visas,” hesaid, adding: “We don’t want them.” Yet, as everyone knows, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, attack is an Egyptian national, another key US ally. And Egypt is not on the list.Nor should it be, because these lists of banned countries collapse individuals into vague categories of suspicion and malfeasance. Why should the actions of one person from any given country mark a completely different person as inadmissible? Trump may sound tough to his supporters when announcing the ban, but such broad-brush applications against basically all the nationals of comparatively powerless countries is hardly the flex that Trump thinks it is. In the eyes of the rest of the world, the new policy mostly makes the administration look like a bully, picking on a handful of Muslim-majority countries, a few African and Asian states, a couple of its traditional enemies, and Haiti.Meanwhile, the rest of the world also sees how the Trump administration haswithdrawntemporary protections from more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua,suspendedrefugee resettlement from around the world, and yetwelcomedin dozens of white Afrikaners from South Africa to the United States as refugees. The ethnocentrism of the policy is as naked as it is opportunistic.The truth is that the damage from Trump’s first-term Muslim ban waslong-lastingand had all kinds of collateral impact, including on themental healthof family members living in the United States. And immigrant advocacy organizations are already sharply criticizing this latest version. AfghanEvac, a non-profit organization that facilitates the resettlement of Afghans who worked with American troops,statedthat the new ban “is not about national security – it is about political theater”. To include Afghanistan among the banned countries, even as thousands of Afghans worked alongside American forces, is to Shawn VanDiver, the group’s founder and president, “a moral disgrace. It spits in the face of our allies, our veterans, and every value we claim to uphold.”Trump has launched an unprecedented crusade against legal immigrants | Daniel MendiolaRead moreTrump’s latest travel ban, his ramped-up immigrationdeportation regime, hisinternational student crackdown, and his all butending asylumin the United States add up to a clearly a concerted attempt to stave off the inevitable while vilifying the marginal. Demographers have been telling us for years now that the US will be a “majority minority” country around2045, a prospect that haslong frightenedmany of the white conservatives who make up Trump’s base. In response, Trump is pursuing a policy that draws on the most basic kind of nativism around, and one we’ve seen before in the United States.The 1924 Immigration Act severelyrestrictedimmigration to the US to keep America as white and as western European as possible. Only in 1965 were the laws finallychanged, with the national immigration quotas lifted, laying the foundation for the multicultural society we have today. That earlier movie of epic exclusion lasted some 41 years. So far, this sequel is violent, scary and authoritarian. It had better be a short film.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump travel banOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS immigrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Little connects Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, all targeted for a total ban, or Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela, all targeted for restrictions. The reasoning stated in the order is that they all pose security threats measured by “whether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable nationals”.Visa overstays, the order elaborates, “indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws”. Yet thelatest dataon overstays from Customs and Border Protection does show these countries high on the list, along with others not included.If we sit with this list a little longer, though, with attention to the history of the world we share, we can see a different unifying logic. All of these countries are in the global south, their citizens are racialized as Black or brown andMuslim. Most have high poverty rates that hover at or above half their population. Several have recently been sites of social upheaval or horrific wars. Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan, for example, all appear on the World Food Program’s list of the world’smost dire food crises.Democrats denounce Trump’s ‘reckless’ and ‘discriminatory’ travel banRead moreThese facts do not, as the travel ban assumes, tell of the inherent violence of people from these nations, nor of a penchant to “disregard” law. In fact, even the data on overstays says nothing of people’s legal status. Nationals ofAfghanistan, Burma, El Salvador, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan and Venezuela have long had a right to apply for temporary protected status due to the insecurity of their countries. We do not know how many of the so-called “overstayers” applied for other protections like asylum.The poverty and insecurity of these nations are mainly an indication that they have been subject to imperialism, including US military and economic intervention and coercion.You cannot understand the endemic violence or economic destitution that forces people to leave Haiti without attending to both theFrench extortionof the island nation in exchange for their freedom from enslavement, and theUnited States’ occupationof it. You cannot understand the mass exodus of people from Afghanistan, one of the world’slargest refugee populations, without understanding the United States’ funding of themujahideen, or the so-called “war on terror”, that did little more than further destabilize the nation.

American shrapnel has beenpulled from the bodiesof Yemeni children. Since March,250people have been killed in US strikes on Saada and Sanaa, at least 68 of whom were detained African migrants.Time and time again data shows that African countries such as oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Chad, ravaged bycompanies such as ExxonMobil, and gold-rich Sudan, are not victims of poverty, but victims of theft. TheUnited Nationsestimates that $86bn leaves the continent each year in “illicit financial flows”, or theft through criminal activities and tax evasion. What’s more, between 1970 and 2022, countries in the global south, including those on this list, are estimated to have paid more than$2.5tnin interest alone to the benefit of the global north. Thomas Sankara, a former president of Burkina Faso, once called debt a “skillfully managed reconquest of Africa”.The wealthiest nations in the world arecausing the climate crisisthat the poorest nations pay for. Climate activists estimate that governments in the global north owe $5tn each year to countries in the global south for the devastation they are causing them.Seen from this vantage, Trump’s travel ban, which proudly cites what came to be known as the “Muslim ban” of his first administration in its opening paragraphs, is a cruel escalation of a longstanding policy of profiting off Black and brown lives and disposing of the most vulnerable among them.Trump travel ban comes as little surprise amid barrage of draconian restrictionsRead moreIn displacement camps in New York and Tijuana and the Aegean islands of Greece, I have met pharmacists, artists, DJs and journalists from many of the targeted countries. Just this week I spoke to a political activist who, forced to flee a massacre in one of the targeted countries, left her three young children behind. Speaking to me after the issuance of this ban, she worried whether she would be able to secure her asylum, which is currently being adjudicated, and whether she could ever reunify her family. Her voice broke as she said: “I wish they could understand that I never wanted to come here.”Trump justified the ban by referencing arecent incidentin which an Egyptian man in Boulder, Colorado, injured 12 people calling for the release of Israeli hostages (though notably Egypt is not on the list). That this one act justifies the banning of millions of people is absurd. This latest ban is simply another installment in a series of policies meant to “Make America white again”, following a ban on asylum and acancellationof humanitarian parole. It comes as attacks on our immigrant students continue, particularly those who dare speak out against the US funding of Gaza’s decimation.It is not the people of these nations that are a threat to the security of the United States. It is the United States that has long been a threat to them, robbing them of their wealth, destroying their institutions and environments, and then denying them participation in the safety built at their expense. We should be atoning for our sins, not exacerbating them.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS foreign policyUS politicsDonald TrumpAfricaAfghanistanSudancommentShareReuse this content"

They needed to know about everything from road closures to the whereabouts of their family and friends to sources of drinkable water.Blue Ridge PublicRadiostepped into the breach.Residents used car batteries or crank-powered radios to listen to the station’s daily broadcast, as the editorial staff stayed on the air for long hours, sometimes sleeping on the floor of the Asheville-based newsroom.It was one example of how public media serves its audience, especially those in rural or small-town America, and especially at times of crisis.A Fox host’s ‘rules for being a man’: no leg-crossing, no public soup drinking | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBut with the Trump administration’s draconianpush to “claw back”more than a billion dollars in already approved funds for public radio and television, that service is threatened as never before. It’s up to Congress to decide whether to agree to that demand or to allow the next two years of funding to stand.“This would disproportionately harm rural areas and smaller communities, where public media really is a lifeline,” said Tim Richardson of PEN America, the non-profit organization that advocates for press rights and free expression.It’s not only at times of crisis that public radio and TV make a difference. It’s every day, particularly in places that don’t have a lot of other news sources.With the sharp decline of the local newspaper business over the past 20 years, many parts of America have turned into what experts refer to as “news deserts”. These are places that have almost no sources of credible local reporting.As local newspapers have shuttered or withered – at a rate of more thantwo every week– news deserts have grown. The effects are sobering. People who live in news deserts becomemore polarizedin their political views and less engaged in their communities.One of the foundations of democracy itself – truth – begins to disappear. People turn to social media for information and lies flow freely with nothing to serve as a reality check.Right now, many small and rural communities that are on the brink of becoming news deserts do still have access to public media – particularly to National Public Radio’s network of member radio stations, which employ dedicated local reporters.But the Trump administration’s new effort targeting public radio and television is a serious threat.Katherine Maher, the chief executive of National Public Radio, was right when she warned this week that the loss of funds “would irreparably harm communities across America who count on public media for 24/7 news, music, cultural and educational programming, and emergency alerting services”.With few exceptions, Democrats oppose the demand, but Republicans in Congress – as usual – are largely in favor of giving the president whatever he wants.The House speaker, Mike Johnson, a loyal Trump acolyte, claims that news coverage from public radio and TV is biased, telling reporters that “there is no reason for any media organization to be singled out to receive federal funds”.And Trump, showing his usual lack of restraint, has described NPR and PBS (public television) as “radical left monsters”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Public radio and television in America are notable for theirlackof bias; in fact, both organizations bend over backwards to present all viewpoints. The only prejudice they have is for traditional objectivity in their news gathering and presentation.If there’s a more balanced and thoughtful news report on TV than the nightlyPBSNewsHour, I don’t know what it is.There are excellent reasons to maintain this funding – primarily to give people the information they need to function in their lives and as citizens.One Republican who has stepped outside the party line is the Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski. She has reiterated her longstanding support for public broadcasting in recent days, arguing in an opinion piece in theFairbanks Daily News-Minerthat the proposed cutbacks would be devastating to communities in her state.“What may seem like a frivolous expense to some has proven to be an invaluable resource that saves lives in Alaska,” Murkowski wrote.In the past, when federal funding for public media has come under fire, Congress has repelled the threats.But Richardson is far from certain that that will be true this time, given Trump’s iron grip on the Republican party and its weak-willed elected officials.“We’re in a different situation, a more dangerous moment now,” Richardson told me.But there is an escape hatch. Republican officeholders do have to listen to their constituents or run the risk of being voted out.Voters – especially those in rural areas, small towns and red states – should let their elected representatives know that they need public radio and television to continue. That public media may even be their lifeline.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS public radioOpinionNPRUS televisionRadioPBSUS television industrycommentShareReuse this content"

But Trump still reigns supremeLloyd GreenIn the end, we’re likely to see a legislative pastiche – a Frankenstein’s monster forged by political necessityFri 6 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 13.46 EDTShareThe feud between Elon Musk andDonald Trumpis a godsend for Democrats, a headache for the president and a problem for Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House. Between now and the Fourth of July, Trump expects congressional Republicans to deliver a badly needed win. After more than four months back in the Oval Office, he still lacks a major legislative achievement.Republicans control both the House and Senate, but the public sees goose eggs on the scoreboard. Almost daily, the courts upend the president’s executive orders. Slim legislative majorities and government by rage come with drawbacks.Trump’s popularity is under water. The afterglow of inauguration is gone. His so-called Liberation Day has morphed into Groundhog Day, each day beginning and ending as it did the day before. Except Groundhog Day wasn’t a horror movie.Substantively, Trump’s tariff hikes have brought little by way of jobs or negotiations. On Wednesday, the payroll company ADP reported that monthly US job growth stands at a two-year low. The US dollar weakens, and interest rates climb. Home-buying belongs more and more to the old and wealthy. So much for Republicans having the interests of working Americans at heart.Yet all is not lost for Trump. He has recast the Republican party in his image. What was once the party of Lincoln belongs to him – Musk, the former king of Doge, be damned. By historical standards, Trump is doing OK. His disapproval numbers stand at ameager seven pointshigher than his approval rating. At the end of April, he was staring at a double-digit deficit.The stock market since rebounded. His end is again nowhere near nigh. What autumn yields remains to be seen. Beyond that, Republicans approve ofTrump, 87-11, a mirror image of his standing among Democrats. He also outpaces Musk by 20 points among the party faithful.An acquired taste, Musk wore out his welcome in the West Wing much as he did in April in Wisconsin. He mojo ebbs. Two months ago, Wisconsinites defied Musk and elected a liberal to the state supreme court. In the run-up to the election, Musk had handed out $1m checks to voters. He also appeared on stage wearing a giant yellow cheese hat. His nod to the state’s dairy industry and the Green Bay Packers failed to amuse or garner votes, much the same way his apparent Nazi salutes came up short.Money doesn’t always buy Musk love.Turning to Speaker Johnson: last month he cobbled together a bill that satisfied the needs of his caucus and the demands of his president. Now, he watches the world’s richest man threaten to transform it all into a pile of ash.Already, Johnson complains that Musk declines his phone calls. Then again, Musk has no reason to take them. Unlike Trump or Musk, Johnson’s clout is derivative. Without the president to lean on, he appears limited. Daddy standing in his corner makes all the difference. House Republicans nod at Johnson because they fear Trump.Musk’s barrage is relentless. Think Tony Stark, the alter ego of Ironman, and you get the picture. “Was it all bullshit?”Trump askedof promised budget savings that never materialized. The South Africa native quickly returned fire.Mincing no words, he branded the “big, beautiful bill” a “disgusting abomination”. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader in the Senate, couldn’t have scripted things any better.Musk stays on the warpath.“No one who actually reads the bill should be able to stomach it,”he posted to social mediaon Wednesday.“Bankrupting America is NOT ok!“KILL the BILL.”On Thursday, things escalated; now Musk says hewants Trump impeached. Battle lines are drawn.What the Senate eventually passes is a work-in-progress. The bill authored by the House will probably be amended. Already, Rand Paul of Kentucky has announced his opposition, earning Trump’s ire. Utah’s Mike Lee too postures as a “no”. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin demands deeper cuts.If four Republicans give a thumbs down, the bill fails. In the end, a legislative version of Frankenstein’s monster is more likely, a pastiche pieced together behind closed doors, a matter of political necessity for Trump and his party.“Trump tries to shore up support for megabill among Senate GOP at White House meeting,”a headline blared on Wednesday night.As drafted, the “big, beautiful bill” addresses an array of core issues, including raising the debt ceiling to avoid a default and financial cataclysm, and making permanent the Trump tax cuts, set to expire at the end of the year. Funding for the wall is also on the line.If the BBB failed, under the rules of the Senate, Republicans would be forced to work with Democrats to achieve a compromise, something almost unheard of these days and an anathema to the president and Maga. That would mean egg on Trump’s face, but the public would probably enjoy the spectacle.Maybe Elon would, too. On Thursday,he posted: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude.” Indeed!Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionElon MuskUS politicsRepublicansUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

For Democrats, the moment has comeFri 6 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 13.51 EDTShareEver since the world’s richest person,Elon Musk, threw his financial weight behindDonald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and appeared hopping around idiotically behind the candidate at a rally stage, political observers have wondered what would instigate the two men’s inevitable falling out.Would it be a matter of competing egos, with each man resenting the power and influence of the other? Would it be a matter of clashing cultures, with Trump’s sleaze rubbing the wrong way against Musk’s Silicon Valley creepiness? Would it be an ideological clash, with the paleocon nationalists of Trump’s dwindling inner circle turning against Musk’s cadre of teenage Doge hackers and cosmopolitan techno-reactionaries?It was bound to be something. Trump, after all, is not known for his ability to maintain cordial alliances – not even with those who have been as useful as Musk has been. Trump’s first term, to say nothing of his pre-presidency career, was marked by soured alliances, public remonstrances against onetime partners, and brief, disastrous tenures by employees and advisers who quickly left, angry. Musk, meanwhile, is known for his uncommonly odious personality, a management style that is euphemistically called “mercurial”, and his own increasingly erratic behavior, which includes clashes with a harem of women bearing his children, anallegedly problematic and escalating drug habit, and rumored bladder problems. It’s not just that these are not very smart guys; it’s that they are guys whose power and money has inflated their egos to such a pathological extent that they are no longer stable, or even especially functional. They would be sad enough cases if their personal deteriorations did not have world-historical consequences; if they hurt only themselves and did not create so much needless suffering for others. As it is, these men were bound to turn on one another and their inevitable fight was bound to reorient the Republican party – casting doubt on the unsteady coalition of new media types, manosphere influences and money that had carried them to victory in 2024.Trump v Musk: the two worst people in the world are finally having a big, beautiful breakup | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWhen it finally came this Thursday – with Trump and Musk posting increasingly hostile invective against one another on their respective proprietary social media platforms, Truth Social and X – the fight seems to have been largely about money. Trump posted that Musk had left the administration angry at cuts to electric vehicle subsidies and called for government contracts with Musk’s companies to be cancelled; for his part, Musk began a series of posts in which he claimed that Trump was named in the government’s Epstein files – “That is the real reason they have not been made public,” he said – and reposted tweets calling for Trump to be removed from office. Musk claimed credit for Republicans’ 2024 victory, and called Trump “ungrateful”. Tesla stocks plunged. Soon various rightwing media and Trump-world figures began getting in on the action, lining up behind Trump or Musk with the frightened, needful air of children whose parents are divorcing.Trump seems to have soured on Musk some weeks ago, when it became clear that Doge, Musk’s frenetic and aggressive extra-legal, cost-cutting venture that had sought to gut the federal bureaucracy in pursuit of the billionaire’s libertarian worldview, was chaotic, inefficient and, above all, wildly unpopular. Musk, meanwhile, was angered by Trump’s trade war, which threatened the value of his companies, and by the Trump domestic policy bill, which cut the federal subsidies for electric cars that have benefitted Musk’s auto company, Tesla.For his part, Musk has always had enemies within the Trump camp: Steve Bannon, the rightwing nationalist, had in fact always hated the South African billionaire, even if they shared a love of certain arm gestures. Unflattering leaks about Musk began appearing in the press, some of which seemed intended to embarrass him. Musk launched a media tour announcing his departure from theTrump administrationand hinted at his frustration with the Trump administration and a broader anti-Washington grievance. He began posting about his distaste for the president’s bill; on his last day at work in the Oval Office, he showed up with a black eye.The feud creates new pressures for Republican politicians, who must now choose between angering Musk, whose money could fund a primary challenge to any of them, and provoking Trump, whose approval can make or break their political careers. And it presents a unique opportunity for Democrats, who now have an unprecedented opening to kill the Trump bill, exploit instability in the Republican coalition and widening fractures within the Maga coalition, and remind their voters that the Trump regime is not only corrupt but also incompetent – spiteful, petty and unable to agree on anything except for a shared desire to loot the government and deprive the people for the sake of further enriching the billionaire class.The Democrats have long been tepid and uncertain in the face of Trump’s second term, with a gun-shy and easily spooked party leadership scolding progressive politicians and the activist base alike to not oppose Trump-Musk, but to let them implode on their own. Now they have. The moment has come. It is up to the Democrats not to waste it.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

So how do you talk to young people about living sustainably and raise knowledgeable kids who care about the future of the planet?Here are some tips for engaging the next generation on the environment meaningfully.Start with conversation: get curious and stay positiveDamon Gameau, actor, film-maker and director of documentaries including 2040 and the upcoming Future Council, says we have built a system that doesn’t value nature – and that needs to change. “Very quickly, children aren’t encouraged to care. They’re encouraged to try and extract and conquer and win and compete.”Instilling care and empathy in children works in a similar way to teaching them most other things: through modelling, education and good conversations.Plan your menu, get kids involved and be realistic: how to pack better school lunchesRead moreSusy Lee, author of Raising Kids Who Care and an educator with 18 years’ experience, says the first step is being intentional about what you’re trying to teach. “We need kids who know [that they] don’t need to be suckered into buying more stuff [and] that generosity and compassion and helping others is actually what makes them happy.”Good conversations need two things, she says: curiosity and positivity. Don’t lecture, be collaborative and be guided by questions. Listen more, talk less.Involving kids in age-appropriate discussions about what matters, then modelling good choices, leads to positive outcomes. Some starting points are: discussing where to donate money and time, whether to get an electric vehicle or petrol car, or visiting your local MP to raise issues important to your community.Gameau says adults can also help by acknowledging the size and scariness of the issues, and letting kids feel anger, sadness and fear. Young people already know about the threats, he says, pointing to an international survey that foundnearly 60% of young peoplewere either very or extremely worried about the environment.Connect with natureThen connect kids (and adults!) with the living world again: spend time in nature, get to know the bird varieties and tree species around you, have adventures outside. It’s easier to care about things you know, see and experience. Take the time to stop, examine and discuss. Seek out joy, beauty and fun to counterbalance the gloom.Zena Burgess, CEO of the Australian Psychological Society, emphasises the importance of action and taking individual steps that build a community of people making positive progress. This is echoed by Lee and Gameau, and reflects Bob Brown’s catchphrase: action is the antidote to despair.Start where your kids are. If they love the ocean, take them snorkelling, watch documentaries, pick up rubbish on the beach. Look for ways to reduce plastic in the home and community, join campaigns against single-use plastic. Follow the children’s lead, show them hope and possibilities, and steer clear of overwhelm.Ditch the balloons and swap the plastic toys for cake: how to have a waste-free birthday partyRead moreTake action – and don’t forget to have funIt’s not the kids’ responsibility to fix things, it’s ours. But we can support them, combining their ideas, creativity and passion with our knowledge and experience. This help ranges from having good conversations to dealing with emotions, arranging logistics, finding information and joining organisations. And it extends beyond our own children: we’ll all be affected by the future we’ve created, and need to use our skills and connections to make a difference in any way we can.Look for ways to make it fun. Jump in the surf after you’ve cleaned the beach; revel in your results. You’re joining a community of billions of people taking action across the world. Spread the hope and joy of these stories; seek out the positives. Make sure there’s a clear link between doing good and feeling good and make it something others want to join. Make it cool to care.Raising kids who care is a matter of balancing the truth of where we are with the resilience of both the natural world and human endeavour. As Gameau says, “There’s something beautiful about the human spirit, particularly when its back is against the wall and innovation and creativity get unleashed. We’re capable of doing extraordinary and wonderful things.”Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingChange by degreesChildrenEthical and green livingConservationEnvironmental activismClimate crisisAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was filming the surrender of the entire Egyptian third army with a team from the BBC, without significant censorship or hindrance. The Israeli commander, Gen Avraham Adan, paused in whatever he was doing to give us an update.Crossing the canal on the Israeli pontoon bridge in a bright yellow Hertz car (not a wise choice of colour) we were even helped when we had to repair a tyre that had been punctured by the shrapnel that littered the battlefield.Censorship? Yes, the report was censored by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) back at the satellite feed point in Herzliya. But the censorship was limited only to matters of operational security. This was obviously helpful to the journalists, but also to the Israelis themselves. They had independent verification, with video to back it, of their remarkable achievement in turning around their initial setbacks in Sinai. And they could show, through scenes with a biblical resonance, that the Egyptians’ surrender was conducted humanely and in accordance with the Geneva conventions, the laws of war. As the great columns of the third army mounted a sand dune, they exchanged their weapons for bottles of water abundantly provided.Was it always this easy? Of course not. On another occasion, I rose early and reached a road block beyondGazaonly to be turned back, as all the press were that day, on the orders of southern command.But that was exceptional. The IDF operated a policy of relatively open access based on mutual advantage. Sometimes it would herd everyone into press buses, which was far from satisfactory. But it would regularly provide the major TV networks with an escort officer, armed and in uniform, to enable and supervise the coverage. One of my escorts in theYom Kippur warwasTopol, the actorfrom Fiddler on the Roof. He was something of a hero in Israel, and all roadblocks opened to him.On another occasion I was on my way to the Golan Heights, accompanied and with documents in order, when the great conductor and Israeli sympathiser Zubin Mehta asked for a lift. To my lasting regret I turned him down on the grounds that I had a press pass and he did not – I thought this may harm my chances of being allowed in.Nowhere that the IDF operated was off limits to us. We could film what we wanted and freely interview soldiers of all ranks. In the trenches of the Golan Heights, because of language difficulties, the other ranks tended to be South African immigrants.I was also free to make mistakes. In 1968, the year after thesix-day war, I returned to Israel and interviewed the chief of staff, Gen Haim Bar-Lev, who was busy building the defensive line that bore his name. I travelled to Jerusalem and was stopped at a roadblock outside the biblical village of Emmaus. It stood at the centre of the Latrun salient, a Jordanian outpost in the previous war of 1948. The Israelis were busy dismantling it brick by brick. I was not allowed to film it and could only have reported it by leaving the country, not to return. Such compromises are commonplace, but I regret this one. The village disappeared, to be replaced by a Canadian peace park.View image in fullscreenIsraeli troops crossing the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur war, 6 October 1973.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesI was also allowed, after 1967, to visit and stay in Gaza, and show the day-to-day reprisals by the IDF against Palestinians whom it held responsible for previous attacks. The same applied to the destruction of homes in the West Bank city ofQalqilya, and the sowing of landmines round the churches of St John the Baptist in the Jordan valley. All of this passed the IDF’s censorship without difficulty.Fast forward to today, and the coverage – or rather, the non-coverage – of the conflict between the Israelis and Hamas in Gaza. The broadcasts regularly start with the mantra that the IDF does not allow foreign media access into the Gaza Strip, and proceed with the most vivid coverage, shot bybrave freelancesand other civilians posting on social media from inside Gaza, of scenes of death and destruction with the commentary voiced remotely in Jerusalem, Ashkelon or London. Often, both print and broadcast media preface the numbers of the dead and injured with a reminder that they were provided by theHamas-run health ministry– sometimes the only source available.My former colleague Jeremy Bowen said on theToday programmeon Wednesday: “Israel doesn’t let us in because it’s doing things there … that they don’t want us to see, otherwise they would allow free reporting.” I’m inclined to agree with him.My sympathies are with Bowen, Fergal Keane and others at the BBC, especially when Donald Trump flings around baselessaccusations of bias. The BBC and other responsible news outlets have a difficult line to tread. I cannot speak for the American networks, but the British channels all have excellent reporters standing by in the region, not exactly there but thereabouts, sometimes on the high ground overlooking Gaza, which some reporters call the “hill of shame”. What is missing is the first-hand experience of the war, shared by reporters on the ground who can properly interpret what is happening. This gives free rein to rumour and falsehood.If you were shocked by my film on Israeli settlers in the West Bank, you haven’t been paying attention | Louis TherouxRead moreWhat Bowen and I know from our shared experience is that it is not enough to win the war of weapons without also winning the war of words and images. And the IDF must see that it is losing. It has historically had its ups and downs with the foreign press, but nothing like the present entrenched hostility. It is doing itself great damage, which it is beginning to feel diplomatically.I would urge the following: that the foreign press, especially the TV networks, continue to stand their ground, and that the Israeli press machine does itself a favour and relaxes the rules to allow some independent access to Gaza. This will not only limit the tides of propaganda (on both sides, it must be said) but perhaps hold the frontline troops to higher standards of behaviour, just as it did beside the Suez canal in 1973.It is important to both sides to reestablish at least the limited level of trust that used to exist between them. Here is an example. In the 1973 war, we were able transmit the news by satellite on the day that it happened. Our office was a chair beneath a palm tree near the feed point. In the 1967 war, the exposed news film was bundled into onion bags – blue for the BBC, red for NBC – and taken to the censor who stamped his approval on the masking tape around the neck, before it was air-freighted to London. But he had to take our word for what the film actually showed.The public had a more accurate account back then of events on the battlefield than it does today through the fog of war in Gaza. When access is denied, everyone loses. And, Israel, that includes you.Martin Bell is a Unicef UK ambassador.

Just look at Reform UK’s surge in ScotlandOwen JonesThe party is making inroads among people who once chose not to vote. But as Zia Yusuf’s resignation shows, chaos still reignsFri 6 Jun 2025 08.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 21.30 EDTShareIf you were doubting that Nigel Farage had a serious chance of heading a hard-right British government in 2029, thepeople of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehousejust poured a bucket of particularly icy water over your head. Though Labour won the Scottish parliamentary byelection, defying predictions it would be beaten into third place, Reform UK chalked up more than a quarter of the vote – trailing the victors by an unsubstantial 1,500 voters.This tells a devastating story. Nigel Farage’s outfit seriously outperformed the level of support indicated by Scottish polling: the last four surveys had Reform on between 12% and 19%, yet it secured 26% of the vote after standing here for the first time. This suggests it is mobilising previous non-voters whom pollsters are not picking up. The latestUK-wide YouGov poll, which asked people how they would vote if there were a general election tomorrow, put Reform in first place, eight points ahead of Labour. Imagine if that polling in fact underestimates their reach.There is, however, an important caveat. The multimillionaire businessman Zia Yusuf did an impressive job as Reform’s chair in professionalising its operations:his resignationspeaks to a perennial threat of internal chaos. Like Ukip, Reform may be hobbled by its excessive dependence on its frontman.The SNP, meanwhile, has ruled Holyrood for nearly two decades in an age in which most incumbents are clobbered. The party has lost its best asset, Nicola Sturgeon. Even so, it did not expect to lose 17 points in this byelection. Its activists are divided on whether this loss is down to the party soft-pedalling on the independence cause, or failing to address voters’ bread-and-butter concerns. It seems almost certain that it suffered the opposite phenomenon to Reform: its demotivated supporters stayed at home.The byelection offered up yet more striking evidence that the Tories are being replaced as the standard bearers of the right, as they bagged a paltry 6% of the vote. This is the end stage of a process kickstarted by David Cameron in 2010: try to placate the right of his own party by throwing them endless red meat, making them fatter and hungrier. It’s the same phenomenon that is unfolding across the west: the old centre-right is dying, and being replaced by a radical right that is increasingly contemptuous of democratic norms.Given Reform’s racist claim that the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, would “prioritise the Pakistani community”, its defeat is hardly reassuring, as it still finds popular support among hardcore Scottish unionists. As the pre-eminentpsephologist John Curtice notes, Labour was in fact down on its already weak 2021 performance in this seat, triumphing only because of the fragmentation of the electorate. The result shows Labour is not on course to retake the seat of Scottish power, he concludes. The big message, he says, is that if Farageism is making inroads even in Scotland, its strength has been underestimated.What next? Starmer’s foot soldiers have a strategy. Having achieved unparalleled unpopularity by attacking state provision for disabled people and elderly people, they are opting for a “squeeze” message. They believe Farage replacing the Tories is beneficial, because he has a lower ceiling of support than the traditional party of the right. Our electoral system will force voters to make a binary choice between aLabourgovernment they strongly dislike, and a Farage premiership most fear. The choice is between two bad options – and they’re hoping that voters will pick the least worse.Cast your mind back to the decision of Hillary Clinton’s team tointentionally promote Donald Trumpas the Republican standard-bearer for much the same reason. That didn’t go well. Labour must surely understand how Farage’s capacity to enthuse non-voters raises the ceiling to an unpredictable height. Starmer’s team clearly looks to Canada, where an incumbent liberal government was on course for electoral meltdown, until progressives abandoned the leftwing New Democrats to prevent the hard-right Conservatives triumphing. Yet there are key differences. One is the small factor of the US president openly planning to annex their country. Another is that although Justin Trudeau’s administration may have been deeply disappointing from a progressive perspective, it did not ceaselessly alienate its natural supporters, as Labour has done, including by adopting rhetoric on immigration associated with the far right.Labour won about two-thirds of the seats in the general election with only one-third of the overall vote share. Surely it recognises that Reform could do the same. This ability is only entrenched by our first past the post electoral system, which even the former Conservative minister Tobias Ellwood has described as“dated and unrepresentative”. Faced with a choice between lesser evils, the strategy for progressives ought to be clear: cement a pact between the Green party and other leftwing candidates, focus on 50 or so seats, and throw every resource at them. In a resulting hung parliament, they could force an end to this antiquated electoral system.But the central belt ofScotlandjust underlined an important lesson. The west is in crisis: the rise of the radical right is both a symptom and an accelerant, and nowhere is immune.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionLabourScotlandConservativesByelectionscommentShareReuse this content"

The poorest nation in the UK is being let down. Repeatedly. But what is to be done?What we need is a hero. Someone whose job is to speak up forWalesin cabinet, to be Cymru’s voice in Westminster’s corridors of power. Luckily for Wales, there is such a person – the secretary of state for Wales. Unluckily for Wales, this role has long been utterly obsolete. Rather than being the voice of Wales in cabinet, it far more often represents the voice of the cabinet in Wales. It needs to go.Wales didn’t have its own secretary of state until 1964. The Scots, meanwhile, were given that voice more than 250 years before in 1707, though it was subsequently abolished three decades later and then recreated in 1926. When Wales did finally get one, it was a real cause for celebration and the culmination of much campaigning.The first two people in the post were Jim Griffiths and Cledwyn Hughes, who were highly respected and had great credentials within the Labour movement. The new role paid dividends and within the space of three years the Welsh Language Act was passed, giving Welsh legal status in Wales (amazing what happens when you give people a voice).But in the following decades there were some absolute stinkers in the job. The next one was George Thomas, who wasanti Welsh languageand described the setting up of the Welsh Office as the “greatest mistake”. The low point of his tenure came after the Aberfan disaster, in which a coal tip collapsed on to a school killing 116 children and 28 adults. Subsequent inquiries found that the National Coal Board was squarely responsible for these deaths after refusing to pay for the removal of the tips. After the disaster, 88,000 individual contributions were received for the victim fund but the Labour UK government decided to take money from that fund and use it to clear the remaining tips.Thomas put pressure on the fundto give in.Over the subsequent decades, many of the people holding the role were not even Welsh or in a Welsh constituency. (Imagine if they had tried to do that to the Scots.) The worst of these was the Conservative John Redwood, who was born in Kent and was MP for Wokingham in Berkshire. (If you want a treat, dig out the video of himfailing to mimethe Welsh national anthem.) Redwoodrefused to sign documentsthat were written in Welsh, and didn’t like to stay overnight in Wales, instead driving back to his constituency in England. But perhaps most damning was that, in a country with significant levels of poverty, he took great pride inreturning £100m of the Welsh Office’s budgetto the Treasury unspent. What an effective voice for Wales in cabinet.More recently, Wales has been blessed with some equally diligent secretaries of state. One was Alun Cairns, who resigned from the post after it emerged that one of his staff wasaccused by a judgeof deliberately sabotaging a rape trial. His best-known contribution was a supreme act of brown nosing when he got the Severn Bridge renamed the “Prince of Wales Bridge” – a decision thatonly 17% of people in Walessupported. Another was Simon Hart, whoadmits in his just-published diariesthat, at the official opening of the new Welsh parliament in 2020: “I skip the Senedd bit – partly in protest, and partly to have lunch with Adam.” He doesn’t say what he was protesting about. Another recent office holder was Robert Buckland who was, err, the MP for South Swindon …While Wales has had some shocking secretaries of state, this isn’t why the role should be ditched. It needs to be gone because, however principled, competent and driven the holder of the office, there is no way they can realistically do the job of being Wales’s voice. They have no power, barely any staff, are appointed by the prime minister and bound by collective responsibility. The current situation represents the worst of both worlds: it gives the illusion of Wales having a voice when it comes with a pre-installed mute button.The UK risks falling apart. Keir Starmer can mend it now – but he doesn’t have much time | Martin KettleRead moreThe current holder of the office is Jo Stevens. Speaking to people in other departments as well as the Wales Office, I get the impression that she is at least proactive in making Wales’s needs part of the conversation. I am told she has been focused in trying to get the historic injustices on rail funding remedied ahead of next week’s spending review. Whether it works remains to be seen – and she sadly failed this week to prevent the new rail project between Oxford and Cambridge being classed as an “England and Wales” scheme, meaning that Wales will not receive Barnett consequentials from it. But at least she isn’t openly contemptuous of Welsh democracy like many of her predecessors.The fact remains, however, that whether or not Welsh issues are raised in Whitehall is totally dependent on the whims of a cabinet member who is appointed and often living outside Wales. That’s a terrible status quo. Wales should appoint its advocates, not the prime minister, who has only once in the history of the UK been Welsh. The role of secretary of state for Wales needs to be replaced by a representative of theWelsh government, which is directly elected by the people of Wales. Better still, we need to properly reform the UK so the UK government doesn’t double as the English government.Devolution gave Wales and Scotland a voice, and that voice should reverberate around the cabinet table. It is long past the time that Whitehall needs to acknowledge that the UK is made up of distinct countries. Giving these nations a real voice doesn’t weaken the union, it strengthens it.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

Those ‘peace dividend’ days are goneHelen Miller is the incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal StudiesFri 6 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 13.46 EDTShareOn 11 June, the government will unveil its long-awaited spending review, laying out how it wants to spendmore than £600bnannually on public services over the next few years. That’s about a fifth of the entire British economy. The choices made over funding for the NHS, schools, courts, prisons and much more besides will shape life in the UK in the coming years. It’s no exaggeration to say this could be the defining domestic policy moment of this parliament.Rachel Reeves’s first budget included a big tax rise and atwo-year increasein borrowing to boost spending on public services. For future years, the chancellor has repeatedly reaffirmed her “ironclad” commitment toborrow only to invest. Such is the dismal state of the public finances that even with tax revenues that are high by historical standards, spending growth in the coming years will be relatively modest. Overall day-to-day departmental spending is set to rise by an average of just1.2% above inflationover the next three years. This will make the spending review tough. Allocating spending across departments will inevitably mean picking winners and losers.The single most consequential decision will be how much funding to allocate to theNHS. The NHS budget is big – it accounts for 40% of day-to-day spending on public services. That’s comfortably more than is spent on schools, universities, the police, prisons and defence combined.For decades, the savings from declining defence spending were effectively ploughed into the health service. Those “peace dividend” days are gone. The government has already committed to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income. It’s unusual for health and defence spending to grow at once – and unheard of for it to happen in a period of low growth and high interest rates. If the government also chooses to prioritise the NHS budget alongside defence, other departments’ budgets will see cuts.Consider this scenario: if the government increases defence spending as promised, and opts for a 3.4% annual increase in NHS funding –below the long-term averageand far short of the 6% growth seen under Labour in the 2000s – it would probably be enough to hire the staff the government’s workforce plan says the NHS needs and deliver improvements to NHS performance before the next election. But the wider implications would be stark: it would requirecuts of 1% a yearto the budget for all other departments.The government could, of course, allocate less to the NHS. That could jeopardise the promise to substantially reduce hospital waiting times by the next election and to build an “NHS fit for the future”. But it would free up resources for its other missions to “break down the barriers to opportunity”, “make Britain a clean energy superpower”, deliver “safer streets” and “kickstart economic growth”. When funding is tight, more money for a shiny new initiative inevitably means less money for something else.The prime minister noted that achieving thefive missions of his governmentwill demand “relentless focus and prioritisation”. We’ll soon find out, when push comes to shove, what this government’s priorities are.Some departments, and some ministers, are likely to be disappointed. Once the spending review settlements are revealed, the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, may not be the onlyLabourMP calling for higher taxes to reduce pressure on spending. By autumn, however, disgruntled colleagues could be the least of Reeves’s concerns.At the spring statement in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was significantly more optimistic about growth prospects than most other forecasters. Since then, global developments have been bad news for the UK’s economic outlook.If the OBR downgrades its growth forecast, that could easily wipe out the chancellor’s limited wiggle room against her fiscal rules – perhaps several times over. Last November, Reeves was adamant that she would not be “coming back with more borrowing or more taxes”. But unless she gets lucky, she will have to come back with something to avoid a breach of her rules for borrowing.Assuming her fiscal rules remain “ironclad”, Reeves will have three options. She could cut departmental spending, just a few months after settling multiyear spending plans with her cabinet colleagues. She could make further cuts to the social security budget, when there is pressure – not least from some MPs – to do the exact opposite. Or she could raise taxes again to pay for the spending that has already been pledged. It’s clear why speculation about potential tax rises will continue.But we should not let speculation about the budget distract us from scrutinising the spending review itself. The government’s decisions on how to allocate more than £600bn of spending a year for several years will be of great consequence, whatever happens in the autumn.And, since speculation about the budget will inevitably continue, the discussion should shift from simply how taxes could be tweaked to raise more revenue to how they could be reformed to be less damaging to growth. Delivering higher growth deserves its place as the government’s number one mission and should be a central focus across all areas of policy. Reeves is yet to show any interest in tax reform. She is missing an opportunity. With challenging years ahead, we need a government that seizes every opportunity to drive up economic growth. Achieving that mission would make everything else easier.Helen Miller is the incoming director of the Institute for Fiscal StudiesExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionRachel ReevesLabourEconomicsNHScommentShareReuse this content"

The Ballad of Wallis Island might just tell usGaby HinsliffRain, cardigans and puns: a melancholic new romcom set on a windswept island hints at a relatable British identityFri 6 Jun 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 03.24 EDTShareIt is, according to no less an authority than the romcom king Richard Curtis, destined to be “one of the greatest British films of all time”. But don’t let that put you off. For The Ballad of Wallis Island – the unlikely new tale of a socially awkward millionaire who inveigles two estranged former halves of a folk-singing duo into playing a private gig on his windswept private island – isn’t some floppy-haired Hugh Grant vehicle, but a reflection on our national character that is altogether more of its times.It’s a lovely, melancholic comedy about the acceptance of failure, loss and the slow understanding that what’s gone is not coming back: an ode to rain and cardigans, lousy plumbing and worse puns, shot in Wales on a shoestring budget in a summer so unforgiving that a doctor wasapparently requiredon set to check for hypothermia. Its main characters have not only all messed up at something – relationships, careers, managing money – but seem fairly capable of messing up again in future. Yet as a film it’s both gloriously funny and oddly comforting, taking a world where everything seems to be slowly coming adrift and making that feel so much more bearable.There’s no such thing as a national character really, of course; or at least no set of indisputably British traits on which 68 million people could ever all agree. Yet there’s a clear pattern to how we like to see ourselves represented on screen – endearingly hopeless, perennially mortified, well-meaning but liable to be eaten alive by Americans – which is telling.There was much flapping recently aboutpolling showingonly 41% of generation Z say they’re proud to be British, a steep decline on previous generations. But it remains unclear whether the issue here is gen Z, or the idea of Britain in which they have lately been expected to take pride. If Britishness didn’t seem quite so puffed-up and aggressive, so relentlessly focused on who is deemed not British enough; if it could simultaneously embrace a more self-deprecating, more tolerant, distinctly embarrassed sense of national identity, would that be one with which some people felt more comfortable?For we are not, fundamentally, a “make Britain great again” kind of place. Even when our politicians deliberately try to evoke the Maga spirit, they do it (thankfully) badly: Britain’s answer to Elon Musk’s terrifying Doge (“department of government efficiency”), aslaunched this weekby the Reform party, is headed by some tech dweeb you’ve never heard of whose role essentially boils down to poking round Kent county council looking for “waste”, before presumably discovering that he hasn’t really got the power to fire anyone.View image in fullscreenTom Basden as Herb McGwyer and Carey Mulligan as Nell Mortimer in The Ballad of Wallis Island.Photograph: Focus Features (c) 2025 All Rights Reserved/PAWith all due respect to Rachel Reeves’s mission to rebuild the nation, meanwhile, the most recognisably British part of her big speech on investing in infrastructure this week was that it revolved around regional buses. The pinnacle of our national ambitions is no longer to rule the waves but just to be able to get into Huddersfield a bit faster than previously, along a road with slightly fewer potholes, and it’s time to own that with pride: this is, goddammit, who we really are.For this is the nation that made a copper-bottomed hit out of How to Fail, Elizabeth Day’s podcast in which guests cheerfully spill the beans on all the ways they have screwed up at life; a nation that can’t accept a compliment to save its life, and knows that if by accident you ever become good at something then you’d better make up for it fast by stressing just how bad you are at something else. (In this week’s published extracts from How Not to Be a Political Wife, a British title for a memoir if ever there was one, the demonstrably successful and well-connected Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vinereturnsagain and again to the failure of her marriage and the impossibility of keeping up with high-powered friends: she’s been in the newspaper business long enough to know her readers would infinitely rather hear about the fall than the rise.)“Am I working class or insufferably bourgeois?” – podcastRead moreWe dwell with relish not just on our individual failings but on our glorious national defeats, memorialising all the football tournaments we ever lost on penalties and weaving heroic disasters – Scott dying in the Antarctic, the retreat from Dunkirk – into our national story. We are the country that turned “we’re shit, and we know we are” into a sporting anthem; that treats failure less as a necessary stage of innovation than as a steady state to be lived with, like the weather. Our tendency to assume things will go wrong certainly has its drawbacks – not least a tendency to regard unalloyed good news with crabby suspicion – but it perhaps makes us more philosophical when they do. Not so much a land of hope and glory, as one of perennial mild disappointment.In the past, this unerring ability to puncture our own balloons might have been a healthy trait, a safeguard against a world power getting carried away by its own importance. Of late, the same Eeyorish diffidence feels more like a way of coming to terms with inevitable decline. But either way, tucked inside The Ballad of Wallis Island is the germ of a national story: struggling to tell other people how we really feel about them, in the rain, but still somehow finding reasons to be cheerful.

It’s time for him to make a choiceAndy BeckettVeer left or double down on the right? Either way, the prime minister needs to commit and sell it to an impatient electorateFri 6 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 6 Jun 2025 09.06 EDTShareAfter less than a year in power, Labour has reached a familiar place. Keir Starmer’s troubled government is at a fork in the road, wondering which direction to follow. With the delivery of its spending review next week after several acrimonious delays, and a Commons vote on its divisive welfare cuts expected later this month, the government’s unity and morale are fragile. The public finances are severely strained, with ever more competing demands, such as for extradefence spending. Though much more energetic than its Tory predecessor, this government often seems opaque, unable to explain its purpose in a compelling way.Many voters and journalists – even more impatient than usual after years of manic politics – are already considering what might replace Starmer’s administration. Atbarely 20% in the polls, Labour is as unpopular as in its most disliked daysunder Jeremy Corbyn– and unlike then, has been overtaken by Nigel Farage’s latest vehicle. Most ominously of all, perhaps, even the government’s successes, such as its trade deals, seem to make little or no difference to its public standing or sense of momentum.Both inside and outside the party, there is an increasingly widespread feeling that the strategy pursued by Starmer, his chief of staffMorgan McSweeneyand the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over the past five years – Reform UK-influenced, socially conservative, fiscally cautious and focused on rightwing pensioners and “working people” – has been tested to destruction. Even McSweeney, previously revered by centrist Labour MPs and political journalists as a “realist” about what the party needed to do to win power and hold on to it, is now being briefed against.But what alternative path might the government take? One ever more openly favoured bythe deputy prime minister,Angela Rayner, and the mayor of Greater Manchester,Andy Burnham, leads broadly leftwards: raising taxes on the wealthy, building much more council and social housing, and no longer echoing Reform’s reactionary rhetoric. The nationalisation of failing privatised utilities and the abandonment or loosening of Reeves’s fiscal rules are also increasingly popular in the party, even among the centre-left conservatives of Blue Labour.Yet the problem for anyone hoping that the government will radicalise in response to its political crisis is thatLabourgovernments rarely do. In opposition, when less cautious party activists and thinktanks have more influence, Labour does sometimes move to the left, as it did by making Corbyn leader after losing the 2015 election. But in office it more often does the opposite. The rightwing media, powerful business interests, conservative parts of the civil service, and voters and Labour politicians who believe that all leftwing policies are a risk: all these influences tell ailing Labour governments that their troubles are actually due to not being rightwing enough.In 1931, the Labour chancellor Philip Snowden – preoccupied, like Reeves, with making the government seem financially responsible – responded to the Depression and a growing budget deficit by rejecting expansive, more leftwing policies and proposing benefits cuts. Only a narrow majority of the cabinet backed him, and the government collapsed. At the election that followed, Labour was crushed.A similar story played out in the 1970s, when Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan’s Labour governments – which, like Starmer’s, had inherited a weak, inflation-prone economy from the Tories – cut public spending to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund. At Labour’s 1976 annual conference,Callaghan dismissedthose who wanted a less austere approach: “That option no longer exists.” It’s easy to imagine Starmer sternly saying that to a left-leaning minister now. Yet in the 1970s, as in the 1930s, Labour’s rightward shift didn’t save it from election defeat.Despite these discouraging precedents, today’s Labour centrists may not be deterred from pushing for another turn to the right, with further concessions to business in the name of economic growth and further clampdowns on immigration. One of the characteristics of Labour centrism, along with its lack of fresh ideas since Blairism, is a lack of self-doubt.Such a right turn could conceivably work this time. Labour could cobble together a new electoral coalition from voters who want to stop Reform at any cost, people who back Labour whatever its policies and former Tories who want to support a less chaotic party. Recruits could come from Reform, too, if Farage’s inexperienced party makes big mistakes – such as the suddenresignation of its chair, Zia Yusuf, after a public row about whether to call for a ban on the burqa –or loses its novelty in the long stretch until the next election. With politics unprecedentedly fragmented, an ever more conservative Labour government may not need many votes to get re-elected.If you find this prospect unlikely or just depressing, and want a frustrated Labour government to finally take the other, leftward fork in the road, there are some grounds for hope. The recent interventions by Rayner and Burnham reflect not just their own more left-leaning politics and possible leadership ambitions but also an awareness that Britain is in a less rightwing phase than many conservatives and centrists believe. Public attitudes to privatisation, nationalisation, inequality and trade unions have shifted leftward in recent years. During the Labour governments of the 1930s and late 1970s, public opinion was moving the other way.Moreover, Starmer’s suppression of the Labour left has inadvertently helped make the Greens more popular and radical, led to the election of five leftwing independent MPs and created a large pool of discontented socialists which may crystallise into a new party. With Labour losing as much support to these forces as to Reform, the pressure on the government to move left could soon become too large to totally ignore.In some policy areas, it can even be argued, the government is already on that path. Better workplace rights, the nationalisation of rail companies, removing or lessening the privileges of private schools andnon-doms, restrictions on the North Sea oil conglomerates andnew infrastructurefor neglected parts of England: a limited but much-needed redistribution of power and wealth is already under way.The problem is that Labour is too timid to say so. At the next general election, whether the government moved left or right when it hit trouble will matter less to Britain’s many unideological voters than whether it did so with a clear and convincing rationale. Democratic government is partly about confidence: having it, showing it and persuading enough voters to puttheir confidence in you. Labour looks far from confident right now.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerOpinion pollsReform UKJeremy CorbynConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

How swaths of a city that is otherwise arrestingly beautiful look as if a giant toddler high on methamphetamines stumbled through them, scribbling on everything in sight with a giant Sharpie.In my mind there is, of course, a fuzzy-but-significant divide between street art, graffiti and tags. There is an entire graffiti wall just across the street from my apartment, visible from my living room, and I adore watching its constant state of flux – the greens and blues that slowly replace bubbly, fat oranges and reds. Sometimes, the wall tilts towards pictures; sometimes it tilts towards words. Other places in the neighbourhoodregularly get postered(“Stop aux violences faites aux femmes”), there are walls that host the retro-style tile aliens put up by Space Invader or thedark-haired women of Miss. Tic, and some cracks in the pavement have even been filled in by theanonymous street artist Ememem.View image in fullscreenA mural in Paris depicting women cutting their hair, to show support for protesters in Iran, 5 October 2022.Photograph: François Mori/API appreciate all of this. I deeply dislike the tags.Street art, like other forms of art, seeks to convey something about the world and the person who drew it. The political postering anchors us in the reality of a world that is far too grim, far too often. Tagging is nothing more than a way of saying me, me, me.Some, I’m sure, will say that the real difference is that I amjust a bobo; that I want what aesthetically pleases me, and reject what does not. That maybe you can’t have one without the other, that Paris is rebellious by nature, that frustration comes with freedom. Aren’t the tags a bit of grit that reveal the city as something real and alive, rather than an open air museum in a tourist-friendly stasis? Aren’t they a form of voice for people who don’t write for major media? If you want to live somewhere spotless and perfect, move to Switzerland, not the 10th arrondissement, you might be thinking. It would be worse, far worse, for Paris to lose its alternative, countercultural identity.View image in fullscreenPoster by Miss. Tic in Paris.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThere is some truth in all of this – Georges-EugèneHaussmann’s grand avenues were designed in part to put an end to Parisian revolts and street barricades. The seventh arrondissement is a postcard; the 20th is a real city. But what sets tagging apart is that it is the visual urban incarnation of a largely, if not exclusively, masculinist impulse towards domination.Street art and graffiti are a form of conversation with the people who live in a city; tags say nothing more than “I was here” and “I dominated this space”. To tag is as egotistical as abillionaire’s dick-shaped joyrideto the edge of space. It’s a dog peeing on a fire hydrant. It’s visual manspreading. Just as with the people who play music on speaker on public transport, or who scream into their phones, the point is not for other people to experience and engage with their art, music or street performance; it is for us to cede to the inevitable truth that, for a moment in time, they control our experience of public, collective life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When you live in a city, you expect the metal grilles of storefronts to be fair game; when someone has scribbled their callsign on a random part of a second-floor wall of a residential building, that feels different. That feels like a violation, the same way it feels like a violation when tags proliferate on shared public spaces – on rubbish bins, the insides of public toilets, the exterior wall of a restaurant that will have to be pressure-washed by a minimum-wage worker in the morning.The city, apparently, has reached its limit and isvowing to do somethingabout the scourge of tagging. When they find the culprits, let me suggest an appropriate sentence: thoroughly cleaning the areas they’ve made less livable. After that, maybe the city can find them some art classes.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsParisOpinionStreet artEuropeFrancecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s been a strangely positive experience to come to the concept of “economics” through living my life as a poet, novelist and medical journalist, because it allows me to critique things that might otherwise go unnoticed. Another very wise friend told me that her husband went to university to study economics, was told on day one that the entire model is built on a concept of infinite growth, and he quit to become a gardener. No wonder we’re friends.The first book of economics I read wasThe Serviceberryby Robin Wall Kimmerer. The point of this beautifully written, small book (a long essay, really) is that different concepts of “economies” exist – we needn’t be beholden to the neoliberal, western, cut-throat, strangle-your-dreams economy that many of us feel mired, indeed trapped, within – and she describes something from her Potawatomi heritage called the gift economy. She speaks of reciprocity and abundance, rather than grasping and scarcity. The revolutionary thing about Kimmerer’s writing is that it’s gentle, assured, and as a reader I’m left with no doubt that she’s correct.Living in a tiny house is preventing me and my toddler from becoming homeless | Kelley SwainRead moreWith my leap to a tiny house, part of my decision-making came from the practical economics of the fact that I would either need to earn more or spend less. Because my daughter is not yet in school, I want to spend less money so I have more time: so I can be present and available for her. No doubt, I could have turned my efforts to a full-time job with higher income, put her into full-time daycare – but none of that appealed to me.A slow and gentle lifestyle is possible, it’s just not sold to us, so it is harder to listen out for. We have to listen for that silence beneath all of the racket and noise. For me, even right this moment, that silence is not silence: it’s raindrops and birdsong. The morning sun is lighting up the pale bark of the gumtrees. Fairy wrens are dancing on my deck. I can choose to spike my nerves and turn on the news, because yes, I want an update on how that fair vesselMadleenis doing: my mother’s heart holds all her crew close, and I am amazed to be in a world where such feats could be seen as heroic, but in fact feel simplynecessary.

My daughter is a gift, and because I co-parent, every day I get with her is a gift. The friends who have been involved in this tiny house project have all given me gifts of time, ideas and even objects – doors, use-of-ute for moving and a wardrobe. My health is a gift, and my health has been far better since embarking on this journey towards a gift economy. Of course I pay for groceries, but when I’m in my new space, I’ll be able to grow vegetables, and there is a popular local “crop swap” in my village. I’ll be down the road from a few small-scale producers, where I can buy potatoes from a neighbour and lentil dal for family-friendly prices. In some ways, though organising my week is work – juggling journalism, part-time PhD, primary parenting – it’s also a pleasure, because I’m choosing it.Meet the woman who lives without money: ‘I feel more secure than when I was earning’Read moreWe want our lives to be full of pleasure, not debt. I’ve noticed something too: the more money people have, the less pleasant they sometimes are (not always). It makes me suspect there is something poisonous about money. There are plenty of large-scale examples rampaging about right now; I don’t need to name names. But recently I had the pleasure of sitting in my neighbour’s sauna; she lives in a tiny house, she retired early and she has no debt. She shared that wealth by inviting me to her personal wood-fired sauna, where we chatted about many of the things she learned about tiny house living. A weekend afternoon spent in a luxurious sauna, and it didn’t cost me anything.Lately, I’ve had the gift of some lovely home-cooked meals with friends and have remembered how that is, perhaps, the greatest gift of all. Sharing food, sharing time, sharing meals. Embracing a gift economy and a smaller scale of life, I’m abundantly grateful.Kelley Swain works in the field of medical and health humanities.

You can’t just waltz into an Hermès store and pluck one off the shelf, even if you’re prepared to drop the many thousands required to pay for it. “The great majority of people are refused a Birkin, they get told that there aren’t any available in the store, which is a lie, they just don’t want to give it to them,” explains the protagonist of Palestinian writer Yasmin Zaher’s debut novelThe Coin, which this month won theSwansea University Dylan Thomas prizefor authors aged 39 or under.Zaher’s unnamed narrator, a Palestinian woman living in New York, has to get to grips with Hermès’s exclusive and elusive sales policies – which seem to privilege loyal customers – after being drawn into a Birkin reselling operation.The Birkin scheme is just a side quest, though; her day job is teaching in a school for underprivileged boys. But the protagonist’strueoccupation, in this quirky, unconventional novel, described by Elif Batuman as “bonkers” and Slavoj Žižek as a “masterpiece”, is cleaning: the meticulous, fanatical cleaning of her body and its surroundings.She develops a routine – which she calls a “CVS Retreat”, named after the US pharmacy chain – involving scrubbing and shaving every inch of her body with products and tools bought at the chemist in a process taking three to four hours, “about the average time it takes a New York lunatic to complete the marathon”.One spot she’s unable to clean with her Turkish hammam loofah is the square in the centre of her back. After one of her CVS Retreats, she begins to feel something “blazing and spinning” in that area, and believes it is a coin, a silver shekel, that she swallowed during a car ride as a child. Naturally, the coin becomes a fixation.“Obsession is a very good way to create a character’s downfall,” says Zaher. The writer herself has an “inherited obsession” with cleanliness, passed down from her mother and the other women in her family. Early in the novel, the narrator says that when you enter a woman’s house, “you never think of all the madness entailed” in making it “sparkling clean”.Fashion is is a tool for discrimination, classism and elitism – and I despise all of those thingsWorking on The Coin, Zaher became more intensely fixated on hygiene, and on fashion, with which she has a “love/hate” relationship. While Zaher feels “seduced” by fashion, “it’s also a tool for discrimination, for classism, for elitism, and I despise all of those things”.Zaher, 33, was born in Jerusalem, before leaving for Yale University at 17 to study biomedical engineering. “I come from a traditional culture. Writing wasn’t something that I thought was possible. So I went into the ‘minority path’: I studied science and I wanted to be a doctor, because that’s what people like me did. And at some point in my mid-20s, I had the courage to do what I actually wanted to do.”She went on to study creative writing at the New School, where she was advised by the novelistKatie Kitamura. She started writing The Coin after moving to New York, drawing on Clarice Lispector’s The Passion According to GH, about a woman who undergoes an existential crisis after crushing a cockroach in her apartment. Lispector “really inspired me to write wildly, to not think too much about what I was saying, about it making sense”, or about “morality”, says Zaher.She wrote the first draft “very quickly” – it was “so messy and so illogical and so strange” – and then spent six years editing it. Meanwhile, she worked as a journalist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Agence France-Presse, covering mostly culture, and “obviously politics, because we have a lot of that”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The character’s “initial standpoint”, says Zaher, “is that she’s going to America and she’s going to reinvent herself as this glamorous woman who has no past, no roots, no constraints on her”, but “her past and Palestine keep bubbling up to the surface”.The same happened to Zaher when she was writing the book: “I set out to write a novel that was fun, sexy, full of pleasures, and against my will, in a way, the past was coming up for me, and the painful present was coming up for me, and at some point I had to submit to that.” Although the character in New York is “totally fictional”, almost all of her childhood memories are Zaher’s real memories, including the swallowed coin.By the end of the novel, we learn that during the Nakba – the forced displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war – the protagonist’s great-grandfather’s land was seized by Israelis. The Dylan Thomas prize’s ceremony happened to fall on Nakba Day, 15 May. Publication of The Coin marked a “lifelong dream” coming true, but it has also coincided with “one of the hardest years of my life”, she says.Being Palestinian “is a very dominant identity. You live with it all the time. You’re all the time being reminded of it, externally, internally. And even more so now,” says Zaher. “My fear is that the book gets attention because I’m Palestinian.” Yet the central character is not “this perfect victim that people expect to see in a novel written by a Palestinian writer”.Zaher instead sees her character as “almost a perpetrator”. She is often judgmental and rude, and her relationships with students are inappropriate (one boy, Jay, regularly helps clean her classroom; she begins leaving him money, and at one point kisses him on the forehead).Writing is about engaging in fantasy – it’s like an exploration of parts of us that we cannot live in real life“I don’t like novels where there are good people and bad people,” says Zaher. “I find that boring. I’m always attracted to novels that bring me closer to my bad, secret fantasies, my repressed bad qualities. I think it’s because reading is engaging in fantasy, and writing is also engaging in fantasy, so it’s an exploration of parts of us that we cannot live in real life.”Aside from Lispector, key literary inspirations have been Kurt Vonnegut – “he made me understand that there’s this thing called contemporary literature” and that you “don’t have to imitate the classics” – and Michel Houellebecq. “I really connect with the loneliness of his characters, and I think he’s a very courageous writer.”Zaher now lives in Paris, with her husband, whom she met while living in New York. She’s working on her next book, a “newsroom mystery” set in Jaffa and inspired by her time at Haaretz. Asked what impact the £20,000 prize, the UK’s most prestigious for young writers, might have on her work, she says she is generally a private person, and tries “to not think about these things”. But “it would be nice if the book would reach more people who really connect with it”.Is she still obsessive? “After seven years of being inside this novel, I think I’m a lot less clean than I used to be, and I also care about fashion a lot less. In a way it sort of healed me of my own obsessions.”The Coinby Yasmin Zaher is published by Footnote.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

On a good day, you might even catch a glimpse of France. But the view won’t have been much consolation to those who were imprisoned here – locked up for a year and a day back in the 16th and 17th centuries – because they were accused of witchcraft. Such was the hunger for trying witches here that historian William Monter has called theChannel Islands“the witch-hunting capital of Atlantic Europe”.Jersey’s witchy history first caught the imagination of Carolyn Rose Ramsay when she worked as a tour guide on the island. A Canadian native and former dancer for major ballet companies in Europe and the Americas, Ramsay soaked up local myths such as the “witch ledge”, built on the side of chimneys so that anyone on a passing broomstick would rest there rather than come down your chimney. She visited Rocqueberg Point, known as Witches’ Rock, where you can supposedly see the footprints of dancing sorceresses. But then she came across the grimmer real-life history of the trials.View image in fullscreen‘Mass hysteria’ … a 1678 line engraving of the hanging of witches.Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/AlamyIn 2022, she set up Ballet d’Jèrri, Jersey’s own contemporary ballet company, and the stories of witches real and imagined, celebrated and persecuted, have inspired its new triple bill, with premieres from three female choreographers: Vidya Patel, Katya Bourvis and Cecilia Lisa Eliceche. It will be performed outdoors, against the atmospheric backdrop of La Hougue Bie, a neolithic burial site, or “passage tomb”, which is one of the oldest buildings in the world.When I arrive at the company’s studio at the Jersey Opera House in St Helier, the dancers are rehearsing with choreographer Eliceche, who is clearly enjoying herself. “Yes! I love that,” she calls out, beaming, as the dancers pull off a tricky warp and weft sequence. She shows me some of the props they’ve been using. “We have a witch’s hat!” she exclaims, holding out a beautiful straw creation with a long, pointed crown which she brought from her home in Salvador, Brazil.Women were accused, tried, tortured and murdered for supposed transgressionsEliceche has always loved tales of witches. Her mother’s family come from Zugarramurdi in Spain’s Basque Country, a supposed hotbed of witchcraft in the early 1600s, and she would visit the witches’ caves there. A self-described “experimental” choreographer, Eliceche has drawn on those memories to make her piece, alongside her own spiritual practice of Haitian vodou, tying in stories of present-day persecution, especially of the Mapuche women on the border of Chile and Argentina near where she was born, who have been put on trial for defending Indigenous land rights. Eliceche is having their names embroidered on to the dancers’ costumes.She feels this project was made for her, which is funny because that’s exactly what Bourvis says when we speak: “I feel like all the work I’ve been doing was preparation for this!” Many women today are enticed by the sense of magic, ritual, feminine power and connection to the natural world that witchcraft in its various forms offers. Inevitably, the truth of Jersey’s witch trials is more grisly. In parallel with what was happening across Europe in a period of of religious fervour, women were accused, tried, tortured and murdered for supposed transgressions.View image in fullscreen‘Intuition and sisterhood’ … Katya Bourvis’s Flux.Photograph: Rebecca Le BrunAt the Jersey Archive, collections director Linda Romeril carefully places a bound volume of 16th-century court records on a pillow in front of us, all delicate pages and spidery calligraphy. She translates from the French the case of Symon Vauldin, accused in 1591 of having discourse with the devil in the form of a crow and a cat. “It says he’s confessed to the crime of witchcraft and he will be hanged and his body burned and reduced to cinders,” says Romeril. This is the first surprise to me. Not all the accused were women – about 20% were men like Vauldin, who was married with four children.Many women were accused of diabolical acts, from casting evil spells to causing the deaths of humans and animals. From the scant surviving information, Romeril tries to put together a picture of who these women were. Some were from respectable families, with husbands and children. One, Andree Tourgis, was accused of killing her daughter’s illegitimate child and sentenced to death in 1608. Romeril wonders what the real story was: she may have been some sort of midwife – so was this a stillbirth or cot death, or even an illegal abortion?For having an affair, she was sentenced to be whipped ‘from the courthouse to the shore till the blood comes’In a small island community, there was also the possibility of family feuds, local disputes and jealousies being involved. And trials often coincided with periods of turmoil, such as the spread of plague in the late 1500s. Those accused of witchcraft may have practised some kind of alternative medicine, such as Jeanne Le Vesconte, who was accused of “infecting some and curing others”. They executed her nonetheless. Public hangings took place in what is now the Royal Square. “Hanged and strangled,” say some of the records.By the mid-1600s, the charges were more predictable. Elizabeth Grandin was accused of leading a life that was “lustful, wicked and scandalous” and of having an illegitimate daughter to boot, while Guillemette du Vaistain had an affair with her brother-in-law. These women could have been tried for a moral crime in an ecclesiastical court, but adding witchcraft meant a potentially harsher sentence. What Bourvis wanted to explore in her piece, Flux, was the archetype of the witch as a symbol of “everything that’s not allowed. She represents messiness and sexuality and desire, but also intuition and wisdom and sisterhood”.View image in fullscreen‘They may not be innocent of other crimes’ … prisoners at Mont Orgueil Castle.Photograph: Malcolm Walker/AlamyFlux is about womanhood and femininity, but also societal systems, “history continuing to repeat itself – and the way we are conditioned to behave because that’s the only way to survive”. Bourvis could be talking about any number of current social or geopolitical situations when she says: “The duality of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ creates this mass hysteria and insecurity, causing us to behave in the most harmful and heartless ways.”Dr Adam Perchard, dramaturg on Ballet d’Jèrri’s production, also points to the pertinence of the theme: “Fear and suspicion of the other, the patriarchy trying to control the masses – is that the 16th century or is it the present day?” Meanwhile, Ramsay talks about today’s social media witch-hunts and how little it takes for people to pile on, “to join in with their pitchforks”.Perchard is a writer-performer-cabaret artist and Jersey native who got hooked on the island’s witch trial history after hearing stories of resistance: of women who found loopholes in the law; refused to submit to the jury of 24 landowning men who would judge them; or endured their stay in Mont Orgueil without confessing, despite probably being tortured. (While Jersey has no evidence of the torture, in neighbouring Guernsey it is written into the court records: “Confessed under torture.”) Perchard cites the example of Du Vaistain, who did have her punishment downgraded. “But it wasn’t such a happy ending,” he says, “since she was sentenced ‘to be whipped all the way from the courthouse to the shore till the blood comes’. Then she’s banished for ever. But at least she had her life.”View image in fullscreenMont Orgueil Castle on Jersey, where suspected witches were imprisoned and tortured.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyFrom the 1560s to the 1660s, there were 65 trials, with 33 leading to execution. Others of the accused were banished, some died before trial, a handful were acquitted, and the fates of a few are unknown. It’s not a huge number across a century, but significant for a population of only 10,000. There are a lot of gaps in the records, which is partly why it’s such a fruitful topic for art: there is room for interpretation. We can’t assume that everyone was entirely innocent, says Romeril. “They’re all innocent of witchcraft, but they might not be innocent of other crimes. It’s just not black and white.”After the 1660s, with the rise of the Enlightenment in Europe, the witch trials came to an end in Jersey, although by then the idea had taken hold in America. The Salem witch trials were in 1692 and 1693. These days witchcraft has a more benign reputation. Patel found herself drawn to the witch’s connection to earth, nature and the seasons – themes she often uses in her own choreography, which is based in the Indian classical form kathak. She describes the piece she has made for Ballet d’Jèrri, Mark Our Ashes, as “a reimagined ritual” honouring the people who lost their lives. Perchard introduced Patel to some of Jersey’s flourishing community of modern-day witches, with whom they’ve been hanging out. “I’ve been getting my witch on!” says Perchard, who goes on to recount a “divination through cocktails” meeting. “Everybody was getting out their rose flowers preserved in vodka under an Aquarius moon. And by the time we tried them all, we never got round to any divination.”The sheer enthusiasm for the subject from the three choreographers proves that the figure of the witch captures imaginations still. Back at Mont Orgueil Castle, there is a decorative metal screen that pays tribute to the victims of the trials. You turn a handle and its mechanical parts creak into life. A small model of a witch on a broomstick twirls in jerky circles. The shrieking of the metal sounds just like a gleeful cackle.Ballet d’Jèrri: Witch Trials is at La Hougue Bie, Jersey, until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceWitchcraftJerseyChannel IslandsSexualityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As Carrie Bradshaw returns, she talks about being an antihero – and the death of fashionFri 6 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareCarrie Bradshaw was undoubtedly not intended as a hate figure whenSex and the Cityfirst aired. But in recent years,a curious cultural shift has occurred: newer fans have started to see Carrie, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, as the most toxic thing about the horny, headline-grabbing show. An entirewebsite, Carrie Bradshaw Is the Worst, was devoted to explaining why Carrie sucked. (The most common complaints: she cheated on nice guy Aidan; talked about herself too much.) One viral essay posited that Carrie was TV’s first female antihero. Parker, 60 and still synonymous with pop culture’s most iconic single gal, has grown to love the term.“I prefer that to any other description of her, because it allows her to be as male as the men have been. I love The Sopranos so much, and I look at all the times [Tony] was unlawful, and we loved him. Carrie has an affair and everybody falls apart,” says Parker ruefully. “An antihero, to me, is somebody that’s not behaving in conventional ways, and she hasn’t ever.” She pauses. “Am I crazy?” Another pause. “A lot of people love her too, though!”Nobody could accuse Parker of being an antihero; in person, she is considered and endlessly gracious, eloquent in a way that puts her in stark contrast to Carrie, the garrulous character she made so indelible 27 years ago. In 2021, she returned to the role in spin-offAnd Just Like Thatwith the same fizz and magnetism. Seated in a Paris hotel room for the European launch of the show’s new season, Parker is tiny – her tininess magnified by the chicly gigantic grey V-neck she wears over a floral dress – and has impeccable posture, surely a holdover of her childhood years spent training as a ballet dancer.View image in fullscreen‘A lot of people love her too!’ … Parker in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBOAJLT is a hugely divisive show – a marker of how relevantSex and the Cityremains – largely because of its clunky handling of race and sexuality, though it arguably nails the way moneyed older people try, clumsily, to talk about progressive politics. Some fans hated the absence of Kim Cattrall’s Samantha Jones, and the introduction of Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), a non-binary standup who becomes Miranda’s (Cynthia Nixon) love interest. But for many, the revival is a deft exploration of life after grief – Carrie’s husband, Mr Big, dies in episode one – and a frothy ode to traditions that seem to be dying out: getting dressed up on a whim for brunch; finding romance in everyday life. This season – which focuses on Carrie’s relationship with on-again, off-again beau Aidan, a handsome new neighbour played by Jonathan Cake, plus hijinks such as Miranda accidentally sleeping with a virgin lesbian nun – is just as delightful.Front and centre, of course, are Carrie’s incredible outfits. She is always dressed to the nines, whether walking through the park in a gigantic hat that looks like a picnic basket or strutting through her apartment wearing a dress adorned with hundreds of jangly charms. (At one point, her proclivity for heels even becomes a key plot driver, as her downstairs neighbour asks her to invest in –gasp!– slippers.) This might be one of the show’s most fantastical elements: a version of New York where everyone isn’t just walking around in yoga sweats. How does Parker, a local style icon herself, feel about the city’s shift to athleisure?View image in fullscreenGingham style … Parker with Sarita Choudhury as Seema Patel in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBO“I mean, I see a lot of people – women in particular – in New York in leggings. They are often on their way to, it seems to me, an exercise experience of some kind. I’m slightly allergic to me criticising the commitment to athleisure wear … You can’t be a hypocrite about it if you believe in wearing what feels good when you walk out the door,” she says. “There are occasions when I think: ‘People should be dressed up, I want to see some effort,’ but the idea of legislating that is counter to a lot of stuff we’re meant to feel and live by. So, it’s not creative but if you’re comfortable, I mean, who am I?”Perhaps AJLT’s main function, then, is as an appealingly joyful piece of escapism in catastrophically dark times. But in the new season, Parker hopes, the show takes on new depth, too. “I was excited about the way the relationship with Aidan would sort itself out, because there’s a new maturity to both parties, especially Carrie,” she says. “It all sounded good to me – challenging, exciting, fun and hopefully funny.”Carrie’s growth is one of the show’s many changes that she welcomes with open arms. “It’s no surprise that at this point in her life, she’s just more equipped, like we all are. I’m reacting differently to things now because I have a decade more experience,” she says. If she were still an antihero … well,thatwould be a hard sell. “We’ve not seen Carrie at this point in her life – I think it’s developmentally correct, but not that surprising. You know, she’s not been a wildly hysterical person for the [entire] nine years spent on television!”View image in fullscreen‘People should dress up – I want to see some effort!’ … Parker in And Just Like That.Photograph: HBOThe complexity of a character such as Carrie may have caused some of AJLT’s new additions to seem one-note in comparison. Che Diaz, the “queer non-binary Mexican-Irish diva”, was one of its most controversial additions – a caricature of queer culture in stark contrast to the nuanced women who defined the original show. Che hasn’t returned for season three. Parker says she was “shocked” to discover the character was so widely reviled. “A friend of mine brought it up to me, and it’s like: ‘What are you talking about?’ And he said: ‘Yeah, there’s all this conversation,’” she recalls. “I’ve been an actor for 50 years, and I’ve almost never paid attention to peripheral chatter. I loved working with them.”Viewers and critics may have had a problem with Che, but if anyone’s flying the flag for Carrie, it’s gen Z. On social media, Carrie is seen as the ultimate messy protagonist; flighty and flinty in equal measure, she is the perfect avatar for a generation obsessed with debating (and subsequently ignoring) red flags and turning traumatic events into pithy one-liners. Barely a day goes by when I don’t see Carrie’s “Single & Fabulous?” New York magazine cover repurposed as aresponse to a modern embarrassment. Parker hasn’t seen this phenomenon first-hand (“I’m not on TikTok myself – I don’t say that pridefully, I’m just overwhelmed by the idea of it”) but hears about it from friends’ kids.“It’s curious, because their lives are so different – the language they use around dating is different,” she says. “They’re less patient. They’re more punitive. They’re not as forgiving of people’s shortcomings. I’m not condemning it, it’s just what I’ve heard. So it’s really interesting that they feel so spirited about it. It doesn’t mean they aren’t objecting to Big and Carrie’s relationship, or the way he treated her, or choices Carrie made. But people had those strong feelings back then, too.”Does she ever feel disheartened that the original show – a quarter century-old ur-text ofheteropessimism– still feels so relevant to audiences now, who find the carnival of dud men dated by Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha painfully relatable? “I think it would be a reason to feel disheartened, but the show is also about finding home and contentment, whatever home means to you,” says Parker. “I feel that 20- and 30-year-olds should be searching. There should be something in the distance that’s important and exciting, and worth the wait. Part of it is rather dreary that great women of all ages are still incredibly frustrated by the dating scene, but I also see a lot of happy endings.”View image in fullscreen‘Great women of all ages are still frustrated by the dating scene’ … Parker.Photograph: HBOThe culture around Sex and the City is cyclical in more ways than one. In the 2000s, the show was criticised for accelerating the gentrification of New York’s meatpacking district; now, New Yorkers are fretting about the arrival of the West Village Girl, a new city transplant who treats the neighbourhood as “a fabulous theme park … to live out Sex and the City fantasies”, is how New York magazinerecently describedit. I ask Parker if, as a longtime West Village resident, she’s heard of this stereotype, which has caused endless conversation online recently, and she immediately turns sheepish, admitting that her husband Matthew Broderick worded her up on the terminology the week prior.“We see it all the time. I mean, every single place has lines round the corner, there’s young girls dressed in very fine threads everywhere, and they’re all stopping in the street and taking their pictures, raising a camera up high,” she says, holding her arm up as if taking an 0.5 selfie. Parker is rattling off the West Village Girl description with ease; for a second, I feel as if I’m in one of Sex and the City’s brunch scenes in which the ladies pontificate, with relish, on the hot topics of the day. “But I remember they said that about the meatpacking, too – they said we ruined it. I recall being crucified for that. It happens – the West Village is a very charming advent calendar kind of neighbourhood, and it’s been through many versions of this, and the true born-and-raised West Villagers have always complained about it, and rightly so, because it’s priced people out.She continues: “Retail rent has gone way high, the price of a coffee – because they’re not going to the deli! If you would just go to the deli,” – she cups her hand around her mouth as if trying to reach the West Village girls through a megaphone – “Just go support Sam’s Deli on West 4th Street!But I think that’s the nature of these things … you’ve seen the lines for a croissant that’s not really croissant – is it a bagel? Is it a donut? Then they top it off with some whipped cream and olive oil and salt and people gomadfor it.”Today’s New York – exclusively a playground for the wealthy, some say – is a far cry from the New York Parker grew up in, after her family moved in an RV from Cincinnati to Roosevelt Island in 1977 in search of opportunity. She frets about the inaccessibility of the city to working-class people “constantly.” “It’s beyond a concern – New York has become impossible for artists, [whether] ballet dancers, photographers, whomever. We haven’t had the kind of political support in our city to really be smart and innovative about affordable housing and protecting culture. It’s our biggest export – so when we’re not able to offer shelter to the people producing that, and focus on tax breaks for big corporations, we lose what makes us singular,” she says. “It’s like an epidemic, this constantly untreated problem. We all do better for having [artistic] communities. Every study in the world shows it.”View image in fullscreen‘They said we ruined New York’ … Parker (left) with Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis in Sex and the City.Photograph: HBOIt was New York’s deep-rooted arts scene that nurtured Parker’s entire career, from her stint being directed – as a child – by Harold Pinter in a Broadway production of The Innocents to her time performing in experimental theatre to her role as Carrie. It’s somewhat surprising she was so game to return to the character given that she’s gone to such efforts to break free of the Carrie archetype with projects such as the 2016 dramaDivorceor last year’s stage revival ofPlaza Suite, with Broderick, in London – not to mention being a judge for the 2025 Booker prize. Was there ever, I wonder, any reluctance? I read her a quote from 2006 by her former co-worker Cattrall, in which she says there’s a “darkness” to playing an iconic character, because those around you can lose sense of where the character ends and you begin. Parker, who has famously fallen out with Cattrall in recent years, seems to stiffen slightly at the mention of her name, before relaxing when realising the question is not about her.“Being a public person is complicated,” she says. “It asks you to be generous of spirit at times in which you might have a child having a meltdown at an airport, or you’re having a tough conversation on the phone. But if that’s my cross to bear, I’m in a pretty enviable place.”And Just Like That is on SkyComedy and Now in the UK.

Now she is swapping Broadway for a powerful account of Britain’s broken prison systemFri 6 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareEach morning before filming Lollipop, Posy Sterling took a giant bucket outside, filled it with ice and climbed in. Never mind that it was November or that her call time was at 5am; the actor would take daily dips in the freezing water in the dark. In Lollipop, Sterling plays a headstrong mother who has recently been released from prison and is fighting to win back her kids.The role is heavy, but the ice baths meant she started the days feeling light. “I just found it euphoric,” she says. Tickled, her driver started bringing her more ice as part of her ritual.Today, Sterling, 32, is similarly full of beans, buzzing from two coffees and fresh from six weeks in New York. “I haven’t slept,” she says brightly. The actor has been quietly building her profile since Screen International named her one of 2023’s Stars of Tomorrow, with performances in the Saoirse Ronan addiction dramaThe Outrunand Benedict Andrews’s buzzy take onThe Cherry Orchard at the Donmar Warehousein London, which has just finished a run off Broadway. We’re meeting in an office in north London, where Sterling is excited to talk about her first leading role in a film.“I share a fire with Molly,” she says of her character in Lollipop. Sterling is breezy and charming, but there is an intensity to the way she speaks. She says she related to Molly’s “refusal to be reduced”, despite the difficulties she faces. In the film, Molly lives in a tent while on a waiting list for a one-bedroom flat. It is the only kind of accommodation she can apply for as a single, unmarried woman, but in order to live with both her children,she needs at least two bedrooms.View image in fullscreenMother load … Posy Sterling in Lollipop.Photograph: Tereza CervenovaAs if things weren’t hard enough, Molly has just spent the last four months in prison.According to the Prison Reform Trust, 58% of prison sentences given to women in England and Wales in 2022 were for less than six months. “And yet the repercussions of what someone like Molly is going through can last a lifetime,” Sterling says. “Usually they’re reacting to the environment they’re in,” she adds, listing poverty, addiction and domestic violence as typical contributing factors. “A different punishment could be served instead of a prison sentence.” She pauses and laughs darkly. “Orhelp, maybe?”The film is written and directed by Daisy-May Hudson, who made the 2015 documentary Half Way, about her and her family’s experience of homelessness, when she was just 24. Lollipop is Hudson’s first fiction film but it is driven by a similar mission: to expose the bureaucracy that punishes people who have fallen through the cracks of society, and to show their joy and resilience. Sterling is electric as Molly, blazing with intelligence and maternal rage.Lollipop review – impassioned, head-butting indictment of the social-care systemRead more“What I really like about what Daisy-May chose to do, is that she doesn’t ever say why Molly went to prison,” Sterling says. “That doesn’t define a person, and it doesn’t tell you anything, actually, about who they are,” though “it’s probably the first thing people would ask”. The film resists offering up Molly’s crime as a way of justifying her situation. Instead, Hudson presents a character study of a flawed, fiercely loving woman trying her best to be a “good” mum.Sterling doesn’t have children of her own but, before Lollipop, had already spent time researching pregnancy in prisons for another role. Sweatbox was produced by Clean Break, a celebrated theatre company whose cast and crew are made up of women affected by the criminal justice system. Set entirely in a prison van and following three women as they are transported between prison and court, the play was turned into ashort film, which caught the eye of Lollipop’s casting director, Lucy Pardee, a regular collaborator of Andrea Arnold. Sterling read the script for Lollipop seven times before her audition, because how prison affects mothers was something she “cared about already”.In order to build the character of Molly, Sterling had conversations with a woman who had fought to regain custody of her children after they were removed. “She would tell me viscerally what her body went through when this happened to her, which was something I was able to draw on when playing Molly,” she says. In the film’s most devastating scene, the stoic Molly finally crumbles, letting out an animal howl of pain on the floor of a social services building. Sterling tears up when I mention it. “It felt quite ancestral, to be honest,” she says. “It’s important that you see how something is just affecting someone. How much can one person take?”Sterling was born in Manchester in 1992, and spent her childhood in north London and, later, Market Harborough in Leicestershire. She is one of eight, including stepsiblings. Sterling and her younger siblings were born quite close together but have different accents because of where they grew up. She says she was “massively protective” of them. “I was separated from my siblings for a time,” she explains cautiously, and “was moved around quite a lot growing up”. The experience of being in so many different situations gave her a fascination with people-watching and quietly psychoanalysing behaviour.“I don’t want to say I was naughty,” she says, but at school, the label stuck. “I was always very passionate,” she adds, two deep dimples emerging. “But I was quite rebellious.” Performing was an escape while growing up and Sterling, a gifted singer, would put on shows and direct anyone within earshot. She applied to Italia Conti drama school, whose alumni includeLesley Manvilleand Naomi Campbell. “Basically I did get in, before Clean Break,” she says.View image in fullscreenKeeping it in the family … Lollipop.Photograph: Tereza CervenovaSterling declines to talk about the circumstances that led her to Clean Break, but explains that “to be a service user [at the organisation], you do have to tick some boxes” – Clean Break being for women who have either been affected by the criminal justice system or are at risk of offending. In 2015 she joined Clean Break’s Young Artists programme, which she describes as “a second chance for a lot of women”. When Sterling was referred there, she remembers that she didn’t want anything to do with acting. “I felt things deeply and had started to do my healing,” she says, and so the prospect of ploughing her emotions “felt like that would be too much”.The programme was an opportunity “to turn pain and experience into something”, as well as an instructive lesson that acting is not the same as therapy. “Sometimes at drama schools, they try to get you to dig and unearth all the worst things in your life, whereas somewhere like Clean Break, they are nurturing you as a person. It’s not always about ‘How do you get into character?’ but ‘How do you get out of character?’”Italia Conti “held my place” and Sterling graduated in 2016. To be an actor, she says, you need life experience – something that nobody can teach. “But you need to have the skill to approach characters, and to be able to access parts of yourself in a way that isn’t going to re-traumatise you.” In Lollipop, Sterling’s soulful performance feels authentic, but it is precise and crafted.View image in fullscreen‘It’s not always about how do you get into character, but: how do you get out of character?’ … Posy Sterling.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian.

In an email, Ashton says Lollipopwas the first acting work she had seen from Sterling. She said her performance was “full of primal feeling and nuance” and left her “truly awestruck … Posy is that electrifying blend of trained technique and raw emotion.”Sterling is also a gifted vocalist and sings in the film. She is “learning the guitar at the moment” and has been “jamming the blues” with musicians she met in New York. During an early Clean Break performance, her rendition of a Frank Sinatra number caught the ear of Jane Winehouse, stepmother of Amy, who invited her to participate in the Amy’s Yard outreach programme, which supports vulnerable young musicians. Sterling wrote and recorded a song in Winehouse’s studio, and met the producer Mark Ronson at a gala 10 years ago. The experience was a turning point that “connected me to myself again”, she says.A few weeks ago in New York, at a performance of The Cherry Orchard, the actor Grace Gummer, daughter of Meryl Streep, was in the audience. She was so taken by the play that she brought Ronson, her husband, with her to see it again the following day. Sterling did a double take when she saw him while on stage. “They were meant to be going to another show, and she traded the tickets in to come back to see it a second time,” says Sterling. It was a full-circle moment, reminding her of just how much has happened during the last decade.Sterling credits Clean Break and the outreach programmes she took part in with instilling self-belief at a time when she had little. “They really want you to see what they see,” she says. “Then it feels like there’s been a reason for all of this.”Lollipop is in cinemas from13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmUK criminal justiceTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The restaurant known as “Naps” to locals is where a group of transgender people regularly come together to chat over beer-battered shrimp, deep-fried green beans and cheese curds. Many travel long distances to do so.“An amazing woman called Martha oversees it,” says Piepenburg, 54. “She told me the stories of people who drive there but can’t get out of the car, and of one young trans woman whose mom stayed outside so her kid could enjoy themselves. It’s not political, everyone was having fun just being able to be themselves. Naps shows how important gay restaurants are – and they are not new. Walt Whitman enjoyed eating in his era’s version of a gay restaurant. We’ve been finding one another for a very long time.”Piepenburg is speaking above the sizzle of bacon and soft rock at theMalibu Dinerin New York’s Chelsea. Diners are his favorite places to eat and they play a starring role in his fascinating, funny and moving book,Dining Out: First Dates, Defiant Nights, and Last Call Disco Fries at America’s Gay Restaurants.Scared advertisers, flag bans and Trump: the US is in for a troubled Pride 2025Read moreThe book, which sprang from a2021New York Times article, travels coast to coast to tell the deep and intriguing history of the American gay restaurant. These establishments, which serve as cozy refuges for sexual minorities, seem all the more necessary amidDonald Trump’s assault onLGBTQ+ rightsand apride monthdistinguished by a mass exodus of sponsors.First, Piepenburg makes clear that he uses “gay” as an inclusive term that encompasses all groups within the LGBTQ+ and queer umbrellas. And for him, what makes a restaurant gay comes down not to the sexual orientation of the proprietors – but whether the venue typically has a significant LGBTQ+ clientele. The stories that arise from the regulars and owners of these establishments are deliciously varied.Writing ofAnnie’s Paramount Steak Housein Washington DC andCasita del Campo in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, Piepenburg reveals the histories of family-run restaurants that have long been gay havens. Then atBloodrootin Bridgeport, Connecticut, he discovers a longtime feminist restaurant and bookstore with radical, inclusive politics at its heart.View image in fullscreenOrphan Andy’s, a 24-hour diner, opened in San Francisco’s Castro neighborhood in 1977.Photograph: Erik PiepenburgIn his home city of Cleveland, Ohio, Piepenburg visits the gay saunaFlex, where comforting food – cheese ravioli, meatballs – is served to customers in their towels. “Flex is not a restaurant,” he says, “but it is serving a purpose. It’s bringing people together over meals.” Asked what the best dish is to serve to those whose main purpose of going to a bathhouse is to have sex, an assistant manager tells Piepenburg: “We love the chili. The staff hates the laundry.”View image in fullscreenErik Piepenburg.Photograph: Peter LarsonPiepenburg writes of the automat cafes of the early 20th century which became popular with gay men “cruising each other overa sandwich and cup of coffee”, and in New York, the very gay branch of Howard Johnson’s in Times Square. The Tiffany Diner in Greenwich Village was below a doctor’s office. Upstairs, gay men went to be treated for the giardia parasite, imbibing medication that took an hour to take effect; many then went downstairs to the Tiffany for a coffee while they waited.Other New York City haunts that Piepenburg dishes on include the still-legendary coffee shop Big Cup that was the 90s real-life gay incarnation of Friends’ Central Perk, and of Florent, the much-loved Meatpacking district restaurant that was a magnet for the cool and queer long before the neighborhood’s stridently glitzy gentrification. After being diagnosed HIV positive in 1987, its charismatic owner Florent Morellet displayed his fluctuating T-cell count on the bottom of repurposed menu boards facing the dining room, and in 2004, the venue hosted the photographer Spencer Tunick for a cover shoot for Poz, a magazine about living with HIV and Aids, featuring a group of HIV-positive people in the nude.“Gay restaurants are special because they are safe spaces for people who have nowhere else to go,” Piepenburg says. “An elderly gay person whose partner has died maybe can’t afford a $20 cocktail, but they can go to a gay restaurant, be greeted warmly and get a meal,” Piepenburg says, his voice breaking again. “That’s maybe their only interaction. It’s so moving to me.”View image in fullscreenThe Mexican restaurant Casita del Campo has been serving Los Angeles since 1962.Photograph: Erik PiepenburgRestaurants can also be places of protest. Piepenburg tells the story of Deborah Johnson and Zandra Rolón Amato, a lesbian couple celebrating their six-month anniversary in 1983 who were told that booths at Papa Choux, an upscale LA restaurant, were reserved for straight couples only; a landmark court case followed.In Atlanta, Piepenburg uncovers the story of “hustler brasserie” Gallus, a multilevel gay venue that contained a very cruisy bar, cabaret area and fancy restaurant. He writes of the welcoming restaurants and food initiatives that ensured people with Aids ate when they faced stigma and demonization.“I thought they were dying, but they’re thriving,” Piepenburg says of the gay restaurant today. In Palm Springs, California, he ate chopped chicken liver on crostini at the restaurant Alice B – named after writer Alice B Toklas, life partner of Gertrude Stein – on the ground floor ofLiving Out, an LGBTQ+ retirement community, while theWater Lilies, a male synchronized swimming troupe, entertained in the pool outside. In New York, reliable mainstays such asCafeteria,Elmo, andArriba Arribapower on. The serving of burgers continues at the venerableJulius, and there is foodie innovation atHagsin the East Village.One of the most piercing character portraits in Dining Out is of Peggy Hubbard, a waitress at Atlanta’s Silver Grill, who was “mama bear” protective of the venue’s gay clientele.Elsewhere, Piepenburg captures the magic ofOrphan Andy’sin San Francisco’s Castro and his devotion to the now-shuttered Melrose Diner in Chicago; a handsome early boyfriend he took there felt differently, “which was a warning sign”.Four queer business owners on Pride under Trump: ‘Our joy is resistance’Read moreIt augured better when Piepenburg and David, his partner of 17 years, went on their first date to theSkylight Dinerwest of New York’s Penn Station. “David wanted to go as much as I did. I knew he’d be a keeper.”The future of the gay restaurant is a mystery, Piepenburg says. He ponders if, with greater social integration, it has had its day. Maybe in major metropolitan centers, he answers himself, but not in places where LGBTQ+ people have fewer spaces and a greater need to commune, especially in a politically hostile era. “Younger people told me they wanted ‘third spaces’ to meet each other – not bars, not work. Perhaps gay restaurants are one of those third spaces.”Whatever else, he hopes, there will always be the sizzle and soft rock of the neighborhood diner.Dining Out: First Dates, Defiant Nights, and Last Call Disco Fries at America’s Gay Restaurantsis published by Grand CentralExplore more on these topicsBooksRestaurantsLGBTQ+ rightsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From the new robot Walt Disney to Mountainhead, movies are fuelled by immortalityTranshumanism has long propelled films from Metropolis to The Matrix. But Jesse Armstrong’s billionaire satire isn’t sci-fi fantasy. Nor is the ‘robotic Grampa’ Disney’s granddaughter so despisesStuart HeritageFri 6 Jun 2025 04.38 EDTShareFor years, the world’s most perfect urban myth was this: Walt Disney’s body was cryogenically frozen at the moment of death, waiting for technology to advance enough to bring him back to life. Started by a National Spotlite reporter who claimed to have sneaked into a hospital in 1967, only to be confronted by the sight of Disney suspended in a cryogenic cylinder, the myth prevailed because it was such a good fit.Disney – and therefore Walt Disney himself – was the smiling face of rigidly controlled joy, radiating a message of mandatory fun that is magical when you are a child and increasingly sinister as you age. This policy (essentially “enjoy yourself or else”) suits the idea of cryogenic preservation. After all, if you have the ego to successfully enforce a blanket emotion as a company mission statement, you definitely have the ego to transcend human mortality.However, not only has the cryogenic Disney myth been put to bed – he was cremated weeks before the National Spotlite hack claimed to find his body – but his family has issued a strongly worded rebuttal of the very idea of a post-human Walt Disney.The catalyst is the recently announced Disneyland show Walt Disney – A Magical Life, which will feature as its star attractionan animatronic recreationof Walt Disney. This, according to Josh D’Amaro, Disney experiences chair, will give visitors a sense of “what it would have been like to be in Walt’s presence”. However, Disney’s granddaughter Joanna Miller is convinced that this isnot what Disney the man would have wanted. In a Facebook post that was stinging enough to earn her an audience with the Disney CEO,Bob Iger,Miller said Disney was “dehumanising” her grandfather. “The idea of a robotic Grampa to give the public a feeling of who the living man was just makes no sense,” she wrote. “It would be an impostor, people are not replaceable. You could never get the casualness of his talking, interacting with the camera, [or] his excitement to show and tell people about what is new at the park. You cannot add life to one empty of a soul or essence of the man.”As recently as a decade ago, this would have been the stuff of bad science fiction – a woman worried that a multinational corporation is bringing a dead relative back to life against his wishes, like a warped nonconsensualWestworld– but no more. As an entertainment concept, post-humanism feels worryingly current.After all, the subject forms the backbone of Jesse Armstrong’s new filmMountainhead. Set in a world of bro-y tech billionaires that is only half a degree removed from our own – one in which AI-created misinformation has already caused society to start to erode – the inciting force of all the dark chaos that unfolds is Steve Carell’s character, who finds himself with a pressing need and an increasingly tight deadline to become transhuman. In other words, his body is failing and only technology can help him ward off the inevitability of death.And this is no flight of fancy. As recently as this year, scholars have been sounding alarms aboutNeuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant company. In aPoliticoarticle illuminating the growing tension between the religious right and Musk’s views on extending human life beyond normal mortality, Alexander Thomas, of the University of East London, pointed out that transhumanism ultimately means that “the 8 billion people alive today simply don’t matter – genocide and wars are mere ripples, as long as some survive, and Musk is the one that needs to survive”.View image in fullscreenIs there life after … Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyFor those of us with certain genre interests, this is all starting to feel alarmingly eerie. Transhumanism may be the word of the moment, but it is a subject that has fascinated cinema for almost as long as the form has existed. Close to a century ago,Fritz Lang’s Metropolisrevolved around the idea of the Maschinenmensch, a robot expressly designed to carry a scientist’s dead lover past the point of her death. Decades later, Stanley Kubrick’s2001: A Space Odysseywas obsessed with what comes after humanity, either in the form of emotionless artificial intelligence or all-seeing Star Children.The theme has been played in countless different ways. InThe Matrix, transhumanism is a punishment, our beating hearts and warm bodies reduced to a power source for the robot uprising. InRoboCop– and especially in its less nuanced sequels – it is a weapon, upgrading fragile humans into unstoppable fighting machines designed to uphold justice at any cost.Neill Blomkamp’s Elysiumused it as a metaphor for class, with the monied haves using technology to perpetually augment their lives while the have-nots are doomed to a finite lifetime of toil.MeanwhileSpike Jonze’s Hertook a warmer approach, concerning itself with the confusing entanglements that occur when the human and transhuman collide. And Ridley Scott’sBlade Runnerfound outright sympathy for its transhuman replicants, who are vilified, hunted and searching for meaning beyond their programmed purpose.Obviously there have been duds along the way.Wally Pfister’s Transcendencefeatured an attempt to upload a scientist’s mind to the cloud so that he could fiddle around tediously with nanoparticles. The Lawnmower Man remains unwatchable, as doesJohnny Mnemonic, and the less said about Bicentennial Man the better.View image in fullscreenMorgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy and Rebecca Hall attempt to upload Johnny Depp’s mind in Wally Pfister’s Transcendence, 2014.Photograph: Peter Mountain/APBut all these films are science fiction. In Mountainhead, however, Carell’s urge to achieve transhumanity is not presented as mad science or wild ambition, but as a mundane tech-bro imperative. It hardly even seems speculative. He is a man who is afraid of death, and just needs to wait for five years so that one of his peers can iron out the kinks in the procedure. The notion is brought up with less ridicule than Jason Schwartzman’s character’s fondness for line-caught turbot.It is because science fiction has finally caught up with us. We live in an age where swathes of industries are about to be decimated by AI that is increasingly indistinguishable from human creation (although God knows how much more terrifying2001’s HALwould have been overlaid with ChatGPT’s chummy “yay you!” sycophancy). In retrospect, Elysium’s depiction of a transhuman ultraclass feels like it was torn directly from Elon Musk’s dream journal. Plus, transhumanism already exists, in a form. If you need proof, listen to theVirtually Parkinson podcast, in which a series of celebrities react with varying levels of dread to a series of questions barked at them by the reanimated AI voice ofMichael Parkinson.Perhaps this is to be expected. After all, the future depicted in movie sci-fi of old is already long past us. Blade Runner was set in 2019,Soylent Greenin 2022. Robocop was supposed to happen a decade ago and 2001: A Space Odyssey was set in, well, you get the idea. While we haven’t quite uploaded human consciousness or handed society over to emotionless lawbots, the scaffolding is all around us: facial recognition, neural implants, uncanny AI assistants that apologise like eager interns.That said, there hasn’t yet been a movie about the creator of a multinational entertainment corporation who dies of natural causes, only to be brought back to life against his will 60 years later as the result of a marketing department brainstorming exercise. And why should there be? After all, it isn’t science fiction. At this point in time, it’s barely even fiction at all.Explore more on these topicsFilmWalt Disney CompanyTheme parksBlade RunnerThe Matrix2001: A Space OdysseyArtificial intelligence (AI)featuresShareReuse this content"

She was 22 and having moved fromIrelandto Manchester, was working in TK Maxx and, at the weekends, as what she’s fond of calling a “sexy shots girl”: “Cash in hand, £8 an hour, 11pm to 3am, teetering up and down the stairs of a nightclub in the building where Joy Division shot the video for Love Will Tear Us Apart with a tray of Jägermeister shots they’d put a bit of dry ice in – burned your skin if you got it on your hands – selling them for three pound each. Terrible job. And just getting absolutely stoned out of my bin all the time, doing whatever drugs anyone would give me for free. I had absolutely no friends.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m aware of the fact that my career is going to struggle as a result of this stuff’ … CMAT. Styling by Mia Maxwell, grooming by Niall Candy.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianAn attempt to get her musical career off the ground, “trying to make hyperpop because I loved Charli xcx so much”, had come to nothing. She had just broken up with her “old, weird” boyfriend and was “completely alone in a flat in Chorlton, thinking: ‘What have I done?’ I got really, really, really upset. I kind of looked at myself in the mirror …” She lets out a snort of laughter. “I feel like there’s so many film scenes where people write songs and I’m like, ‘that didn’t fucking happen like that’, but this one did. So I’m crying, grabbed my guitar and wrote I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby! in like 20 minutes. And that was that. I thought: ‘I know what I need to do now.’”A couple of years later, I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby! was one of a trio of smart, witty, country-inflected songs that catapulted Thompson to lockdown-era fame in her native Ireland, turning her into what she calls “a big fat pop star” in a matter of months. Her debut album, If My Wife New I’d Be Dead, entered the Irish charts at No 1, its success spreading to the UK,Europe, Australia and the US. Her second, Crazymad, for Me, featured a duet with John Grant and was nominated for an Ivor Novello award and the Mercury prize. Success all happened “purely because I’ve got better at writing songs”, and came surprisingly easily, she says. “Whenever someone’s like, ‘Oh, is it really difficult?’ There’s parts of it that are difficult, but in general, I’m just like ‘This is class, no issue at all. This is great.’”Take a Sexy Picture of Me – videoThere’s no doubt that CMAT is a fantastic pop star, and you can see why Sam Fender has her opening for him in a series of stadiums. Arriving at her record company offices direct from a photoshoot, she looks extraordinary. Her clothes are a riot of bright clashing colours, her enormous sunglasses initially hide eyes thick with glittering blue makeup: she manages to exude a certain chaotic glamour while eating a pasty as a late lunch.She is incredibly forthright on a huge range of topics. She stands up for trans rights – “If you think of social media as like a video game, you rack up the spoils really high when you decide to go for a group of people who are already at risk” – and confronts the culture of wellness and self-improvement or, as she calls it, “the rise-and-grind ethic which is making people insane and making them unable to communicate with other people because they’re so obsessed with focusing on themselves”. Sometimes she’s too forthright for her mum, though: a recent appearance on Adam Buxton’s podcast provoked a dressing down. “She told me it made her cringe: ‘That lovely posh Englishman, so well spoken, and you calling yourself a cunt the whole interview. And you’re not a cunt, you’re lovely.’”I’m crazy and I do crazy things, and I have crazy relationships with peopleAnd yet, she concedes there has been a significant downside to her breakthrough. “The kind of headspace that good songs come from is one of extreme emotion, extreme depth of feeling,” she says, “which has an impact on my life. I do live in that really heightened state of emotion all the time. I’m crazy and I do crazy things, and I have crazy relationships with people.” She doesn’t mean crazy as in wild or outrageous, she qualifies. She means crazy as in authentically unwell, or – as she puts it with characteristic bluntness – “mental”.Now 29, Thompson thinks she has always suffered from auditory hallucinations, but during the making of her third album, “I started actually hallucinating. I was in New York, writing. I didn’t realise for the first two months that was what was happening, but I basically imagined the entire apartment I was staying in was crawling with insects, that I had insects crawling on my skin all the time. I was calling the landlord, letting off bug bombs, I made them throw the couch out because I thought it was covered in fleas. I was itching all the time. I was texting a group chat of friends, sending them pictures of all the bug bites on me: New York’s disgusting, full of insects. And they didn’t exist. I went to the doctor and showed him my bites and he said: ‘Those are stress hives; you’re mental.’” (Possibly not an exact diagnosis.) “I was hallucinating the whole time.”View image in fullscreenCMAT on stage at Bergenfest 2024 in Norway.Photograph: Per Ole Hagen/RedfernsFor that reason, she worries that songwriting might not be a sustainable occupation for that reason, or that taking medication might cause the flow of songs to stop. But whatever the pains staked in writing its contents, her new album is superb. It pushes at the boundaries of her previous work’s sound: into synth-heavy territory on the title track, pop soul on Running/Planning and distorted alt-rock on The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station, a song during which the constant sight of the TV chef’s face in Britain’s motorway services seems to bring about an existential collapse in the mid-tour CMAT.View image in fullscreenCMAT: Euro-Country.It arrives in a sleeve featuring its title, Euro-Country, written in the kind of Gaelic script beloved of Irish theme pubs, above an exceptionally striking photo based on Jean-Léon Gérôme’s 1896 painting Truth Coming Out of Her Well. It features Thompson emerging from a fountain in the middle of a shopping centre near her home town of Dunboyne. “Blanchardstown shopping centre,” she says. “For the first 10, 11 years of my life, it was like my local village. My sister, who lives in Blanch now, goes to the shopping centre every day. You drive there if you want to see other people and then you drive back home again and live in your house by yourself.”That’s the reality of much of Irish life, she says. “There’s a kind of space thatIrelandis occupying in western media culture right now, a little more fetishised and trendy than it’s ever been. Americans think it’s cute; English people are like, ‘Ooh, I love Guinness and Kneecap and The Banshees of Inisherin, and I’m getting my Irish passport and mmm, I love potato farl.’ People talking about Hozier like he’s a magical, delicate fairy from the bog. It’s a romanticised version of Ireland that doesn’t exist. It’s a really hard place to live, a really hard place to grow up, unless you have money, which we didn’t. So yeah, magical, beautiful, mystical Ireland: it’s a shopping centre, that’s what I grew up with. A shopping centre.”Ireland’s recent history suffuses Euro-Country, which features vocals in Irish, songs called Billy Byrne from Ballybrack, the Leader of the Pigeon Convoy and Tree Six Foive and a title track that she describes as “a collage, a mood board” about the financial crisis that engulfed the country in 2008. “I was about 12 and it all happened around me, it didn’t really happen to my family directly,” she says. “My dad had a job in computers, we didn’t really have any money, we weren’t affluent, but we were fine. Everybody else on the estate we lived in worked in construction, or in shops, and they all lost their jobs. Everybody became unemployed. Then, in the village I grew up in, there was a year or 18 months where loads of the people I went to school with, their dads started killing themselves because they’d lost everything in the crash.”Initially, Thompson thought she must have misremembered this. “But I dug deep, did research and the amount of male suicides that happened in Ireland at that time was astronomical. When I hit secondary school, teenage boys started killing themselves as well; that was very common where I grew up. I think it was a kind of chain reaction as a result of the economic downturn. I’m not blaming anyone – no one ever purposely tries to cause that much harm. It’s trying to get all this stuff together and think: ‘Why did all this happen and how do we stop it from happening again?’ I don’t have the answer but I think we all need to keep looking at it and really fucking try to hound ourselves into a position where we’re not just thinking about monetary gain all the time.”View image in fullscreen‘Capitalism is a force for bad. But pop stars won’t say that’ … CMAT. Styling by Mia Maxwell, grooming by Niall Candy.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianEuro-Country is a noticeably more political album than its predecessors, which tended to focus on relationships and the chaos of her personal life. Thompson says she couldn’t really see anyone else in her position doing it, so decided to take it on. “No one is dealing with capitalism as a force for bad, this really fucking horrible putrefied version of capitalism which has absolutely had a line of coke up its fucking hole since Covid, where the richest people in the world are so much richer than they used to be five years ago,” she says. “Pop stars won’t come out and say that because they’ll be absolutely shot for it, because they’ve all done brand deals: ‘Oh, I love my Dove moisturiser.’”View image in fullscreenCMAT at the 2024 Mercury prize awards.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesThompson was one of a number of artists to pull out of Latitude and other festivals over sponsor Barclays providing financial services to defence companies supplying Israel. She says that as soon as she removed herself from the lineup, an upcoming deal with a designer perfume brand disappeared. “They ghosted me. I lost a lot of money. But who fucking cares? I’m aware of the fact that my career is going to struggle as a result of this stuff, but I also think everyone else in music needs a kick up the hole. Where’s all the fucking artists? Where’s all the fucking hippies?”Of course, another reason why musicians might feel abashed about mentioning politics is fear of a social media backlash, something Thompson knows all about. Last year, an Instagram video of her performing at BBC Radio 1’s Big Weekend festival attracted so much abuse – largely directed at her weight – that the BBC was forced to disable comments. She laughed it off at the time, suggesting she should be imprisoned for the crime of “having a big fat ass”, but returns to the subject on her current single, Take a Sexy Picture of Me (it has turned into that rarest of things: a song about body shaming that has provoked a TikTok dance trend, with it-girl Julia Fox and Chicken Shop Date host Amelia Dimoldenberg participating).“Prior to moving over to the UK I would never have thought I was plus size,” she says. “And then I started working with fashion directors in London for photoshoots and started hearing: ‘Wow, you’re so lucky I collect plus-size Mugler because no one else will be able to dress you.’ I thought: what are you talking about? I’m a size 14! I thought everyone was this size! Why are you being so weird? But truth be told, if someone on the internet calls me a big fat ugly bitch, I’m like ‘yeah, whatever’, I don’t fucking care. But I started realising that other people were witnessing it and other girls, young girls, were witnessing this happening to me on a fucking huge scale – what must they think of that? How is it going to make them feel, particularly if they’re bigger than me?”Ten-gallon hits! Why country is the biggest pop music craze of 2024Read moreShe brings it back to commerce. “In day-to-day real life, if you think being fat will stop people from ever wanting to have sex with you, let me tell you that is not the case in such an extreme way. I’ve seen the girlies out there doing unbelievably well for themselves, right? But [because] fatness is not commercially viable, it’s not in the realm of commercial attractiveness.” Online, she says, the body image discourse brings out “weak-willed, spineless people who have been brutalised by commercial viability, criticising someone for not falling within the realms of what is easily sellable”.Thompson says she is aware that the political bent of Euro-Country is a big ask of audiences in 2025, when pop seems to largely function as a means of temporary escape from a terrifying world. “It can be read as incredibly cringe and incredibly earnest and on the nose, right? It’s an embarrassing thing for me to be asking of people. Because it’s not trendy to be earnest any more. I’m aware of that, and …” She laughs again. “Actually I don’t care. I don’t care if I’m putting my foot in it, I don’t care if I’m saying something wrong. We’ve all been too measured, too careful because we’re being witnessed all the time. I think we need more willingness to fail. Even if it’s futile, you’ve got to fucking try. Because it’s fucking depressing otherwise.”Euro-Country is released via CMATBaby and Awal on 29 AugustThis article was amended on 6 June 2025.

The first, Picking Flowers felt like the work of a female singer-songwriter who had dispensed with verses and choruses and was backed by a band on the verge of falling apart: woodwind, keyboards and guitar clashing, drums fading in and out of the mix, everything soaked in dub-influenced echo. Then it seemed to turn into a completely different song midway through. The second, Que?, offered a male rap-adjacent vocal over a chaotic sprawl of distorted guitar and drums before collapsing into noisy abstraction then stopping dead.It was the work of an eight-piece collective – all its members have other careers, both musical and otherwise (their ranks include a fashion designer and a visual artist) – formed in Brighton, but now dotted around south London: they apparently record in a disused shipping container and their social media presence consists of a solitary Instagram post. Their forthcoming mixtape Lightning Hit the Trees offers more of the pigeonhole-swerving same: music that veers from lulling and acoustic to nightmarish and noise-laden, from free jazzy improv to soundtrack atmospherics to prog-flecked post-rock, every one of its 29 minutes packed with ideas. How it might cohere live is an interesting point – it could easily just devolve into a mess – but there’s something hugely appealing about Parade’s disinclination to stay still, or provide an easy point of comparison.Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenTeyana Taylor.Photograph: Publicity imageTeyana Taylor – Long TimeOn her first release in five years, the actor/musician ethers an out-of-date relationship (“and the truth is, I didn’t end when it was over”), her cold poise blooming into gothic, vogue-ready house.LSCate Le Bon – Heaven Is No Feeling“You smoke our love like you’ve never known violence,” the Welsh musician sings witheringly on the first taste of her seventh album, atop a sea of dazed sax and murky, liquid guitar.LSKathleen Edwards – Say Goodbye, Tell No OneYet another hard truth:the Canadian songwriterfaces up to a relationship gone sour – how “you can get blisters from your favourite shoes” – on this wistful Americana epic.LSKasst 8 – Land of the ScousersProudly heavy Merseyside diction powers this rap track, which harks back to classic grime and garage with its lo-fi drums, ersatz strings and horns, and pirate-ready flow.BBTEditrix – The Big EThe New York guitarist makes thoughtful, knotty solo records, plays with Bill Orcutt and has a discordant, rumbling punk band in Editrix: in this skittish duck-and-diver, Eisenberg sings of aliens with joyful sharpness.LS​Laicositna – Sit & GoIt’s unusual to hear a British MC use such a fragile flow, so far off the mic.

A day after the shooting, San Antonio police issued a statement saying they had found “no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr Joss’ murder was related to his sexual orientation”.King of the Hill actor Jonathan Joss killed in shooting aged 59Read moreBut during a news conference on Thursday William McManus, the San Antonio police chief, said the statement was “premature” and that whether Joss’s sexual orientation played a role in the shooting “is part of the investigation”.“I will own that and simply say again that we simply shouldn’t have done that. It was way too early in the process for any statement of that nature to be issued,” McManus said.The police chief said many in the LGBTQ+ community “are feeling anxious and concerned” after Joss’s shooting and that “a lot of it has to do with that premature statement”.“The loss of Jonathan Joss was tragic, most heavily felt by the LGBTQ+ community,” McManus said.Texas does not have separate hate crimes charges. But if homophobia is found to have been a motive in the shooting, that could result in a harsher sentence at trial under the state’s hate crimes law.View image in fullscreenCandles, flowers and notes are placed at a makeshift memorial in San Antonio.Photograph: Eric Gay/AP“We gather the facts, and we give those facts to the district attorney’s office. And then that hate crime designation is determined at sentencing,” McManus said.The actor’s home burned down in January. Joss’s husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has said that they were checking mail there on Sunday when a man approached them, pulled out a gun and opened fire.In a statement, de Gonzales said he and Joss had previously faced harassment, much of it “openly homophobic”.Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, who is a neighbor of Joss, was charged with murder in the shooting. He has been released on a $200,000 bond.Ceja Alvarez’s attorney, Alfonso Otero, did not immediately return an email seeking comment on Thursday.McManus said police had been called to Joss’s home and his neighborhood about 70 times over the past two years related to “neighborhood-type disturbances”.“Sometimes [Joss] was the caller. Other times, the neighbors were calling on him,” McManus said.The San Antonio police department’s mental health unit as well as a unit that works with residents to help prevent crime “had extensive engagements with Mr Joss, making repeated efforts to mediate conflicts and connect him with services that he may have needed”, McManus said.The January fire at Joss’s home is still being reviewed by arson investigators, McManus said. Joss lost all his belongings in the blaze and his three dogs were killed.Actors who worked with Joss, along with friends and fans, have honored Joss’s memory with tributes.“His voice will be missed at King of the Hill, and we extend our deepest condolences to Jonathan’s friends and family,” the show’s creators and producers – Mike Judge, Greg Daniels and Saladin Patterson – said in a statement on the animated series’ Instagram page.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionTelevisionParks and RecreationSan AntonionewsShareReuse this content"

They decide to cast off their clothes and walk through the countryside as nature intended, only to be mistaken for poachers. The story’s combination of humour, transgression and ear for the Doric dialect of north-east Scotland were characteristic qualities of its author, Nan Shepherd (1893-1981), a writer unashamed by her nakedness and celebrated for her evocations of Scotland’s rural environment.Celebrated, that is, onceThe Living Mountain, her short book about walking in the Cairngorms, was published. That was in 1977, three decades after its completion, but more especially in 2011 when it was republished by Canongate, just as it was slipping back into obscurity.It had not always been that way. As the author of three interwar novels, Shepherd was considered a significant modernist writer in her day. But, having turned her attention to teaching, not to mention roaming the hills, she had been largely forgotten at the time of her death in 1981.As this one-act play by Richard Baron and Ellie Zeegen would have it, she is a woman with little concern for posterity. Played by Susan Coyle, Shepherd is resistant to flattery and modest about her achievements, coming most alive at the sound of poetry; sometimes her own, just as often not. At times in Baron’s production, she asks members of the audience to read her favourite passages aloud (which, at my performance, they do impressively).Part of a generation that included the novelist Neil M Gunn and the poet Hugh MacDiarmid, Shepherd enthuses about contemporaries such as Virginia Woolf, to whom she was compared. This literary passion, along with an unconventional private life, is at the heart of a play that swirls around her story, taking us from wide-eyed child, discovering the beauty of pine cones, to care-home resident, refusing to be patronised by the staff.Coyle switches from excitable youth to stiff-limbed old woman and all points in between, while Adam Buksh gamely plays lovers, academics and carers. If the play skims the surface of Shepherd’s appeal as a writer, it is nonetheless a warm-hearted evocation of a life led with self-determination in and out of the shadows.AtPitlochry Festival theatreuntil 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatrePitlochry Festival theatrePoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

Detention is the final part of the trilogy that began with Coal, looking at the mining industry, followed byWasteland, about the nascent rave culture that sucked in disaffected youth in the midst of those mines’ closures. Detention focuses on the Section 28 legislation brought in in 1988, forbidding the “promotion” of homosexuality. This is the backdrop against which Clarke, and every other young gay man and woman at that time grew up. We see dehumanising political speeches, the bullying, the self-hatred; the bleakness is tangible.View image in fullscreenUrgency … Imogen Wright in Detention by Gary Clarke Company.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianYet while Detention is about the effects of homophobia, it’s most strikingly a celebration of solidarity. A community cast of older LGBTQ+ people are deftly sewn into the show, some of whom were active in LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners, as seen in the film Pride). Others play the role of volunteers at the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, a lifeline for many, sitting at a desk with a rotary dial phone: “Hello, Lesbian and Gay Switchboard, how can I help?” We hear text based on genuine calls from the switchboard’s logbook – a young man thrown out of home, a woman scared she’ll lose her children, a man diagnosed with HIV – and watch the dancers’ bodies trapped or in turmoil, eaten up with anxiety.Clarke’s work has been called “dance-documentary”. It’s activism, but it’s also drama, and Clarke’s sense of structure and storytelling is sound, the dancing is full of dynamism and urgency, sweeping us through the scenes. Most moving is a duet right at the start that embodies the impact of Aids, two men in a clinch that somehow morphs from romance to struggle to one partner desperately supporting his dying lover; flirtation to tragedy in the space of one dance.Like a darker, dancier version of It’s a Sin, Detention is hard-hitting but laced with humour. It’s a portrait of a particular period in time that still echoes down the decades.Touring until 15 OctoberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDanceLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

For decades, the content-creating studio chief has beenroundly criticizedfor making the traumatization of Black women a persistent theme in his work. In Straw, his latest exercise in misogynoir for Netflix, he pulls out all the stops to break the camel’s back.The Life of Chuck review – unmoving Stephen King schmaltzRead moreThe guinea pig for this cultural stress test is Janiyah (Taraji P Henson), an apex Perry caricature who is past the point of exhaustion. Her loud, hot and dumpy apartment isn’t all that keeps her in perennial discomfort. There’s also a precocious young daughter (Gabrielle E Jackson) with nagging medical issues, and that eviction notice on the dining table. She can’t make ends meet despite working three jobs, and her cashier’s position at the local food desert grocery store is especially thankless. When an angry customer spikes a bottle of fizzy drink at Janiyah’s feet, her boss orders her to stand down from her busy checkout lane to clean up the mess. When Janiyah unwittingly cuts off an undercover cop in traffic after begging off the register to run a quick errand, he throws his ice coffee drink at her car and threatens to “find a legal way to blow your brains out”.In the end, Janiyah is ticketed for driving on an expired license, her car is impounded and she’s forced to find her way back to work on foot in the kind of surprise monsoon that Perry keeps in the forecast to further break down his female protagonists – and, verily, things do indeed get worse: her irascible boss (Glynn Turman) fires her for deserting her post, her landlord empties the meager contents of her dumpy apartment on to the curb, and her kid is confiscated from school after the principal squeals to child protective services. At her wits’ end, she treks back to the grocery store to urge her boss to release her last paycheck only for both of them to wind up held up at gunpoint when a band of robbers charge into the back office to empty the store vault.There’s a glimmer of hope when one of the robbers attacks Janiyah, and she fights him off and kills him with his own gun – but her boss is convinced she’s in on the heist because the attacker “knew her”. Turns out the guy only read her name tag, but the boss is already running with his story while on the phone with 911. When he threatens to take her down and twists the knife, Janiyah finally snaps and shoots him dead, too. It isn’t much long after that we find Janiyah in the middle of a hostage situation at the bank when her attempt to cash that bloody last paycheck raises alarm bells.The balance of the film plays like the Tyler Perry version of John Q, down to the Luigi Mangione-coded public rallying cry – trading injuryfor Spike Lee’s insult, perhaps. The third act is freighted with pointed digressions on the intractable racism in banking and healthcare systems, and the inescapable Perry twist at the film’s core is its own commentary on the Black mental health crisis. As ever, Perry – who takes top billing once more as this film’s writer, director and executive producer – engages with many ideas, but none that he seems to fully understand. That includes Black women, whom he does a tremendous disservice to once again.But the hatchet job may be lost on most viewers because Straw is one of the better films on Perry’s grade curve. The pacing could be better for what is ostensibly a 105-minute thriller. The day-night transitions in particular arewild,and again the rain comes out of nowhere. But Straw doesn’t meander as much as Perry’s other productions. (Looking at you,Duplicity.) It’s not soapy or camp either. There’s melodrama, sure, but Straw makes you take it seriously – and a lot of it is a credit to the actors playing it straight and, possibly, getting a few extra takes to refine their performances (weird flex, I know).Sherri Shepherd, who’s typically at her best going for laughs, shines as the sober bank manager who remains empathetic in crisis. Teyana Taylor was equally impressive as the detective hostage negotiator who advocates for Janiyah. (The only letdown in her performance was her wig, which is very muchon-brand for Perry.) But yet again it’s Henson who delivers the powerhouse performance while edging from distress to anger to winsome compassion. It’s just a shame that after hiring her for four films now, Perry is still treating her like a speed bag.In one of the scenes outside the bank, as the standoff at the bank deepens, a protest movement foments and one Janiyah supporter holds up a sign that reads, “Nevertheless she persisted”, amuch-memed feminist slogan. Sadly, the irony is probably lost on Perry – ultimately, a billionaire servant of the evangelical Christian patriarchy who is steadfastly committed to proving that the women of the world who make “bad” choices deserve all the pain and punishment they can get and then some. This certainly won’t be the last Straw.Straw is out now on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTaraji P HensonNetflixTyler PerryThrillersDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Boogying back to the Bridgeafter six years, Nicholas Hytner’s rollicking production of Shakespeare’s great comedy feasts on bawdy mischief and aerial antics. Radiating charisma, Emmanuel Akwafo’s uninhibited Bottom instructs his ragtag group of am-dram players to rehearse “most obscenely and courageously”. Hytner’s production, with somewhat more rigour and expertise, takes note.Bunny Christie’s luscious set of beds, leaves and trapdoors has us at once rising from the murky depths of the forest and floating among the clouds of sleep. Half the audience mill amid the foggy underland, skilfully shuffled by stage management, while the rest of us sit up among the fairies. The immersive setup complements the play’s shapeshifting unreality; in this world, we become another set of magical creatures lurking in the shadows.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Akwafo as Bottom.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRules of gravity are forgotten here. Led by David Moorst’s spiky, spidery Puck, who reclaims his role from the original production, the disco-ready fairies barely touch the ground, gambolling instead across bedframes and dangling effortlessly from loops of aerial silks. Their astonishing acrobatics have echoes of the1970 Peter Brook productionof this play, albeit with more brazenly bisexual energy, which sweeps over the show like confetti. In the lovers’ clamorous scene of misunderstandings, Puck amuses himself by floating above them, swivelling the direction of their affections like spinning tops.One of the production’s greatest feats is switching the dialogue of fairy royalty Oberon (JJ Feild) and Titania (Susannah Fielding), which puts the power firmly in Titania’s hands. With the two actors doubling up as Theseus and Hippolyta, their motivations and memories are folded into one another, so that Hippolyta’s simmering rage at Theseus’s entrapment of her feeds Titania’s vengeful actions towards Oberon. The gender-flipping also gifts us Oberon’s riotous seduction of Bottom, a scene so joyful the whole audience seems drunk on delight.Re-met by moonlight: A Midsummer Night’s Dream returns to London’s Bridge theatre – in picturesRead moreThe cast are comedy gold, their ad-libs winking to the crowd, though we could do without the distraction of the looser modern soundbites. Unlike in the 2019 run, the party doesn’t carry on beyond the show, but the production itself is enough. When all the characters are awake and the evening’s events seem distant, memories of what they did and who they kissed flicker through them. Even when dawn breaks, the night of giddy revels remains.At theBridge theatre, London, until 20 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreBridge theatreNicholas HytnerBunny ChristieA Midsummer Night's DreamreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s there in the harness that allows deaf and hearing-impaired gig-goers to feel music as vibrations on their chest. It’s there in the vibrant clothes. It’s there – certainly – in the all-purpose hands-free vibrator (yes, really). But it’s not just the individual items that exude this joy. It’s the themes of community action and care that show up again and again, and the reframing of the very concept of disability – from the “medical problem” society sees to the proud identity we know it to be.This show, which takes a wide-ranging look at how disabled people have fashioned the world to better represent ourselves and better suit our needs, is divided into three parts: Visibility, Tools and Living. In Visibility, we see the evolution of accessible fashion from sterile to cool, and how disabled people have used photography to reclaim our images and bodies. In Tools, we see how disabled people have adapted everything from kitchen utensils to computers to allow us to get things done. And in Living, we see how we have demanded cultural and architectural change so that we can participate in society as equals.View image in fullscreenTools … disabled people have adapted everything from kitchen utensils to computers to allow us to get things done.Photograph: Peter KelleherThe exhibition does a great job of including the full range of impairments disabled people have. There’s a bike with a built-in leg brace and a video explaining the concept of deaf space (an architectural idea about how spaces can be designed to support lip-reading and the use of BSL). There’s a self-tightening shoe and the original fidget-spinner, designed to help autistic and other neurodivergent people.In this way, the exhibition goes far beyond the tired assumption that access means a ramp. It is also great to see disability-led design from all areas of life – not just care and housing, but also gaming, socialising, working, travelling, urban-planning and more. So often disability is treated as a monolithic experience, but the V&A is showing it in all its diverse, multifaceted glory.The exhibition also has a deliberate focus on design not onlyfordisabled people butbydisabled people. In a world in which people often make assumptions about our needs, and presume to speak on our behalf, this is very welcome. Many of the projects and products featured are DIY inventions, moulded out of necessity by disabled people who weren’t able to buy the tools they needed. Others are the work of grassroots organising groups, or individual disabled people leveraging their jobs at big companies to create change.View image in fullscreenSqueeze Chair (chaise longue), by artist Wendy Jacob, embraces the sitter between two mohair arms, providing comforting sensory feedback.Photograph: Ted DiamondTaken together, these items and their stories serve as a powerful reminder of disabled people’s often-overlooked agency, and a refutation of the idea that we are merely the recipients of help. We can and do help ourselves. As Tristram Hunt, the former Labour MP who is now the V&A’s director, emphasised at the exhibition’s launch, the idea is for it to embody the famous disability rights slogan: “Nothing about us without us.” It truly does.This slogan applies politically as well as culturally. And what I like most about the exhibition is that it does not shy away from the inherently political nature of disability. Many objects on display are directly linked to the long fight for disability rights: one of the first things you see is a T-shirt emblazoned with the “Piss on Pity” slogan from the 1990 Block Telethon campaign. There are photos of disabled people stopping buses during the Campaign for Accessible Transport, as well as pieces related to the more recent (and ongoing) cuts to disability benefits.View image in fullscreenInnovation … Xbox Adaptive Controller, developed by Microsoft.Photograph: V&A Museum, LondonBut beyond referencing these discrete historical events, the exhibition also recognises that existing, thriving and finding joy as a disabled person in an ableist world is a political – often radical – act. That radicalism is reinforced by the show’s emphasis on the intersection between disability and other marginalised identities, with pieces linked to the Black Panthers and queer culture. This will feel intimately familiar to many disabled visitors, for whom it will be lovely to see their lived experiences reflected at a prestigious arts institution, but will hopefully provide a new perspective for nondisabled viewers, many of whom will never have seen disability and disabled lives presented in this way.That’s what makesDesign andDisabilityso good. It takes what disabled people know to be true – that we are creative, that we are innovators, that our exclusion comes from a world not built for us, that our lives are political – and makes those ideas interesting and accessible for everyone. Disability culture is vibrant and fun, boundary-breaking and world-shaping. So is this exhibition.Design and Disability is at the V&A, London, from Saturday until 15 February 2026Explore more on these topicsDesignDisabilityV&AMuseumsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Opening track A Tightwire sets the template for the album: urgent, off-kilter and even slightly disorienting. The youthful trio of Kai Slater (guitar, vocals), Asher Case (bass, baritone guitar, vocals) and Isaac Lowenstein (drums, synth) have played together since high school, which has meant they have a musical understanding and are as tight as the proverbial nut.View image in fullscreenLifeguard: Ripped and TornTheirs is angular, driving post-punk with audible echoes ofthe Pop Group, Wire, Gang of Four and the Wedding Present, but they’ve certainly brought their own spin to it. The songs blaze forth with hurtling, mostly indecipherable imagery. They could be yelling “I am the spy on your pillow” or “words like tonality come to me”. What does it all mean? Who knows – but it’s fun thinking it through.There’s a real sense of drama to the circular-saw guitars, slow builds and cascading basslines, from which spring effervescent tunes and interesting curveballs. Like You’ll Lose is post-punk with a hymnal quality. The weirdly compulsive Music for 3 Drums knowingly references Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians, but sounds as if it was recorded during a visit to a rivet-making factory. Some of their most distorted guitars, drones and screeching metal might prove too challenging for many palates, but it’s refreshing to hear a young band make such a bold racket.Explore more on these topicsPunkIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

His radical approach earned him the nickname of “Red Pabst”, and when Hitler was elected to power in 1933, Pabst reacted by taking his family to the United States. He intended to emigrate permanently, but what was supposed to have been a brief trip back to Austria to visit his sick mother saw Pabst detained inside the Third Reich for the duration of the second world war. This unfortunate turn of events had a dramatically detrimental effect, not only on Pabst’s immediate situation but on his entire postwar career.Daniel Kehlmann has frequently used historical events as the basis for his fiction, most famously in his breakout 2005 novelMeasuring the World, which draws on the work of the German explorer and geographer Alexander von Humboldt, and more recently in 2017’sTyll, which brings to life the capricious exploits of the legendary jester Till Eulenspiegel during the thirty years’ war. But Kehlmann’s works are so much more than fictionalised biographies, and his new novel The Director is as imaginative and bold in its use of editing as Pabst’s own movies.In the opening chapter Franz Wilzek, the assistant director on Pabst’s lost 1945 film The Molander Case, is being interviewed on TV about his life and career. Wilzek, who is in the early stages of dementia, insists that this elusive film was never shot. The underhum of hostility around the subject from both the interviewer and his producer hints at something unspoken, the memory of an event that Wilzek either cannot or will not revisit. But Franz Wilzek did not really exist, and the film he is said to have worked on was left unfinished.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But nothing in Kehlmann’s world is accidental, and The Director is more interested in the unstable no man’s land between facts and the truth than in any point-by-point rehash of “what really happened”.Following a meeting with Joseph Goebbels that ricochets queasily between horror and comedy, Pabst tries to convince himself that “all he’d had to do was make a hand gesture and say a few words”. Meanwhile, in the decaying rural mansion that has become his prison, his son Jakob – a fictional amalgamation of Pabst’s two real sons, Michael and Peter – is forced by schoolfriends to enter a bottomless cellar where the Pabsts’ black-shirted caretaker Jerzabek scuttles in the cobwebby darkness like a giant spider. Trude Pabst – an actor and aspiring screenwriter before taking on the sacrificial duties of Great Man’s Wife – is caught in a web of her own, increasingly finding solace in alcohol, if only to avoid the society of her Nazi neighbours.Pabst himself seeks refuge in work, taking on subjects that are “German enough” not to offend the censor. The films he creates offer their own coded criticisms of the regime, though in the eyes of the postwar commentariat, his resistance is too covert, too artistic. The novel’s denouement takes us finally to the film set of The Molander Case, relocated to Prague in order to escape the allied bombing. Pabst is determined to finish the film by whatever means necessary, even as more and more of his support staff are forcibly conscripted into the Wehrmacht. He insists to Wilzek that “without us, everything would be the same, no one would be saved, no one would be better off. And the film would not exist.” This argument about the ultimate supremacy of art has been the position Pabst has occupied all along; in the midst of the falling bombs and the fleeing civilians, the teenage soldiers and the advancing Russians, it is an argument that is forced to its utmost and must surely break.Even at this distance of 80 years, the sense of claustrophobia and ultimate folly is all encompassing. One feels an aching sympathy for Pabst, caught in a situation so far beyond his control that “when he tried to breathe in, there was only icy water, and in the distance, he knew, monsters were moving … black and many-armed, at home in the darkness”. It would seem that Kehlmann also is prepared to cut him some slack, saving his bitterest condemnation for Leni Riefenstahl, who really did use concentration camp inmates as extras, and for Alfred Karrasch, the author of the novel on which The Molander Case is based and who, unlike Pabst, really did espouse Nazi ideology in his work. Kehlmann’s characterisation of both is hilarious, merciless and brilliant. The Director has all the darkness, shapeshifting ambiguity and glittering unease of a modern Grimms’ fairytale: it is Kehlmann’s best work yet.The Director by Daniel Kehlmann, translated by Ross Benjamin, is published by Quercus (£22).

His lucid message here is “If we save the sea we save our world”, as he talks us through what humanity has done to the Earth’s oceans and how we can protect them. Awe and anger intermingle – there are glorious images of aquatic life, such as the remote submarine seamounts that are “pitstops” for migrating fish or the kelp forests in coastal waters that capture carbon. But it’s the underwater footage of indiscriminate dredging by trawlers that has the most emotional impact – a picture of devastation that’s also a call to arms.Sunday 8 June, 8pm, National Geographic/Disney+PiggyView image in fullscreenTwisted desires … Laura Galán in Piggy.Photograph: TCD/AlamySmall-town Spanish teenager Sara (Laura Galán) is nicknamed “Cerdita” (Piggy) by her mocking peers, being overweight and the daughter of the local butcher.

Apollonia is the new girl in town who catches his eye, while Morris E Day is the comic relief as a competing band’s frontman.

And in Joseph L Mankiewicz’s slick take it’s Marlon Brando as Mark Antony who gets the best: his “I came to bury Caesar not to praise him” speech is a masterclass in rhetorical rabble-rousing. And Brando has to raise his game, what with seasoned stage stars James Mason (Brutus), Louis Calhern (Caesar) and, particularly, John Gielgud (Cassius) immersing us eloquently in portents and plots, murder and mayhem.Sunday 7 June, 2pm, BBC TwoSnow WhiteView image in fullscreenStill wonderfully whistle-worthy … Rachel Zegler in Snow White.Photograph: Disney/APAn apple-barrelful of controversy surrounds this amiable live-action version of Disney’s animated fairytale.

But Cooper is a shrewd operator and this is another smartly placed building block in a growing media brand.Disney+, from Tuesday 10 JuneTrainwreck: The Astroworld TragedyView image in fullscreenCatastrophe … Trainwreck: The Astroworld Tragedy.Photograph: NetflixThis documentary exploring the catastrophe that unfolded at Travis Scott’s2021 concertin Houston is part of the same strand as Netflix’s Woodstock 99 series and covers similar ground in its depiction of systemic failure leading to tragedy. One key difference is that concertgoers now have mobile phones – and the frequently horrifying footage takes viewers right into the heart of the crush that claimed 10 lives. The story of the aftermath is bleak, too: as survivors tried to deal with the shock while coaxing some accountability from the people who failed them.Netflix, from Tuesday 10 JuneTitan: The OceanGate DisasterView image in fullscreenA worldwide obsession … Stockton Rush, CEO of OceanGate.Photograph: Simon Platts/BBC“There was no way of knowing when Titan was going to fail,” says one maritime expert in this documentary, “but it was a mathematical certainty that it would.” What drove OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush to gamble with the lives of four people (not to mention his own) in 2023?

Food styling assistant: Julia Aden.The sweet spotFoodHelen Goh’s recipe for pavlova with raspberries, lychees and elderflower creamFruit and floral flavours with marshmallowy meringue make for a sensational melt-in-the-mouth dessertHelen GohFri 6 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTShareInspired byPierre Hermé’s iconic ispahan macarons, where rose, lychee and raspberry create an exquisite flavour combination, this dessert reinterprets the trio in a crisp and marshmallowy pavlova. Instead of rose, I’ve used elderflower to infuse the cream, gently bringing together the delicate sweetness of lychee and the tart brightness of raspberries. Garnish with fresh elderflowers (if you can find any) and some coulis for a beautiful centrepiece.Pavlova with raspberries, lychees and elderflower creamPrep5 minCook2 hr 30 minCool2 hrServes8-10For the meringue250g egg whites(from 6-7 large eggs)½ tsp cream of tartar400g caster sugar2 tsp vanilla extract1 tsp white vinegar2 tsp cornflourFine sea saltFor the cream filling400ml double cream100g mascarpone2 tbsp elderflower cordial2 tbsp icing sugarFor the fruit topping565g tin lychees(250g drained weight)350g fresh raspberriesFresh elderflowers, to decorate (optional)Using the base of a roughly 23cm cake tin or plate, trace a circle with a marker pen on a sheet of baking paper, then put the sheet ink-side down on a large baking tray.Heat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2 and put an oven rack in the bottom third of the oven.Put the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer, and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high for about a minute, until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and carry on whisking to soft peaks. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking all the while, then beat for about five minutes, until the mix is thick and glossy. Turn down the speed to low, add the vanilla, vinegar, cornflour and a pinch of salt, and beat for another minute or two to incorporate.Dab a little meringue under each corner of the baking paper, so it sticks to the tray, then spoon the rest of the mixture into the centre of the traced circle. Using a small spatula, spread the meringue to the size of the circle, shaping it into a round with a slight dip in the centre. Transfer the tray to the oven and immediately lower the temperature to 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas ½. Bake for two hours, then switch off the oven and, with the door slightly ajar, leave the meringue inside for about two hours, until completely cool.When you’re ready to serve, put all the ingredients for the cream filling in the bowl of an electric mixer, and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-low for about a minute. Turn up the speed to medium and beat for another minute or two, until the cream makes smooth waves.To assemble, carefully transfer the meringue to a serving platter, then spoon the cream into the centre and spread it right to the edges. Top with the lychees and raspberries, some coulis if you like,and place a few elderflowers all over, if you managed to find some.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotDessertEggsFruitSpring food and drinkSummer food and drinkCakerecipesShareReuse this content"

Lean into it. You’re going to take white rum and coconut rum, and infuse them with lime zest. Then you’re going to add coconut water. Are you feeling tropical yet? Throw in some orange bitters, because why not? Then pop that sucker in the freezer (you’ll need a 750ml resealable bottle) and grab a lounge chair by the pool. That’s the vibe.Tropical coconut pieServes5-7315ml white rum315ml coconut rumZestof 1 lime, pared off in wide strips1 pinch sea salt120ml coconut waterLime rounds, to servePut the two rums, lime zest and salt in a blender, then pulse until the zest is finely chopped but not pureed. Leave to sit for three minutes, then strain through a muslin-lined fine sieve into a clean 750ml bottle. Add the coconut water, cap the bottle securely, then shake well to mix. Store in the freezer.To serve, pour into cocktail glasses and garnish with lime rounds.This is an edited extract from Freezer Cocktails: 75 Cocktails That Are Ready When You Are, by JM Hirsch, published this week by Hamlyn at £14.99.
