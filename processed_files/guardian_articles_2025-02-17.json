To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron said on X.“Otherwise, there is a risk that this ceasefire will end up like the Minsk agreements,” he said, referring to the pacts that sought to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015.Starmer insisted that the US is not poised to leave Nato, but said the issue of burden-sharing within the alliance had become pressing. “In this moment we have to realise the new era we are now in and not cling hopelessly to the comforts of the past and to take responsibility for our security and our continent,” he said.UK defence officials say that even if a 30,000-strong European force is deployed away from the frontline in a reassurance role, it will need the protections, including air cover and logistics, that only Nato – specifically the US – can provide.Scholz agreed with Starmer that such a force was inconceivable without US backing, but criticised the conversation about troops as “completely premature and the completely wrong time to have this discussion now”. He was “even a little irritated” by the debate. “We are not yet at peace, but in the middle of a war waged brutally by Russia, which is being pushed forward without consideration,” he said.In a summit that was never intended to reach a decision, the clearest consensus was around increasing defence spending.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said: “We will not be able to effectively help Ukraine if we do not immediately take concrete steps regarding our own defence capabilities. If Europe, and this is the case today, is not able to counter Russia’s military potential, then we must immediately catch up.”Scholz too said he wanted a focus on how Europe could remove defence spending increases from fiscal debt rules. “It is quite clear that our continued and necessary support for Ukraine is only possible if we can decide to finance it separately,” he said. He added the German debt brake should not apply to defence spending above 2% and that the country could mobilise an additional €30bn annually.Criticising Trump’s decision to rush into peace talks with Russia, he said it was “highly inappropriate” that a debate had started about the outcome of talks that had not yet taken place, and were being conducted without the involvement of Ukraine. He said “it is very clear to us: we must continue to support Ukraine – and it must and can rely on us”.Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said all European nations should boost their support for Ukraine and defence spending at home to protect themselves against Moscow. “Russia is threatening all of Europe now, unfortunately,” she said.European leaders are increasingly concerned that Trump is rushing to strike an immediate ceasefire with Russia that Ukraine and Europe will only be able shape at the margin.Reflecting those concerns, Tusk said: “Everyone at this meeting is aware that transatlantic relations, the Nato alliance and our friendship with the United States have entered a new phase. We all see that.”Meanwhile, senior Russian and American diplomats are due to meet in Riyadh on Wednesday to follow up on the surprise phone call to Putin initiated by Trump last week.Trump’s special Ukraine envoy, Gen Keith Kellogg, stressed Trump wanted a quick deal: “We are now at Trump time, which means I get an assignment today and tomorrow at noon he asks me why it hasn’t been done yet.”Scholz argued there must be “no division of security and responsibility between Europe and the USA”, effectively ruling out German participation in a reassurance force in the context of a ceasefire if the US does not agree to participate militarily in the peacekeeping mission.So far the US has refused to commit to providing any help to a putative European force.“Nato is based on the fact that we always act together and take risks together, thereby ensuring our security. This must not be called into question,” Scholz said.Poland has long said it will not deploy troops in Ukraine, arguing its role as defending central Europe. Italy and Spain are also opposed to sending troops without greater clarity about the US role.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who arrived nearly an hour late for the summit, said the option “that involves the deployment of European soldiers in Ukraine seems to me to be the most complex and perhaps the least effective”.“Other avenues should be explored that also include the involvement of the United States, because it is in the Euro-Atlantic context that European and American security is founded,” she said.France’s twin purpose in calling the meeting had been to conjure a vivid, unified display of European solidarity with Ukraine, and to forge a strategy to persuade Trump that Europe, with its own security and resources at stake in the Ukraine talks, has an unimpeachable right to a seat at the table.Macron, a lifelong exponent of a stronger European security dimension, also wanted the summit to open discussions on the level of contributions the big European powers could assemble for a reassurance force.With trust between Washington and Europe at a low ebb, there is also increasing concern among European diplomats that Trump may decide, as a goodwill gesture, to unilaterally lift key sanctions on Russia, relieving the growing pressure on its economy.Moscow is angling for sanctions to be lifted as part of the package that reopens diplomatic relations between Russia and the US. Russia is hoping the US will also signal a withdrawal of American troops from the continent.US officials, both in public and private, have put different emphases on aspects of the deal, including how Ukraine will be consulted, leading many European diplomats to believe the US does not yet have a single coherent plan.The US has sent mixed messages about Ukrainian and European involvement in the talks, with Michael Kellog saying it was “not reasonable to have everyone sitting at the table for a Ukraine peace deal”.In a bid to shore up Trump’s exclusion of Europe from the process, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: “I do not know what Europe would do at the negotiating table. Given the attitude of European states to the war, he is not sure what contribution they would make if they were invited. If Europe wants to continue the war in Ukraine, why should it be invited to negotiations.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerDonald TrumpEuropeOlaf ScholznewsShareReuse this content"

She died at the scene after being shot.Her suspected killer is believed to have fallen from the Queen Elizabeth II bridge into the River Thames after the shooting. Police said they were continuing to search areas of the river.Police said a car and firearm linked to the suspect, who was known to the victim, were later recovered next to the Dartford Crossing. Queen Elizabeth II bridge links Kent with Essex across the Thames.The male suspect is reported to have been seen on the wrong side of a bridge barrier and officers are focusing efforts on searches to recover him from the water.The landlady of The Three Horseshoes described customers “screaming, shouting and crying” as they realised what had happened. She told Sky News that she had been preparing for the Valentine’s dinner service when she heard two loud bangs that she initially thought were fireworks.About 30 people were at the pub for dinner, while 20 more were in the bar as the incident unfolded just after 7pm, she said. “People were only just starting to sit down, it was early on in the evening.”She also described how an off-duty firearms officer had intervened to bring the situation under control. She told the broadcaster the victim had been to the pub before but “wasn’t a regular”.The senior investigating officer, DCI David Higham, said on Saturday that officers searching for the suspect were “not ruling out the possibility that he may have entered the water”, and said the force was “currently only looking for one suspect and do not believe there to be an ongoing risk to the public”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Presented with a complex fire in a historically significant building, formerly Manchester Square fire station, firefighters successfully contained the fire, preventing it from spreading to neighbouring properties.”About 100 people were evacuated and there were no injuries as a result of the blaze, which was tackled by about 125 firefighters using 20 fire engines.Explore more on these topicsLondonHotelsHospitality industryFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

The new administration will only talk to Iran, Waltz added, if “they want to give up their entire programme and not play games as we’ve seen Iran do in the past in prior negotiations”.Earlier this month, Trump offered the Iranian regime a stark choice.“I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear,” hetold the New York Post. “I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it.”In politics as in business, Trump’s vaunted “art of the deal” has relied heavily on bluster and threats, but analysts question how well that will work with Tehran. They also warn that the window for a diplomatic resolution to the standoff with Tehran will get narrower with each passing month, as Iranian nuclear capabilities progress, and Netanyahu works to persuade Trump to participate in joint strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities while it is at its most vulnerable.Israel’s prime minister has tried and failed to convince successive US administrations to take part in military action against Iran, including Trump’s. During his first term in the White House, Trump declined, in line with his aim of keeping the US out of foreign wars.In 2018, however, Trump did fulfil another Netanyahu request,withdrawing the USfrom a three-year-old multilateral agreement that had constrained Iran’s programme in return for sanctions relief. Since then, Iran haspushed forward with nuclear developmentand now produces increasing amounts of 60%-enriched uranium, which means it is a small technical step away from the production of weapons-grade fissile material.Tehran insists it has no intention of making a nuclear weapon and remains a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, could upend that policy if Iran’s nuclear sites came under threat.Israel and Iran launched a series of tit-for-tat attacks on each other last year, culminating in substantialIsraeli airstrikes on 25 Octoberthat inflicted significant damage on Iran’s air defences.That damage, combined with Israel’s crippling campaign over the past year against Iran’s most important ally in the region, Hezbollah, has left Iran in its most militarily vulnerable state for decades.View image in fullscreenIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with members of the air force in Tehran earlier this month.Photograph: Iranian supreme leader's website/AFP/Getty ImagesStanding alongside the new US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Sunday, Netanyahu made clear he wanted to take advantage of that vulnerability.“Over the last 16 months, Israel has dealt a mighty blow to Iran’s terror axis. Under the strong leadership of President Trump, and with your unflinching support, I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,” he said.US intelligence agencies have been briefing reporters over the past week that they believeIsrael is likely to attackIranian nuclear sites in the first half of 2025. Butthe intelligence assessmentsalso underlined Israeli reliance on US support in the form of aerial refuelling, intelligence and reconnaissance. US officials also said such strikes would, at most, set back Iran’s programme by a few months, and could trigger Tehran’s decision to take the decisive step towards making weapons-grade uranium.Whatever the misgivings in Washington, theTrump administrationapproved the sale earlier this month of guidance kits for bunker-busting BLU-109 bombs, likely to be essential in inflicting damage on Iran’s most deeply buried enrichment plant at Fordow.Netanyahu was the first foreign visitor to be invited to the White House after Trump’s re-election, andaccording to the Washington Post, the two leaders discussed “several possible levels of American backing, ranging from active military support for a kinetic strike – such as intelligence, refuelling or other assistance – to more limited political backing for a coercive ultimatum”.Raz Zimmt, a research fellow and Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said there was another clock ticking on diplomacy with Iran. Under the 2015 nuclear agreement, its remaining signatories, including the UK, France and Germany, can trigger a “snap back” of all international sanctions on Iran, but that leverage expires in October this year, giving European capitals the options of “use it or lose it”. If the mechanism is triggered, it could lead to a further escalation, Zimmt said.Top Iranian politician appeals to Trump to restart nuclear deal negotiationsRead more“I think there is a very limited diplomatic window of opportunity until August or September, to reach some kind of settlement between Iran and the US,” he said. “If there is no agreement by then … I think it will be much easier for Netanyahu to get not just a green light [from Washington] but perhaps some kind of military capabilities which will make it easier for Israel to achieve a broader and more effective impact.”Netanyahu regularly describes Trump as the “best friend” Israel ever had in the White House, a description echoed by Rubio and other administration officials, but that friendship will be put to a decisive test as Israel continues to press the case for an attack on Iran.Ariane Tabatabai, a Pentagon policy adviser in the Biden administration, said it would fuel “tension between the ‘restraint’ camp in the administration and the more traditional Republicans who are more inclined toward a more forceful approach to Iran”.“It’s not clear yet in these early days which group will have more influence in the inter-agency process and ultimately drive policy, but that’ll be a factor as well.” Tabatabai said.Trump prides himself in keeping the US out of foreign wars, but he has shown himself ready to take military action against Tehran, ordering theassassination by droneof a Revolutionary Guards commander, Qassem Suleimani, in Baghdad in January 2020.Saudi Arabia isreportedly offering to mediateto avoid a conflagration, but even if Trump wanted to hammer out a deal, argued Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, Trump’s browbeating style of negotiation could easily backfire when it came to Tehran.“The Trump style is he goes in heavy,” Vatanka said. “But Ali Khamenei has to be extremely careful how he responds to Trump so his personal image is not damaged.”“Iran has been weakened in the region – no doubt about it – but they still claim to be leading proponents of the Islamic cause who stand up to western bullying,” he added. “So what might work with certain countries in Europe or in Latin America will not necessarily work with the Iranian regime.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranIsraelIran nuclear dealMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

He denies all the charges.Giving evidence in his own defence, he said he was “in the habit” of taking consensual pictures of his sexual activity.Questioned about video material he watched, the PhD student at University College London said he liked “time stop” pornography, in which “the females are passive and unresponsive during sex”, according to a definition agreed by the defence and prosecution.His barrister, Mark Cotter KC, asked why he preferred that type of sexually explicit material, to which Zou replied: “I like it because the girl appears to be still and quiet when they are having sex.”Cotter then asked Zou: “What about being asleep?”He replied: “Yes, that’s my favourite type. But I could not find that.”Zou is on trial at Inner London crown court and the jury heard he had grown up in China. When he came to London to study he came into contact, the court heard, with drugs including ketamine, cocaine and ecstasy.After his arrest in January 2024 Zou told police he used the drug butanediol as a moisturiser, but now claims he put it in his drink to get high. He said that after his arrest he did not want police to think he was a drug user.The prosecution said it was one of a series of drugs found when his home was raided and searched, which Zou used to stupefy and subdue women so he could carry out his attacks.He denies attacks on three women in London and seven in China from 2019-23.After his arrest, Zou told police: “Firstly, I wish to say that reference has been made to pictures retrieved from my mobile phones, however I have not seen these and I do not recall when and where I took them.“I can say, however, that I am in the habit of taking pictures of my sexual activity with my sexual partners. The pictures are only taken with her consent and agreement.“As to the allegation of rape, I deny having sexual intercourse with a partner without her consent and I always believed she consented to it.”The engineering student told the jury he did not know how many houses his parents had in China. His father worked in a state-owned enterprise and his mother was a teacher.He said he had insomnia, which caused his hair to fall out. He had a number of cosmetic procedures, including a hair transplant and work on his eyelids and chin.He gave evidence with the help of an interpreter, speaking in Mandarin.Zou denies 11 counts of rape as well as three counts of voyeurism, 12 counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and eight of having a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence.The prosecution said Zou seemed charming and smart but was in fact a “predator, voyeur and rapist” who ignored pleas from his victims to stop.Zou, who grew up in Guangdong province, will continue giving evidence in his own defence on Tuesday and the trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, it is not known whether the title was selected for further review or for withdrawal.“It is a book I wrote for my children and for other kids to remind them that we all struggle, but are united by our humanity and our community,” said Moore.The review of library books is part of an examination of all “instructional resources”, according to the Defense Department, to check that its schools are aligned with Trump’s recent executive ordersEnding Radical Indoctrination in K-12 SchoolingandDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism.Moore, who won an Oscar in 2015 for Still Alice, said that she is “particularly stunned” by the news because she is a “proud graduate” of the now-closed Frankfurt American high school, operated by the Defense Department, adding that her father is a Vietnam veteran and spent his career in the US army.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

After dozens of summits at which a hesitant and discordant EU had failed to agree on anything like a cohesive plan for the end of the war inUkraine, this one had, suddenly and vitally, to be different.The leaders of France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain and – speaking for the Nordic and Baltic states – Denmark, plus Britain’s prime minister and the heads of Nato and the European Commission and Council, arrived in Paris reeling from a historic week.Last Monday, the US vice-president, JD Vance,had told Europeits “excessive regulation” of potentially harmful technologies was all wrong. Two days later,Donald Trump called Vladimir Putinto start talks between the US and Russia on ending the war.The same day, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,told his European opposite numbersat a meeting in Brussels that the US was no longer “primarily focused” on Europe’s security and the continent would have to take the lead in defending Ukraine.Zelenskyy’s week from hell: shock in Ukraine as Trump abandons KyivRead moreOn Friday came Vance’scoup de grâce:a violent ideological assaultaccusing European democracies of quashing free speech, bowing to multiculturalism and running scared of voters. Forget Russia: the real threat to Europe, he said, was “from within”.The US vice-president then declined to talk to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, insteadmeeting Alice Weidel, the leader of the far-right AfD, a party that Germany’s security agency keeps under surveillance as a potential threat to democracy.In five days, leaders were made forcefully aware of three realities: first, the US and Europe appeared no longer to share the values that, since 1945, had underpinned the transatlantic alliance. Second, Europe could no longer rely on the US to defend it.Third – on the immediate question to which Europe was most eagerly awaiting an answer – the US plan, insofar as it actually exists, did not seem to include a place at the table for Europe (including, for that matter, Ukraine).Monday’s Paris summit wasconvened by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, because, in the words of an Elysée adviser, “there is now a necessity for Europeans to do more, better and in a coherent way, for our collective security”.Those attending were deemed to be the most determined, but also the best equipped, a coalition not just of the willing but the capable – including Britain, no longer an EU member but a major contributor to Ukraine and a potent European military force.Arriving in Paris, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe’s security was “at a turning point. Yes, it’s about Ukraine – but also about us. We need an urgency mindset. We need a surge in defence. And we need both now.”But Monday’s summit is likely to be the first of many on the road to a coherent European security policy for Ukraine and for Europe more broadly: Europe’s security environment may have changed, fundamentally, but Europe has not.It has its “enemies within”:populist, far-right, Moscow-friendly, pro-Trump governmentsthat will block a common security policy where they can. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, lost no time in denouncing Monday’s summit.The meeting was a gathering of “pro-war, anti-Trump, frustrated European leaders” aimed at “preventing a peace agreement in Ukraine”, he said, adding that unlike them, Budapest “supports Donald Trump’s ambitions … and wants peace in Ukraine”.Robert Fico, Slovakia’s populist prime minister, also had a go. EU officials had no mandate for Europe’s role in any Ukraine ceasefire, he said, adding that the discussions did not concern the EU and their participation hurt confidence in the bloc.As the US retreats, Europe must look out for itself – so is Macron’s nuclear offer the answer? | Simon TisdallRead moreCountries not invited to the Paris talks were also grumbling. “Even within the EU, not all states are treated equally,” said Slovenia’s pro-European president, Nataša Pirc Musar. “This is not the Europe we aspire to [or] the Europe that will be respected.”Other leaders will dread the impact of a big increase in defence spending on already fraught domestic politics. According to Nato, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg and Slovenia all spend less than the target 2% of GDP on defence.There are mighty battles in prospect over more shared borrowing – which Germany, among others, strongly opposes – to fund Europe’s collective security needs, and over the use of frozen Russian assets.More immediately, there are differences over Ukraine’s postwar security guarantees.Macron had already raised the possibilityof an eventual European peacekeeping force in Ukraine last year, and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, said on Sunday the UK wasprepared to put troops on the ground. Sweden followed suit on Monday.The Netherlands said it was “not negative” about the idea, but Germany said it was “premature” and Poland – which at 4% spends more of its GDP per head on defence than any other Nato member – said it was “not planning to send any Polish troops”.EU diplomats acknowledge the Trump administration’s brutally transactional, unashamedly ideological stance could splinter Europe’s already fragile unity. Whether or not it does, they say, could depend on the process of which Monday’s Paris meeting is but the first step.Explore more on these topicsEuropeUkraineTrump administrationRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The first is a large land deterrence force, able in theory to fight, if Russia were to invade again – probably on the lines of the 100,000 to 150,000 troops sought by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.But with the US ruling out participating, personnel constraints mean it is far from clear Europe could supply such a number, and Savill believes a more credible alternative would be a “tripwire” force of some “tens of thousands with European brigades on parts of the frontline”. That would be a more limited assistance, but could mean that if Russia were to attack Ukraine again, European countries would be drawn into the conflict.A more limited model still would be “a large training force”, which could amount to a deterrent because the European troops would be based in Ukraine, and who may be able to fight and provide support in a military crisis. But this would be only a limited aid to Ukraine – which is facing about 600,000 Russian troops along an active front of at least 600 miles.Ben Barry, a military expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, adds that “an air and maritime component” are also necessary to any future support for Ukraine.Would they be peacekeepers?It is unlikely that any European force deployed to Ukraine would be a peacekeeping mission. Such missions are orchestrated by the UN and would involve working in a even-handed way, patrolling both sides of a line of contact. They have been exposed as toothless in the past, most notably in Bosnia in July 1995 when Serbian forces massacred about 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica who were nominally under UN protection.Whatever size the force is, it would more likely be under some kind of European command. Last Wednesday, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said such troops would not be covered by a Nato security guarantee, meaning countries involved would have to fend for themselves if a new conflict with Russia broke out.What are European countries saying? Are they willing to participate if needed?France has been the most enthusiastic about deploying a military contingent to Ukraine, and the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is hosting a summit of European leaders in Paris on Monday afternoon. Overnight, Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said the UK would also be willing to deploy “our own troops on the ground if necessary” and Sweden also indicated its participation was a possibility.But in Germany, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who faces an election this weekend, said such discussions were premature given the wider uncertainty about where the US-Russia talks will end up. Meanwhile, Poland, which has been heavily re-arming, has ruled out sending troops to its neighbour – a blow to the nascent multinational effort.What does Russia think?Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 at least in part to prevent its smaller neighbour from becoming part of the west, including joining Nato. Its overall objectives have not changed, including its aspiration to demilitarise Ukraine, and it would be likely to oppose the presence of European troops inside the country.The Kremlin wants to exclude European countries from its talks with the US. “I don’t know what they would be doing at the negotiating table,” the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday – and the Americans seem happy to agree. If a European force was to be deployed to Ukraine it might well be subject to low-level provocative attacks, designed to test their willingness to remain deployed in the country.Would there be a risk of a wider conflict between Europe and Russia?While US politicians have ruled out sending ground troops, the US has not (yet) ruled out providing air support. A no-fly zone over Ukraine would be a significant help to Kyiv, but the White House appears so uninterested in Ukraine it is not clear that it would even entertain this step.The more likely scenario is that European countries would have to provide a full security guarantee to Ukraine – raising the question of how far Europe is prepared to go. Britain and France possess nuclear weapons, but given Russia’s larger nuclear arsenal, it would be unlikely they would pledge them in defence of Ukraine.Russia has suffered heavy casualties in Ukraine and struggled to gain territory after 2022 and may not want to be drawn into another overt conflict. But with the US committing itself to non-involvement, the Kremlin may consider western forces in Ukraine a softer target than those covered by the Nato umbrella in the rest of Europe.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Starting several months into Israel’s bombardment and continuing right up until the recent ceasefire, London-based directors Jamie Roberts and Yousef Hammash made their documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone by remotely instructing two local cameramen, Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba, as they captured life inside the “safe zone” – an ever-changing, ever-dwindling area in the south-west of Gaza, designated by Israel as the place where displaced Palestinians should reside. That the cameras predominantly follow children has an unexpected double effect: it makes the film’s many deeply distressing moments all the more unbearable, yet it tinges them with some sort of hope.The kids are led by 13-year-old Abdullah, who acts as narrator as well as appearing on camera. “This area used to be colourful,” he says, briskly touring a scene of apocalyptic destruction in Khan Younis, where he lived in a house that sheltered 40 people before Israeli bombs turned it to dusty rubble. “Now, it’s grey.”Abdullah maintains a wryly sunny tone as he describes how you live after you’ve lost everything, and his determination to smile while surviving is matched by 10-year-old Renad, whose method of coping with shells landing a terrifyingly short distance away is to laugh and chatter, even as the earth shakes. Renad concentrates instead on her online cooking channel: we see her recording a guide to making a dessert, apologising to viewers for having to use powdered milk. She is a natural presenter, fluent and engagingly upbeat. “They’re from all over the world,” Renad says of her growing TikTok fanbase. “If there is too long between posting videos, they check on me, thinking I got killed.”View image in fullscreen‘If there is too long between posting videos, they check on me, thinking I got killed’ … Renad in Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone.Photograph: Amjad Al Fayoumi/BBC/Hoyo FilmsMost remarkable is Zakaria, an indefatigable 11-year-old who chooses to spend all his time bustling around al-Aqsa, the only fully functioning hospital still standing in Gaza, having appointed himself to work as a volunteer. A fixer, porter and media liaison person, he faces a busy shift when Israeli forces raid the nearby Bureij refugee camp, killing scores of Palestinians. As civilians who have suffered blast injuries or gunshot wounds stream in, little Zakaria opens the back doors of ambulances, steers gurneys and briefs journalists, shuttling endlessly this way and that, sure-footed in the crowd.He is asked what that mess on his hands is. “Blood from the injured and the dead,” he announces, in the disorienting matter-of-fact tone that all the children in the film share. When an overnight bombing attack leaves a crater 20ft deep elsewhere in the “safe zone”, a boy Abdullah meets as he surveys the damage is similarly sanguine. “Suddenly the sky turned red and explosions rang out,” he says, equably reporting that his uncle, aunt and cousin died. “We found the girl’s head here, along with a bone covered in flesh.”This macabre dissonance continues as we hear the children try to square the casualties with the official statements of the Israel Defense Forces. “The Israeli army said the strikes had targeted three senior Hamas militants,” Abdullah says, carefully enunciating, of the above bombing of homeless people’s tents. Later, when missiles hit a school near al-Aqsa, causing another bloody rush at the hospital: “The Israeli army said the school was being used as a Hamas command centre.”Trump’s plan for Gaza leaves Arab nations facing an impossible choice | Nesrine MalikRead moreThe film’s utterly horrific peak comes with footage, shot on 14 October 2024, which literally offers a new angle on one of the most indelible images of the war: smartphone pictures on social media meant the whole world saw 19-year-old Sha’ban al-Dalou burned alive on his hospital bed, when tents full of refugees and patients outside al-Aqsa were bombed. We are now off to one side, looking across the same scene at a right angle, focused on the rescuers who cannot penetrate the heat of the blaze. “I saw the boy burning with my own eyes,” says Zakaria. On the voiceover, Abdullah adds: “The Israeli army later said that it was a precise strike on terrorists who were operating inside a command and control centre.”How to Survive a Warzone has unforgettable scenes of its own, such as the one where a surgeon conducts exploratory surgery on an unnamed 10-year-old to see if his injured limb can be saved; we learn the answer when we cut to the same surgeon minutes later, handing an amputated forearm to a colleague for disposal. But what lingers is what the medic says afterwards: he himself is “burning inside” with miserable anger, yet he takes comfort from his expectation that the boy will soon adjust and become “bright” again. In the face of the grimmest carnage, that light has not yet been extinguished.Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her mum is Julia (Julia Jentsch, who 20 years agomemorably played anti-Nazi martyr Sophie Scholl) and dad is Tobias (Felix Kramer). Julia is on the verge of a furtive affair with work colleague Max (Mehmet Ateşçi) while Tobias is being turned into a beta-male joke at his publishing company – his cover design choice for a new novel is scorned by his underlings, and he’s particularly undermined by a supercilious smoothie called Sören (Moritz Treuenfels).It is at this fraught moment in their family history that a schoolfriend of Marielle’s slaps her in the face for calling her a slut, and this trauma leaves Marielle with a superpower. She telepathically knows everything her parents are doing: her mum’s secret smoking with Max and their hushed sex talk, and her dad’s humiliation in the office. Something in the pure honesty and anger of that slap has endowed Marielle with the blazing insight and truth about parents who are living a placid life of dishonesty. Bewildered and panicky, she asks them for help getting rid of this burdensome and upsetting new power — they at first don’t believe her, but a crisis dawns as they are confronted with the truth, not merely about Marielle’s new abilities, but about their own lives.It’s a funny premise for a fantasy-satire, and it’s very amusing when Julia and Tobias refuse to credit that it’s happening and then try talking about it all in French in their bedroom so that their daughter can’t telepathically listen in (her powers don’t run to translation). But then what? How would a middle-aged couple really behave if they knew that their teenage daughter could see everything that they were doing? Would they, with hilarious unease, try to fabricate the ideal life they assume their daughter wants to see? Or would they think that this is absurd, so they might as well do what they wanted to do anyway? The movie comes up with differing answers to this question for Julia and Tobias, who are, after all, governed by gendered ideals about how a woman and a man should behave.But the key fact is Julia’s possible infidelity and this painful part of the story overwhelms the business about Marielle having telepathic powers, and so a lot of the comedy and absurdism of the film’s starting point gets lost. Well, it could be that the whole point of the film isn’t that Marielle’s powers are special, but that they are universal – or almost. Teenage children, in their watchful silence, are very good at working out what their parents are really thinking and doing, and parents had better acknowledge that, and be honest with their children.What Marielle Knows screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmBerlin film festivalDrama filmsComedy filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsGermanyComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But for how long?Shane HickeyMon 17 Feb 2025 05.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTShareThe annual push to get savers to use up their tax-free allowance has begun early – but there is speculationthat the cash Isa could be under threat.The chancellor,Rachel Reeves, has reportedly been lobbied to ditch the tax breaks on the popular accounts, just as people are piling in their money to take advantage of them.Now there have been warnings that the good rates will not last for long, and are likely to go down if the Bank of England reduces interest rates in the summer.Why are cash Isas in the news?It is now over 25 years since the individual savings account (Isa) was introduced. Since then, the rules around how much you can hold in the tax-efficient wrapper have changed, as have the different types of Isa you can have. But, essentially, it has always been an account where you can earn interest, or other returns, without paying tax on them.A cash Isa is like a regular savings account – your money is held in a bank, and you are paid ­interest at either a variable rate, or a fixed rate, depending on which type you choose.There is a maximum amount you can put into an Isa: in this tax year it is £20,000, and last year’s budget said it would stay at that level until 5 April 2030. All of it can go in a cash Isa – or, for the first time, several cashIsas– or you can hold some in stocks and shares.At the end of each tax year, the allowance expires and starts again on the first day of the new one in April. Traditionally, there is an “Isa season” in the months before the deadline, as people look to invest their full allocation.This season has started early after it emerged that the chancellor has been lobbied by firms in the City to scale back, or get rid of, the tax breaks on the accounts.The speculation has prompted some people to invest their money earlier, according to Sarah Coles from Hargreaves Lansdown.“Cash Isas are flourishing under pressure. They had a record year in 2024, and now we’re seeing an early start to the cash Isa season. With decent rates and frozen tax thresholds pushing more people into paying tax on their savings, it’s easy to see why,” she says.“It’s ironic that, at the same time, there has been so much speculation over the future of the cash Isa.”What are the best deals?After several years being ignored as a result of low returns, cash Isas have been enjoying a surge of interest recently as they offer similar rates to those on regular savings accounts.Some had questioned whether it is really worth investing in a cash Isa following the introduction of the personal savings allowance (PSA). This means basic-rate taxpayers don’t pay tax on the first £1,000 of interest earned outside an Isa, and higher-rate taxpayers on the first £500.But since rates have improved, many more ­people will find themselves with a tax bill for broaching these limits.Rachel Springall of financial information firm Moneyfacts explains: “A higher-rate taxpayer will easily breach their £500 ­allowance if they are earning 5% on £10,000. It would then be little surprise for cash Isa deposits to thrive this year.”At the time of writing, the best rate available on a variable cash Isa was 5.02% with Moneybox, although it is only available on an app, you do have to maintain a £500 minimum investment, and it is limited to three withdrawals a year.Coventry Building Society is offering a one-year fixed deal at 4.5%. Hodge Bank has a two-year fixed cash Isa at 4.41% (with a £1,000 minimum investment) and Shawbrook Bank has a three-year deal for 4.42%, according to figures from Moneyfacts.How long are they set to last?When the Bank of England dropped the base rate from 4.75% to 4.5% at the beginning of the month, the ripple effect was felt in what the banks offered, with some drops in rates in easy-access and fixed-term accounts, says Coles.“Tax year end is a competitive time to raise money, so fixed rates may hold up better as banks work hard for your money as we get closer to 5 April.“However, given wide expectations of another cut around the summer, both the fixed-rate and easy-access markets are likely to trend downwards over time.“The benefit of fixing now is that there are some really strong rates around, and given that those for easy-access and fixed accounts are likely to be lower later in the year, there’s a chance to lock in those better rates now.”Andrew Hagger at personal finance websiteMoneyComms, says that because of competition, some banks have not passed on all of the recent cuts since last summer.“With base rate being cut by 75 basis points since last August, most easy-access cash Isas are now paying a lower rate when compared with February 2024.“However, competition amongst some providers has seen some deals only marked down by around 0.5%.”Carry out a reviewSpringall says there is billions in current and savings accounts earning no interest and urges people to review their finances so they can get the most value possible.“Consumers must shake off apathy and act now to review where they have stashed their savings, ensure they beat the eroding impact of inflation and ­protect them from tax,” she says.Explore more on these topicsIsasThe ObserverConsumer affairsSavingsBanks and building societiesRachel ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was thinking of buying the rights for a novel byJoan Lindsay, Picnic at Hanging Rock, a story about the mysterious disappearance of three schoolgirls at an ancient rock formation and she was looking for an up-and-coming director. I had been gripped by the book and was very keen to make it.In the early 70s, adapting a book was what they did overseas, not in the Australian film industry. Picnic set a precedent, but that didn’t stop us getting the funding we needed, which ended up being A$440,000 (£220,000). Even at that low budget, it was still a dangerous commercial enterprise: a mystery without a solution.Oh Miranda, it’s been so long!I thought about filming the outdoor scenes in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, but as soon as I saw the real Hanging Rock in Victoria, there was no doubt. A lot of the visual inspiration came fromAustralian impressionistsof the late 19th century: Frederick McCubbin, Tom Roberts and especially William Ford’s 1875 painting At the Hanging Rock.To get the soft focus look, cinematographer Russell Boyd, feeling very self-conscious, went to the wedding section of a Sydney department store to buy veils of differing thicknesses to use as lens filters. Some of the dreamlike moments, like the swan representing the “Botticelli angel” schoolgirl Miranda, were scripted; others, like the burst of lorikeets as she enters the picnic grounds, were put together later by the editor, Max Lemon.View image in fullscreenRachel Roberts as Mrs Appleyard, with Margaret Nelson as Sara, in Picnic at Hanging Rock.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA couple of weeks into the shoot Vivien Merchant, who we’d cast as the strict headteacher Mrs Appleyard, was forced to withdraw because of illness. I went back to our original list, and miraculously Rachel Roberts, a British new-wave actor I admired, was free. The wig we’d made for Vivien also fitted her, but she said: “I simply can’t wear it.” It was bad luck in the English theatre to wear other actors’ wigs. Luckily, she had one of her own that she was able to use. She was a consummate performer.We shot an alternative ending where Mrs Appleyard goes back to the rock to search for the girls. But the last closeup of Rachel, a world of pain on her face, was so powerful I knew it had to be the closing shot – we didn’t even bother to cut together the other ending.A potential distributor in the US supposedly threw his coffee cup at the screen at the end of the film, saying: “Whodunnit?” He felt he’d wasted a couple of hours. The film was a modest success, but did very good business on college campuses. Picnic was one of those milestones for the Australian film industry as it evolved in the 70s – it was remarked upon around the world.When I went back to the site years later, they told me people often take pieces of the rock home as a souvenir – but return them, thinking they bring bad luck.Anne Louise Lambert, played MirandaIn the rough and tumble Australia of the 70s, it was pretty special to have something like Picnic come up. At the end of my teens, I felt I was born to play Miranda. With her free-spiritedness, she felt like an expression of my generation; that kind of flower-people stuff, unaffected by the colonialism of the culture we were raised in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They offered me the part, but reconsidered and gave it to another actor with very little explanation. I was incredibly disappointed. Then, out of the blue, they changed their minds because they thought the other girl was too big – a sign of the times.All the schoolgirls were lodged together, separately from the rest of the cast, at a Christian women’s guesthouse. It was like stepping back in time, with these sweet little rooms with lots of antimacassars. It was designed to help us bond, but it didn’t happen for me – I was missing my family. With these cliques of young women, there were lots of feelings. Some of them decided that Jane Vallis, who played Marion, another of the disappeared characters, would pair up with Dominic Guard, who played the young Englishman who follows them. Any time I was with him, suddenly there would be this wall of girls in front of me; this instant kind of intervention.Peter once said Miranda was more of a quality than a character. But the production designer Martin Sharp, who knew Joan Lindsay and the book well, helped me find her. In my room, for example, if I opened a drawer, it was full of things he’d put there that were meaningful for Miranda: Valentine’s cards, handkerchiefs, pressed flowers, photographs in lockets.There have been times when I thought it was a load of fluff, like a shampoo commercialI was the only character lucky enough not to have to wear a corset, but clambering about on the rock in those little Victorian boots was brutal. I was still feeling insecure, because there had been something not very wholehearted about my casting. One lunchtime, after a horrible morning filming where I’d had to re-do a scene a number of times, I came down the rock to see a little old woman staggering over some rough ground. I realised it was Joan Lindsay; she came up and threw her arms around me. Right in my ear, very emotionally, she said: “Oh, Miranda, it’s been so long!” That was incredibly validating.There have been times in my life when I thought the film was a load of fluff, like a shampoo commercial. About 10 years ago, Indigenous groups started objecting to it – which I understand, when the history of the rock is so much greater – and I decided not to talk about the film. But I recognise it’s got this extraordinary life force that keeps it going. I’m a psychotherapist now, and it has this Jungian aspect in the unsolved mystery: the exploration of society’s shadow side, all the murky stuff that is brought up when the girls disappear.Picnic at Hanging Rock is rereleased in cinemas on 21 February to celebrate its 50th anniversaryExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madePeter WeirDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the great musical ‘disruptor’ unveils his new murder-and-mandolins epic, he looks back on his most famous collaborationAlexis PetridisMon 17 Feb 2025 12.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 12.55 ESTShareAsk a set designer to create a bohemian Paris apartment and they’ll probably come up with something that looks a lot like Jean-Claude Vannier’s: books everywhere, vintage Bauhaus armchairs, art on every bit of wall space. You would say the living room was dominated by his grand piano, but your eye keeps getting drawn to a plethora of toy pianos that sit on and around it. On closer inspection, there are toy pianos on the shelves too, crammed among the books. “I’ve got more in the other rooms,” shrugs Vannier, speaking through an interpreter, “and I have a house in the country that’s full of them too. I take them to concerts and play a note or two. I find it adds something to a live performance that is filled with virtuosos. I have an open-tuned guitar that I kick, too – it makes a big boom.”Disrupting an orchestral performance by playing a toy piano or kicking a guitar seems characteristic: Vannier, now in his early 80s, has been a disruptive presence in French pop for 60 years. His latest project is pretty odd: a song cycle performed by a vast mandolin orchestra, accompanied by a story written by Vannier that involves a broken romance, alcoholism, homelessness and murder.His album Corpse Flowers featured songs about despairing monkeys and the danger of voiding one’s bowels when drunk“All the great love stories are sad,” he says, “because if people live happily ever after and have lots of children, there’s not much to say.” In fairness, it’s certainly less strange than the story Vannier’s most famous collaborator,Serge Gainsbourg, came up with for his 1972 album L’Enfant Assassin des Mouches (The Child Fly Killer). This involved a small boy persecuting a fly before being smothered to death by a swarm of the insects.If Jean-Claude Vannier et Son Orchestre de Mandolines seems an unlikely diversion, it’s no more peculiar than Vannier’s 2019 album Corpse Flower, a collaboration with Faith No More’s vocalist Mike Patton (a Vannier superfan who’s releasing his mandolin album on his label Ipecac) that featured songs about despairing monkeys and the danger of voiding one’s bowels when drunk. Nor indeed Vannier’s own career as a singer-songwriter in the 70s, which came about, he says, because no one else wanted to sing his chanson-inspired songs.It’s meant as no reflection on the quality of the albums to say you can see why: Vannier’s idea of a single was a song called Merde, V’la le Printemps, or Shit, Here Comes Spring. “It wasn’t my intention to shock anyone,” he says. “I just wanted to talk about what I saw around me. I had a song called Mon Beau Travelo – My Beautiful Transvestite. I was doing the music for a ballet withRoland Petit. After the performance, he would take me to the side streets off the old Paris Opera. There were many drag queens there. We used to watch them and that’s what inspired the song. It was very controversial at the time, and no one was willing to sing it, but it’s not shocking. It’s just what I wanted to express.”Vannier’s reputation, however, really rests on his arrangement and soundtrack work. David Holmes, DJ and creator of soundtracks for a host ofSteven Soderberghmovies, has called Vannier “the greatest soundtrack composer of them all, a true genius”. Vannier has worked with everyone from singerFrançoise Hardyto literary provocateur Michel Houellebecq. He wrote and recorded songs with the latter, Houellebecq even taking singing lessons to get his voice up to scratch.Mentioning his name provokes a frown from Vannier: “It’s true that I’ve worked with him, but he’s someone who will never be my friend. I met one of his publishers in an antique shop near here and they [joked], ‘Houellebecqis worse than a gangster!’ He has a terrible reputation, so I would never associate with him. But I’m a huge fan of his actual writing.”For all of these people, Vannier constructed astonishingly inventive orchestral arrangements, that occasionally touch on atonality and often bear the influence of music from the Middle East – the result, he says, of his disastrous first job, as an engineer in a Paris studio.View image in fullscreenPoses … Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin in the 1970 film Cannabis.Photograph: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty Images“I started with yé-yé singers, young girls and boys, and I made a lot of mistakes. So they had me record accordionists, who at that time were seen as very vulgar: their music was for Saturday night dances that were a bit violent. They didn’t have a good reputation. I messed up again, because I wasn’t particularly interested in this music, so they had me record Arab musicians. This was during theAlgerian war: there was a lot of fear aimed at Arab people, they were not popular at all in France. I loved working with them. I was happy, because I loved Arab music.”But it’s Gainsbourg who remains his most celebrated client. Vannier worked with him on the lauded soundtracks for the films Cannabis, La Horse, and Les Chemins de Katmandou and, most lauded of all, on 1971 record Histoire de Melody Nelson. A flop on release, it’s now acclaimed not just as Gainsbourg’s masterpiece, but one of the greatest French-language albums in pop history.Its belated rediscovery by crate-digging sample hunters and musicians in the 90s also seemed to spark a broader shift in anglophone listeners’ traditionally snobbish, dismissive attitude to French pop: if something as extraordinary asthishad escaped widespread attention, what else had the country’s musicians produced?“I think you’re right,” says Vannier. “When I first started receiving emails from kids in the UK that went on about how amazing this record was, I thought they were laughing at me – I know the British are very big on sarcasm. But then Mojo magazine called my daughter saying they wanted to do a big spread on me. I was astonished. I think that, quite simply, they just didn’t have access to these records before. They accepted me with open arms and more. I realised I had influenced a lot of people.”You can say that again. Echoes of his dramatic Melody Nelson orchestrations can be heard everywhere from Beck’s Sea Change to the Arctic Monkeys’ Tranquility Base Hotel And Casino, and they’ve been sampled by everyone from Portishead to De La Soul. In recent years, Vannier has conducted huge, star-studded concerts of the music in London, Paris and LA.Prankster … Vannier with one of his toy pianos.Photograph: Courtesy Jean-Claude VannierYet his relationship with Melody Nelson is a tricky one. Vannier says he wrote most of the music – “Sometimes Gainsbourg would come and see me with a melody, but more and more he would turn up with absolutely nothing and I would have free rein” – but Gainsbourg declined to give him a writing credit. They remained friends until the French singer’s death in 1991, but Vannier seems to have found Gainsbourg’s penchant for provocation a little trying.“He pretended to be a shit-stirrer,” he says, “because it was profitable for him financially. He wasn’t really interested in politics or philosophy or psychology – he was just prompted by whatever his press people told him to do. Before TV appearances, he’d run his hands through his hair so he looked more dishevelled. At the start, he actually pretended to be an alcoholic when he wasn’t – he was trying to shock on purpose to amuse his audience. At the end of his career, he genuinely was an alcoholic, but at the beginning that was a pose as well.”Melody Nelson had another belated effect. While working for a French label, the British DJ, producer and “Gainsbourg obsessive” Andy Votel heard “garbled rumours in Parisian record shops” about a mysterious “Melody Nelson follow-up” that had never been released. Some of the rumours were pretty lurid: it was based on Lord of the Flies, it had an “X-rated cover”, it had been banned.It turned out they were talking about L’Enfant Assassin des Mouches. “The guy who produced it worked with a guy called Mike Brandt, a really kitsch singer who was big in the 70s, although Eminem later sampled elements of arrangements I had created for him.” This was on 2009’s Crack a Bottle. “I’d made a few hits with this guy, so to thank me, his producer said he’d make a record with me and I could do exactly what I wanted. It was very, very expensive to make. I don’t think anyone today would throw so much money at such a strange project.”My parents hated artists – there was no way I was going into musicThe results were astonishing, if deeply weird: a melange of funk, free jazz, hard rock, musique concrète and stunning orchestrations. His label was so horrified, it refused to press more than a handful of copies. If Vannier was surprised by the belated interest in Melody Nelson, it was nothing compared to his bafflement when Votel contacted him, asking to rerelease it, which he did in 2005 to vast acclaim.It’s been quite a career. At 82, Vannier “doesn’t do much work” nowadays, but doesn’t give much outward impression of slowing down, with another soundtrack coming up. Perhaps he can’t stop. “When you love music,” he says, “there’s absolutely nothing that can prevent you from making your own music. My parents were devout Protestants. They absolutely hated artists. There was absolutely no way I was going to pursue a career in music. But once I turned 18, I had the right to do so. When your real passion is music, it’s like a tide that absolutely nothing can stop.”Jean-Claude Vannier et Son Orchestre de Mandolines is out now on Ipecac.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockSerge GainsbourgFranceClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With two relatively affluent belligerents involved, mobile phone coverage is ubiquitous on both the civilian and soldier sides. Juxtaposing intercepted calls back home from frontline Russian troops with shots of the devastation they have wreaked inUkraine, this film is a bleak and searing wiretap into Putin’s warping effect on his people and the psychology of power.“A Russian is not a Russian if they don’t steal something,” jokes one woman when she hears her brave boy has looted some makeup for her. Set against the shots of ransacked living rooms, wrecked petrol stations and dimly lit bomb shelters, such casual banter hammers home a chilling normalisation of imperialism and aggression – which comes with varying justifications. There is the standard dehumanisation: that the “khokhols” (a derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians) deserve it. Many parrot Putin’s line that the special military operation is fighting fascists. Or, in some troops’ amazement at Ukrainian ice-cream and abundant livestock, we glimpse an economic envy that lets such lies slip down more easily.There are dissenters, too. “Putin cares about the land, not the people,” points out one grunt. What is truly chilling is how the largely female listeners on the other end of the line are often more gung-ho than the soldiers. In one horrific segment, another combatant tells his mother about Federal Security Service officers torturing individuals. He confesses to participating in and enjoying this sadism. “If I got there too, I would enjoy it like you,” says Mum. “You and I, we are the same.” With Russian civilians here regularly condoning the murder of their Ukrainian counterparts, it shows how deeply Putin has cankered the body politic.Amid the thriving micro-industry of documentaries about this conflict, there are, as always, questions to be asked about the purpose and perspective of individual films. Since this one presumably could only have been made with the cooperation of the Ukrainian intelligence services, it’s hard not to wonder about what material was made available to director Oksana Karpovychand what has been made prominent in the edit. Even so, this eavesdropping is totally compelling, often overpowering the visuals the conversations are matched with; a dissonant stratagem that both outlines and pierces the post-truth fog of war.Intercepted is at Bertha DocHouse, London, from 21 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineRussiaSurveillanceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Are we too frozen with fear to name it?Zoe WilliamsThe truth is paralysing. But after JD Vance met the far-right leader Alice Weidel in Germany, it is time to be clear about what we are seeingMon 17 Feb 2025 13.07 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 18.01 ESTShareJD Vance’s decision, while in Germany, to meet the far-right AfD leader, Alice Weidel, yet decline a meeting with the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, would have caused more alarm, I feel, if it hadn’t come accompanied by so much other signalling. The vice-president of a nation engaged in tearing down its own institutions lectured the whole of Europe on itsproject to “destroy democracy”, which is absolutely textbook: he’s describing black as white, openly turning observable reality on its head. It’s unsettling, for sure, but that’s because it’s audacious, not because it’s complicated. It’s the simplest move of statecraft ever – show the world who you are, dare them to call you on it.Meeting Weidel was the second simplest move – show the world who your allies are, dare them to mention it, or see if instead they turn themselves in knots trying to bring the AfD back into the fold, rather than accept that the postwar consensus has folded.Like many people, I often feel as if I grew up with the Michael Rosen poem that starts: “I sometimes fear that / people think that fascism arrives in fancy dress.” In fact, it waswritten in 2014, but it was such a neat distillation that it instantly joined the canon of words that had always existed, right up there withclouds being lonelyandparents fucking you up. Obviously, fascism arrives as your friend. How else would it arrive?What I did not anticipate, when thinking that the whole suite of behaviours, from Nazi saluting to upturning reality, belonged well and truly to the past, was the sense of paralysis that would settle when fascism finally put its fancy dress on.I’m not talking about other world leaders, and the sufficiency or otherwise of their response. I’m honestly just talking about the guy in the street, the spectator, myself. You’re dumbstruck for ages, not wanting to call the thing what it is. It starts off feeling like embarrassment or coyness – what kind of hysteric runs around shouting “fascist”? A very silly one, surely? They might be the ones who have put their patent jackboots on, but fancy dress only exists with an audience.Then it morphs into something more superstitious – don’t call the thing what it is because that will only embolden the thing. You can keep telling yourself that the thing is already bold enough and doesn’t need your energy. Yet the feeling persists: if I decline to freak out, then the next phase cannot commence.Between 1933 and 1939, the journalist Charlotte Beradt compiled The Third Reich of Dreams, in which she transcribed the nightmares of citizens from housemaids to small-business owners, then grouped them thematically, analysed them, and smuggled them to the US. They were published in 1968. A surprising, poignant number of them were about people dreaming that it was forbidden to dream, then freaking out in the dream because they knew they were illegitimately dreaming. There were amazingly prescient themes, of hyper-surveillance by the state before it had even begun, of barbarous violence, again, before it had started. But the paralysis theme was possibly the most recurrent and striking – people’s limbs frozen in Sieg Heils, voices frozen into silence, motifs of inaction from the most trivial to the most all-encompassing.That’s the problem with paralysis – it gets into everything. If you can’t respond to the news, you can’t look at the news, but you know it’s still there. When you’re averting your eyes, you can’t even think your way into next month. Casting yourself any further ahead than that feels like asking for trouble. Frozen feels preferable to adapting to a new reality. Sometimes you don’t have to look for it – trouble will find you anyway.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now the prime minister wants to put it outMon 17 Feb 2025 03.51 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 03.55 ESTShareAs the devastation in Gaza continues, Palestinian families in Britain are racing against the clock to try to bring our loved ones to safety. Newsfinally cameof a successful family reunification – but instead of being able to feel a moment of relief for this one family, we’ve had to face a vicious political and media backlash.The UK media, government and even the prime minister have fixated on a “loophole” that allowed a mother, father and four children fromGazato be granted the right to live in the UK via the Ukraine family scheme. It obscures the reality that there is no Gaza family reunification scheme, forcing Palestinians to navigate an immigration system that offers no clear pathway to safety.Here are the facts:the legal team representing the family did not argue for their entry under the Ukrainian scheme, but simply used that form as a vehicle to submit a human rights application because no dedicated form exists for Palestinians. The court ruled in the family’s favour underarticle 8of the European convention on human rights, which protects the right to family life. The judge made it explicitly clear that the Ukrainian scheme was irrelevant to the case, yet Keir Starmer has chosen to pledge to “close the loophole” while the media vilify the family’s success, using inflammatory language such as “opening the floodgates” to justify inhumane policies.For me, a Palestinian from Gaza, this is not just an abstract policy debate – it is deeply personal. My mother, father and three siblings, after enduring six months of genocide and being displaced more than five times, managed to evacuate to Egypt. Their home in Gaza was bombed, and they survived starvation and constant terror. They have no family or legal status in Egypt, and they have a right to be here with their family after everything they have endured. And so for months I have fought through a hostile UK system, desperately trying to secure a way to bring them to safety.Yet rather than recognising its moral and legal obligation to establish safe pathways for Palestinian families to be reunited, the government has chosen to manufacture outrage over a legal ruling that reaffirmed a fundamental human right. This decision should have been a catalyst for action, prompting the UK to introduce aformal Gaza family reunification schemefor families such as mine. Instead, the government seeks to shut down any possibility of reuniting in safety, fuelling anti-Palestinian sentiment and legitimising further inhumane policies. We want our families to be safe, and we are met with closed doors.TheGaza Families Reunitedcampaign, alongside 350 families in the UK, has been tirelessly advocating for an immediate family reunification scheme. But the government’s refusal to act leaves families in limbo, suffering through endless legal and bureaucratic hurdles just to be with their loved ones.Judge who granted Palestinian family right to live in UK made wrong call, says Keir StarmerRead moreThe contrast between the UK’s response to Ukrainian refugees and its treatment of Palestinians could not be more glaring. After Russia’s invasion, the UK swiftly created astructured schemefor Ukrainian families. In comparison, Palestinians – who have endured 15 months of genocide, starvation and mass displacement – are left without any dedicated family reunification pathway.This is not about seeking refuge out of choice, but the fundamental right to family unity. Despite what is stipulated in article 8 of the European convention on human rights, Palestinians are forced to fight legal battles just to be together. The legal process is already prolonged and complex, and many families are unable to secure legal representation to even begin applications.Family reunification is about more than just immediate survival – it is about dignity, healing and justice. We, the Gaza Families Reunited campaign, are not seeking permanent resettlement in the UK. We only want to be with our families while they are unable to return to Gaza.Israel’s systematic and forced displacement of Palestinians – whether through military aggression, starvation or forced exile – is aclear breach of international law. The UK cannot claim to uphold international law while simultaneously denying Palestinians the right to safety and family unity.Palestinian families in the UK have watched helplessly as their loved ones in Gaza experience relentless bombings, starvation and forced displacement. They have the right to be reunited, to heal, and to find safety together until it is safe to return home.Ghassan Ghaben is a member of the Gaza Families Reunited campaignDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why aren’t all women getting it?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettThe tragic loss of a mother of three highlights how widespread perinatal mental illness is – and that care is patchy and underfundedMon 17 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 11.09 ESTShareTwo sobering facts for you: 1) Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death in the period from six weeks to a year after birth, and 2) There are only 22 mother and baby units in the whole of the UK, with not a single one in Northern Ireland.Perinatal mental illness – a leading complication of pregnancy – is in the news again. Services are crumbling and overstretched, anda postcode lotterymeans women are often struggling to access treatment, with devastating consequences. The new Labour MP Laura Kyrke-Smith has beenspeaking movinglyabout the death by suicide of her friend Sophie, who ended her life 10 weeks after the birth of her third child. Sophie had been suffering from anxiety, especially around her baby’s feeding, and they had spent a night in A&E, but it is unclear whether signs that she was at risk were picked up by professionals.Her friend has been left wonderingif, amid all the worry about the baby, anyone asked her mother if she was OK, and what a difference that might have made not only to Sophie, but to the three young daughters she left behind.In pregnancy, you are monitored for all sorts of physical complications. In fact, the average woman during pregnancy has 16 contacts with health professionals. They measure you and scan you and take your blood and urine samples and monitor you for pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. They should also ask you about your mood, but this doesn’t always happen, or not often enough. After you have your baby, your health visitor and GP should check the baby’s health and ask about the mum’s wellbeing, but it can sometimes feel like a tickbox exercise, and the attention paid to this, and the help available, can vary wildly from place to place.The Maternal MentalHealthAlliance and the Royal College of Midwives say that there are stark variations in the levels of care and the length of time it’s taking to access what could be lifesaving support. They and Kyrke-Smith want to prevent women at risk from slipping through the cracks by making mental health support fully embedded into routine maternity care. There have been great improvements in recent years – including the creation of designated mental health midwife posts – but there is a desperate need for more funding and staff.I am a mother with some firsthand experience of the perinatal mental health system. I have waddled through the crumbling temporary buildings. I have sat on hold on the phone in tears. And I have felt the shame that sometimes hampers women for asking for help during what everyone tells you should be a wholly joyful period of your life. It took three referrals – two from a hospital consultant, and one from a particularly tenacious health visitor – to get me some specialist help.There is, understandably, a high threshold for referral (though let’s be honest, it is probably too high). Services are so stretched that it can be difficult to think that you are deserving of care. “There must be so many women worse off than I am,” you think, even if you’re told that you absolutely should be receiving help. At a time of acute need and decades-long issues of underfunding, the notion of preventative maternal mental health care seems like a luxury, even though – as in my case – getting support established in pregnancy can help stop things reaching crisis point once the baby arrives.I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I received outstanding care, especially from the mental health nurse, who made home visits and was in touch by phone. But sadly, it is help I would not necessarily have got in another borough or region. So many mums that I have met have soldiered on alone, or said, many years after the fact, “I think I had postnatal depression”, or “the thoughts I was having were not normal”. Helping women and their loved ones recognise when they need that extra support – and that they are deserving of it – should be a crucial part of the pregnancy journey. Asking how they are, listening to them, noticing any alarm signals, and signposting to relevant services is now standard in some trusts, but it should be everywhere.There are places where charities are trying to fill the gaps, but lots of women need a higher level of care than free counselling delivered by volunteers. A friend who moved from London to Somerset is testament to this. She received brilliant care in her first, twin pregnancy, in Islington, but during her second pregnancy she had to opt for expensive private therapy. This was despite writing up a document summarising her history of postnatal depression (PND) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and asking health professionals to read it.What does this tell us? Depressingly, it suggests that even the most vocal self-advocates can struggle to access support, so what hope is there for those who feel they do not deserve it, who are vulnerable, or who haven’t spotted the signs that they need help?Labour MP to push for better maternal mental health care after friend’s suicideRead moreThere are many awful details in the story of Sophie’s case, from the messages she sent in those desperate first weeks, to the rich life she left behind. What made my own heart sink was reading about her difficulties with feeding. Kyrke-Smith has said how she doesn’t know “whether the conversations they were having about the baby’s feeding were done in a way that was considerate of the mental health struggles that my friend may have been having”. Since I wrote about my own challenges with breastfeeding, several mental health professionals have told me in private that they believe the way the NHS delivers Unicef’s baby-friendly breastfeeding policy can be incompatible with thesafeguarding of women’s mental health. A 2022 study in Nature alsoraised concernsthat exclusive breastfeeding promotion policies may exacerbate adverse maternal mental health outcomes. A truly baby-friendly policy values the sanity of that baby’s mother.I am so glad that the conversation about maternal mental health is happening, and measures such as the introduction of specialist mental health midwives are a step in the right direction, but more funding, more staff, more education, more monitoring, more data, and more outreach are urgently needed. One in five women suffer from a mental illness in the perinatal period. When will mothers stop being left to cry it out?Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

King Abdullah of Jordan squirmed in the Oval Officelast week, as the press asked him and Donald Trump about the latter’s Gaza plan. He is in a tight spot, wanting to keep Trump onside while at the same time not agreeing to the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Immediately after, anonymousEgyptian “security sources”– not parties prone to leaking without strategic direction from President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi – said that Sisi would not accept an invitation to visit Washington as long as the Gaza displacement plan was on the agenda. Now, this was probably more for the Egyptian public’s consumption than for Trump’s benefit – Egypt is in no position to make an enemy of the new administration – but it nonetheless shows how hard it is for Trump to secure the acquiescence of even the US’s closest allies.Saudi Arabia alsopostponed a visit to the USonce Trump announced his intentions for Gaza. And in a remarkable change of tune, Saudi, which before 7 October 2023 was en route to normalisation with Israel and is not usually a country to make heated statements, lost its patience. When Benjamin Netanyahu quipped that maybe it would like to take Palestinians from Gaza (“they have a lot of territory”, he said), Saudi state media unleashed astorm of invectiveagainst him. When Trump announced his plan, Saudi Arabian authorities immediately put out a statement rejecting it. So keen was the government to signal that rejection that itreleased the statement at 4amlocal time.Leaders are scrambling to calibrate their responses atan emergency summit on Thursdayhastily convened in Saudi Arabia. But they will struggle to do so without landing themselves in hot water with Trump, members of the Arab public or global opinion on the illegality of the plan. “The current approach is going to be difficult,” the United Arab Emirates (UAE) ambassador to the US said when asked if his government could find “common ground” with Trump on Gaza. He might have got away with that. But perhaps feeling that it was a little too strong, he went on to say that “we are all in the solution-seeking business” and he doesn’t really “see an alternative to what’s being proposed”. The clip immediately starteddoing the roundson social media as evidence of the UAE’s endorsement of ethnic cleansing. There is clearly no consensus on Trump’s Gaza approach, or even how to respond to it, between countries that make up a political bloc but have divergent interests.Time is running out. On Sunday, Marco Rubio kicked off atrip to Israel and the Middle East. Conversations that some have been avoiding on Trump’s home turf will have to happen there. A need to come up with a common line and strategy on behalf of Arab countries is now pressing. The task is to thread a needle: flattery of Trump and rejection of his Gaza plan are irreconcilable, and each time even a single head of state engages with Trump or is asked about Gaza, there is the risk of a comment that inflames feelings or infuriates the US emperor. The Arab summit seems a very long way away when every day brings another Trump gambit or threats to the end of the ceasefire in Gaza.The scramble is part of a bigger problem. Arab states are unable to settle on a position on Palestine. Before 7 October, normalisation agreements with Israel had been secured bysome Arab nationsand were under way with others, with Palestinian statehood a nominally plausible prospect subject to technical questions, even though in reality everyone knew it was more remote than ever. The war killed that plausibility, and Trump buried it.1:26Trump puts Jordan's king on the spot about plan to take in displaced Palestinians – videoWith the stakes so raised, it is impossible for Arab nations to engage with Israel and the US on Gaza and Palestine one way or the other without undoing something big. The political landscape is finely balanced. Egypt and Jordan are the most important parties when it comes to any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza due to their proximity, and would be most affected by any resettlement campaign. They are also big USforeign assistance recipientswith weak economies and governments with shaky mandates. These payments andmilitary aidare in part remuneration for these states being “stabilising” parties in the region, serving as buffers between Israel, Iran, Hamas and all proxies, absorbing refugees and facilitating the movement of US military assets through the region. Losing US aid weakens not only their economies, but also theirmilitaries, security agencies and ability to maintain the patronages and oppressions needed to stabilise politics.But there areother calculations. Agreeing to a plan that involves the expulsion of Palestinians in essence turns all receiving and facilitating countries into parties to what will simply be a wider, differently configured Israel-Palestine conflict. Instead of the removal of Palestinians from Gaza being an end to something, it would be the beginning of something else, with the horror of mass displacement on top. It is unfathomable not only in cruelty and criminality, but also in terms of practicality: already,35% of Jordan’s populationare refugees. Also – and Trump can be forgiven for not getting his head around this, considering how invisible they are – people live in these countries, millions of them. They might not have a say in how their politics is run, but they have an opinion. That opinion has historically been managed but by no means erased. It’s not a safe bet to assume that the mass removal of Palestinians won’t set off something explosive, either in terms of popular discord, or its exploitation by competing political or even extremist players.To stop Trump’s Gaza plans, Palestinians need solidarity and support | Omar BarghoutiRead moreIn short, Arab governments are being forced to confront and settle a question that goes to the very soul of the contemporary region – what does Arab identity even mean any more? Is it just a group of countries that speak the same language and share borders, but with regimes and elites that have become too enmeshed with the west to be viable on their own terms? Or is there still some residual sense of agency in those regimes, some echo of political integrity and duty towards other Arabs?Beyond the existential, though, here is what Arab leaders should learn from Trump giving them orders about their territories and people: the price of their US-stabilised status quo is now so high that it makes less and less sense on a practical basis. To submit to Trump would be to accept full vassal status and summon new domestic challenges, and all for an unreliable benefactor. To defy him would entail a full-blown reconfiguration of politics in the region that might seem too colossal to contemplate. Arab political elites find themselves in this mortifying position because of their historic feebleness on Palestine: it is a concentrated expression of their own weakness, capture and shortsighted self-interest. The future ofGazais no longer an issue that can be finessed while saving face indefinitely. Trump’s plan is a gateway to the final erosion of the integrity and sovereignty of the wider Middle East.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What I do know is that if we all tune out, there’s no hope at allMon 17 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 13.18 ESTShareIt’s tempting in this dire moment to try and shut out the nightmare of what’s happening in Washington DC.“I’m waking up every day to a genuinely sick feeling in my stomach and a heavy feeling in my chest,” my friend Laura, who follows the news closely, texted me recently.I get it. It’s frightening and dispiriting to watchDonald Trumpand his sidekick Elon Musk wreak havoc on institutions from the National Archives to the Treasury to USAid – infiltrating data systems, firing internal watchdogs, taking the side of every ne’er-do-well, threatening the wellbeing of dedicated civil servants and persecuting the most vulnerable people in our society.The insults to common sense, basic morality and good government seem to come hourly. Some are disastrous – like the anti-science RFK Jr picked for health and human services secretary – and some are relatively small, like the furor over the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.Here’s how Democrats should fight back against Trump | Margaret SullivanRead morePut them all together, and it feels as if we’re watching the US implode before our eyes. Not that this nation was ever anything but deeply flawed, but it did hew to democratic norms like the rule of law.And it’s all happening so fast and so relentlessly.Lofty media discussions of whether we are in a constitutional crisis fail to grasp the severity. That term “does not even begin to capture the radicalism of what is unfolding in the federal bureaucracy and of what Congress’s decision not to act may liquidate in terms of constitutional meaning”, as the New York Times columnistJamelle Bouieput it earlier this month.What’s worse, there’s little reason to think things will improve any time soon, or perhaps at all.In an important piece published this week inForeign Affairsmagazine, the prominent scholars Steven Levitsky and Lucan A Way wrote that democracy is in greater peril now than at any time in modern US history.They forecast that US democracy “will likely break down during the secondTrump administration, in the sense that it will cease to meet standard criteria for liberal democracy: full adult suffrage, free and fair elections, and broad protection of civil liberties”.These political scientists see us moving into “comparative authoritarianism” – not a full-blown autocracy but certainly going that way.They do have some advice for those who want to slow this juggernaut. This includes public officials, journalists, lawyers, judges – and ordinary Americans.“Hold the line,” they say.“Trump will be vulnerable. The administration’s limited public support and inevitable mistakes will create opportunities for democratic forces – in Congress, in courtrooms, and at the ballot box.”But here’s the caveat: “The opposition can win only if it stays in the game.”That won’t be easy. The endless harassment and threats – downright intimidation – will discourage many of Trump’s critics from taking a stand.We see plenty of that already with the way some news organizations have softened their tone toward Trump, reporting the facts but not getting the outrage across.We see it in ABC News’s decision to settle a defamation claim by Trump that they should have fought and probably would have won. Even before the election, we saw it in the abrupt withdrawal of anti-Trump editorials at the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times.Some of this retreat is invisible, Levitsky and Lucan note. Talented young lawyers, the kind who might have run for public office in the past, may decide that, in this ugly environment, that’s a bad idea.Without making a direct statement, many who oppose Trump’s movement will move to the sidelines and keep their heads down.“Such a retreat would be perilous,” the authors note. “When fear, exhaustion, or resignation crowds out citizens’ commitment to democracy, emergent authoritarianism begins to take root.”At some point, there’s no turning back.What can regular Americans do? Perhaps most crucially, they can stay informed and engaged.Want to defeat Trump? Support unions | Eric BlancRead moreThey can keep track of what’s happening, not just throw up their hands and think only of sports, entertainment and family life.They can support democratic institutions, including news organizations (no matter how imperfect) or individual journalists. They can help to make sure voting can happen fairly and freely in their communities, including by volunteering as poll workers.They can communicate with their elected representatives, telling them what they find unacceptable and encouraging them when they do something right. They can do the same with journalists and their bosses.They can donate to organizations that defend press and speech rights like the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press or PEN America. They can seek out trusted voices, like that of my Guardian colleague Robert Reich and many others.Sadly, some of my most idealistic friends have decided to check out. After all, they did what they could to keep Trump from getting a second term – they voted, they donated, they wrote letters to prospective voters, they worked on campaigns.Having failed, as they see it, they say that they’re done caring.I understand that attitude. I might be tempted to do the same if I weren’t a journalist writing about politics and media.I’m far from certain that staying aware and engaged will make any difference.What I do know is that if we all tune out, there’s no hope at all.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s an idea whose time has comeMon 17 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 08.15 ESTShareThe startling contempt for Europe’s intensifying security concerns displayed by Donald Trump and his henchmen has brought an old, controversial question back to the fore: should Britain and France pool their nuclear weapons capabilities and create a Europe-wide defensive nuclear shield to deter Vladimir Putin’s Russia, if the US reduces or withdraws its support?Trump has not so far explicitly threatened to cut US nuclear forces based in Europe. But speaking last week, the president said he wantedto halve the US’s defence spending, especially on nuclear weapons. Trump often denigrates Nato, keystone of European security. Last year,he encouraged Russia“to do whatever the hell they want” to member states that, in his view, spend too little on defence.Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, warned Nato defence ministers in Brussels that defending Europe was no longer a strategic priority, and raised the prospect of US troop withdrawals. Inan insulting speechat the Munich security conference, he minimised the threat posed by Russia. Americans would not be taken for “suckers” by Europeans, he said.These unprecedented assaults on US-Europe ties have raised real fears of a damaging, possibly permanent rupture with Washington. It is against this volatile background that France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, hascalled an emergency summitin Paris of European leaders, including Keir Starmer. The meeting is expected to focus on Ukraine, its future defence, and Europe’s anticipated exclusion from US “peace talks” with Russia due later this week.Yet an even bigger issue overshadows the summit: how to better organise Europe’s collective defences in the context of reduced, unreliable or nonexistent US support and overt nuclear threats from an emboldened Russia. Boris Pistorius, Germany’s defence minister,has predictedthat Putin could attack at least one Nato country within the next five years. Frontline Poland and the Baltic republics voice similar fears.Nato’s chief, Mark Rutte, has urged all 32 member states to expand defence spending. Many, including Britain, appear poised to do so. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, dismayed by what looks to many in Kyiv like US betrayal, told the Munich conference it was time to create an “army of Europe”. That reflects ideas long promoted by Macron, a passionate champion of more integrated, expanded, self-reliant European defence – and reduced US dependence.It is Macron who is leading the debate about a pan-European nuclear shield. The French leader gave new prominence to the idea in a 2020 speech at the École de Guerre in Paris, whenhe suggesteda “strategic dialogue with our European partners … on the role played by France’s nuclear deterrence in our collective security”. Macronrepeated the offer in 2022and again last year.France is not proposing to place its independent deterrent, theforce de frappe, which comprises about 290 warheads and operates separately from Nato, under the control of other countries – or the EU. What Macron is saying, like François Hollande and other French leaders before him, is that there exists a “European dimension” to France’s nuclear defence planning. If, for example, Berlin were threatened with nuclear destruction, that would be seen as a threat to Paris, too.1:53Zelenskyy says time has come to create an 'armed forces of Europe' – video“French leaders havethree main worries,” an analysis published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated. “Firstly, there is a high risk that Trump could withdraw from Nato, or at least significantly reduce US conventional forces in Europe … Secondly, he may also reduce the number of US nuclear weapons currently deployed in Europe, though not much evidence currently supports that prospect.“Thirdly, and most importantly, a US president who loathes or dismisses many European countries is unlikely to risk American lives forEurope.” This latter argument has circulated in France since the days of Gen Charles de Gaulle, who created theforce de frappe: namely that, if push came to shove, the US would go nuclear to save Boston but not Boulogne, Bratislava or Bognor Regis.Macron’s proposal raises numerous, complex questions. Among them, who could order the actual use of “Europeanised” nuclear weapons? Who would pay for such a force, especially if necessarily modernised and enlarged? Would such a move make matters worse, by accelerating US disengagement?The view from Germany, a necessary partner in any such project, is mixed. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and anti-nuclear parties such as the Greens strongly dislike the idea (as do French leftwing and far-right parties). But Friedrich Merz, Scholz’s likely successor, is reportedly interested. Manfred Weber, a leading German conservative, told the Guardian last year that doubts about Trump meant it was time to take up Macron’s offer. Weber also urged the opening of a “new chapter” with London.The need for British involvement has also been raised by Christian Lindner, another senior German politician. “The question is: under what political and financial conditions would Paris and London be prepared to maintain or expand their own strategic capabilities for collective security?”Lindner wrote last year. “When it comes to peace and freedom in Europe, we must not shy away from these difficult questions.”Trump’s betrayal of Ukraine has emboldened Putin and pulled the rug from under Nato allies  | Simon TisdallRead moreThe IISS study raised similar issues. “As the only other nuclear power in Europe, Britain is a natural partner for France in any exploration of how to strengthen European deterrence … [They] regularly exchange data about nuclear safety and security … The British and French nuclear arsenals combined come to around 520 warheads, numerically equivalent to China’s current deterrent force. This alone could send a stronger message toRussia.”Development of a joint UK-French nuclear umbrella, under the auspices of the European Nato allies and sidelining the US, is politically explosive for Starmer. It would raise questions about sovereign control, not least from the Eurosceptic right. It could be seen by many in Labour as fuelling nuclear weapons proliferation, bringing nuclear war closer. Putin, who has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, would view it as a provocation. So, too, for different reasons, might Trump. It would be a good test ofhow independent of the USthe UK deterrent really is.But as the defence analyst Joseph de Weck argues in Internationale Politik Quarterly, times are changing fast. Governments urgently need solutions to Europe’s rapidly deepening security crisis. “Europeans may simply not have the time for gradualism in security integration any more,”De Weck wrote. Extending French and UK nuclear guarantees to the whole of Europe, including Ukraine, is an idea whose time has come.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionNatoNuclear weaponsEmmanuel MacronKeir StarmerVladimir PutinDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Fresh Peruvian air still rejuvenated my lungs and the brain fog induced by my daily smartphone addiction hadn’t yet crept back in.The disastrous events that followed began once I turned my phone back on. Responding to a Twitter solicitation for Peru recommendations, a man I’d never met posted: “Go mountain biking down a volcano in Arequipa!”Those eight words would change my life.I didn’t even know what Arequipa was, and yet within an hour of the tweet I’d resolved to change all my plans and go. I waved goodbye to my hiking buddy and swapped my flight to Lima, Peru’s capital, for Arequipa, its second biggest city, noted for its striking volcanoes, valleys and adventure sports.As I’m a lifelong adrenaline junkie, the opportunity felt irresistible. I’ve skydived, sand-dune surfed, paraglided, bungee-jumped off New Zealand’s tallest tower, been propelled from the water into the air by a jet pack and doneTough Mudder-style adventure events which included ice baths and an “electroshock therapy” obstacle of 10,000 volts.These experiences shouldn’t be taken as braggadocio that claims: “I’m mad, me!” but more as a recognition of a lifelong problem. I had always found the pedestrian, repetitive monotony of daily life stultifying without a semi-regular thrill to remind me of my own mortality. Descending a volcano by mountain bike felt too seductive, a once-in-a-lifetime experience I couldn’t let pass.I struggled to find a tour company that would take me as a solo rider. Three suppliers cancelled at the last minute the night before. It was almost as if the universe was telling me something bad would happen. Still, I ignored such signs and finally found a guide.My head brushed the roof of the 4x4 as I set out with my guide and a driver for the two-hour journey up the winding Pichu Pichu volcano which dominates the city’s skyline, so tall at 4,200m that my ears popped on the ascent. As the SUV rolled over the volcano’s ancient lava-encrusted bumps, a familiar feeling returned to my gut: nervousness, excitement, the feeling of being alive.My guide offered me four routes, increasing in order of difficulty. He tried to get me to buy the fourth – the hardest (and most expensive). I opted for the third. At the summit I geared up: knee pads, elbow pads, helmet, extra layers. Initially the descent – down a spiralling gravel path which wrapped around Pichu Pichu – was glorious. I belted Life by Des’ree as we whizzed down the winding track. Adrenaline surged through me. My guide showed me three “shortcut” off-road descents straight down from the spiral. I declined each for being too steep until it started to get awkward – I’d literally paid him to take me off road, and I was staying on road. I agreed to the fourth descent.Suddenly the hills felt perilous; I was almost at a 90-degree angle. My singing abruptly stopped. My colon travelled to my larynx. I screamed at an emasculating pitch and surprising volume. “Well done, Mr Gary!” my guide said, laughing, as I completed a steep descent. “Remember: don’t brake on the hill.”The bike then picked up an alarming pace. I felt panic travel through me. I resisted braking for most of the descent till it felt too dangerously fast. I saw my guide, who’d stopped ahead of me on the narrow rocky trail, rapidly nearing. Fearful I’d knock him over, I braked too hard into a skid.Furious amounts of dry dust erupted from the hilly dirt ground in protest. My back wheel flipped up, throwing me over the handlebars. In a wallop, my entire body weight landed on my right wrist. Through the clouds of dirt, I briefly saw the outline of my bike in the air. The dust cleared enough for me to see it hurtling towards me before landing on top of me, instantly winding me. At altitude.View image in fullscreenGary Nunn after breaking his wrist mountain biking in Peru.Photograph: Gary NunnArid soil filled my mouth; the first thing I did was spit. I could barely breathe. My hearing faded back in. “Mr Gary? Mr Gary, are you OK?”I was too winded and in shock to respond. “Catch your breath, Mr Gary,” my guide said. The first word I choked out was an expletive. The first feeling was sheer embarrassment. Then disappointment. Then pain.My guide insisted my wrist definitely wasn’t broken; he’s a former paramedic, and if it was broken, it would have swollen more, he said. He even tried getting me back on the bike, but I was in too much pain. Deflated, I asked him to radio the van-of-shame to drive me the rest of the way down the volcano. I slipped and slid down the dusty narrow trail, swearing each time I bumped my wrist.The next day, in agony, I headed to a private clinic. My wrist was definitely broken. Broken so badly that, eight months on, my wrist still isn’t fully functional.Looking back on that last adrenaline-fuelled ride, I feel both idiotic and philosophical, sad and cautious. I should have eased in more gently on an easier route.Cyclingfast both on and off road has long been my passion, but at the age of 42 I have reluctantly conceded that my mountain-biking days are probably over. Doing the same thing and expecting different results is madness. Twenty minutes of euphoria just isn’t worth the risk of two months in a plaster cast then many more in physio.And it’s not just mountain biking I’ve turned the page on. Gently letting go of the thrill-seeking side of myself is a reluctant metamorphosis, but one that recognises both a 36-hour rave atBerghainand a broken bone will take longer to recover from as I ease into middle-age. Each action has an equal and opposite reaction, and that reaction lengthens and intensifies, arguably from your 40s onwards. Each activity will now require a clear-headed risk assessment by speaking it through with someone less gung-ho than me. Four-day hiking with tents? Yes. Canyoning? Maybe. Free solo rockclimbing? Absolutely not. I’m currently deciding whether to ride theworld’s largest zip-line system in Mexiconext month. Jury’s still out. The old me would’ve already booked it.Quitting adrenaline-seeking activities has made me take a closer look at my thrill-seeking need and what it says about me. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist. I’m still figuring out what this means for me, and how to manage it, but it contextualises my risk-taking. While it’s a popular aphorism for wellness memes and trite wall-hangings, the spontaneity of the “carpe diem” or “yolo” mindset is all well and good till you’re in a foreign hospital being told you need bone-resetting surgery costing £4,000 – and your travel insurance won’t pay. I’ve realised: sometimes living for tomorrow is healthier than living for today.Gary Nunn is a freelance journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsCyclingWhy I quitHealth & wellbeingMountainscommentShareReuse this content"

China certainly doesn’t relish a trade war with the US, but it was better prepared than others for Mr Trump’stariffs, and both sides appear to be leaving room for a potential deal. And, though China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is poised for worse to come, the second Trump term is bringing Beijing opportunities as well as problems.International respect for the USplummetedunder his last administration. As the US president turns the screws on long-term partners, China is looking to take advantage. Colombia quickly caved to Mr Trump on the matter of migrant returns, but China’s ambassador has beencelebratingthe “best moment” in relations between Bogotá and Beijing. Under pressure from the Trump administration, Panamaannouncedthat it would allow its participation in China’s global infrastructure plan, the belt and road initiative (BRI), to expire. Yet behind-the-scenes arm-twisting had already beguntilting Panama backtowards the US. Mr Trump’s attempts to humiliate and bully may backfire there and across the region.He is likely to find it harder going, too, away from his back yard, in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The US has never been afraid to use hard power, but trade, aid and military alliances have also been key to its hegemony. No longer. Mr Trump’s attack on South Africa,cutting financial assistance, may delight Elon Musk, but pointlessly alienates an important middle power. His declaration that the US will expand its territory in various locations – using military force if necessary – shows his utter contempt for the law, as does his order tohalt enforcementof US legislation banning the bribery of foreign officials.China might well benefit byaddressing some of the impactof the US axing aid – it funds at least one affected group. But it has focused more on loans and infrastructure than partnership with local organisations, and its record suggests it is unlikely to fill the financial holes left by the US.There is little naivety about engagement with Beijing these days, but many countries will conclude that they have little choice but to hedge their bets. China is most likely to gain ground in multilateral institutions, and among middle‑income nations thatview it much more positivelythan high-income ones.Mr Vance’s blast at European leaders at the Munich security conference, and promotion of the hard right, was ashocking moment of clarity. Yet far from holding out a velvet-gloved hand, Beijing has just appointed a controversial “wolf warrior” diplomat as its special representative for European affairs. Lu Shayesparked furywhen, as ambassador to France, he questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet states and Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea. As China and the US contend, others are likely to find themselves not wooed but pressured by both sides.China rose more rapidly in the global order than it could have expected. Now it is watching US power deteriorate far more quickly. That’s promising for a country that wants a multipolar world without inconvenient universal values. Yet the question is not just how others react to Beijing’s growing power but whether a security free-rider may find itself taking on roles it hoped to avoid, or having to cope with the vacuum left if it doesn’t.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last week there was a strikingly differentsession, as four care-experienced young people offered their perspectives to the education committee. The point was to increase MPs’ insight by confronting them with children for whom social care is a hugely important fact of life.Some of the material shared was personal. But these witnesses also had opinions about how services could be changed to better meet the needs of young people in similar positions. As well as describing losses and disappointments, they spoke warmly about adults who had supported them. This included teachers,personal advisers(support workers for care leavers up to age 25) and foster carers. One young woman said her independent visitor (a voluntary role) was a key person in her life.The importance of sustained relationships was a theme that shone through. Each young person described painful feelings of disconnection. These can be personal but also institutional – for example, the gap between children’s and adult mental health services, or the lack of accommodation outside term time for students who have no other home. The need to support siblings to keep in touch was raised, along with increased entitlements forkinship carers.A clearer role for kinship care is one element in the children’s bill currently making its way through parliament, although advocates are disappointed that new allowances are not included. Concern about rising costs is the reason, with social care budgets widely recognised to be among the biggest challenges facing local government. The system as a whole is under huge strain. In 2022-23,councils in England spent £7bnon looked-after children. At the end of March, there were83,630 childrenin the care of local authorities.Poverty, driven by austerity, is a key reason for this rising tide of need. While the change of government has brought new policies, including an attempt to limit the profits of private children’s homes and strengthen local authority commissioners, the reforms can also be viewed as the next stage in a process started by the last government. Josh MacAlister, wholed a reviewcommissioned by the Conservatives, is now a minister.Public awareness of the vulnerability of children separated from their parents dates back centuries – think of novels such as Oliver Twist. Research showing that a childhood in care is correlated with adverse life experiences includinghomelessnessandtime in prisonis not new. But the increased visibility of care-experienced activists and advocates means that outdated ideas are being updated, as arenewed strugglefor improved rights and services takes shape. In Wales, new placements in children’s homes or other settings run for profit arebeing banned.A campaign to make care experience a protected characteristic, in an amendment to the UK-wide Equality Act, would grant care-experienced people explicit protection from discrimination. The entitlements of 16- and 17-year-olds – including the right to be placed in care, as opposed to regulated accommodation –are in urgent need of being strengthened.While there are, of course, a range of views about priorities, it is right that the voices of care-experienced people are being heard. As Jake Hartley, who grew up in a foster home in Lancashire, told MPs last week, “One person can make a world of difference.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I am not religious, I don’t read the Tory press, I am not part of some opaque conspiracy and my opinions are not “sham indignation”. I feel genuine dismay at the manipulation and incompetence on show in parliamentary consideration of the bill.My perspective comes from my background as a psychiatrist with expertise in the interaction between severe physical illness and mental health. Leadbeater’s committee initially refused to hear from the Royal College of Psychiatrists and backtracked in response to the resultant outcry, eventually inviting a representative of the college and two other psychiatrists (one of them me) who appeared as individual experts.My session was interrupted by Leadbeater explaining to the committee that I and other witnesses didn’t understand the nature of suicide in life-limiting physical illness; the committee went on to ignore the advice of all three experts that the bill’s proposed medical assessment was inadequate.The latest twist is Leadbeater’s proposal that a psychiatrist will be part of a panel that will review decisions made by two doctors whose assessment does not meet the standards recommended by her psychiatric witnesses. The rationale for this approach seems to be that the last months of life are so self-evidently not worthwhile that there is no need to ask about, or offer help with, possibly modifiable influences on the decision to seek assisted suicide. Therein lies the danger of the bill and the real reason for much opposition to it.Allan HouseEmeritus professor of liaison psychiatry, University of LeedsKim Leadbeater’s proposal for expert panels seems to make sense – depending on the expertise available (High court signoff in England and Wales assisted dying bill to be scrapped, 10 February). Coercion can be subtle and is widely misunderstood. I have always thought advocates for restorative justice approaches in domestic abuse cases fail to understand how coercion works – a word or a look that would not be picked up by an observer can have a powerful impact on a victim.An expert panel is more likely to identify potential coercion than a single judge, but only if members are specially trained on coercion and disability equality, with input from voluntary sector women’s organisations such as Women’s Aid, plus ethnic-minority and disability organisations. Only then will they have a chance to identify how coercion may come into play.Caroline AirsNewcastle upon TyneKim Leadbeater has reneged on her promise to include a mandatory high court review of applications for assisted dying. It was this promise that persuaded many doubting MPs to support her bill at its second reading. Her proposal for expert panels to oversee applications is illusory. Like the judiciary, psychiatrists, doctors and social workers are overwhelmed, and will be unable to undertake the time-consuming task of serving on panels. The MPs who originally supported the bill will have their opportunity to change their minds later this year. As John Maynard Keynes said: “When the facts change, I change my mind.”Dr David JeffreyWest Malvern, WorcestershireKim Leadbeater’s proposed amendment to the assisted dying bill has filled me and many others with grave concern. Leadbeater hasdescribed the billas the “most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world”. However, the removal of judicial oversight significantly weakens the safeguards, raising concerns about what other measures may be dropped through the legislative process or through the interpretation of clinicians.While it will be essential to involve multidisciplinary teams if the law is changed, this need not have come at the expense of judicial oversight. While we do not yet know who will be appointed to the proposed expert panels, concerns have already been raised that there will inevitably be a self-selection bias to the voluntary assisted dying commission.My background as a nurse and as a priest tells me that the best safeguard is the current law. I urge parliament to reject this bill. It is neither safe nor compassionate. Instead, we should be focusing on providing the best possible palliative care services. Dying people should be offered hope, not fear.Sarah MullallyBishop of London and lead bishop for health and social care, Church of EnglandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We have a routine that eliminates most plastic waste. We shop at the market for fruit and vegetables, all in paper bags, and use vinegar for all cleaning. We use tooth tabs in glass jars, shampoo soap bars and laundry sheets. We’ve had dairy milk and oat milk delivered in glass bottles for years.Supermarkets can cut plastic packaging, but don’t. When I asked a manager at a big store why they can’t do more, I was told they have long-term contracts with big producers, which have long-term contracts with plastic producers. So vote with your wallet and shop where they help you – Lidl has compostable bags for many loose veg and fruit, and Aldi has nuts in paper bags. And there are always refill shops, though they tend to be expensive. Cutting down on plastic is possible, it just takes a little more time and effort.Sue KellawayChristchurch, DorsetCongratulations to Emma Beddington and to Gwen Harris (Letters, 12 February) for their efforts to go plastic-free, which mirror my own attempts to go zero waste. Having reduced our household waste from two to one bag per fortnight, I now reluctantly accept that further reductions are unlikely. After recycling, upcycling, using retail outlets that sell unpackaged products, doing without certain things and composting all organic waste, what is left is mostly plastic.The path to a more sustainable lifestyle is not straightforward and it can be hard to make informed choices about what actions are actually beneficial. The raw material for the bamboo loo rolls delivered to your door wrapped in paper, if not the product itself, may come from the other side of the world, and driving any distance to avoid a plastic bottle doesn’t make sense.There will doubtless be many wrong turns along the path, but the huge financial and environmental costs involved in processing and disposing of our domestic waste should be incentive enough for us all to try harder to minimise it. Supermarkets and suppliers need to do much more, but individuals need to show willing too.Cathy SwannAlresford, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I’m doing it for myself now’Donald McRaeNew Zealand fighter has appreciated spending time with his family as he prepares to challenge Daniel Dubois for the IBF world heavyweight titleMon 17 Feb 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 16.16 ESTShareThere’s nothing quite like watching Joe Parker lip-syncing to Take That to lift the mood in the back of an Uber on a drizzly morning in Dublin. The dangerous threat Parker faces against another big-hitting monster of the ring in Daniel Dubois, in Riyadh on Saturday night, fades with the laughter.Even the depressing reality that boxing will continue toignore human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, as Parker’s intriguing bout with Dubois headlines an outstanding bill bankrolled by the country’s General Entertainment Authority, can’t erode the wit and charm of the New Zealand heavyweight channelling his inner Gary Barlow.It’s a long drive from the heart of Dublin to the Ballybrack Boxing Club, where Parker has prepared for Dubois, and soI watch the video the fighter made last April. In December 2023 Parker hadoutclassed Deontay Wilder, a knockout merchant expected to crush him, and he was looking for a new opponent. Settling on Dillian Whyte, against whom he had losta slugfest in 2018, Parker created an amusing parody of the usual abusive call-out.Rather than being belligerent or crude, Parker pretended to croon and dance his way into Whyte’s heart by serenading him to the plaintive strains of Take That’s Back for Good. Featuring framed photographs of Whyte, and lipstick-stained mugs, Parker and his crew of South Auckland homeboys shuffled and sang their seemingly love-struck lament as a way of trying to set up a rematch. Those few minutes captured the essence of Parker.‘A lovely sweet kid’: tributes paid to John Cooney after Irish boxer’s deathRead moreHearing about this diversion on my way to see him, a beaming Parker exclaims happily soon after I step into the gym. “That’s my favourite,” he says of the Whyte spoof which belongs to an entertaining collection of videos Parker began making during Covid lockdowns with his wife, Laine, and their children in 2020. Laine was initially dubious but the videos became an internet sensation and she joined him in making them – including her as Olivia Newton-John to his John Travolta intheir version of Grease.Last month Laine and their five kids surprised Parker by arriving in Dublin – as a way of bringing the family back together amid the grind of fight camp. “It’s been very beneficial,” Parker says of their reunion, “because I worry when I’m in camp. I always think: ‘What’s happening back home? How are they? They’re missing out on time seeing their dad. Is my wife OK looking after five kids?’“The toughest part about boxing is saying goodbye to your family and being away in camp. They’re now staying in a separate house but it’s six minutes away and I get to see them for two hours every evening. It’s a great boost.”Parker is the most amiable man in boxing but his good mood, as the days tick down to his fight against the formidable Dubois, is not just because his family have been around him. It seems rooted in his sense that he has a serious chance of upsetting Dubois and replacing him as the IBF heavyweight champion. His team is led by Andy Lee, the astute and inspirational Irish trainer, and also includes George Lockhart, the American nutritionist and strength and conditioning coach.Lee has transformed Parker after the heavyweight, who was ill with a virus,lost against Joe Joyceon an 11th‑round stoppage in 2022. Parker has since been on a five‑fight winning run, with his most recent two victories against Wilder and the Chinese giant Zhilei Zhang catapulting him towards the heavyweight summit.View image in fullscreenJoe Parker: ‘The toughest part about boxing is saying goodbye to your family.’Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianAfter an hour in the ring, the steam rising from him on a freezing morning, Parker sits down with me for an hour. Conviction pours from him as he says: “I feel a real belief going into this fight – not just because of those two wins but because George and I have been quietly working away since April, and Andy and I have done such great work the last three months.”Dubois is also on a roll. He has shown grit and explosive power when stopping his past three opponents – Jarrell Miller, Filip Hrgovic and Anthony Joshua. “Even though Daniel’s in good form I don’t see the threat,” Parker says coolly. “I know he’s a beast but I’m extremely confident because of the work I’ve done. I’m more focused on the process. I enjoy going to the gym, training,eating honey, resting. If I do everything right, and do exactly what Andy tells me, the result will come.”Parker is heartened by speculation that Dubois is overlooking him and focusing on a possible heavyweight title unification fight against Oleksandr Usyk, who remains the real world champion and is in possession of the three other belts: “Mmm, it’s good. He might be in two minds. His focus might be split on that fight and our fight. He deserves the praise he’s got recently but that can take him away from what’s actually important and what he needs to work on.”Was he surprised thatDubois beat Joshua, knocking him down multiple times in five one-sided rounds? “I was,” Parker says, “because the only people that said Daniel would win were his team and George Lockhart. The whole week George told us that Daniel beats Joshua.”What is Lockhart’s prediction for Dubois v Parker? “George said I’m going to finish him off in three rounds. And Daniel’s said he’s going to finish me in three rounds. So it’s interesting.”Lee, meanwhile, told me how much he trusts Parker’s intelligence to negate Dubois’ shocking power. If the 33-year-old Kiwi of Samoan heritage can withstand the brutal punches being thrown his way he has the ring smarts to test Dubois – who has lost previouslyagainst JoyceandUsyk. The young British heavyweight was criticised unfairly in both contests and accused of quitting – even though he sustained a broken orbital bone against Joyce.But Dubois remains under the domineering sway of his father and he used to be withdrawn and painfully shy. His confidence has blossomed sincehe defeated Joshuabut does Parker believe Dubois might be psychologically fragile if momentum swings away from him? “If you haven’t worked on your weaknesses you can revert to them,” Parker says.“When things get hard in the fight, you might latch on to that again. But he’s showing growth and confidence and strength. It’s just hard to know because he’s not really a man who says a lot. I also don’t trash-talk anyone. In that sense we’re similar. There is no crap talk towards each other.”Parker and Dubois were first scheduled to fight in late 2023. “Andy, George and me were all on board for that one but, five days after agreeing, I got a call: ‘Sorry, Joe. You’re not fighting Daniel. You want to fight Wilder?’ Me, Andy and George were keen and so I got Wilder instead of Dubois.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was just the one fight after the other I was meant to lose.”Parker has been authoritative and convincing recently but does he worry about the damage of boxing having turned pro in 2012 and after 38 fights? “Yeah. Big time. I said to my team: ‘If you ever see any signs [of brain damage] I’m out. If my speech goes off track, please jump in and tell me.’ Andy would do it. George would. I’ve said I’ve only got two more years. When I’m 35, I’m out.”Parker’s great friend Tyson Fury, who introduced him to Lee, has retired four times previously. But was Parker surprised byFury’s latest retirementlast month? “I was because I still think Tyson’s got a lot to give. He was in two very competitive fights with Usyk [who narrowlywon both last year] and Tyson still loves the sport.When he announced his retirement I called him straight up that evening. I said: ‘What’s happened?’ He goes: ‘Joe, it’s one of those things. I don’t feel like fighting any more.’ But you never know with Tyson. He can do whatever he wants. He’s made lots of money, he’s got a loving family, achieved everything in boxing. So I told him: ‘It’s fine if you want to walk away. Enjoy your life, you’ve done everything.’”Parker is a passionate ambassador forManuka Doctor honey, while devouring the sweet stuff before he fights, and he has a supportive family. He credits his parents for all they have done. “They both came from Samoa. My dad lived in the bush and had a hard life. He lived on bats and eels, and went diving into the waterfall to get shrimp. He was very resourceful and like a bushman. But he had a hard upbringing in Samoa. My mum also lived up in the mountains of Samoa and it was tough for her.“But it was even harder for them when they moved to South Auckland. They only spoke Samoan and they had to get work. Back then there was racism but they survived and made a living for us as a family [of five]. My dad’s been working in the same steel plant for 35 years and it’s a tough job. He’s still there now and he’s almost 65. But they are so proud of me.”Parker reveals: “My mum’s dad had over 20 kids and my dad is one of something like 28 kids. I’ve got a very big family.”Is the heavyweight planning to add to his own immediate family? “I think No 6 would be perfect. I’ve got four girls and one boy. One more would balance it out, hopefully another boy. You want to spend time with each of them and make sure they’re all given the time they need and want.”Does his wife get nervous watching him fight? “I’m sure she still does, but she sees how Andy, George and me operate, how in sync we are, how we work so well together and it gives her confidence. She knows that if I win this fight it’ll probably be my best achievement. This will mean something different because I’m doing it more for myself now. Before it was for my dad, New Zealand and Samoa. Now it’s for me, my wife and kids.”If he does win, will another lip‑syncing video be on the way? “I’d love that,” Parker says as he points to another trusted member of his camp. Kerry Russell helps the boxer to make his surreal and humorous videos and Parker says: “He’s the magic man and we’d need to do something special together after I beat Dubois.”Explore more on these topicsBoxinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

By 10pm on a bitterly cold night at Elland Road, any notions that Leeds would capture the mood courtesy of a suitably cadenced performance had been thoroughly disabused as Daniel Farke’s side fought their way to a dramatic last-gasp win after Wilson Isidor had givenSunderlandthe lead.Yet if it was hardly poetic, substitute Pascal Struijk’s gamechanging double returned Leeds to the top of theChampionship, leaving them two points ahead of Sheffield United, seven clear of third-placed Burnley and 10 in front of Régis Le Bris’s team.Leeds United 2-1 Sunderland: Championship – live reactionRead moreIt was a cruel end for Sunderland as their nasty habit of conceding late goals once again returned to haunt them. “We want to be promoted and the result is tough to take but we can be proud of the way we played,” said Le Bris, whose side look destined for the playoffs. We’re still young and still learning. We played a good first half but Leeds were very good and you could see they had more experience than us. We need more depth in the squad.”Leeds are now unbeaten in 15 league games. Farke was so excited by Struijk’s winner that he was booked in the midst of a wild celebration and fears he will have to watch next Monday night’s game at Sheffield United from the stands. “These are the best sort of wins,” he said. “It was a great night but it was difficult. Sunderland are one of this league’s best counterattacking sides and we had to be patient and we had to fight but this is a major step in our development. I’m pretty proud of my players tonight.”By the end Sunderland were forfeiting possession far too cheaply but they began well and Illan Meslier was swiftly called to arms when Enzo Le Fée sped down the left and squared for the unmarked Jobe Bellingham to test the goalkeeper’s reflexes with a low shot perhaps lacking a little power. When that effort was parried the rebound fell to Patrick Roberts but, once again, Meslier proved equal to the challenge.Nonetheless Le Fée – incidentally a former school friend of Meslier’s in Brittany and fellow product of the Lorient academy once run by Le Bris – had served notice of the talent that once prompted the loanee’s parent club Roma to pay Rennes £20m for his services.View image in fullscreenPascal Struijk heads a late winner for Leeds.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAlthough, even at this early stage, Leeds had plenty of possession, Sunderland kept their cool and waited to pounce. Sure enough an opening arrived thanks to a long ball from Dan Ballard diligently chased down by the increasingly ruthless Isidor, who expertly turned the outmuscled Ethan Ampadu before directing a fabulous angled shot into the net via the inside of both uprights.Too strong, too swift and, above all, too skilful for Ampadu to handle, the former Zenit St Petersburg striker had a lot to do after springing the Leeds offside trap but Isidor’s 12th goal of the season suggested the Frenchman would not be out of place in the Premier League.Farke’s team are not accustomed to trailing at Elland Road in the Championship and, as Sunderland fans serenaded them with renditions of “Leeds are falling apart again”, turned tetchy. Jayden Bogle’s booking for a frustrated tackle on Bellingham after the midfielder’s connection with Le Fée’s gorgeous flick encapsulated the mood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farke’s players were clearly unhappy at their guests’ audacity in breaking Meslier’s run of six clean sheets in the second tier but struggled to fathom out how to exact revenge.Manor Solomon did his best but although the winger dazzled at times as Sunderland withstood a barrage of home pressure, Leeds created precious few clearcut chances until a double substitution on Farke’s part proved inspired as Struijk’s powerful header following Joe Rothwell’s free-kick finally defied Anthony Patterson.In the 95th minute that duo did it again. As Rothwell crossed and Struijk’s close-range header hit the back of the net an extraordinary rescue act was fully accomplished and a high decibel blast of the Kaiser Chiefs’ I Predict a Riot boomed out of the sound system.“If you enjoy watching football, you enjoy watching Joe Rothwell,” said Farke. “His technique is outstanding.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipLeeds UnitedSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Less than four years later a magnificent, imposing, futuristic stadium has opened on the banks of the River Mersey. A torturous journey decades in the making has been worth every step.History, memory, grief and belonging: my bittersweet Goodison farewellRead moreIt was July 2019 at the nearby Titanic Hotel when the architect Dan Meis unveiled his grand plans for Everton’s new home. Tonight it welcomed its first guests, the 10,000 fortunate Evertonians selected via a ballot to attend the first test event and game at Bramley-Moore dock. A friendly between Everton’s and Wigan’s under-18s has never felt so significant, or such a privilege to observe. Future quiz question answers: Everton’s Demi Akarakiri kicked the first ball and Wigan’s Harrison Rimmer scored the first goal at Everton Stadium. Everton lost 2-1.Everyone present was sat in the South Stand, a steep bank of 14,000 seats that will function as the home end when Everton relocate here next season. In all likelihood as a Premier League club, something that could not have been said with great certainty before David Moyes returned last month as manager. The views are superb, no obstructions here, and also impressive when looking out from the back of the South Stand at a panorama of the city skyline. The facilities are excellent, too. The concourses have vast amounts of space, refreshment kiosks and toilets. The upper Gwladys Street at the 133-year-old Goodison Park this is not.View image in fullscreenEverton’s under-18s take on Wigan in front of a 10,000 crowd in the first game at the club’s new stadium.Photograph: Tony McArdle/Everton FC official photoWigan’s visit was the first of three test events required for Everton to obtain the licence and safety certificate to operate at 52,888 capacity next season. All four stands will be open for the second and third events, albeit at a reduced 25,000 capacity and near capacity respectively. It is estimated the stadium will attract 1.4 million visitors to the city annually, create 15,000 jobs and contribute £1.3bn to the UK economy over its lifetime.What a quest it has been to get here. Everton went through two failed stadium projects at King’s Dock and Kirkby, plus a proposal that never really got off the ground at Walton Hall Park, before settling on this site in the early years of Farhad Moshiri’s ownership.View image in fullscreenA general view of the interior before the test match.Photograph: Emma Simpson/Everton FC official photoMoshiri’s one positive legacy should be celebrated, even though the £750m-£800m project came close to sinking Everton at times: £55m of that sum was spent preserving and restoring heritage works at Bramley-Moore, including the original dock walls that remain under the stadium, the railway tracks that carried coal to steamships on the Mersey and the Grade II-listed hydraulic tower that forms a symbolic part of a 17,000-capacity outdoor plaza. The infill of the dock took three months and 480,000 cubic metres of sand dredged from the Irish Sea. Two porpoises had to be guided out of the dock before it was sealed for good. Architecturally, Everton Stadium is the most striking, ambitious addition to the Liverpool waterfront since the Three Graces were built in the early 1900s. They were also built on an infilled dock, St George’s.The inevitable teething problems that have arisen so far mainly concern access and have been beyond Everton’s control. Liverpool city council recently announced a raft of parking restrictions within a 30-minute walk of the stadium that have caused uproar among local businesses. The restrictions, which came into effect on Monday and are scheduled to last 18 months, apply not only on match days but 365 days of the year. More than 7,000 people have signed a petition calling on the council to scrap the year-round parking restrictions. Local residents and businesses claim they were enforced without consultation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their Sunday defeat at Tottenham was an engaging if bitty affair that finished 1-0 largely because the low quality of defending on show was compensated for by the low level of attacking. It wasfun in its way, but it didn’t feel a lot like Premier League football.It also meant United dropped to 15th in the table, having won just four of 14 league games under Ruben Amorim. Under Erik ten Hag this season, United were taking 1.22 points per game; under Amorim that’s down to 1.00. Nobody was under any illusions about the scale of the task he was taking on, but four months after Amorim took the job it would be very difficult to identify any concrete signs of progress. There has been the resilience of the performance in the league at Anfield, in the FA Cup at the Emirates, and not a lot else.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreAmad Diallo has impressed, raising further questions about why he was used so sparingly by Ten Hag, but he is now out for the season after sustaining an ankle injury in training. The starting XI on Sunday featured perhaps three players who feel as though they might be part of the long-term future of the club, and even that’s being slightly generous given Patrick Dorgu has only just arrived and thus hasn’t had time to be afflicted by the general malaise. In January, United seemed willing to sell one of the other two, Alejandro Garnacho, if only because as an academy product he would represent pure profit in the Premier Leagues profit and sustainability rules (PSR), thus allowing them to further restock the squad.This, of course, is a large part of Amorim’s problem. The squad he has inherited is a shambles. And while it’s legitimate to wonder why Casemiro is still clanking around the United midfield, a glance at United’s bench, which featured eight teenagers plus Victor Lindelöf, makes clear just how few options Amorim had. It’s probable now that United will suffer their first lower-half finish since 1989-90 – the season when, by legend at least, Mark Robins’s winner at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round kept Alex Ferguson in the job – but nobody should think that is the fault of anybody but the club’s owners.This week will mark a year since Jim Ratcliffe bought just over quarter of the club and the right to run the football operations from the Glazers. He was greeted with optimism; he is local and logic said nobody could be as bad as the last lot. Since then he has imposed a bevy of cost-cutting measures – many bafflingly petty. He has done away with discounts for pensioners and children and installed an array of expensive executives. Dan Ashworth was installed as sporting director, presumably to try to ensure the sort of coordinated approach that has been so obviously lacking since Ferguson left in 2013, only to leave after five months, seemingly for opposing the appointment of Amorim.The 40-year-old’s record in Portugal makes clear he is a gifted coach, but that does not make him the right coach for United. He reiterated again on Sunday that he will keep playing his 3-4-3, that this is a season that almost has to be written off as the players familiarise himself with the system. But he must know that most of this squad cannot play it. He also must realise that there will be no great infusion of cash to rebuild the squad in the summer; United are already under pressure to avoid breaching PSR regulations.Even with a fair wind, as Gary Neville said on the It Was What It Was podcast, it would be an enormous task for Amorim to transform the tactical identity of a club that has almost never previously played with a back three. And that leads to questions: just how certain are the hierarchy that Amorim is the right man? Defining the philosophy should be a job for a sporting director, who would then recruit players and coaches accordingly. The absence of such a guiding hand has been one of the biggest problems for United for over a decade – then they appoint one and immediately ignore his advice.And the wind is not fair. Fans are becoming frustrated by the lack of progress, which on the one hand is hard on Amorim, but on the other is readily understandable, given the way they are being squeezed by the club, paying extra to watch the worst football United have produced in 35 years.The danger is that, even if Amorim is the right man, his reputation will be so tarnished by the end of the season that he will never be able to inspire the belief successful management requires. This is a mess with no easy solutions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had won three European Cups with the Amsterdam club, but he needed to stretch his wings. As Spain relaxed its regulations on foreigners, Real Madrid sniffed around, but it was Barcelona who pounced to reunite Cruyff with the Dutch coach who had so inspired him at Ajax, Rinus Michels. The deal was agreed on 13 August but that breached Dutch regulations which stated that all transfers should happen in July. It took two and half months for the bureaucracy to be resolved, and Cruyff finally made his debut on 28 October.He joined a team just beginning to find its feet after winning only one of their opening five games of the season. They didn’t lose again until after their first league title in 14 years had been decided. But the high point, without question, came on 17 February 1974, when Barcelona went to the Bernabéu for the Clásico. Cruyff ran the game, setting up three goals and scoring one, showing remarkable balance and strength to beat two players in the edge of the box, as Barça won 5-0.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

But the head coach is waiting on the second-rower George Martin, who was not part of full training on Monday because of discomfort in his knee.Six Nations half-term report: Ireland top of class but Wales go from bad to worse | Ugo MonyeRead moreScotland are the only Six Nations team England have yet to beat under Borthwick after they clinched a29-23 victoryin the head coach’s first match in charge in 2023 beforeprevailing 30-21 at Murrayfieldlast year.Tom Curry said there had been an “edginess” to training this week as England seek a win that would keep theirSix Nationstitle hopes alive, and his fellow back‑rower Ben Earl explained how the squad have been shown video clips as they bid to stop Scotland’s four-match winning run.“We’ve watched some of that back, we’ve learnt some lessons,” Earl said. “We’re not going to be short of motivation, that’s for sure. There will be a unit meeting and we’ll be told that they mauled us for 7.1 metres per maul last year … that’s not a great stat for the forward pack, is it? It’s stuff like that, dropping that in. We know that there’s a job to do and that might contribute to the feeling we’ve got in the group at the moment.”Two years ago at Twickenham, Duhan van der Merwe ran riot, beating five defenders on the way to the tryline, before the South Africa‑born winger racked up a hat-trick at Murrayfield 12 months ago.For Earl, the Twickenham defeat was particularly painful and prompted some soul-searching as he soon found himself dropped from Borthwick’s squad, while the loss last year sparked England into changing their attacking approach.“It is [difficult to watch] but I’m a big believer that those are the kind of games where you learn the harshest lessons,” Earl said.“I distinctly remember 2023 Scotland at home was a big turning point for me. That was a time where the penny really dropped and I felt I had to learn some lessons. It’s something I’ve looked back on and am almost grateful for. But it’s never nice. [I learned] I was unfit, that I didn’t know what it takes to become a top‑class international rugby player, I didn’t know what it took to play under Steve. Some harsh lessons but nothing I’d change.Quick GuideRussell and Graham may be fit to face EnglandShowScotland backs Finn Russell and Darcy Graham are both \"in the hunt\" to be involved in Saturday's match against England at Allianz Stadium, according to assistant coach Pete Horne. The pair were cast as doubts for the Calcutta Cup  after sustaining head injuries in a nasty collision with each other during the first half of last Sunday's 32-18 defeat by Ireland at Murrayfield.However, both players remain with the squad and have been taking part in light training at Scotland's warm-weather base in Oliva Nova, south-east Spain, over the past few days. Their 12-day stand-down period from full contact rugby is due to end on Thursday – the day the squad fly from Spain to London – and if they pass the required protocols, they will be free to train on Friday with a view to playing on Saturday.\"They're both progressing well through the protocols,\" Horne said. \"I think depending on how that goes over the next couple of days, there's a chance that they could both play. There won't be any risks taken. I'm sure the medics are right on top of it. They're both in the hunt.\"Scotland have added Bath centre Cameron Redpath, Edinburgh scrum-half Ali Price and Edinburgh wing Ross McCann to their squad, with centre Matt Currie dropping out due to concussion, back-rower Alexander Masibaka returning to his club Soyaux Angouleme and scrum-half George Horne having a facial injury assessed.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s not necessarily unfit in terms of physiologically. It’s like, ‘I’m shattered, can I keep going?’ is a different mindset to ‘I’m shattered, I think I’ve emptied myself and got nothing left’, and you’ve always got more. Steve’s a big believer in the back-rowers being the ones who run the furthest … work the hardest. You always think that until you get thrown into the Colosseum.

We did all of that. It was another lesson where we started the game well and tailed off.”Curry has been among England’s standout performers in their opening two matches, all the more impressive given he has to carefully manage his training load after adebilitating hip injury that threatened retirement. With England players given last weekend off, Curry was able to spend time with his miniature dachshund, Toby, and revealed dog-walking plays a part in his recovery programme.“It is more the way I walk,” Curry said. “I just make sure I am walking on my heels and it is a good distraction so having Toby is good. My run-in from Christmas was really good physically. It felt like I was finally playing with two hips, which was nice. Coming into this tournament, it feels like the first time I’ve played in an England shirt where all I’ve been focused on is the game, the ball, where I am with the ball. That’s been a lot of weight off my shoulders. Just go out and throw yourself into it.“I have won big games and sometimes you come back in and the first session everyone is on their heels a bit.

Sinner’s explanation that he was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by his physio was accepted byWada, but the agency added that “the athlete bears responsibility for the entourage’s negligence”.The world No 1 is therefore suspended from 9 February until 4 May, meaning he will be eligible to play at the French Open, which starts on 19 May. Speaking at the Qatar Open, Djokovic said: “There’s a majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled.Emma Raducanu ‘really proud’ after ending losing run with win over SakkariRead more“A majority of the players don’t feel it’s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers.”Sinner’s was the first of two high-profile cases in tennis in quick succession, with the women’s world No 2, Iga Swiatek,handed a one-month suspension in Novemberafter a positive test for the angina medication trimetazidine. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted it was caused by contamination of a medicine Swiatek was taking to help combat jet lag.By contrast, the former world No 1 Simona Halepwas given a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022after a positive test, although it was later reduced to nine months. Meanwhile, Britain’s Tara Moore, a far less well-known player, was suspended in May 2022 while an investigation lasted 18 months before an independent tribunal determined that contaminated meat was the source of the prohibited substances for which she tested positive.“Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have got the ban for years … there is so much inconsistencies between the cases,” said Djokovic. “Sinner has got a suspension for three months because of mistakes and negligence of his team members, who are working on the tour. This is also something that I personally and many other players find strange.“Now it’s a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn’t work, anti-doping, it’s obvious. I hope that in the near future the governing bodies are going to come together and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes. It’s inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair.”Moore, 32, wrote on X on Monday: “I don’t think any of this was Sinner’s fault. I’m simply asking that everyone get the same treatment. I hope his case will further improve the conditions in which players are treated and will be a precedent for future cases’ timelines.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think he loses any points or his No 1 spot either, so it’s an interesting ban.”The British No 1, Jack Draper, told Sky Sports: “I’m sure he wouldn’t have done anything intentional but we have to be accountable for what goes in our bodies.

If you have one on the first day then you get the bit between your teeth and you can say, OK, let’s kick on. That one is absolutely crucial, and didn’t we half find out last year, because none is horrendous.”Nicky Henderson dealt Cheltenham blow as Sir Gino ruled out for seasonRead moreSetbacks, disappointments and frustrations flew at Henderson from all directions both before and during last year’s festival meeting, as star turns including Constitution Hill, Jonbon and Sir Gino were last-minute scratches as a bug swept through the stable at the worst possible moment of the year. The handful of horses from his yard that made it to post showed little or nothing of their best form, and Henderson’s eventual blank over the four days was his first since 2008.There has beenfresh misfortune alreadybefore this year’s meeting with Sir Gino, the likely odds-on favourite for the Arkle Trophy on the meeting’s opening day, ruled out with an injury.But the most successful British-based trainer at the meeting over the last four decades still has several big chances across the week, including three current Grade One favourites in Constitution Hill, in the Champion Hurdle on 11 March; Jonbon, in the Champion Chase the following day, and Lulamba in the Triumph Hurdle, the opener on the final afternoon on 14 March.All three were on parade here on Mondayalong with Palladium, last year’s German Derby winner, who is also on course for the Triumph, and clearly in excellent health.The market leaders for the feature events on the first two days of the festival have sharply differing characters. “[Constitution Hill] is the most laid-back person you’ll ever come across, and the other one is a complete fuss-pot and can’t stand still for two minutes,” Henderson said. “The other horse [Constitution Hill] would stand still for two days, I could tie him up to a telegraph pole and come back and get him in the morning and he’d be fine.”View image in fullscreenNicky Henderson with Palladium, left, and Lulamba during a stable visit at Seven Barrows in Lambourn on Monday.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAConstitution Hill, who remains unbeaten after 10 starts over hurdles, has raced just four times since winning the Champion Hurdle in 2023, and spent a year on the sidelines between his two wins in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton in December 2023 and 2024. But he appeared to be back to something close to his best on Boxing Day last year and followed up in comfortable fashion –bar an unexpected mistake at the last– in the International Hurdle at Cheltenham last month.“Funnily enough, from my point of view, I hated Cheltenham the other day,” Henderson says. “It absolutely killed me, because I think we went into Kempton with half a mind that he could easily get beaten, and if he did, we felt we’ll be alright in March… [but] Cheltenham was something else. That day absolutely did me in because it was sort of a no-win situation, wasn’t it?“His work is the same [as it was before his latest start]. I suspect Nico [de Boinville, his big-race jockey] will have a sit on him this week just to see where he is and how he feels but I suppose he’d better jump a hurdle at some stage. You hardly want to go in [to the Champion Hurdle] with the last hurdle he jumped being that one.”Next month’s Champion Hurdle promises to be one of deepest and strongest for many years, with State Man, last year’s winner, and the high-class mares Brighterdaysahead and Lossiemouth – the runner-up in the Christmas Hurdle – all seemingly being aimed at the race.“You’re certainly going to get pace,” Henderson said. “It’s what she [Brighterdaysahead] has always done [but] the one good thing is that he can travel off any pace. The pace that Lossiemouth found difficult at Kempton was no worry to him, he can travel at a very high speed.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowMarket Rasen:1.50 Wallquatari 2.20 Bluey 2.50 Groom De Cotte 3.20 Miss Cynthia 3.52 Geordie Night 4.27 Onesoc 5.02 Forward Thinking.Taunton:2.05 Ask Me Another 2.35 Cornish Storm 3.05 Catch On Me 3.35 Camulus 4.10 Aurigny Mill 4.45 Shearer.Wolverhampton:4.20 Enola Holmes 4.55 Little Bittern 5.30 Kaleidoscope Eyes 6.00 Addosh 6.30 Daaris 7.00 Sweet Fantastic (nap) 7.30 Coconut Bay 8.00 Mariner 8.30 High Court Judge (nb).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was a hint of reception that Henderson, De Boinville and Constitution Hill can expect if he retains his unbeaten record next month after his latest success at short odds in January.“The last time I saw that sort of crowd [for a Cheltenham winner] was in Sprinter Sacre’s day,” Henderson said. “It’s a very special thing.

Trump’s funding freeze is causing panicOn his first day, the president paused billions of dollars in funding for clean energy projects initiated by BidenStephen Starrin Columbus, IndianaMon 17 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 07.03 ESTShareMike Mullett strains to see through sheets of misty rain while driving through working-class neighborhoods of Columbus, a quaint town in southern Indiana.He’s trying to find the senior center, multi-family homes and rent-assisted properties – more than 530 in total – that he and many other locals hope will receive $4.42m in federal funding for solar electricity projects.But now that money is at risk.On 20 January, Donald Trump paused billions of dollars of federal grant funding for clean energy and other projects around the country initiated by the Biden administration’sGreen New Deal.“We’ve been slavishly working on a plan since April 2023 that would provide solar energy to hundreds of households in two low- and moderate-income Columbus neighborhoods,” says Mullett. The project was expected to be rolled out in April, with previously approved funding thought to have been made available by 14 February.“Unless the Trump administration makes a 180-degree turn on funding, that expectation will obviously not be met.”Record-breaking growth in renewable energy in US threatened by TrumpRead moreThe funding is part of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s $7bnSolar for All program, which is meant to help low-income families save money on electricity costs. About$117mwas set for solar projects and initiatives in Indiana.Communities across Indiana, a solidly Republican midwestern state, were set to benefit more than most from the Biden administration’s ambitious clean energy push in what was an ultimately failed effort to win votes in Rust belt states whose voters have abandoned Democratic party politicians in recent decades.By August 2024, $7.8bn in private investment for a host of clean energy projects including solar and battery production had come to Indiana, spurred in part by the promise of federal grants and local tax-abatement schemes.But Trump has followed through on his election campaign promise to roll back clean energy initiatives, referring to Biden’s efforts as the “Green New Scam”.Leading Republicans have backed his move, despite the potential economic risks to states where the president is popular.“The executive branch of government in our system has the right to evaluate how executive branch agencies are operating,” the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, said on 5 February.On 10 February, a federal judgeissued an orderfor the Trump administration to unfreeze its funding hold.Indiana isn’t alone in its drive for solar energy.Solar projects ranging from utility scale to single housing efforts have proved hugely popular in red states. Texas has the second-highest number of installed solar power units, after California, enough to power more than 4.5m homes. Florida follows close behind.A quarter of a trillion dollars – 80% of the total funding for green energy manufacturing and other initiatives – was to go to projects in Republican-leaning congressional districts across the US.At 3.4% of its total, Indiana, where Trump won by almost 19 points in November’s presidential election, produces more state electricity from solar than Democrat-leaning states such as Illinois, Washington and New Hampshire,according toone industry organization.“The $130m in total Solar for All funding awarded for Indiana would transform Indiana’s solar market by allowing more than 10,000 families in low-income communities around the state to directly benefit from the electric bill savings and resilience afforded by local solar,” says Zach Schalk, the Indiana program director at Solar United Neighbors Action, a non-profit that has helped invest $7.1m in solar initiatives in the state.“It’s really a non-partisan issue if you look at the survey polling across the US. We’ve had elected officials of both parties [in Indiana] sign letters of support. We know that this is a popular program.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can’t run a manufacturing plant on rooftop solar panels.”Emails sent to the Indiana Republican party and a state senator representing Columbus asking if party members believed the funding pause could risk solar electricity projects and disrupt business developments were not responded to.In Columbus, Trump’s move has been demoralizing for Mullett and others who have made a huge effort to secure funding that would see solar electricity infrastructure installed at 320 community households, 204 multi-family households and seven single-family project households.“Most of us are retirees and volunteers,” he says. “I would say [we’ve spent] 20 hours a week at a minimum; sometimes there were weeks when we were doing 40 to 60 hours a week.”He says that if the federal funding is lost, private funding that has been committed to help pay for the project would be gone too.“If the pending litigation in federal district courts must run its course all the way to the US supreme court, the delay in the rollout of the [funding] would certainly be measured in months, perhaps extending even into 2026,” he says.According to one study, Indiana residents have seen the seventh-highest electricity rate increase in the country.Nearly 83%of its electricity generation is sourced by natural gas or coal plants.Still, the time and effort Mullet and other community members have invested in the project means they aren’t about to give up. He says the work will continue even as the funding remains in flux.“Doing this in a way that low-income households can become involved, it’s literally a 50-year-old dream of mine,” he says.Explore more on these topicsUS newsSolar powerEnergy (Environment)Energy (Technology)US politicsRenewable energynewsShareReuse this content"

Those supporting the deal, including the UK, the EU and Japan, are hoping the levy will raise billions of dollars a year, which could be used to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate breakdown.Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia and 12 other countriesmade a submission to the IMOon 31 January opposing the plans. They argued a levy could reduce exports from the developing world, raise food prices and increase inequalities.They wrote: “A levy would not deliver a just and equitable transition [to low-CO2 shipping] and its adoption may trigger negative, economy-wide impacts … a levy is a fundamentally divisive proposal.”The countries also claim a levy is not needed to meet the IMO’s greenhouse gas reduction targets.Experts said the levy could still pass despite this opposition, if the IMO took a firm stance. At least 46 countries, representing about two thirds of the global shipping fleet, are thought to favour a deal. Some countries may also be won round through concessions on how the levy could be used, and the level at which it is set.The countries that are keenest on a levy are those most at risk from climate breakdown, many of them among the planet’s poorest. It will be hard for countries such asBraziland China to present themselves as champions of the developing world if they are pitted against what the most vulnerable nations are calling for.The impact of the levy is likely to be small in overall terms, reducing GDP by between 0.03% and 0.07%, according to estimates quoted in the submission.Brazil will host the Cop30 UN climate summit this November in Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon. The country has been engaged in intense diplomacy for the past year, and stepped up further last month with the appointment of the Cop president-designate,the veteran diplomat André Corrêa do Lago.Brazil has also called for a global wealth tax on billionairesto fund development aid and climate adaptation efforts in poor countries.But maritime campaigners said Brazil’s stance on a shipping levy was the result of its highly export-dependent economy.John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at IMO, said: “Brazil is very sensitive, in thinking that because of its exports of large quantities of dry goods, the levy would have a greater impact.”If there is little sign of agreement, the IMO could force discussions to a point. By longstanding tradition, the organisation tries to seek consensus, but some measures have been forced through in the past despite disagreement from some of the 176 member states.Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the IMO, said he would “focus on identifying common ground and build consensus”, and pointed out that members had previously agreed to adopt some form of emissions pricing mechanism this year. He said: “The complexities cannot be underestimated. [But] I am positive that we can achieve the required progress to meet our timeline.”A further complicating factor is Donald Trump’s presidency of the US. The IMO is not thought to be one of his priorities, and the US has not formally adopted a position on the levy in the past. Some think the US could “sit this one out”, in the words of one diplomat.But even if the US does not obstruct a deal,Trump’s threats of sweeping tariffsare deeply unsettling for countries concerned about global trade.Delaine McCullough, a campaign manager at Ocean Conservancy, pointed out that Trump’s tariffs were far more disruptive than any likely impact from a shipping levy. “The cost of a levy would be dwarfed by the tariff levels [Trump is proposing],” she said.Friederike Roder, director of the secretariat for the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, which brings togethercountries calling for levies to fund climate action, saidTrump’s actions on freezing USAidshowed the need for stable, predictable means of financing development, of the kind that only levies and similar mechanisms can provide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Heavily polluting sectors should be taxed more than cleaner parts of the economy.”Among the likely flashpoints in the shipping levy discussions are the questions of how the proceeds from the levy should be spent, and the level at which it should be set.Some within the shipping industry want all the revenues to be devoted to helping countries and companies move to lower-CO2 fuels and vessels. But many poor developing countries vehemently oppose this, arguing that the revenues should be considered as climate finance, to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of extreme weather.In aproposal submitted in January, the International Chamber of Shipping and countries including the UK and Japan, as well as the EU, suggested the levy should be set between $18.75 (£14.95) and $150 (£120) per tonne of CO2. Even the upper end of the scale is likely to be the minimum needed to encourage real change in shipping practices, according to Maggs.The five-day negotiating session at the IMO headquarters in London, which ends on Friday, will be followed by another round of talks in March, before a decision is due to be taken in April. Talks on climate issues at the IMO have a history of dragging on. It was originally hoped that the levy would be agreed, after years of talks, in the summer of 2023, butthat round failed– and it tookmost of the past two decadesto force countries and their shipping industries toaccept the need for mandatory CO2 reductions.As well as the carbon levy, the talks will cover a “carbon intensity indicator”, fuel standards and energy efficiency. These are also essential for reducing the CO2 output of the shipping industry, which accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.In part because of the way that shipping contracts are drawn up, ships tend to get to ports as quickly as possible, even if they know there is no berth ready for them, in which case they linger near the ports until ready. This “go fast and wait” strategy is wasteful of fuel, and produces far more CO2 than necessary – a reduction of 10% in speed would equate to a 20% cut in emissions, according to Maggs.Agreeing on CO2 targets and efficiency measures could make a vast difference in the short term, he said. “It’s a very potent way to bring emissions down quickly.”This article was amended on 17 February 2025. An earlier version referred to John Maggs as shipping policy director at Seas At Risk. Maggs left that organisation in 2024, and is currently the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the International Maritime Organisation.Explore more on these topicsBrazilCop30Climate crisisShipping emissionsShipping industryAmericasUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

It brought damaging winds of 130mph and heavy rainfall, with 440mm of rain falling in two days. Prior to landfall, Zelia affected southern Indonesia, including Bali, with winds of more than 45mph. The storm weakened into a tropical low by Saturday, but continued to cause widespread flooding, particularly near the Pilbara rivers and the Great Sandy Desert.Zelia intensified rapidly because of the record-warm Indian Ocean temperatures, which were 1-2C above the seasonal average, providing increased energy and moisture to fuel the storm. While Port Hedland in Western Australia had minimal damage, nearby areas like Pilbara and Marble Bar faced flooding and fallen trees. The Great Northern Highway remains closed, disrupting food supplies and leaving supermarket shelves empty. The tropical low is now tracking southwards, with rainfall becoming patchier and lighter.Over the weekend, meanwhile, WinterStorm Jett swept through the north-east of the US, bringing strong winds, snow, freezing rain and blizzards. South-west Pennsylvania had about 5in (12.7cm) of snow, while southern New York received 4in (10.2cm). Higher elevations in the Adirondacks, St Lawrence Valley, and the mountains of New England and Maine are expected to accumulate up to a foot of snow from the storm.This week, high winds from Jett will continue to affect the north-east, with gusts expected to reach up to 60mph. Wind alerts remain in place, with power outages and travel disruptions likely. The winter storm formed through a process known as bombogenesis – a rapid intensification of low pressure, whereby the pressure drops by at least 24 hectopascals within 24 hours.As the active polar vortex persists, North America and Canada are bracing for yet another deep freeze. The cold air in the region will strengthen the upper-level ridge over Canada, creating a vast reservoir of cold air that will continue to push southwards across the US, bringing more extreme temperatures to the region.Over the weekend, the Northern Plains experienced a sharp drop in temperatures which is expected to spread south and east through the week, reaching the Gulf and the east coast by Thursday. This cold snap is forecast to bring temperatures more than 10 degrees below average across the US and Canada, with cities such as Chicago, Colombus, Denver, Detroit and Indianapolis experiencing daytime highs of about -15C to -20C. In Canada, cities such as Edmonton and Saskatoon could experience lows of below -35C.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsWeatherwatchExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It happens to every female.”The witness said she did not complain about the incident but added that, on an occasion when she received therapy through the army welfare services, “somehow everyone knew about it”.She said at first she used to leave her door unlocked, but added: “I stopped feeling safe and started locking my door because anyone could just walk in.”Hort, now 23, who has left the army, said: “As the only girl in my battery I got a lot of unwanted attention from a lot of the lads, especially if they had had a drink. I couldn’t walk out of my block without getting nasty comments. That goes for the majority of females, not just in Larkhill.”Assistant coroner Nicholas Rheinberg asked: “Did Jaysley ever talk to you about these problems?”Hort replied: “No. I know she would get a lot of comments. She was stunning. They would all make disgusting comments like ‘I would do this to her’. You can’t react to it because it makes it worse and they would do it even more.”Alison Gerry, representing Beck’s family, asked about evidence Hort gave a service inquiry that women were called “lesbian” or “slag”, and subjected to “vicious gossip”.Hort replied: “You could be walking to the kitchen and they would be like: ‘Come to my room’. You would say: ‘I don’t want to do that’ and they would say: ‘You’re disgusting’.”She added: “If you’re told enough times that you are a slag, that affects you. It makes you feel very low. I would go to work every morning and I would get called fat by my training instructor.“He would say: ‘Look at you, you are fat, are you pregnant?’. You are just sat there humiliated.”George Higgins, a former sergeant who has since left the army, confirmed he had a relationship with Beck but declined to say when it began.Higgins was a trainer at the army foundation college in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, which Beck attended from the age of 16.The inquest heard it was an offence under the Sexual Offences Act for someone in a position of trust to have sexual activity with a person aged under 18 under their care.Higgins, who was eight years older than Beck, confirmed that he was aware of that law but had received “very little” training about it at the time. He also declined to answer whether he had been in relationships with other recruits.The inquest continues.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

This will be highlighted in an appearance by Starmer on Monday intended to show that his administration has begun delivering on its key pledge of “fixing the NHS”.Among the 64% of the 1,888 adults polled who experienced a difficulty:32% had to chase up the results of a test, scan or X-ray.32% had not been told how long they would have to wait for their care or treatment.23% were unaware of who to contact while they waited.20% received an invitation to an appointment after the date had passed.“Admin plays a crucial role in how patients experience health care, yet our research shows many patients find themselves in an admin doom loop, trapped by no-reply emails and unable to access the person or answers they need,” said Jacob Lant, the chief executive of National Voices.People with long-term health conditions, those from ethnic minority backgrounds and poorer people are more likely to have a bad experience of their interaction with the NHS. For example, 75% of those with a chronic illness encountered a problem compared with 57% of those in good health.Julia Cream, a King’s Fund policy fellow and co-author of a report containing the survey results, said the findings “lay bare the day-to-day dysfunction of an NHS that is too often not meeting people’s needs and highlights the deep inequalities people experience when they are trying to access and engage with health services”.Patients and carers interviewed for the report, called Lost in the System, described how the administrative issues they encountered led to them suffering stress, anxiety and other mental health issues. Negative experiences also encouraged a perception of waste in the NHS.The vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs, Dr Victoria Tzortzio-Brown, said: “These issues aren’t the fault of hard-working administrative staff across the NHS, but a symptom of a system that’s chronically overstretched and understaffed, relying on patchy out-of-date processes and digital infrastructure.”GPs and their colleagues “are often involved in chasing up test results, missing letters and appointments with our patients, adding to our bureaucratic workload at a time when need for our care is rocketing”, she said.In a separate survey, 19% of people thought their local hospital was not a safe place to be treated in.When asked why they thought their hospital was unsafe, 27% said a roof could fall in, 26% cited a rodent infestation and 20% said sewage or flooding could occur.The findings emerged in research undertaken by the pollster Savanta for the Liberal Democrats among a representative sample of the UK adult population about the state of the NHS estate.The party’s health and social care spokesperson, Helen Morgan, said: “It’s shocking that so many patients no longer trust the buildings they rely on to get better, fearing the very walls they’re treated in might crumble.“People should only worry about their health not whether the roof will cave in on them.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthKeir StarmerEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

These modified T-cells are grown in a laboratory and then infused back into the patient.Known as CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapy, the approach has proved particularly successful in treatingcertain typesofblood cancers. Next-generation forms of the therapy have been approved for such cancers in countriesincluding the USand UK.However, response rates have been less encouraging in solid tumours, with long-term outcomes unclear.Now researchers have reported the longest known survival after CAR T-cell therapy for an active cancer, revealing a woman who was treated as a child 18 years ago has remained cancer free. Crucially, the therapy was given for a type of solid tumour called neuroblastoma, a rare cancer of the nerve tissue that develops in children.Diagram showing how T-cell therapy worksProf Helen Heslop, co-author of the research from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, says the trial was one of the earliest to use CAR T-cell therapy for cancer.“It’s nice to have such long-term follow-up and to see that even if it was a very early CAR T-cell – and there’s been a lot of work to make them better – we were still able to see a clinical remission that’s been sustained for this long, so that she’s grown up and is leading a normal life,” Heslop says.First patients of pioneering CAR T-cell therapy ‘cured of cancer’Read moreWriting in the journal Nature Medicine, Heslop and colleagues report how they recruited 19 children to take part in a phase 1 clinical trial of CAR T-cell therapy for neuroblastoma between 2004 and 2009.Over seven years that followed the therapy, 12 patients died due to relapsed neuroblastoma. Among the seven that survived beyond this point, five were cancer-free when given the CAR T-cell therapy but had previously been treated for neuroblastoma using other approaches and were at high risk of relapse. All five were disease-free at their last follow-up, between 10 and 15 years after the CAR T-cell therapy, although the team note they may already have been cured when the therapy was administered.The other two surviving patients had cancer that was actively growing or spreading when they received CAR T-cell therapy, but subsequently went into complete remission. One of these patients stopped participating in follow-up sessions eight years after treatment, but the other continued and has remained cancer-free more than 18 years.“She has never required any other therapy and is likely the longest-surviving patient with cancer who received CAR-T therapy,” the team write. “Encouragingly, she has subsequently had two full-term pregnancies with normal infants.”The team add the modified T-cells were still detectable in some patients after more than five years. Heslop says that, while it is not known for sure, it could be that CAR T-cells that persist are able to tackle the cancer should it return.Heslop adds that newer forms of CAR T-cell therapy have showna greater response in recent trials for neuroblastoma, and may also help tackle some types of brain tumour in children.Karin Straathof, the associate professor in tumour immunology at UCL’sCancerInstitute, who was not involved in the new study, says the results are beyond encouraging.“This is really a solid demonstration that in solid cancers you can achieve complete responses, but also what we want really – and particularly for children’s cancers – long-lasting complete responses,” she says.But Straathof says further work is needed, adding: “What we now are trying to focus on is understanding why does it work in some patients and why [it] doesn’t work in others, and what we can learn from that to make better designs of these chimeric antigen receptors.”Explore more on these topicsCancer researchMedical researchCancerHealthChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The event is organised by the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC), whose backers includePaul Marshall, one of the owners of GB News, and Legatum, a private investment company.‘We can’t change our leader again’: Tories despair at Badenoch’s poor PMQs performancesRead moreThe Conservative leader sought to position her party as the true torchbearer in Britain of a new wave of conservatism. In an apparent dig at rightwing rivals, Badenoch said populism became corrosive if it was “anger without the ability to take action”.Badenoch was cheered when she criticised the west’s “inheritance” as “the real poison of leftwing progressivism” and said the conference was part of her party’s renewal of policy and ideas.“Whether it’s pronouns, or DEI, or climate activism, these issues aren’t about kindness – they are about control. We have limited time and every second spent debating what a woman is, is a second lost from dealing with challenges.”She added:“If we throw this opportunity away because of anger or self-doubt, or weakness, our country and all of western civilisation will be lost.”Badenoch was speaking a day beforeJordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist and co-founder of ARC, will interview the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage.While thousands of delegates from dozens of countries are attending, the conference at the ExCeL centre has a strong Christian current running through it.While religion does not explicitly feature in promotional material for the event, there is a religious influence on its direction from Peterson, who draws on the Bible in his work, and his ARC co-founder Philippa Stroud, a committed Christian credited with shaping the Conservative party’s policies during the 2000s.The event’s approach to net zero and the climate crisis ranges from scepticism to outright hostility.There was loud applause for the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, when he used a virtual address to describe the aim of reaching net zero by 2050 as a “sinister goal” and “lunacy”, claiming Britain’s politics in the area had impoverished the country.“I think the agenda might be different here than climate change. It’s certainly been a powerful tool used to grow government power, top-down control and shrink human freedom. This is sinister,” he said.Days after the US vice-president, JD Vance, sparked anger by launching a scathing attack on western European democracies, Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, bemoaned what he said were poll findings that only one in five British adults considered themselves to be very patriotic.Johnson decried what he claimed was a weakening of national identity, saying: “If Americans are not Americans any more and Brits are not Brits any more and Germans are not Germans any more then naturally something else will fill the void.”He doubled down on the hardline “America first” attitude towards Nato and defence relations with previously close allies. “We must each take care of our own house before we take care of the neighbourhood,” he said in an address via a virtual link.Attenders included supporters of Europe’s older conservative movements, as well as the new generation of populist parties in Germany and Austria, Spain’s far-right Vox party, and the Fidesz party of Hungary’s self-styled illiberal democrat, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán.From Britain, attenders included Lois Perry, a former Ukip leader who is heading a new UK branch of a US climate change denial group, Heartland Institute, which has taken funding from oil interests and US Republicans.Peterson has used his own X account to endorse the views of the AfD’s Christine Anderson on the climate crisis, which he described as a “totalitarian lie”. Peterson has also been a vocal supporter of Tommy Robinson, although he appeared to have dialled down his rhetoric in favour of the jailed far-right activist during the conference.Other panellists included Niall Ferguson, a historian who won applause from the hall by endorsing the comments made by Vance at the Munich Security Conference.Also appearing on a panel was the Labour peer and proponent of the socially conservative Blue Labour movement,Maurice Glasman. The peer, who is on ARC’s advisory board, said he agreed with those at the event who believed that capitalism “desecrates humanity” when it treated human beings as commodities.There was laughter when Lord Glasman – who recently appeared on a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, the US Republican strategist and on-off Trump ally – jokingly congratulated the Americans present on “at last finding a king”.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesJordan PetersonClimate science scepticism and denialnewsShareReuse this content"

They also breach Britain’s international obligations to respect the right to claim asylum and guarantee safe routes.“Far from being a drain on this country, migrants from all over the world enrich our society in every sense. Anti-migrant politics will not build a single house, staff a single hospital or raise anyone’s wages. Instead, by echoing its rhetoric, the government is simply fuelling the rise of Reform UK.“We urge Labour’s leaders to recognise that Labour’s only route to victory is to deliver for the vast majority of people. We need to reverse austerity, address the climate crisis, take on the water and energy companies ripping us off, and foster a politics of working-class solidarity.”Ministers have faced previous warnings from within the party and its backers that attempts to try to limit the threat from Reform by talking and acting toughly on migration could backfire.This monthLabour launcheda series of adverts with Reform-style branding and messaging about how many people the government had deported, including a series from a group called UK Migration Updates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shares in Lloyds andClose Brothers, two of the biggest providers of motor finance in the UK, fell as much as 3.8% and 8.5% on Monday afternoon.Reeves had tried to intervene after pressure from lenders, who have claimed that a massive compensation bill could disrupt the motor finance market. The chancellor was later forced to deny that she had caved in to lobbying by the financial sector or that she was working against consumer interests.“There is nothing pro-consumer about making it harder for people to buy an affordable car for their family. That would be bad for working families,”Reeves told reporterson the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.Lobby groups have warned that huge payouts over the scandal – which some analysts say could rival thepayment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling sagaand collectively cost lenders up to £44bn – could push lenders out of business, force them to offer fewer loans or raise interest rates to cover their bills.The scandal ballooned aftera court of appeal judgment in October, which vastly expanded a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigation into motor finance commissions. Theruling determinedthat paying a “secret” commission to car dealers, who had arranged the loans without disclosing the sum and terms of that commission to borrowers, was unlawful.Close Brothers and FirstRand are hoping to overturn that case at the supreme court in a hearing from 1 to 3 April.Gary Greenwood, a banking analyst at Shore Capital, said news of the Treasury’s failed intervention would “come as a disappointment to the market”.“Ultimately, the situation and potential outcome remains subject to significant uncertainty and, although the mood music had arguably been improving, this news highlights that the process will be far from straightforward in its resolution,” he said. “We hope that a common sense ruling can eventually be reached that punishes those that deserve to be punished while sparing those that do not.”The supreme court on Monday also rejected separate intervention attempts by the customer campaign group Consumer Voice, as well as the Financing and Leasing Association (FLA) lobby group, which represents car lenders ranging from large high street banks such as Barclays to the finance arms of manufacturers such as Ford and Volkswagen.The City regulator, theFinancial Conduct Authority, will be allowed to take part in the case. The National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA), which represents car dealerships, has also been granted the right to intervene.Alex Neill, a co-founder of Consumer Voice, said the decision to reject its attempted intervention was “extremely disappointing”.She added: “An overwhelming majority of car finance customers have told us they are concerned about the practice of dealers being paid commission. And it’s little wonder, as people trust their car dealer to act in their best interests when arranging finance. Yet, this trust is clearly being abused by some dealers in the market.”The Treasury and NFDA were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFinancial sectorRachel ReevesClose BrothersUK supreme courtConsumer affairsBankingAutomotive industryShareReuse this content"

But in the past few days Spudman has been posting about his problems with Tamworth council in Staffordshire, which he says wants to move the pitch he has occupied for 22 years.“I have lost my pitch to a flower bed,” he said. “A flower bed is more important than me. They have offered to ‘move’ me. I don’t want to be moved … I want to stand on my pitch. That’s where I’ve built my business, that’s where everyone knows I am.”Spudman also talks in his post about contracts being changed which mean he has to reapply every 12 months.“I feel so, just destroyed, by this … a flower bed on my pitch and ‘we’ll move you somewhere’,” he said.There are “a thousand other towns who would love the footfall we bring”.Spudman said the support since posting had been amazing, including other towns offering a pitch.A petition on Change.org calls for the council to reinstate his original pitch. On Monday afternoonit had reached more than 65,000 signatures.Tamworth council said street food vendors were being temporarily moved for regeneration work and that Spudman would be able to return to a pitch just a few metres from his current one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That scheme, originally designed to help smooth online shopping, is being revoked after it emerged that the number of shipments under the “de minimis” rules had ballooned to more than 1bn, valued at $54.5bn by 2023 – most of them from China or Hong Kong via firms includingSheinand Temu.“You are looking at an increase of $30 to $50 per consignment [group of parcels],” said Brad Ashton at the advisory firm RSM. “It is creating a perfect storm for online retailers putting goods into the US market. It has a lot of the hallmarks of Brexit in terms of its potential impact on small traders.Businesses will see their margins eroded because costs will increase. We may get to a point where the changes make a UK business uncompetitive in selling to the US.Brad Ashton, RSM“Businesses will see their margins eroded because costs will increase. We may get to a point where the changes make a UK business uncompetitive in selling to the US.”The widespread use of Chinese factories for many British brands, particularly in fashion, means businesses such asAsosand Boohoo will be drawn in, as well as many UK independent marketplace sellers.It will not just affect goods made inChinaand then sent from the UK, but potentially a much wider array, as any package containing even one product made in China may have to pay import tax and pass through customs checks, further increasing costs, according to experts.There is also an expectation that the de minimis rules will eventually be scrapped for all imports, no matter their origin.About $5bn worth of parcels were exported to the US from the UK under de minimis rules in 2021, according to aCongressional Research Service analysisof data from US Customs and Border Protection. About 80% of that was estimated to be related to online retail, with fashion likely to be a large proportion of it.Chris White, at the logistics company Fulfilmentcrowd, said that during the brief period when the rules were in place in early February, one-third of the parcels it shipped to the US from the UK were found to be of Chinese origin and subject to the new taxes.Fast-fashion specialists Asos and Boohoo sell about £300m of clothing a year to the US. Both are already struggling to compete with the rise of Shein and high street retailers, which have revived after the Covid pandemic. John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, said Asos and Boohoo would have to “adjust prices or take a view on [the] profitability of operating in the US”.As well as the higher tax charges, customs checks required after the rule change will add as much as two days to the processing of orders, making UK retailers less competitive with US-based operators on the speed of delivery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

White said that during the period when the new rules were in place, similar parcels were loaded with different levels of duty as local customs officers made different decisions.He said a further element of the rule change might be to expose brands that were “trading on an image of being British or European” as being “made in China and not Savile Row”, potentially damaging their appeal.There would be “lots of crossed fingers and puzzled faces” over the changes in legislation, with retailers potentially opening more US warehousing or, longer term, to switch sources of supply, White added.Boohoo closed its US warehouse earlier this year, and Asos is scheduled to close its facility there in November. However, a reversal could be on the cards if the de minimis rules are confirmed. Many fast-fashion companies have already diversified their supply chains – making more in India, Bangladesh or Turkey. Trump’s tax changes could accelerate this further.Shein is reportedly incentivising Chinese suppliers to set up in Vietnam, according to a report by Bloomberg.It is not clear when the new rules might be implemented as the US tries to put the technology and workforce in place to handle the new system. Experts say it could take weeks or months.While there is a chance that Trump will change his mind, as he has done on tariffs with Canada and Mexico, no business can bet on which way the US might jump.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeRetail industryE-commerceTrump administrationSmall businessChinaeBaynewsShareReuse this content"

I know there is a campaign being waged, including by her legal team, to protest her innocence, and including some of my parliamentary colleagues.“What I would say to those campaigners and to anyone else who’s involved in the court of public opinion, as it were, is that there is a judicial process to follow.”He said people who thought there had been an unsafe or wrong conviction should “consider those grieving parents who’ve lost their babies”, and pursue legal routes to have her case looked at again because it was “not a political campaign, it’s a legal process”.He added: “I still think that waging a campaign in this way in the wake of these convictions is not the right thing to do.“Until I’m told otherwise by the courts of this land, then I continue to stand by the view that there’s been a fair conviction here until the courts determine otherwise; that’s how justice in this country works.”Letby’s lawyer, Mark McDonald, has submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission for her convictions to be referred back to the court of appeal, and has called for Streeting to pause the ongoing public inquiry chaired by Lady Justice Thirlwall.Responding to Streeting’s comments, McDonald said: “Although I sympathise with the position Wes Streeting finds himself in, there is now overwhelming and compelling evidence that Lucy Letby’s convictions are unsafe. There is now no point in having a public inquiry that only focuses onLucy Letby.“If the numerous international experts are right, there was a systematic failure on the neonatal unit and, unless this is properly looked at, millions of pounds will be spent on an inquiry that will never get to the truth. The SoS [secretary of state] needs to be ahead of this and not wait for the system to collapse under his watch.”Earlier this monthan international panel of expertsfound no evidence Letby had murdered or harmed any of the babies she was accused of attacking. The senior Conservative MP David Davis described the case as “one of the major injustices of modern times”, as the panel presented its findings at a press conference.The panel, which includedProf Neena Modi, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, concluded that the newborns Letby was charged with harming had suffered a catalogue of “bad medical care” or deteriorated as a result of natural causes at the Countess of Chester hospital in north-west England.Separately, Streeting told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there was “a hell of a lot more to do” in theNHSafter meeting a manifesto pledge to deliver 2m extra appointments. He denied this figure was affected by the previous Conservative government’s policies.He said: “We’re reporting back to reassure the public that politics can make a difference, that government can be a force for good, and that this government is delivering on the promiseswe made to the country.”Streeting added that he was open to “serious proposals” for private investment in the NHS, including using independent hospitals to bring down waiting lists.He said: “I certainly want more patient choice, more patient power, more patient control over where they’re seen, how they’re treated, the nature of their appointments. The NHS should be as responsive as any other organisation that we use.”But he said he intended to learn from the “enormous cost” that the NHS continued to bear from the previous Labour government’s PFI deals. “I think there is a role for private investment, but the terms of those arrangements, that’s where you’ve got to tread really carefully.”Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyWes StreetingCrimeNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Nineteen state attorneys general have sued to block the Trump administration’s policy of allowing political appointees and “special government employees” to the access that department’s payment systems.Doge incursions into the US tax collection agency come as the agency is preparing to lay off thousands of workers hired by the previous Biden administration.Last week, Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said last week he hoped to upgrade the technology at the IRS. Bessent told Fox Business he wanted to improve collections, privacy and customer service.“I don’t think there’s anyone, anyone in the country, who thinks that they – that the IRS has achieved its potential in either of those three,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Musk and his team have 120 days before they are required to make federal employment declarations.According to a draft of the IRS memorandum obtained by the Post, Kliger is set to work at the IRS for that period, though his employment can be renewed for the same duration.The memo said the agreement is for Kliger to keep any tax return information confidential, to keep it safe from unauthorized access and to delete it from his records after he finishes his term at the IRS, the outlet said.According to a Government Accountability Office report, the government spent around $90bn in 2019 on information technology, with most of that spent on operating and maintaining legacy systems that are in some cases half a century old and vulnerable to hackers.IRS systems are among the oldest – many were built using computer coding language from the 1960s – so overhauling the IT is broadly in line with the Doge team mandate to modernize and synchronize systems across departments.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, however, he was resting and we knew that he wouldn’t call.”The pope held several meetings on Friday morning before being taken to hospital, including with Mark Thompson, the chief executive of CNN News, which later reported that Francis was “mentally alert but struggling to speak for extended periods due to breathing difficulties”.The pope, who has suffered ill-health in recent years, was also admitted to hospital in March 2023 with acute bronchitis. After being discharged, he said: “I am still alive.” He was readmitted to the Gemelli for health checks in June that year and again in February 2024 after suffering from what he said was “a bit of a cold”.Francis had part of his lung removed in his early 20s while training to be a priest in his native Argentina. He also underwent a colon operation in June 2021.He has often been seen in a wheelchair or with a walking stick as a result of a sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem. He hit his chin on his nightstand, reportedly after a fall, in early December and he injured his right forearm after falling at his Casa Santa Marta residence in January. He also stumbled after his walking stick snapped while entering the Vatican’s auditorium on 1 February.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyEuropeReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

His post linked to a website where the digital coin could be bought, the domain name of which included Milei’s popular catchphrase “long live freedom”.“The world wants to invest inArgentina,” Milei added in the post to his more than 3.8 million followers.The token immediatelysoared in value, from almost zero at the time of its launch to nearly $5, before plummeting to under $1,according to trading sites. Argentina’sfintech chambersaid that the case could amount to a “rug pull” – a scam which sees cryptocurrency rapidly inflated, or “pumped”, before crashing while insiders “dump” their stake, making the tokens worthless. Other economists and crypto specialists said the digital asset could be a fraud or Ponzi scheme.Milei deleted his post hours later, saying he was “not aware of the details of the project”, but the scandal has nonetheless sparked a political firestorm, and the federal prosecutor’s office will reportedly now examine whether the president engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties.A group of lawyers filed fraud complaints in the criminal court on Sunday, saying they “criminally denounce the president of the Argentine nation,Javier Milei, because we believe that he is a fundamental participant in the development, execution and planning of the mega-scam related to the launch of the $Libra token”.Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs,told the Associated Pressthat he saw an illicit association to commit “an indeterminate number of frauds” in the episode. “Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential,” he said.Opposition lawmakers, meanwhile, are calling forMilei’s impeachment. “This scandal, which embarrasses us on an international scale, requires us to launch an impeachment request against the president,” said lawmaker Leandro Santoro, a member of the opposition coalition.Myriam Bregman, a prominent socialist leader and former presidential candidate, said “Milei is the one who must answer to the Congress. We want to know, step by step, who has benefited from it and how. This isnot the first timehe has been involved in something like that, but it is aggravated by his current role as president.”Former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner wrote on social media: “You promoted a private cryptocurrency from your official X account, created by who knows who. You inflated its value taking advantage of your presidential investiture. And, to top it all off, you say that you were ‘unfamiliar’! … From self-proclaimed ‘global leader’ to CRYPTO SCAMMER.”Latin American leaders also weighed in, with Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, saying that “it is extremely serious if confirmed, especially in terms of a president’s powers to promote something private”.The incident has prompted comparisons with the US president, Donald Trump, who last month launched the $Trump memecoin, which alsosurged before crashing.Milei retaliated to the criticism by blaming his opponents, whom he called “filthy rats of the political caste”, and saying they wanted to “take advantage of this situation to do harm”. The presidential office said that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency’s development and decided to remove the social media post to limit further exposure. It added that the anti-corruption office had been instructed tostart an investigation.Political analyst Marcelo García, of the Horizon Engage political risk consultancy firm, said Milei and his government need to “contain the crisis by giving a clear explanation of what happened” in order to prevent the incident from “escalating to a credibility crisis that could discourage the largest investment community”.Cryptocurrency hasexploded in Argentinain recent years, as disillusioned savers sought to keep their money outside traditional banks amid a decades-long economic crisis and soaring inflation rates.Analysts have warned that the crisis could damage Milei’s reputation as a custodian of economic recovery – and an anti-corruption president – ahead of midterm elections later this year.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaCryptocurrenciesJavier MileiE-commerceAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Brafman allegedly fired 17 times, striking one victim in the left shoulder and grazing the other’s left forearm.While in custody, Brafman spontaneously told detectives that while he was driving his truck, “he saw two Palestinians and shot and killed both”, arrest documents said.Law enforcement officials did not confirm if the victims were in fact Palestinians andthe Miami Heraldreported that they were actually two vacationing Israelis, naming them as Ari Rabey and his father.Facebook posts after the shooting show Rabey at Miami’s Jackson memorial hospital and his Hyundai with several bullet holes and markings.The outlet reported that as of Monday afternoon, Brafman, the alleged shooter, was being held at the Miami-Dade correctional center on two counts of attempted second-degree murder.Further complicating the incident, one of the injured men reportedly posted “death to the Arabs” in a message on social media after the shooting. “My father and I went through a murder attempt against antisemitic background,”he wrote.The Council on American-Islamic Relations’Floridachapter has called for federal hate crime charges in the shooting.“It is deeply ironic and telling that both the alleged pro-Israel perpetrator and the pro-Israel victim in the Miami Beach shooting reportedly hold racist anti-Palestinian views,” said Cair’s national executive director, Nihad Awad,on X.“This just the latest example of the hate targeting the Palestinian-American community in this country and Palestinians in their homeland.

At least seven prosecutors have resigned rather than comply with the request.According to WNBC, Adams held a Zoom call on Sunday with at least three of his deputies who expressed their intention to resign. The Democratic mayor is facing mounting calls for his own resignation, first over corruption charges filed last summer, and now over their resignations.Adams has pleaded not guilty, denied any wrongdoing and rejected calls for his resignation. He has also indicated he believes the charges were brought in retaliation for criticizing the Biden administration’s immigration policies, blaming them for the city’s struggles with absorbing tens of thousands of new arrivals.Adams has reportedly agreed to some cooperation with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) immigration agents, including allowing federal authorities to restart operations on Rikers Island, which holds the city’s largest jail.The mayor has also rejected accusations that dropping the federal charges against him would amount to making him a political prisoner of theTrump administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am committed to US president Trump’s plan for the creation of a different Gaza.”The remarks come after a report by Sky News Arabia on Sunday night thatHamaswas prepared to hand over control of Gaza to its West Bank-based rival, the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority (PA), following pressure from mediator Egypt.The broadcaster said, citing Egyptian sources, that the Palestinian militant group had agreed to the establishment of a temporary committee to overseethe reconstruction of the territory,which has been levelled by Israeli airstrikes over 16 months of war.Netanyahu’s latest comments will weigh heavily over the future of the month-old truce after italmost collapsed last weekfollowing news of Trump’s surprise plan for the US to “take over” Gaza and“relocate” its 2.3 million people to countries such as Egypt and Jordan.International humanitarian law experts say the proposal amounts to ethnic cleansing.Netanyahu’s defence minister, Israel Katz, announced the establishment of a new agency late on Monday to oversee the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians fromGaza.A three-month-old ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah is also in doubt ahead of Tuesday’s deadline for Israel to withdraw remaining troops from its northern neighbour.In a briefing on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson, Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, told reporters that Israeli forces would remain in five “strategic locations” over the border in order to protect nearby Israeli towns and villages, an announcement met with frustration by Lebanese officials.Israel’s security cabinet is set to decide on Monday evening whether to send a delegation to the Qatari capital, Doha, to discuss the difficult second stage of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. The second phase is scheduled to begin in early March, and would involve the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, effectively ending the war. The third phase is supposed to address the exchange of bodies, a reconstruction plan for Gaza, and future governance.Donald Trump’s Gaza plan: the key takeawaysRead moreAccording to Israeli media, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich’s far-right Religious Zionism party, which was opposed to the ceasefire, is still threatening to collapse Netanyahu’s coalition if Israel does not return to fighting when the first stage of the truce expires.It is widely believed at home and abroad that Netanyahu, afraid that losing office will leave him more vulnerable to corruption charges, has prioritised the survival of his government over a hostage deal.While Israeli public opinion isunlikely to swaygovernment decision making on the war, protests were held across the country on Monday to mark 500 days since Israeli hostages were kidnapped and taken to Gaza in the Hamas attack of October 2023 that triggered the conflict. In Jerusalem, dozens of demonstrators marched to Netanyahu’s residence, chanting slogans and carrying banners that read “Home Now”, before meeting lawmakers at the Knesset.Captives have been released in batches of three or four in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees on a weekly basis since 19 January, but about 45 more Israelis and foreign nationals are not eligible for release until the second stage of the agreement.Israel is preparing to receive the bodies of four hostages from Gaza on Thursday and is working on bringing back six living hostages in the next scheduled release on Saturday, an Israeli security official said on Monday. If the handovers are successful, the timeline for the start of the second stage of the truce will be moved up by a week.Netanyahu has repeatedly publicly embraced Trump’s plan for the US to take ownership of Gaza and redevelop the coastal strip as a resort, telling reporters on Sunday during a visit to Israel by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, that the government was “working closely” alongside Washington to implement the Trump proposal.The US president’s vision for Gaza has been flatly rejected by the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world, which is now scrambling to come up with alternatives.Saudi Arabia is hosting a summit for delegations from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Friday, and the Arab League will convene to discuss the reconstruction of Gaza and governance options on 27 February.Reuters reported on Monday that the EU is planning to tell Israel next week that Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza should be ensured a dignified return and that Europe will contribute to rebuilding the shattered territory.In Lebanon, the IDF said the decision to maintain five positions in the country was a temporary measure that was approved by the US-led body monitoring the truce. The ceasefire was extended for another three weeks after the first deadline at the end of January.Lebanon’s president, Joseph Aoun, said in a statement that Lebanese officials were working diplomatically to achieve the Israeli withdrawal, and that he “will not accept that a single Israeli remains on Lebanese territory”. Under the agreement, the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers are supposed to patrol a buffer zone after the Israeli pullout.Also on Monday, the Israeli military said it had killed Muhammad Shaheen, a Hamas leader, in an airstrike in Sidon in southern Lebanon. The attack was the deepest Israeli strike on Lebanese territory since the ceasefire went into effect in November, freezing a two-month-old Israeli ground operation. Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel began trading cross-border fire on 8 October 2023, a day after the Hamas attack that began the war in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

He slowed down,he told Reuters, “because there were many people, some running, some scared, and some were shouting for help”.It was then that he noticed that one of the people at the scene had a knife. “I immediately understood what was happening – there were people on the ground bleeding, and this person was waving the knife in a threatening manner.”Al-Halabi sprang into action. “I immediately drove toward him and hit him with my car. The good thing is that the impact wasn’t too strong, thank God,” he said. “I mean, the goal of hitting him with the car was just to neutralise him or stop what he was doing. The goal wasn’t to harm anyone.”View image in fullscreenAlaaeddin al-Halabi.Photograph: ReutersIn the confusion that followed, al-Halabi said he was shocked to see some in the crowd turn on him,telling the newspaper Kleinen Zeitungthat he locked himself into his car as some people began to hit his vehicle. Speaking to Reuters, he said: “People attacked me after the incident – people on the street thought I was carrying out an attack like what happened in Germany.”The attack came days after a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seekerdrove a carinto a trade union demonstration in neighbouring Germany,killing a two-year-old girland her mother as well as injuring 37 others. It was the fifth high-profile attack involving migrants to Germany in the past nine months, leading politicians to seize onmigration as a talking pointbefore snap elections on 23 February.Saturday’s attack in Austria killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others, all of whom were believed to have been targeted randomly.Speaking to reporters, the police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio later said al-Halabi’s actions had played a role in halting the attack. “It was probably a heroic act, yes. It prevented something worse from happening,” he said.The sentiment was echoed by the mayor of Villach, Günther Albel. “We are very grateful to the man who intervened selflessly, courageously and decisively and thus prevented something even worse from happening, as well as to the rapid deployment of the police,” he saidin a statement.The state governor, Peter Kaiser, also thanked al-Halabi, saying that his intervention “shows how closely terrorist evil but also human good can be united in one and the same nationality”.As media across Austria described al-Halabi as a hero, the 42-year-old brushed off the label. “People look at me as a hero, but I don’t see it that way,” he said. “I say to people: ‘Please, if something like this happens again, you have to do something. You can’t just stand there, take photos and film videos.’”As Austria reeled from the stabbing, rightwing politicians sought toreinforce their hardline viewson migration. Late last year, Austria was among the dozen European countriesthat suspendedthe processing of asylum applications from Syrians after thefall of the Assad regimein Damascus. Officials in Austria said they were preparing a “repatriation and deportation” programme to the country.The attack was the country’s second deadly extremist attack in recent years. In November 2020, a man who had previously attempted to join the Islamic State group carried out arampage in Vienna, armed with an automatic rifle and a fake explosive vest, killing four people before he was fatally shot by police.In August, authorities foiled plansfor an attackon a Taylor Swift concert that was inspired by the Islamic State group.In the wake of Saturday’s attack, those who weighed in included the Free Syrian Community of Austria, a support group for Syrians, who expressed its deepest condolences to the victims’ families and sought to distance the suspect from the tens of thousands of Syrians who live in the country peacefully.“We all had to flee Syria, our home country, because we were no longer safe there – no one left their country voluntarily. We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,” it said on social media. “We would like to emphasise: anyone who causes strife and disturbs the peace of society does not represent the Syrians who have sought and received protection here.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaEuropeIslamic StatenewsShareReuse this content"

The militia faced little resistance in its latest march.One Bukavu resident, Blaise Byamungu, said the had been “abandoned by all the authorities and [taken] without any loyalist force”.“Is the government waiting for them to take over other towns to take action? It’s cowardice,” he said.The rebels marched to the governor’s office over the weekend. Bernard Byamungu, a leader of the group, stood in front of the office and promised to change the status quo. “We are going to clean up the disorder left over from the old regime,” Byamungu said to a small cheering crowd, telling them they had been living in a “jungle”.M23 is one of more than 100 armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to the DRC after taking part in the 1994 genocide inRwandathat targeted Tutsis.The DRC, the US and other countries have all accused Rwanda of backing M23, which the Rwandan government denies. UN expertssay Rwanda’s army is in “de facto control”of the group.The Burundian army had been supporting the Congolese army to protect Bukavu. M23’s capture of the city marks an unprecedented expansion of territory by the militia since it resurfaced in 2022. It also further risks escalating the conflict into a regional war.Almost 3,000 people were killed and a similar number injured in the fight for Goma.Fighting this year has worsened the humanitarian crisis in eastern DRC. It has destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters around Goma and Minova, leaving about 350,000 internally displaced people without protection,according to the UN.On Saturday, the Congo River Alliance, a coalition of militias including M23, said it was committed to “defending” the people of Bukavu. “We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,” the rebels’ spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said.The DRC government urged calm.“It calls on the population of Bukavu to stay at home and not expose themselves to avoid being targeted by the occupying forces,” the communications ministry said on X.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandanewsShareReuse this content"

On Rupert’s death, instead ofthe evenly split family trust previously planned, power would go solely to his older son.He lost his effort to hand the reins to Lachlanin December last year.Detailing the many power struggles within the family, Coppins writes that one former News Corp employee claimed Lachlan had referred to the media side of the business as “ShitCo” (a claim a spokesperson for Lachlan denied to Coppins) – a possible echo of RoyCo, the fictional company created by patriarch Logan Roy in Succession, commonly regarded as having been inspired by the Murdochs.When discussing why the battle for succession saw Rupert pit James and Lachlan against each other, leaving Prudence and Elisabeth on the sidelines, the Atlantic piece quotes James calling his father a “misogynist”.For years, as power and control waxed and waned between the male Murdochs over various parts of the organisation, there had been reports of James’sunease with News Corp’s reporting of the climate crisisand Fox News’s apparentembrace of rightwing conspiracy theories. Coppins’ interview details all of it, including James’ discomfort with the company’s support of Brexit andof Donald Trump, andprevarications on Charlottesville.Coppins writes that James “had come to see Fox News as a blight on his family’s name and a menace to American democracy” and that “drastic changes were needed to save the companies from the consequences of his father’s reckless mismanagement”.James reportedly told him: “If lying to your audience is how you juice ratings … a good culture wouldn’t do that.”In 2010 Rupert invited his children to a family counselling retreat with a specialist therapist. A leak to Vanity Fair described it as a “loving, supportive” experience.But the truth, Coppins writes, is that the counselling session “devolved into posturing, gaslighting, and recriminations”. James tells him: “It was a car crash. Everyone was more alienated from each other at the end.”After the Guardian in 2011revealedthat Murdoch’s News of the World Sunday UK paper illegally hacked the phone of the missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, James called his father to say the tabloid should be shut down, Coppins writes.Rupert “was not happy” and “instructed his son not to say a word to the press, James recalled. He’d be in London soon.”James was apparently alarmed and saw his father looking “frail and confused – nothing like the decisive, towering figure he’d long admired and tangled with, according to Coppins. “He remembers calling Lachlan in Australia and fretting, ‘Dude, our old man has gone crazy. This is terrible.’”It was Australia’s 2019-20 bushfires that prompted a rare public sign of the split.In a statement, James and his wife, Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch, shared their frustration with News Corp and Fox’s coverage.“They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary,” their spokesperson said in a statement at the time.Later in 2020, Jamesresigned from the News Corp board.How departure of James laid bare the Murdoch family riftsRead moreCoppins’ interview traces the relationship between James and his father as it disintegrated.By the time of the court battle, “James and Rupert had barely spoken in years,” the piece says, then detailing a handwritten note from Rupert delivered along with legal documents:Dear James, still time to talk? Love, Dad. P.S.: Love to see my grandchildren one day.“James, who could not remember the last time Rupert had taken an interest in his grandchildren, didn’t bother to reply,” Coppins notes.Coppins also describes a series of “withering questions” put to James by Rupert’s lawyer in a nearly five-hour session at a Manhattan law office. .According to the Atlantic, the questions included: “Have you ever done anything successful on your own?” “Why were you too busy to say ‘Happy birthday’ to your father when he turned 90?” “Does it strike you that, in your account, everything that goes wrong is always somebody else’s fault?”The lawyer also referred to James and and his sisters as “white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies”.James, Coppins writes, realised Rupert, who was seated silently, was texting the questions to the lawyer. “How fucking twisted is that?” he asks Coppins.At the end of the session Rupert left the law office conference room without saying a word, Coppins writes.View image in fullscreenPrudence, James and Elisabeth Murdoch arrive at court for the hearing on the matter of succession of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire in Reno, Nevada, September 2024.Photograph: Alan Devall/ReutersAt Thanksgiving 2024, after the trial had finished, James and his sisters wrote a letter to their father saying they missed and loved him.“Put an end to this destructive judicial path so that we can have a chance to heal as a collaborative and loving family,” they pleaded, according to the Atlantic.Rupert, the piece goes on, said they should contact his lawyers if they wanted to talk to him.The Atlantic piece also goes some way to answering the tantalising question of whether the Murdochs watched or admired Succession.Coppins writes that James only watched one episode and “found it too painful. But other members of the Murdoch clan were obsessed with the show; certain scenes and storylines seemed un­cannily true to life”.A spokesperson for Rupert and Lachlan described James’s claims in the interview as a “litany of falsehoods … from someone who no longer works for the companies but still benefits from them financially”.Last week, New York Times Magazine reporters scoured through 3,000 pages of evidence from the trial, and reported thatthe trust will expire in 2030. At that point, or when Rupert dies, the siblings have to work out what to do next.Coppins writes that James, who “quotes Shakespeare and cites Roman imperial history in casual conversation”, is now struggling with the question: “How did we let it come to this?”“His 93-year-old father will, despite his most fervent wishes, die one day,” he writes. “And when he does, he will leave behind a family at war with itself.”Explore more on these topicsJames MurdochRupert MurdochNews CorporationLachlan MurdochAustralian medianewsShareReuse this content"

Now a new documentary lets her tell her storyStevie ChickMon 17 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 10.57 ESTShareIn August 2019, the New York film-maker Eva Aridjis Fuentes embarked on a cab ride that would change her life. Though her driver sported sunglasses and a turban, Aridjis Fuentes thought she looked eerily familiar. “The driver played Neil Young’s Harvest album in its entirety; we sang Heart of Gold together. I asked if she’d ever seen Neil play. She said: ‘Oh no, my concert days are long over’. So then I asked if she’d ever seen Q Lazzarus.”Q Lazzarus was the stage name of Diane Luckey, a singer from the 80s whose song Goodbye Horses had soundtracked Buffalo Bill’s infamous nipple-tweaking scene inThe Silence of the Lambs. The track became a cult classic, covered by Bloc Party’s Kele Okereke, Deftones’ Chino Moreno and MGMT among others. Q vanished in the mid-90s, with many, including friends and collaborators, believing she was dead. But Aridjis Fuentes – who regularly playedGoodbye Horsesat club nights – had a hunch that Luckey herself was driving this taxicab. “She looked in the rearview, said, ‘Oh, I’ve heard of her’, but abruptly changed the subject,” Aridjis Fuentes remembers. Later, though, the driver admitted: “I’m Q.”View image in fullscreenHeart of gold … Diane Luckey AKA Q Lazzarus photographed in the 80s.Photograph: Images courtesy of Sacred Bones RecordsThat night, for the first time in 15 years, Q dreamed she was performing. She called Aridjis Fuentes the next morning, telling her: “My dead mama raised me not to ignore signs from God.” Thus began a beautiful friendship, one that yielded Aridjis Fuentes’ documentary, Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus, which will be released this spring. It will be accompanied by a soundtrack album that will finally shine a light on Q’s voluminous catalogue of unheard music. Tragically, Q, who died in 2022, is no longer around to tell her story herself, but, as she says in the documentary, she collaborated with Aridjis Fuentes on the movie to explain “the truth: what went wrong and why I disappeared”.Diane Luckey was raised in New Jersey, a Baptist chorister whose sister Abbie says in the documentary “always wanted to be Rod Stewart”. Against her parents’ wishes, she relocated to New York aged 18, making money there as a session singer and cab driver. By the mid-80s, she was performing at clubs such as the Pyramid, Boy Bar and Limelight, accompanied by a drum machine, guitarist Bill Garvey and dancer Danny Z, AKA Dan Agren. “In New York clubs back then,anythingwent,” says Agren. “Rampant drug use, people having sex in the corners. I was often nude on stage, wearing handcuffs, and Q would drag me around. I’d shout, ‘Honey, you’re breaking my arms!’ It was like she waspossessed.”Agren and Q lived together in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen. “Q was very protective,” says Agren. “If I got harassed in the street, she’d get right their faces. She was a big woman. She was not afraid. A couple of people made the mistake of trying to rob her when she driving her taxi, and she beat the crap out of them.” One night, the directorJonathan Demmehailed Q’s cab; after hearing her sing at the wheel, he handed her his card. “She came home that night and said, ‘I have a feeling. This man is forreal,’” remembers Agren.Demme used Q’s song Candle Goes Away in his 1986 movie Something Wild and, two years later, tapped her for another track forMarried to the Mob. Garvey had penned Goodbye Horses for himself. “But the way Bill sang it, it would have gone nowhere,” says Agren. “Q gave it her melodic harmonies, turning it into her opus.” She recorded Goodbye Horses at 4am in a single take, after an 18-hour taxicab shift. Her androgynous, shadowy and soulful vocal raised the track’s new wave melancholy to sublime heights. Realising its brief appearance in Married to the Mob hardly did the song justice, Demme foregrounded it in The Silence of the Lambs three years later. “That’s when the songreallytook off,” says Agren. “But by then, Q was in London.”View image in fullscreenGoodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus poster.Photograph: Courtesy of Sacred Bones RecordsQ believed the Demme connection would snare her a recording contract. But, says Aridjis Fuentes, “the record labels told her they couldn’t market a black woman singing rock.” So Q bolted for London, where she recruited local musicians for her new, heavy metal direction, met boyfriend-manager Richard, and began dabbling in drugs. She slogged away for several years, but London proved another dead end. However, Demme then offered another opportunity: singing Talking Heads’ Heaven on screen in his 1993 Aids dramaPhiladelphia.Demme then invited Q to sing at the movie’s premieres in New York, Philadelphia and Washington DC. But Q was bumped off its soundtrack album for, she claimed, a piano performance by star Denzel Washington’s wife. The disappointment hit hard, as did her breakup with Richard. “It was incredibly painful for her,” says Aridjis Fuentes. “She had tried so hard, and had so much talent. But nobody would give her a chance.”“She was so unhappy,” sighs Agren. “She hardly got out of bed. She wanted to go off the deep end and just do drugs endlessly.” Q’s account of these years in Aridjis Fuentes’ documentary makes for harrowing viewing, a gruelling descent into crack cocaine use, homelessness and prison. Miraculously, though, she eventually broke out of this downward spiral; by the 00s, she had married and was raising a son, James Luckey, in Staten Island.Demons conquered, Q kept her past hidden from her new friends, and even James. Goodbye Horses’ remarkable afterlife made that tricky, however. “Mom never talked about her career,” James remembers, “but I figured it out myself. I didn’t realise what a big deal it was until I heard [Goodbye Horses] in Clerks II, and Family Guy, and Grand Theft Auto IV. I told schoolfriends: ‘My mom’s a rock star!’ She overheard and said, ‘Stop telling people about me!’”“Q was an extremely proud woman,” says Aridjis Fuentes. “She didn’t want people from her old life to know what happened to her, and didn’t want her new friends to know about her past. It takes a lot of strength to bury all that, to never mention you were a singer, to not even listen to your music.” By the time they began work on the documentary, however, James was graduating college. “Q said, ‘I don’t need to take care of him any more, why not go back to my music?’”With her son’s help, she began the slow process of chasing performance royalties for Goodbye Horses. She gave Aridjis Fuentes a sack of demo tapes, spanning her work with Garvey, material she wrote with Agren and rock tracks cut with her London band, for the documentary soundtrack. It’s about to be released as an album, the first time any of her music other than Goodbye Horses has seen official release. “She always wanted to put out a record of her music,” says Aridjis Fuentes, “one she would finally get royalties from.”View image in fullscreen‘My mom’s a rock star! … Q Lazzarus performing in London.Photograph: Images courtesy of Sacred Bones RecordsFor the documentary’s climax, Q and Aridjis Fuentes planned a New York concert, with Q performing material from throughout her career; her London bandmates were to back her, reuniting for the first time since her disappearance. But it wasn’t to be: in July 2022, Q broke her leg, and then died of sepsis while in hospital. “This infection had taken over her whole body, and nobody had noticed at the hospital or at the rehab,” Aridjis Fuentes recalls. “It was already too late for them to save her.” The director was devastated, having lost “this extremely magical, special person, who’d become one of my closest friends”.“She died the way Black women die when they go to hospital,” adds James. “Through neglect. Look at the data. How many Black women die in surgery or during childbirth, compared with other races? It’s an ugly truth.”Q’s passing changed the tone of Aridjis Fuentes’ film. “I had been playing with the whole ‘Lazarus’ thing – chronicling her rise, fall and her resurrection, this happy ending where she’s back from the dead,” Aridjis Fuentes says. The production turned into “a nightmare”, she adds. “We had some big-name producers involved, but when Q passed away, they disappeared. I wound up having to do a Kickstarter to finish the movie.”Still, Aridjis Fuentes’ movie is a moving and honest triumph. And making it granted Q some long-deserved joy. In those final years, she made peace with her past and was again chasing her dream. “The thought of releasing the album, playing the concert, finally getting her music heard, rejuvenated her,” James says. “It was a true Lazarus effect. She was ahead of her time, and I’m just glad people will now be able to truly hear her music.”Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzaruswill be in select cinemas from 7 March, andreleased on streaming in April. The soundtrack album is released on Sacred Bones on 21 February.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsPop and rockJonathan DemmefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the kind of gushing tribute paid to things that turn out to be lifeless and humourless. ButRaMell Ross’s Oscar-nominated filmNickel Boys, adapted from the novel byColson Whitehead, really is beautiful; it creates beauty and even a kind of complex, defiant joy from generational pain and trauma caused by racism in the postwar United States. Of all the films on thismixed best picture nomination list, Nickel Boys – produced by Dede Gardner, Joslyn Barnes and Jeremy Kleiner– is the film which I’d most like to win, perhaps partly because as a film about the African American experience it for some reason isn’t in the conversation in the way Barry Jenkins’sMoonlightonce was.Gorgeously shot byJomo Frayand designed byNora Mendis, the film follows the fortunes of Elwood, played by Ethan Herisse, a smart young black boy in 1960s Tallahassee, Florida, who gets thrown into a brutal reform school called The Nickel Academy (based on thenotorious real-life Dozier School). This is a racist tyranny where the black kids are beaten and often killed, in which case they are secretly buried and officially described as “runaways” – and all because Elwood innocently hitched a ride in a stolen car on his way to a technical academy for which he had been recommended on account of his academic promise. A nauseous irony re-routes him to a different institution.In the Nickel, he befriends another kid, a kindred spirit called Turner, played by Brandon Wilson, the only person he can open up to and discuss the four ways out of the Nickel: age out (it’s for juveniles); serve your time (difficult, if you are deemed not to have submissively “reformed”), die – or run.From other perspectives,Nickel Boyscould look like a bromance (and it is an amazingly potent study in friendship) or like a particularly tragic kind of coming-of-age film, or a study in survivor guilt or even like a particular type of historical mystery with those flash-forward scenes in which one of the boys, now adult, is living a complicated, difficult life, brooding over online news stories concerning bodies found in the Nickel’s grounds. And now, enigmatically, the camera is just behind the character’s head, less an embodiment of his consciousness and more a kind of recording angel.But Nickel Boys is a powerful study in experience and identity, because of the film’s central idea: it is shot from the point-of-view of one or the other of the two leads. We begin with Elwood, and the micro-intensity of all the little epiphanic things he looks at as a child, periodically glimpsing his own face in the reflection of a steam iron, or a TV screen, and finally (perhaps a kind of cheat) in some photobooth pictures he gets with a girlfriend. It’s the kind of first-person technique we’ve seen in Robert Montgomery’s noir Lady in the Lake or the sequence in Rouben Mamoulian’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. But after a while, at least partly because filming things purely from a certain character’s viewpoint means we paradoxically get less of a sense of him, we switch to the viewpoint of the second lead. They look into each other’s eyes (and it’s a technique which, on first writing about this film, I found myself comparing to the British TV comedy Peep Show).‘What would happen if the camera was Buddhist?’ The outlier film-making of RaMell RossRead moreThere is such tenderness in the depiction of the two boys: imprisoned and yet also, in the grimmest of paradoxes, freed from the constraints and hypocrisies of the world outside the Nickel, a world of trying to pretend and to fit in with whiteness, of enduring the exhaustion of trying to finesse and negotiate an expedient third way between submission and rebellion. The moments of intimacy that Elwood and Turner have are their island surrounded by hate, and yet that hate is a kind of education, a red-pill moment of clarity that other kids do not have.Perhaps the most devastatingly emotional parts of the film are those with the wonderful Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor as Elwood’s grandmother, who comes to the school and is refused permission to visit him, but encounters Turner outside and declares that she will have to hug him instead – and does so repeatedly, hugging the camera, or indeed us, the audience. It’s the single most moving thing I’ve seen in the cinema this year.The Nickel is a microcosm of Jim Crow America, or many another societies, in its evasions, its cruelties, its hypocrisies, its icy and fraudulent claim to be providing some kind of corrective moral guidance. Turner and Elwood are treated with cruelty and bigotry: to the white ruling class they look interchangeable.Yet there is such sweetness and gentleness in Nickel Boys, a counterweight to the grimness, because it is after all a film about childhood, and the way young people are vulnerable but also have resilience. The two Nickel Boys are heroes because of the intensity of what they see in the outer world and in each other. They bear witness.Explore more on these topicsOscarsBest picture Oscar hustingsAwards and prizesNickel BoysColson WhiteheadfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she brings this crime melodrama to Berlin, an engaging if tonally uncertain high-wire adventure that satirises China’s hopeless addiction to gangster capitalism. It is also acidly unsentimental about the bread-and-circuses escapism of the country’s booming film and TV industry with all its period-costume wuxia nostalgia. It’s an appealing film, though it contains some strangely broad comedy and is also, in a couple of violent moments, a bit naive about exactly how easy it is for a young woman physically to fight off a big strong guy.Above all, Qu gives us a rather amazing set-piece scene on the set of a wire-fu action movie, a scene that feels real in a way that the rest of the film really doesn’t, for all that it is watchable. Fang Di (Wen Qi) is a tough woman employed as a stunt double on a movie set, playing the black clad, sword-wielding ninja bouncing over terracotta rooftops and whizzing through the air in long shot. For the closeup, the preening star in the same outfit steps in while Fang Di staggers over to get a coffee at the craft table. The work is exhausting and dangerous and Fang Di is doing it to pay off her family debts to mob matriarch Madame Wang.Desperate for more cash, she takes on a gruelling night shoot in which, attached to a wire harness, she has to be submerged under murky water to fly up into the air. The callous director demands this shot to be repeated endlessly, despite Fang Di’s obvious distress – and seeing that there are too many ripples from the last take, he commands she stay under the water for 15 seconds before the camera rolls, instead of the almost-safe three.Just at this unimaginably low point in Fang Di’s life, her long estranged cousin Tian Tian (Liu Haocun) appears; she is being pursued by the mob, having fallen into debt and drug addiction at the hands of the same criminals who supplied drugs to Tian Tian’s notoriously parasitic and waster dad, the source of all the family’s despair. Now Fang Di and Tian Tian have to evade the same duo of hatchet-faced tough guys, as well as a local cafe owner from their home town who the mobsters have bullied into joining them.There are entertaining, incidental scenes mocking the craziness of show business; looking to graduate away from stunt work, Fang Di auditions for a drama, doing an absurdly written scene, and bursts out laughing in the middle of the dialogue, to the director’s outrage. And there is a moment of pure (and implausible) farce when the gangster tough guys, taking a wrong turn in the movie studio, are inveigled into taking part in a hospital drama and a war epic. It’s amusing, but the silliness doesn’t entirely work. All this is interspersed with flashbacks showing the two young women’s former intimacy and the painful anguish of their family dysfunction, establishing a mood of sadness that is underscored by the final, desolate scene of their early childhood. A flawed, but involving spectacle.Girls on Wire screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsComedy filmsCrime filmsChinaComedyAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, he reflects on a remarkable lifeMon 17 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 06.16 ESTShareFor a man who was supposed to be dead next month, Ian Smith looks good. Astoundingly good: huge smile, glowing skin, that famous wobbly chin. There is only one visible clue that he has terminal cancer: a freshly shaved head, over which he frequently rubs his hand. Chemotherapy left him with “an awful half shaggy, half bald look”, so he buzzed it all off. “First time I’ve been bald since I was a baby,” he says, happily. “Apart from no hair, you can’t tell I’m sick at all.”Smith is among Australia’s most recognisable actors, although you may not know him by his name. Charlie Brookeronce describedhim as “probably the friendliest face on television – a cross between 10 Toytown mayors and a baby”. Perhaps you know him as Harold Bishop from Neighbours. Smith joined the cast in 1987, two years after the show launched, and became one of its longest-serving members, appearing in more than 2,100 episodes over five decades.Harold had the most spectacular storylines. He was swept out to sea and returned five years later with no memory. He almost strangled a guy to death. He had a stroke, which temporarily turned him into a peeping tom. He survived cancer, car accidents, a heart attack. He was a Christian white-bread suburban patriarch, decency personified – and an audience favourite. When the cast flew to the UK to perform in the 1988 Royal Variety show, it was at the personal request of the queen mother, a hugeNeighboursfan: “She shook my hand and said: ‘Oh Mr Smith, Idoenjoy your Harold.’” George Harrison once came up to say hello: “And he asked formysignature!” Smith says, delighted. “For his niece.”View image in fullscreenInimitable … Harold Bishop in a spot of bother, in Neighbours.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockNeighbours was a hit in Australia, but a bigger one in the UK, launching the international careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce, Margot Robbie and Jason Donovan. While other actors came and went, Smith was always Harold. When he and Pearce returned for the finale in 2022, he told Pearce: “I could have been an actor.” Pearce laughed, but Smith wasn’t entirely joking: “I saw so many good actors come and go – but they always go. My father had instilled in me to never walk away from money. And the money was very good. To be in work, I learned, is a privileged position. And to be in permanent work, with holidays for Christmas, is fantastic.”By the time he realised the world saw him only as Harold, “it was too late. I had been on the show too long. I would love to play something outlandish, like a vampire or a serial killer,” he says wistfully. “But all the people in casting today were brought up with Harold – one even told me that was the reason I was being typecast.” Did he make peace with that? “Unwillingly,” he snorts.Smith is nothing like dithery Harold: he is a cheeky old thesp, who wants nothing more than to talk about his days in the theatre, touring Gilbert and Sullivan or doing pantos in the UK. “Wonderful work. I remember this one kid in York – on opening night, I went out and he yelled: ‘It’s behind you!’ I said: ‘What’s behind me?’ and he said: ‘Your career!’ Apparently, he did it every year.”Permanent work with holidays for Christmas? Neighbours is fantasticSmith dialled back his involvement in Neighbours in 2007, then left the show to go travelling with his wife, Gail, in 2009. Over the following decade, he returned for a few short stints to fund their travels and came back for the final episode. When Amazon surprised everyone by rebooting the show, he returned for a few episodes, before signing on again as a regular in May 2024. It seemed Smith was never quite done with Harold – but, then again, neither were we.Then, in December 2024, Smith announced he was leaving Neighbours again, this time for good: he had beendiagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma,a rare and aggressive lung cancer. His doctor cried when he delivered the news. Smith collapsed: “I thought I would be stronger, but I am as a weak as any human.” He began doing “very dramatic things, like looking at every sunset, watching children play. The week before, I would have killed them!” he says, with a twinkle in his eye.Smith was told he would be dead by March. “Dying does change how you live,” he says. How has he changed? “I vainly say I am a better person now, but I think I am more forgiving, more understanding. It is a pity that I couldn’t have come to all these realisations [before] I was sick – I could have done somebody some good in the world.”He began chemotherapy and immunotherapy, a newer treatment that uses your immune system to fight the cancer. Remarkably, just after he revealed his cancer to the world, his doctor called with good news. He jabs at his phone and shows me his first scan, two tumours blazing red in his chest. He then shows me his latest scan. It’s startlingly clear, without a speck of red in sight.View image in fullscreenSmith as Harold Bishop in 1988.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images“That’s why I’ve got this solid grin on my face,” he says. “Apart from being 86, I feel good. I’m in no pain. I know how strange that sounds.” Suddenly, he has more time than he thought; he is mulling over buying an electric car and he has just got a new cat, named Sisi (“after the Hungarian empress”).“I know I have cancer, because doctors keep telling me I have it,” he says, smiling. “I may get very sick again one day. But I have lived the most privileged life.”Smith was raised by working-class parents in Williamstown, now a boojie seaside suburb in Melbourne. He was a Walter Mitty type, “always the hero of my daydreams”. He had the “most spoiled childhood” and “the best education I didn’t want”. His parents, Connie and Gordon, were “beautiful people”: even though neither of them had a flashy bone in their bodies, they encouraged their teenage son when he began performing in amateur musical theatre.“I was in heaven,” he says wistfully. “I had been working in a warehouse and here were young people who talked about the things I thought about – loveliness, beauty, poetry, how a piece of art could affect you. At work, it was all about pies and sheilas. It was a revelation; it was the start of my life.”Smith was a natural on stage: his first role (in Oklahoma!) was in the chorus; by his second (Carousel), he was the lead. He was “a very romantic, impressionable, randy little bugger”, constantly falling in love with his co-stars. “I thought I looked old-fashioned, but some of the girls later told me I was very good-looking. I had such a big head. It took a long time for me to become this perfect,” he jokes.Acting was a revelation – my previous job was all pies and sheilasHow did he meet his wife? “This won’t make me sound like a very nice person,” he warns. “At my ex-fiancee’s birthday.” Smith was performing in Fiddler on the Roof in Melbourne; his fiancee was working as an usher at another theatre, with Gail. “I walked in and, honestly, it was like a dreadful, soppy American soap – we saw each other and that was it. The next night, I went into the show and told everyone I had just met the future Mrs Smith. They all laughed at me!“Gail was the biggest softie under the sun,” he says, tearing up. They were married for 51 years, until her death from pancreatic cancer in 2019. “I discovered I knew very little and she taught me everything. She taught me how to be a decent human being. I was caught up in beinga star.”It was “the most beautiful marriage”, he says. They never had children “because we found out what caused them”. He is joking, but they never wanted them.“Gail and I just didn’t suffer – and I used the word deliberately – maternal or paternal instinct,” he says. “We had completely different childhoods. Gail was one of nine; I was one of one. She was always trying to escape her family – all through our marriage, she loved being one of two.”View image in fullscreenSpectacular … Harold in action.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyBut for all their happiness, Smith suffered from depression and panic attacks. “I was going to a shrink about it and he said: ‘You know, you are so typical of someone who was adopted,’” he recalls. “I went back a week later and said: ‘Guess what!’”That week, his mother, Connie, called unexpectedly. She was about to undergo hip surgery and was worried that she wouldn’t survive. She told her 54-year-old son that he was adopted.Smith doesn’t know what happened next. “I think I passed out, standing up. One day, I was Ian Smith, born in 1938, this is my mum and this my dad. All of a sudden, that is not my mum and that is not my cousin and my grandma wasn’t my grandma. Everyone had lied to me. And I hated them all. They were asked not to tell me. But I hated them.”At first, he didn’t want to know who his biological mother was. Eventually, he changed his mind. He went to an organisation that specialised in helping adopted children affected by past adoption practices, which tracked down his mother.Her name was Peg Kline. She was only 14 years older than her son; she had been raped by her older brother’s friend when she was 13 and he was 26. “He was a paedophile and a rapist,” Smith says, bluntly. When Kline went into labour, the nurses held a blanket over her lower half and whisked him out of the room before she could see him.Smith wrote her a letter. The first time Kline laid eyes on her son, he was a greying, middle-aged man, although they both felt relief at their resemblance; same watery blue eyes, same fleshy face. “There was nothing of my father left,” Smith says.Kline was married and had adult sons; Smith, always the only child, now had half-brothers. But he never developed a filial connection with Kline; she was just a good friend, until her death in 2005. “I never learned to love her,” he says. “I never called her mother. I think she would have loved that, but I couldn’t do it.”Smith got into television after he noticed that the actors who turned up to theatre rehearsals had better cars than he did. It turned out they all did television. He promptly made his way through several huge Australian shows: Homicide, Bellbird, Matlock Police, Division 4.He was still plugging away when a friend asked if he might try his hand as a script editor on Prisoner, a popular 1980s Australian soap set in a women’s prison. Smith edited the scripts, but also acted in it and even became an associate producer. On the final day, the creator, Reg Watson, thanked Smith for his time and asked if he would “care for a little part” in his new show, Neighbours.The five-week part was Harold, the childhood sweetheart of an established character, Madge Ramsay. Smith was desperate for the work: “Some people say you must suffer for your art – bullshit! If it is easy, you have a licence to try a few things, rather than just being desperate.”He played Harold for two uneventful weeks when, suddenly, the entire camera crew laughed at one of his takes. “They are a hard bunch to make laugh. I thought: what the hell did I just do? So I asked. One of them said: ‘Smithy, you were a silly old fart.’ I said: ‘Will you tell me if I do it again?’ So we went again, they all laughed and I said: ‘Right, I’ve got it.’ And that was Harold.” A week later, he got his first 12-month contract.I was so messed up. My black dog had had pups and they were all black tooHe played Harold for four years, until 1991, when the character was swept out to sea. In reality, Smith had been sacked – which he discovered by reading the storylines and realising Harold was no longer in them. “I was very angry. How could they do it without me? Don’t they know who I think I am?” he says, faux grandly. It was soon after this that he found out he was adopted.“I went down the gurgler. Way, way down,” he says, miming self-harm. Did he ever hurt himself? “No, no. But I went down the deepest, darkest hole and all the black dogs were waiting down there for me.”Gail saved him. “I can’t tell you what she did for me. She was beyond human,” he says, wiping his eyes.What was it like returning as Harold five years later? “Fantastic!” he says. “Because I still had my raw – and I meanraw– nerves working for me. I was playing a man who was totally messed up in the head, and I was so messed up. My black dog had pups and they were all black, too.”View image in fullscreenA love for the ages … Harold at the funeral of Madge Bishop.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockWhen Smith met the qualifications for voluntary assisted dying (VAD) last year, a pharmacist rang and asked if he would like the drugs sent to his home, to keep for the day he decided to die. “And I said no,” he says. “I’m awfully glad I did, too, because there have been times I would have taken it. I really would have. And I would have missed out on that wonderful day in December when I was told of my progress. My first thought was: ‘My God, I could have been dead.’ And I would have been, if I’d had the mixture at home.”Smith “wholeheartedly” approves of VAD, having watched his parents, birth mother and wife die of cancer: “I just disagree with it being left in the home. For so many reasons – you could be robbed! It is as good as a loaded gun.”His life expectancy was first moved to this Christmas and is now Christmas 2026. “I am in this funny, vacuous place,” he says. “They can’t say the cancer has gone – in fact, they mustn’t, because it has come back in other people and they have died of it. But honestly, if they told me it had come back now, I would be ready this time.”Does he feel proud of his life? “You can’t help but be,” he replies. Recently, a film crew who are making a documentary about his experience with VAD were told their funding application was approved because Smith was “culturally significant”.“Culturally significant!” Smith crows. “I rang my agent and said: ‘I give you permission to tell your friends that you knew me.’ He said: ‘God, I was hoping they wouldn’t tell you.’”In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.In the US, call or textMental Health Americaat 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

Now, she is working on 50 domestic violence cases and says her career is a privilege, not a jobPaula CocozzaMon 17 Feb 2025 01.55 ESTShareElizabeth Barbour didn’t start studying law until she was 54 and had a school-age daughter. “But once I decide to do something, I’m hard to stop,” she says.Law is an atypical later-life career choice. It certainly bore no connection to Barbour’s first and second vocations, as a hand model and then a real-estate developer. “Law school was hard. It was disheartening,” she says. “I was literally everybody’s mother’s age. I didn’t have a cohort of friends. I was like a foreigner. I felt really isolated. But three years of being pummelled with all this information really did expand my bandwidth.”One day, after a negotiation exercise, the professor told her: “I’ve never had a student be able to work the table like you did.” She spent time with family-law attorneys and “began to intuit that this would be my area”. After graduating, she worked for a practice that dealt with high-net-worth individuals. “But that’s just an attorney helping you to argue over money,” she says. “I didn’t want to do that.”Law school was hard. I was literally everybody’s mother’s age. I didn’t have a cohort of friends. I felt really isolatedShe passed the bar at her second attempt. Soon after, at 60, she got a job with the Legal Aid Society in her home town of Roanoke, Virginia. By then, her marriage had ended. In retrospect, she says, going to law school was “a declaration of selfhood”.Now 68, Barbour is working on 50 domestic violence cases. The work is emotionally draining – and rewarding. “These amazing women have been kicked around the block and are able to say: ‘Enough.’ When they come to me, they are ready for a change. I can give them legal help and play an active role in their life as they are transitioning from one place to another.”Barbour considers her career a “happy accident”. Until she was 54, she had “a freewheeling kind of life – but never without direction”.Although she was the eldest of three daughters, she “almost felt like an only child”, which fostered a strong sense of independence. Even so, she still accepted the assumption that she would “get married, change my name and be a housewife”.View image in fullscreen‘I learned that I could plot my own adventure’ … Elizabeth Barbour.Photograph: Kate Thompson/The GuardianAt high school in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Barbour “got involved with some women’s consciousness-raising meetings. I learned that I could grow up and plot my own adventure. Part of that message was: ‘You can go to law school or be a doctor.’ The part I heard was: ‘Go do your own thing.’ I went out and did my own thing and didn’t really think what my career would be.”After travelling through South and Central America, Barbour got her first proper job as a hand model with the Ford agency in New York. Her campaigns included Palmolive washing-up liquid. When Isabella Rossellini was the face of Lancôme, Barbour says, “I was her hands”.From there, she moved to Telluride in Colorado, where she met her ex-husband. They ran a business renovating houses and selling them. “I’m from a building family,” she says. “My great-grandfather showed up in this town early and became a builder.” From her office window in Roanoke, she can see the Calvary baptist church, which her family helped to build.‘I question if I’m doing the right thing’: how to cope at law school later in lifeRead moreIn childhood, Barbour had been “put on notice that not everybody had it easy”. Her mother “always volunteered with people who were disadvantaged”; Barbour would be at her side “some place where people were gathering food”.From an early age, Barbour was aware that she wanted to adopt: “I just had this little inkling that that was what I needed to do.” Her daughter is 26 and works as a paramedic. “The same kind of work,” Barbour muses. Her mother, 92, still helps in a hospice.Barbour believes that she has found her calling. Initially, the courtroom was frightening. “But my mum always said: ‘Do what you’re afraid to do.’” These days, the fear has gone. “It’s more and more rewarding. I love my office. I love my clients. I see no end to my career. It is a privilege, not a job.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60Legal aidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You could make a batch of the salad by itself for lunchboxes, but the trout elevates it to a filling dinner for two. You can, of course, use your preferred fish: any thick fillets, such as cod, pollack or haddock, would work well here. And if you don’t have pumpkin seeds, substitute breadcrumbs or any type of nut.Baked trout with beetroot, lentil and pomegranate saladPrep15 minCook30 minServes24 medium beetroot, peeled and cut into 2cm chunks1 red onion, peeled and roughly chopped1tbsp olive oil1tsp ground cumin1½tsp flaky sea salt250g packet cooked puyand green lentils50g baby leaf spinach, roughly chopped90g pomegranate seeds(from about ½ pomegranate)3tbsp roughly chopped walnuts2tbsp extra-virgin olive oil½-1 large lemon, juiced2 trout fillets2tsp smoothdijon mustard2 heapedtsp pumpkin seeds, roughly choppedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.

He laughed, noting that those words in relation to recipes made him both curious and, because of their foggy closeness to mythologising, suspicious.It was his recipe for hazelnut ragu that started it all, sending us down more or less the same paths in books and online, where we met more of the same thing: fabulously contradictory stories in which ragu made from hazelnuts was an ancient Piedmontese dish of great beauty born out of economy and hardship, and also “forgotten”, which justifies the lack of any evidence as to where it actually came from. Yet also, a breezy, contemporary dish that, like so many modern dishes, was scorned by those faithful to more traditional (ancient, authentic) versions. There were other claims, too, such as “This is the authentic recipe” and “This is an improvisational dish: do as you wish”. In short, a big tangle, which makes for entertaining reading. Although maybe not for those of the opinion that recipe writers should stop the self-indulgent introductions and get straight to the recipe – which is what we did.Armed with half a dozen sets of advice and opinions, we mixed together hazelnuts, mushrooms, diced vegetables, herbs, wine, tomato, heat and time with the aim of creating – in Stefano’s words – a deeply flavoured sauce and sumptuous condiment that is as satisfying as a conventional meat ragu. Not that this is in any way attempting to be a substitute for anything: it is a dish in its own right, and one that reminds us what delicious, useful, oily, satisfying things hazelnuts (andcobnuts) are, especially when they are paired with mushrooms. The secrets of success are softening the finely diced vegetables and herbs slowly, so as to bring out their depth of flavour; chopping the nuts roughly for a mixed texture (the rubbly bits give body, while the more floury bits help to thicken the sauce); and simmering the ragu slowly for about an hour, so everything comes together and steams up the kitchen windows.One option is to serve this with mashed potato, or polenta, or gnocchi made from potatoes or pumpkin, or long pasta – in which case boil 400-500g fresh egg tagliatelle or linguine in well-salted water. While the pasta is boiling, pour the ragu into a warm bowl, then, once the pasta is ready, either drain or use a spider to lift it directly into the sauce. Add a handful of grated cheese, too, if you like, then toss gently and serve this timeless dish immediately with lots of red wine.Hazelnut and mushroom ragu with pastaServes4150g shelled hazelnuts or cobnuts, lightly toasted in a pan4 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and very finely diced1 carrot, trimmed and very finely diced1 celery stalk, trimmed and very finely dicedSalt1 bushy sprig fresh rosemary2 bay leaves, crushed but whole250ml glass red wine1 small dried or fresh red chilli½ tin (200g)whole or chopped tomatoesA knob of butter400g mixed mushrooms, sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and minced400-500g egg tagliatelle, or linguineGrated parmesan, to serve (optional)Using a knife or food processor, cut or pulse the nuts until they have a rough, sandy texture. Working in a heavy-based pan or casserole, warm the olive oil and soften the diced vegetables with a pinch of salt, plus the rosemary and bay leaves for about five minutes. Add the nuts and cook, stirring, for five minutes more.Raise the heat slightly, add the wine and leave everything to bubble for a while, then add the chilli, tip in the tomatoes, season with salt if necessary, and simmer over a low heat for 45 minutes.Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan and, once it’s foaming, add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they collapse and are just starting to take on some colour. Pull the pan off the heat, add the minced garlic, then tip the lot, along with any pan juices, into the simmering ragu. Cook for another 15 minutes, until the ragu is dense and tasty, then adjust for salt, if need be.Boil the pasta in well-salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain and lift directly into the ragu pan. Add grated parmesan, if you like, then toss well and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsPastaA kitchen in RomeSauces and graviesFoodItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

It combines Google’s advanced AI assistance with numerous Samsung tools for writing, drawing, photography and chatting.But the reality of the £1,249 (€1,449/$1,299.99/A$2,149) superphone is slightly less than the sci-fi dream. While at times the AI tools can be thoroughly impressive, on other occasions they can be dumbfounded by the simplest thing.View image in fullscreenThe S25 Ultra is a monolithic slab of glass wrapped in a titanium band.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe outside of the Ultra has been slimmed down and is 14g lighter than its predecessor, with new flat sides and tiny bezels around its gigantic, fantastic screen. It is about as close as you can get to being a slab of glass with a display.Inside it has a souped-upQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which is even faster in tests than the version in therecent OnePlus 13. It was difficult to really trouble the performance of the chip, so it should handle anything most people want to do with a phone. The battery lasts a good two days between charges while actively being used for 7.5 hours across a range of daily tasks, photos and media on a mix of wifi and 5G – making it one of the longest lasting on the market.SpecificationsMain screen:6.9in QHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X (500ppi) 120HzProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM:12GBStorage:256, 512GB or 1TBOperating system:One UI 7 (Android 15)Camera:200MP + 50MP 0.6x + 10MP 3x + 50MP 5x; 12MP front-facingConnectivity:5G, USB-C, wifi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, UWB and GNSSWater resistance:IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins)Dimensions:162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mmWeight:218gSustainabilityView image in fullscreenSamsung says the S25 Ultra is themost durable to date, but will likely still need a case to survive drops.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSamsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity.The phone isgenerally repairable.

The drawing assist tool turns crude sketches into various styles of art (left).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSamsung has built on the numerous“Galaxy AI” tools added last year, including new drawing features and a fresh AI select tool. This allows you to simply tap on images, text, icons and other items on your screen to see what you can do with them – such as drawing, editing or searching.The“Now” bar at the bottom of the lock screenshows a stack of widgets such as live sports scores from Google, currently playing music, timers, reminders for flights and other timely things. It is a cross betweenGoogle’s At a Glanceand Apple’sDynamic Island on iPhones, and is useful. Live notifications, such as scores, can also show in the status bar.It also produces an AI-curated snapshot of your day featuring local weather, calendar events, photos you’ve taken, reminders, health information, Spotify playlists and other bits. It once told me to be careful using my phone while walking as apparently I had used it for 42 minutes out of three hours of walking. I didn’t find that particularly useful.View image in fullscreenThe S Pen stylus remains for drawing on the screen, but its magic wand and remote features that have been one of key selling points since thedays of the Galaxy Note serieshave been removed.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe star addition is thenext generation of Google’s Gemini assistant, which has the ability to perform multiple tasks at once using apps on your phone and the web. For example, it can pull times and dates from the web to set a reminder for you or send the info to friends.It promises a lot, and when it works properly it can be thoroughly impressive. But it also trips up on trivial things, such as failing to send a WhatsApp to a friend because they spell their name “Paterson” with one “t” not two. Or confidently adding a reminder for the nextFantasy Premier Leaguetransfer deadline, but getting the date and time wrong. Fundamentally it can’t be trusted to just get on with things without you needing to check it for accuracy, which is a problem for all AI tools at the moment.The rest of theOne UI 7 software experience, the latest version of the operating system, is pretty slick. Parts of it are more like Apple’s iOS than ever, but it has enough customisation options to make the phone look and behave how you want. Samsung will support the S25 Ultra with software and security updatesfor seven years from release, which matches the best from Google and Apple.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is fairly simple to operate despite being packed with capabilities.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe S25 Ultra has a very similar camera system on the back asits recentpredecessors, including the main 200MP camera, a 10MP 3x telephoto and a 50MP 5x telephoto camera capable of optically zooming to 10x magnification, or beyond with digital zoom. New for this year is a much improved 50MP ultra wide camera, which has much better low-light performance producing crisper and better detailed images indoors and in other dim environments.The camera app is also packed with plenty of fun and useful modes, including its best-in-class portrait mode, full manual control and various advanced tools. But as with its predecessors, the S25 Ultra’s best feature is simply the adaptability of having four cameras with multiple different magnifications available.PriceThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs from£1,249(€1,449/$1,299.99/A$2,149) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, the Galaxy S25 costs£799, the S25+ costs£999, theZ Fold 6costs£1,519, theGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XLcosts£1,099and theiPhone 16 Pro Maxcosts£1,199.VerdictThe Galaxy S25 Ultra kicks off the year as the most powerful and adaptable of mainstream slab Android phones.The camera is great with more lens choices than others. It has the most powerful Android chip going, long battery life, plenty of storage, a huge screen and a stylus.But Samsung hasn’t added much to the formula that made the model such a killer device several years ago. The design feels like an endpoint for the high-end smartphone. It’s not obvious where you go from here to meaningfully change the experience on a hardware level.That leaves its AI features to offer something new. Some of them are great, many are gimmicky and some features, such as the upgraded Gemini assistant, are very hit and miss. Sometimes it can be fabulous, while being annoyingly dumb or simply untrustworthy in other moments.The Ultra is a great phone that will go the distance. Just don’t buy it for the overhyped AI features.Pros:massive 120Hz screen, highly capable camera with 3x and 10x optical zoom, good software with seven years’ support, top Android chip, long battery life, access to the latest AI features.Cons:huge, extremely expensive, S Pen lacks a little magic of previous versions, doesn’t meaningfully improve on formula of predecessors, AI capabilities overhyped for now.View image in fullscreenThe matt glass back has a similar monolithic and imposing look to the screen on the front.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSamsungAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesTelecomsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now instead of tennis and tea parties, it offers scenic treks and seafood feasts in glorious spring sunshineLiz BoulterMon 17 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShare‘Why don’t theinglesicome here any more?” The question was asked by a customer atCaffè Romain the seaside town of Alassio, whose pre-second world war British population could reach 5,000.There are several reasons, I think. From the late 19th century, wealthy Britons would arrive in October to escape the winter cold, stay until May, and then head home before the torrid Italian summer. These days, British people with that kind of wealth probably winter between Zermatt and the Caribbean. But neither has Alassio great appeal to more ordinary Britons wanting a summer holiday: August temperatures can hit the high 30s, crowds and prices surge and, as in so many Italian resorts, the sands are taken over by beach concessions from Easter to September.View image in fullscreenHowever, lovers of blue skies, warm sunshine, good food and outdoor pursuits may find this Ligurian resort a perfect spring or autumn destination. Just over an hour from Genoa (not much more from Nice), this lucky little town faces south-east over the Ligurian Sea, protected by a ring of hills on a shallow curve of silvery sand called Baia del Sole (Sunshine Bay). Alassio’s microclimate sees it consistently a few degrees warmer than its neighbours, with clear skies punctuated by a few spring showers.A spring trip to Alassio could also take inFlauer(4-6 April in 2025), the town’s festival of cooking with flowers, this year with invited Sicilian chefs widening the offering of stalls, tastings and guided hikes. As a preview I nibble a few pinky-red begonia petals and am surprised at their zingy citrus taste – perfect in gelato.The cobbled path winds up and up, under carob and olive trees, views getting more spectacular with each hairpinMany Flauer events take place on Piazza dei Partigiani, which has the sea on one long side and is minutes from the town’s smart pier, Molo Bestoso, a setting for contemporary art exhibitions until late October. Inland are the narrow streets of the old town, called Il Budello (the gut), where the Old Alassio Association keeps photographs dating from before the British “discovered” it. An image taken in 1860 shows Alassio a mere fishing village, with just sheep and a few drying nets on the unspoilt sand.The green hills above Alassio are a little more built up now, but still ripe for exploring. I hear all about them from lawyer Igor Colombi, who recently finished a project to maintain,  waymark and map the 56 miles (90km) of former mule tracks leading into the hills. Armed with his map (available at the tourist office), I take the railway underpass off the main road to find the cobbled path toSolva. It winds up and up, views getting more spectacular with each hairpin, past gardens and allotments, under carob and olive trees, to the village square and a church with 14th-century frescoes designed to frighten the faithful into behaving.View image in fullscreenThe island of Gallinara sits off Alassio, to the north-east.Photograph: Mauritius Images /AlamyThere are no refreshments in Solva, but it’s only a half-hour walk back, with the track ending close to wonderfulOsteria I Matetti(see below). At Solva’s July festival, hungry hikers can gorge onbiscette, dough fritters similar to churros, and probably just as bad for you.A longer trail leads from Alassio’s south-west edge to Moglio village, with its pretty multicoloured houses and views of the bay from a different angle. Moglio’s summer festival celebrates a less-appealing speciality: stewed tuna entrails. They are said to have a “decisive” taste. However, there is also Bar a Nió, with simple – intestine-free – snacks on a panoramic terrace.View image in fullscreenAn old poster for Balzola’s Baci biscuits, created in the town’s historic pastry shop.Photograph: Liz BoulterFor a deeper dive into Alassio’s hinterland, I consult a wise woman, Laura Brattel, who will be leading foraging walks (in English if required) during the Flauer festival. She learned about wild plants for food and healing from her mother and grandmother, but only after she’d promised, in a ceremony held when she was just five, not to use the knowledge to do harm. The lore can only be passed between women, so she is not allowed to share it with her only child, a son.On a lung- and thigh-stretching walk to Vegliasco, a village with a 16th-century watchtower, she shows me wild celery, several types of dandelion and an edible bush with lush spinachy leaves. She shows me how to spot poisonous plants and explains how a herbal tea made from rosehips is a natural Prozac.The strawberry tree’s leaves are good for stomach, bladder and circulatory problems, while the waxy leaves ofcaccialepre (Reichardia picroides)are good in salad or cooked in ravioli.Laura runs foraging walks year round, and offers bespoke bookings.Back in town I take a look at what all the British left behind: a tennis club straight out of Agatha Christie, still thriving under eightysomething British owner Joe Skordis; the Anglican church, not so thriving; and the English Library, presided over on Wednesday and Friday afternoons by another long-term resident Brit,Jacqueline Rosadoni.A century ago, Alassio was all about mixed doubles, garden parties and new year balls. Times have changedBut for more of what today’s visitors might enjoy, I take to the water, meeting fisher Stefano Roascio at the town’s marina. He offers tours (from €30, ask at the tourist office) of the bay andGallinara, the rocky island visible from all the mainland villages. The public can’t land there as yet, but in 2020 the authorities stepped in to stop a Russian oligarch buying it, and there are plans to open a museum and some Roman ruins as a tourist attraction. For now, it’s a handy shelter from chill breezes: Stefano anchors his boat, L’Orizzonte, in the island’s lee and even in low season it’s warm enough for a pre-lunch dip.View image in fullscreenThe palm-fringed streets of Alassio’s old town, leading down to the sea.Photograph: Panther Media/AlamyWhen not entertaining tourists, Stefano supplies fish to top restaurants, so knows what this coast can offer. We tuck into marinated anchovy antipasti, tartare of sea bream, amberjack sashimi and swordfish carpaccio, then cuttlefish salad and pasta with sea urchins, confit tomatoes andtrombette, long, delicate, yellow courgettes.After, I go to theCarlo Levi Gallery(Saturday, 3pm-6pm, free), having previously known the man only for his books and leftwing politics. He was a regular visitor to Alassio until his death in 1975, and his paintings include post-impressionist-feeling carob trees and expressive portraiture. There are also leaflets, posters and artefacts from his activist life.A century ago, Alassio was all about mixed doubles, garden parties and new year balls for assorted upper-crust Dalrymples and Hanburys. Times have changed, but so has the town. The sun still shines in spring and autumn, and with scenic treks instead of tennis tournaments, seafood feasts instead of vicarage teas, Alassio could find theinglesifalling for it all over again.Where to stayView image in fullscreenA room in Villa della Pergola.Photograph: Matteo CarassaleOn the edge of the old town,Casa d’Artista(doubles from €150 B&B) has sea views from the back and paintings by the owner’s mother, artist Maria Teresa Preve, everywhere, including the book-lined breakfast room.For a splurge,Villa della Pergola(doubles from €310 B&B) has been owned by several wealthy British families and sits amid beautifully restoredbotanical gardenstransformed bytennis club founderDaniel Hanbury in the 1920s. The garden has one of Italy’s biggest collections of wisteria, and spring sees a “waterfall” of them in full glory.Where to eatOsteria I Matettilooks unassuming, but inside you are hit by a loud hum of happy patrons. The walls are lined with old school photos: every local over a certain age can find themselves somewhere. Young staff dash about handing plates of pasta to office workers. Pesto comes withgasse, large flat pasta tubes, though I am also tempted by greentaglioliniwithbottarga. Booking is essential, but be aware that it is the local HQ for Inter Milan fans, who watch on a big screen unrolled from the ceiling on match days.Balzola, the town’s opulent bakery and cafe, does crepes and gelato as well asbaci dialassio, signature hazelnut biscuits sandwiched with chocolate cream.Noveis the Michelin-starred restaurant of Villa della Pergola. A glorious vegan menu offers pasta with peanut, broccoli andchinottofoam, green gazpacho over tomatoes cooked at just 63C, and sweet delicatetrombettewith truffles.A mostly plant-based lunch at La Vigna, in hills north of town, can mean organic wine from their own nearby vineyard, starters of hotpanissa– chickpea-flour fritters with lemon – and fresh fried porcini, then a main ofpinzimonio –olive oil dip with pesto and anchovy – with the region’s freshest veg: raw spring onions, fennel, chicory, carrot, celery and boiled waxy potatoes.The trip was provided by the town of Alassio and Alassio MarinaExplore more on these topicsItaly holidaysEurope holidaysCultural tripsGenoa holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The simple geometry problem that fools almost everyoneThe answer to today’s triangular teaserAlex BellosMon 17 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 16.34 ESTShareEarlier todayI set you the following two problems. Here they are again with solutions.1. Tricky triangleWhat is the length of AD, the dashed line?View image in fullscreenSolution: x = 1The reason that most people fail to solve this one is because the triangle is degenerate: it is, actually, a line, not a triangle.The horizontal side has length 8. The other two sides add up to 8, so these two sides will lie on top of the horizontal line.People who spot that the triangle is degenerate still get the puzzle wrong, as they immediately assume that the distance between A and D is 0. A moment’s reflection, and you realize it is 1.2. Rockin’ rectanglesIt’s easy enough to divide a square into five rectangles.View image in fullscreenBut can you:i) Divide a square into five rectangles such that no two rectangles share an entire side in common – i.e. the sides of abutting rectangles never startandfinish at the same points? (The rectangles do not need to be the same size or shape.)ii) Divide an 11 x 11 square into five rectangles in such a way that the ten side lengths are the whole numbers from 1 to 10? Hint: if you have solved part i) use this arrangement of rectangles.Solutioni) You can change the size of the rectangles, and flip the ones around the side to go the other way, but this is the only pattern that works.View image in fullscreenii) There are two solutions, both have a kernel of 4x7. You will get there by trial and error, and by observing the constraints. The side length is 11, so there must be four sets of two side lengths that add up to 11. The area is 121, so the sum of the areas of the 5 rectangles adds up to 121. In other words, how can you divvy up the numbers from 1 to 10 into pairs, the sum of whose products is 121?View image in fullscreenI hope you enjoyed these puzzles, I will be back in two weeks time.I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.

Just 100 metres separate the two border checkpoints – on the Sudanese side, three raised flags welcome newcomers; on the South Sudanese side, a sign in Arabic and English marks the entrance to the country.Women arrive carrying their children, with their belongings balanced on their heads. Some families bring bed frames, nightstands, food, chairs and suitcases, loading them on to carts pulled by donkeys and crossing into South Sudan to escapewar in Sudan.“Today, I feel like I am in a safe place,” says Hamed Attaher, a 26-year-old technology student from the University of Khartoum. Attaher has been travelling since he left Khartoum a year ago, and has finally set foot on South Sudanese soil. “My aunt is waiting for me in Juba,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe entry point for refugees from Sudan to South Sudan; in the background is the border. In December, more than 5,000 people crossed this point each dayThe world’s youngest country is facing the most severe humanitarian crisis in the world as thousands of displaced people continue to cross the border into South Sudan’s Upper Nile state at the Joda border, 30 miles (50km) north of the town of Renk.More than 12.5 million peoplein Sudan have been forced to flee their homes since the war broke out in April 2023. During the first weeks of December, at least 5,000 people crossed into South Sudan each day, fleeing bombing and fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).At a checkpoint on the crossing, the International Organization forMigration(IOM) categorises people as either refugees or “returnees”. For many, arriving in South Sudan means returning to a land they thought they would never see again after fleeing the civil war that began in 2013 – these are the returnees.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: A group of women board an IOM bus to be transferred to the town of Renk; right: a sack of USAid sorghum alongside a pile of belongingsNow, it is the South Sudanese who are receiving their neighbours and, in some cases, their former compatriots. “We are one people because we call the Sudanese side ‘North Juba’ and the South Sudanese side ‘South Juba’,” says a humanitarian worker, though officially the area is called Wunthou.In the reception area, UNHCR tents provide shade and BP-5, emergency food for disaster relief, for those waiting to continue their journey to reunite with family or friends.For those with health problems, the IOM handles “green” patients, meaning those who can wait, while Médecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) takes care of the “orange” and “red” cases.

These makeshift communities grow each day, with small businesses, improvised mosques and new neighbourhoods taking shape. Others opt for the buses and trucks to nearby towns organised by the IOM.Attaher has climbed into one of these trucks along with dozens of men, women and children. He waves, making a victory sign with his hand as he begins what he hopes will be the final leg of his journey.At Renk County hospital, where those needing immediate care are taken, baby Hosseini is lying in a bed in the paediatric section.

The cry of a mother interrupts her.

Zelenskyy did not dismiss the offer out of hand, but said itdid not yet contain the security provisionsKyiv needed.What are critical minerals?Critical minerals are the metals and other raw materials needed for the production of hi-tech products, particularly those associated with the green energy transition, but also consumer electronics, artificial intelligence infrastructure and weapons.The rush to tackle climate breakdown and move away from fossil fuels has triggered a rush for energy transition minerals such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel, which are useful for electrification of transport and the construction of wind turbines. The same minerals and others are also used for the manufacture of mobile phones, AI datacentres and arms such as F-35 fighter aircraft, placing them in high demand.As the world’s economy and technology transforms, the value of critical minerals has soared and geopolitical competition for access to them is rising. In 2023, theInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimatedthat the market for energy transition minerals had reached £320bn in 2022, double its value five years earlier. And if countries fully implement their clean energy and climate pledges, demand is expected to more than double by 2030 and triple by 2040,the agency says.Which minerals are regarded as critical?The term critical minerals is not a scientific term so much as a political term, and different countries have different lists of critical minerals depending on their domestic and geopolitical objectives.In 2022, the US Geological Survey (USGS)published a list of 50 minerals, from aluminium to zirconium, that it regarded as “play[ing] a significant role in our national security, economy, renewable energy development and infrastructure”. Notable inclusions were arsenic, for semiconductors; beryllium, used as an alloying agent in aerospace and defence industries; cobalt, lithium and graphite, crucial for manufacturing batteries; indium, which makes screens respond to a finger touch; and tellurium, which is used for solar power generation.The US’s Energy Act stipulates that the list must be updated every three years, which means this year it will be up for review, and it will be interesting to see which minerals appear or disappear given the new political environment in the country.What are rare earth elements?Rare earth elements (REEs) are a subset of 17 critical minerals that are variously indispensable for mobile phones, electric vehicles, missile guidance systems and other electronics, industrial and energy applications.Despite their name, most of the rare earth elements are not particularly rare, but their extraction and refining is fiendishly difficult – and environmentally highly destructive – meaning production is concentrated in very few places, mainly China.REEs include europium, used in nuclear power station control rods; dysprosium, gandolinium and praseodymium,used in the magnets in your mobile phone; and gadolinium, holmium and ytterbium, used in lasers among other things.What critical minerals does Ukraine have?A2022 articleby the chair of Ukraine’s Association of Geologists, Hanna Liventseva, claimed her country contained about 5% of the world’s mineral resources, despite covering only 0.4% of the globe’s surface, thanks to a complex geology that takes in all three of the main components of the earth’s crust.According to Ukraine’s own data, cited by Reuters, the country has deposits of 22 of the 34 minerals identified as critical by the EU, including rare earths such as lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, erbium and yttrium.Before the outbreak of war with Russia, Ukraine was a key supplier of titanium, producing about 7% of global output in 2019, according toEuropean Commission research. It also claimed 500,000 tons of lithium reserves, and one-fifth of the world’s graphite, a crucial component of nuclear power stations.However, with Russia controlling about one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory, much of these reserves have been lost. According to estimates by Ukrainian thinktanks cited by Reuters, up to 40% of Ukraine’s metal resources are under occupation. Russian troops also occupy at least two of Ukraine’s lithium deposits, one in Donetsk and another in Zaporizhzhia.Why does Donald Trump want Ukraine’s critical minerals so much?There is one big reason Trump is so keen to get his hands on Ukraine’s critical minerals: China. More than ever, the Asian superpower is the world’s factory and that means, wherever in the world critical minerals are torn from the ground, it remains a crucial staging point on the supply chain.Most of the world’s processing capacity for critical minerals is in China. According to the IEA, China’s share of refining is about 35% for nickel, 50-70% for lithium and cobalt, and nearly 90% for REEs. Its dominance in the latter, especially, is overwhelming. According toUSGS data, in 2024 China accounted for almost half the world’s REE reserves.With Trump effectively instigating a trade war with China with his imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese goods, US access to critical minerals is potentially under threat. As mentioned earlier, the world is being gripped by an unseemly scramble for mineral wealth. They are the building blocks of the economy of the future, and if the US doesn’t get its hands on them, someone else will.Explore more on these topicsUkraineDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyCommoditiesManufacturing sectorChinaEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

This is a coup, plain and simple,” Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said.Trump and Musk, the world’s richest man and Trump’s largest single donor, now face multiple rebukes from judges and legal experts to the regulatory and staff cuts they have engineered at the treasury department, the US Agency for International Development and several other agencies.Incongruously, as Trump has touted Musk’s cost-cutting work as vital to curbing spending abuses, one of Trump’s first moves in office last month was to fire 17 veteran agency watchdogs, known as inspectors general, whose jobs have long been to ferret out waste, fraud and abuse in federal departments.Those firings were done without giving Congress the legally required 30 days’ notice and specific justifications for each one, prompting mostly Democratic outrage at Trump’s move, which he defended as due to “changing priorities”, and falsely claimed was “standard”.In response to the firings, eight of those inspectors general filed a lawsuit against Trump and their department heads on Wednesday arguing their terminations violated federal laws designed to protect them from interference with their jobs and seeking reinstatement.The IGs who sued included ones from the Departments of Defense, Education and Health and Human Services.View image in fullscreenPeople gather to protest outside the federal district court in New York for the start of a case against the ‘department of government efficiency’ on Friday.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPADemocratic critics and legal experts see Trump’s IG firings and Musk’s Doge operation as blatant examples of executive power plays at the expense of Congress and transparency.“I think their claims that they’re going after waste, fraud and abuse is a complete smokescreen for their real intentions,” said Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.Likening Trump’s firing of the IGs to “firing cops before you rob the bank”, Whitehouse stressed: “It’s pretty clear that what’s going on here is a very deliberate effort to create as much wreckage in the government as they can manage with a view to helping out the big Trump donors and special interests who find government obnoxious in various ways.”On another legal track opposing Trump and Musk’s actions, many of the nation’s 23 Democratic state attorneys general have escalated legal battles against Doge’s actions and sweeping cost cutting at treasury, USAid and other agencies.For instance, 19 Democratic AGs sued Trump and the treasury secretary in February to halt Doge from accessing sensitive documents with details about tens of millions of Americans who get social security checks, tax refunds and other payments, arguing that Doge was violating the Administrative Procedures Act. The lawsuit prompted a New York judge on 7 February to issue a temporary order halting Doge from accessing the treasury payments system.In response, Musk and Trump lashed out by charging judicial interference. Musk on his social media platform Twitter/X where he has more than 200 million followers charged that the judge was “corrupt” and that he “needs to be impeached NOW”.Trump, with Musk nearby in the Oval Office on Tuesday, echoed his Doge chief saying: “It seems hard to believe that a judge could say, ‘We don’t want you to do that,’ so maybe we have to look at the judges because I think that’s a very serious violation.”Legal experts, AGs and top congressional Democrats say that Trump’s and Musk’s charges of improper judicial interference and some of their actions pose dangers to the rule of law and the US constitution.View image in fullscreenA supporter of federal workers holds a sign near the US Capitol in support of federal workers on Thursday.Photograph: Sue Dorfman/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock“The president is openly violating the US constitution by taking power from Congress and handing it to an unelected billionaire – whileElon Muskgoes after judges who uphold the law and rule against them,” said Mayes.Ex-federal prosecutors echo some of Mayes’s arguments.“The suggestions by Trump, Musk and Vance that courts are impermissibly interfering with Trump’s mandate to lead is absurd,” said the former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade, who now teaches law at the University of Michigan.“Under our constitutional separation of powers system, each co-equal branch serves as a check on the others. The role of the courts is to strike down abuses of executive power when it violates the law. Comments disparaging the courts seems like a dangerous effort to undermine public confidence in the judiciary. If people do not respect the courts, they will be less inclined to obey their orders.”Likewise, some former judges worry that certain judges could face violence sparked by the threats Musk and Trump have publicly made.“While federal judges expect people to disagree with their opinions, I have long feared that personal attacks like those from Trump and Musk against at least one New York judge would expose them to harm and even death,” said the former federal judge and Dickinson College president, John Jones.“Worse, judges are essentially defenseless when it comes to fighting the false narratives that are being promulgated because their code of conduct prevents them from engaging with the irresponsible people who make these statements.”Legal experts too are increasingly alarmed about how Musk and Trump are exceeding their power at the expense of Congress, including some of the retaliatory firings by Trump against critics or perceived political foes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The agency’s mission is to provide humanitarian aid and fund development assistance and tech projects in developing countries.“The firing of IG Paul Martin, a highly respected and experienced inspector general, on the day after his office released a critical report, risks sending a chilling message that is antithetical to IGs’ ability to conduct impactful independent oversight on behalf of the American taxpayer,” said the ex-defense department IG Robert Storch.Storch, one of the 17 IGs Trump fired abruptly last month who has joined the lawsuit against theTrump administration, stressed more broadly that “IGs play an essential role in leading offices comprised of oversight professionals across the federal government to detect and deter waste, fraud, abuse and corruption.”A former IG, who requested anonymity to speak freely, warned bluntly: “Trump and Musk are gaslighting the American people. No one should believe Musk and his troops have actually discovered billions of dollars of waste, fraud, abuse and ‘corruption’. If they had, we would know the specifics. They can’t provide them and they won’t. At most, they have seen things that may need to be explained, but they haven’t bothered to seek the explanation from anyone with relevant knowledge.”Despite rising concerns about the powers assumed by Musk, Trump unveiled a new executive order in the Oval Office on Tuesday expanding Musk’s authority and mandate.Trump’s new order requires federal agencies to “coordinate and consult” with Doge to slash jobs and curb hiring, according to a White House summary.All agencies were instructed to “undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force” and limit new hires to only “essential positions”, according to the summary.View image in fullscreenElon Musk stands behind Donald Trump at the Oval Office on Tuesday.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersDuring the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday Musk spoke in grandiose terms about his mission with a few dubious and broad claims about frauds that it had uncovered, while declaring without evidence that it was what “the people want”.Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, which have received billions of dollars in federal contracts in recent years, is wielding his new federal authority as a “special government employee” without giving up his private-sector jobs. Musk’s post is a temporary one that bypasses some of the disclosure requirements for full-time federal employees.As Musk’s powers have expanded and Doge has done work in more than a dozen agencies, 14 state AGs filed a lawsuit in federal court in DC on Thursday broadly challenging Musk and Doge’s authority to obtain access to sensitive government data and wield “virtually unchecked power”.The lawsuit argues that Trump violated the constitution’s appointments clause by establishing a federal agency without Congress’s approval.At bottom, some legal experts and watchdogs say the threats posed by Musk’s cost-cutting drive that Trump has blessed, are linked to the record sums that Musk gave Trump’s campaign.“After Musk reportedly spent close to $300m to help Trump get elected, Trump has been giving Musk what appears to be unprecedented access to the inner levers of government, including private and confidential information about individuals,” said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission who now teaches law at American University.“Musk and his followers can use that access to help Trump kill or neutralize congressionally created agencies and rules that serve and protect the public interest, while ensuring the government protects and serves the ability of the wealthy to grow their fortunes.”Other legal watchdogs fear more dangerous fallout to the rule of law from Trump’s greenlighting Musk’s Doge operation and agenda.“President Trump has not only afforded Elon Musk and Doge extraordinary power over federal agency operations with little public oversight and accountability, but he has also done so at the expense of Congress and its constitutionally mandated power,” said Donald Sherman, the chief counsel at the liberal-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.“Trump enabled Musk’s capture of the federal government after illegally firing more than a dozen inspectors general despite Congress strengthening the laws protecting IGs less than three years ago … ”Sherman noted that “what’s even more troubling is that congressional Republicans have been more than willing to cede their constitutional powers in service of President Trump and Elon Musk’s political agenda.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpElon MuskUS constitution and civil libertiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The moves have sent a wave of terror through the undocumented worker community that underpins large parts of the US economy.“Every day I wake up and walk out the door, I go with the hope of going to work, but with the fear of not being able to come back,” said a construction worker and single parent in Texas who obtained immigration protection under the Biden administration. She requested to remain anonymous due to fears about her immigration status.“Every day I worry if something happens, who will take my kids,” she said. “I have only one child born in the US. They are the only one who might be able to return, but me and the other kids would not be able to come back.”She claimed that since Trump took office for his second term, there had been fewer opportunities to work construction jobs given the increased fear of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids at workplaces.Despite being in the US for 10 years and constantly trying to obtain documentation, she explained it took her experiencing weeks of wage theft to be able to get documentation through thedeferred actionprogram, which provides temporary status and work authorization to immigrants who have been victims of labor abuses.“Unfortunately, these next few years will be years of fear, years of silence,” she said. “I believe the anti-immigrant pushes are racist. People have been taken away without criminal records. We used to have the ability to pay fines before because we didn’t have criminal records, but I’ve heard from other immigrants, anyone being taken into custody by Ice, regardless of their situation, will be deported.”Trump has signed an executive order to allocate military resources at the US border with Mexico andopenedGuantánamo Bay prison in Cuba to the detention of undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security alsorolled backa policy of restricting Ice arrests at sensitive locations such as hospitals, places of worship and schools and the agency ispushingto recruit IRS agents to assist in immigration enforcement. The administration is also reportedly planning toreopenfamily detention centers.View image in fullscreenJulia (left) reacts as Nora Sandigo talks to her husband after he called from a federal detention center, on 2 February 2025 in Homestead, Florida.

Nearly 2.9 million immigrants, the most in any occupation group, are employed inconstruction and extraction, comprising 34% of employment in these occupations in the US.The Guardian spoke with several immigrant workers in construction about their experiences and fears caused by Trump’s immigration policies and the anti-immigrant sentiments stoked by his rhetoric and policies.Another undocumented construction worker in Texas said there is a “constant fear” in going to work every day that his workplace will be raided by Ice or that he will return home to find his family, the majority of whom are undocumented, taken away.“It is a constant fear. It’s something we can’t take from our minds, every instance of the day,” they said. “My main worry is there will be one day where my family might be taken away from me and be sent back to Mexico.”Trying to acquire legal documentation has been “almost impossible”, they added. “The reason behind these policies, it comes from racism. The majority of immigrants aren’t criminals. Like myself, a lot of immigrants come to this country to be able to fulfill their dreams, to be able to work. We’re humans and we have rights. The things we go through when being held in immigration detention, unless you live them, you won’t be able to understand it.”Andres Surquia of Georgia currently has immigration protection through deferred action – a government policy that allows certain undocumented immigrants to work and avoid deportation for two-year periods.“I’m scared because Trump has said he wants to remove deferred-action protections, which took me so long to get,” he said. “As immigrants, we come into this country to work and we want to be respected and protected.”The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, which represents 140,000 workers in the US and Canada,pushedto secure deferred-action immigration protections for workers experiencing labor abuses in construction for the past several years under the Biden administration.“It was one of the main pillars we put forth as a union, in coalition with other unions, that really view immigration as a working-class issue,” said the IUPAT general president, Jimmy Williams. “Now, under theTrump administrationit’s going to go back to all these workers having no recourse, and the employers continuing to be able to use their status as a way to keep them further and further from being able to speak out.”Immigration is a labor and economic issue, Williams said. The union views it as a responsibility to fight and defend these workers because they are their union members. But he expressed disappointment with Democrats whom he feels have so far failed to support these workers.“Where’s the resistance?” Williams asked. “When will the Democratic party really get it right on framing this as a working-class issue and put the target solely on where it belongs, which is on the employers that have abused this system for decades now, keeping workers’ rights down, keeping wages down? You’ve seen limited to no response from the opposition.”A construction worker in Texas who has been pursuing asylum said she had seen fewer people show up to work out of fear in recent weeks.“There’s not many people going to work any more, because of the fear. The only reason why I go to work is it’s a necessity to bring food home and pay bills,” she said. “They want to extract the people that are working in the farms, that are working in the fields, that are working in the restaurants that they eat in, and now they’re taking them without any explanation. It’s not fair.”Milton Velásquez is a construction worker in Maryland from El Salvador who currently has temporary protected status (TPS), provisional protection given to nationals of some countries in crisis. Trump has alreadyrevokedthese protections for 350,000 Venezuelans and hasincitedfears he will revoke or limit protections for 1 million immigrants in the US from 17 nations granted protections under the Biden administration.“It scares me because if my TPS does get revoked, I will lose a lot of job opportunities without it and it would limit my income,” he said. “There is always fear of deportation. I try not to think about it, but what scares me the most is having to go back to El Salvador. I would have to work 10 times as much to get paid $10 a day.”Under the first Trump presidential term, Velásquez faced issues with trying to bring his son and daughter to the US from El Salvador through the Central American Minors program, which Trumpshut downin 2017. He is still separated from his daughter.“I tried to get her a visa,” Velasquez added. “I’ve been longing to bring them here. That’s what I work for, to provide for my family, to get my family to come here.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of the Trump administration’s temporary protected status decision, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (929) 418-7175.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationUS economyUS domestic policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

US-funded projects are usually well paid, and in places likePapua New Guinea, a single income supports extended family members and communities,” said Dr Lefaoalii Dion Enari, a Pacific expert at Auckland University of Technology.‘A fight for our lives’: Trump’s USAid freeze is harming millions of women and girlsRead more“This type of approach will harm US relations in the Pacific a lot more than it will harm the Pacific itself,” Lefaoalii said.What programs does USAid support in the Pacific?USAid funds initiatives in a range of areas including health, the climate crisis and economic development. It helps countries develop and implement climate action plans and provides grants to local organisations to build resilience against the climate crisis and disasters. USAid also funds initiatives on community disaster preparedness and sustainable energy. For example, USAid’s Climate Ready for Big Ocean State Sustainability program was designed give 12 Pacific countries more access to climate finance for critical adaptation and mitigation projects.USAid does not publish a comprehensive list of projects it supports in the Pacific. But estimates drawn from USAid documents, regional bodies and analysts, suggest there are more than 100 large- and small-scale projects supported by USAid across the region.The Guardian spoke to 12 people across the Pacific involved in USAid projects. They did not want to be named for fear of losing potential future income. Some have already been let go, while others are in limbo, uncertain about how long they will remain employed.One source estimated 600 Pacific islanders are full-time employees of USAid projects, but that does not account for contractors and other partners – which is estimated to amount to thousands of people.Another worker at an organisation in Papua New Guinea that relies on USAid expressed anxiety about the future. “We employ four people, and as of now, we do not know how long we will remain in operation,” they said.How much funding does the US give the Pacific?According to the Lowy Institute, the US spent $3.4bn in the Pacific Islands cumulatively between 2008 and 2024. A total of $249m was spent in 2022, with the majority going to Compact of Free Association (Cofa) nations, which are the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau.“The US spends 80% of its aid to the Pacific on Cofa nations. Of the remaining 20%, most goes to Papua New Guinea and other Melanesian countries,” said Alexandre Dayant, deputy director of the Indo-Pacific Development Centre at the Lowy Institute.“Cofa nations are shielded from the USAid freeze as their funding was approved by Congress through the Department of the Interior,” he added.Although the US pledged $600m in 2022 to strengthen its engagement in the Pacific, including commitments toopen embassies in Tonga and Kiribatiand appoint a US envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, people involved in the programs on the Pacific side say the funds have yet to fully reach the islands.How has the Pacific responded?Some programs are looking for new funding. One organisation inSamoa, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (Adra), was granted $532,608 in 2023 from USAid to create new economic opportunities, promote women’s empowerment, and address disaster risk management in 20 rural villages. The programs supported around 14,000 villagers. The agency also provides workshops on mental health, domestic violence and family health, which are supported by USAid and the Pacific American Fund.In a statement issued earlier this week, Adra said it was actively seeking alternative funding to continue its suspended life-saving programs. The organisation said it was working to utilise other available resources to keep critical initiatives operational during the review period and remains hopeful for a positive outcome.This includes the community disaster and climate risk management, which gives villages knowledge and skills to respond to hazards and disaster.“Even though this is shocking initially for our people, at the end of the day, we are resilient,” Lefaoalii told the Guardian. “For Samoa, and for many across our islands, we have social safety nets built into the community to help in such times.”Despite the resilience of the region, Lefaoalii said the move by Trump has been seen in the Pacific as “disrespectful”.“We deeply value loyalty and respect, and this move was disrespectful. It was not consultative and has directly affected community livelihoods, this will not be easily forgotten by Pacific leaders,” said Lefaoalii.Explore more on these topicsPacific islandsUSAidPapua New GuineaSamoaTongaKiribatiAsia PacificexplainersShareReuse this content"

It has not been easy, he says, recalling the threats he has received over the years for reporting illegal hunters and loggers in reserves, but he never considered giving up.Last year, however, tensions in the area escalated after violence soared on the country’s coast. Accounts of almost daily killings in the cities of Esmeraldas and Guayaquil emerged as gangs appeared to fight over territory, while forced recruitment in rural areas increased, as did extortions, known locally asvacunas,or vaccines.View image in fullscreenA gun found in a police raid in a Durán barrio, a centre of Ecuador’s drug trade.Photograph: ReutersLast August, while attending meetings in Quito, the capital, Raul received a phone call from colleagues in the Chocó. They had heard that a local gang planned to kidnap him the next time he went to the territory, hoping to get money and information – or else.“They simply said: ‘They’re going to kidnap you tomorrow. Don’t come in,’” says Raul, who asked for his real name not to be used as he still fears for his safety. “When you get news like that, it makes my blood run cold.”Raul did not return to the Chocó for months, but when he finally went back, he did not share his travel plans with anyone and tried to be as discreet as possible. “I don’t think we’re prepared to deal with this kind of thing,” he says. “At least, I’m not.”Raul’s story highlights the struggles of many scientists inEcuadorwho are conducting fieldwork with diverse populations and critical ecosystems in a country facing a growing security crisis.‘They’re going to kidnap you. Don’t come in’RaulAmid a presidential campaign where the incumbent,Daniel Noboa, is up for re-election, security remains a pressing issue in Ecuador. Like El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, the Ecuadorian leader has launched a crackdown on crime – a move that has drawncriticism for human rights abuses. However, his initiativehas not yet effectively addressed the country’s crime problem.View image in fullscreenA fisherman in the Jambeli archipelago, where the once-thriving port of Puerto Bolivar has become nearly dormant since the drug violence began.Photograph: Marvin Recinos/AFP/GettyIn the past four years, Ecuador’smurder rate has risen nearly sixfold, and it is now considered one ofthe most violent countries in the region.As fieldwork in remote rural areas gets more dangerous, scientists fear they may be forced to abandon projects, leaving vulnerable ecosystems at risk and communities isolated.Javier Robayo, director of the localconservation foundation EcoMinga, has worked in the Chocó rainforest for 12 years since they created the Dracula reserve along Ecuador’s northern border with Colombia. He says the border region has always been controlled by armed groups, notably Colombia’s Farc guerrillas, before they laid down their arms after the 2016 peace accords, followed by precarious talks with the ELN guerrilla group (which havesince broken down). Yet that has never affected their work until now.Today, these armed groups have become fragmented, while other gangs have emerged, all vying for control of illegal goldmining in the region. Robayo has reported some of this mining to the authorities, but local officials told him they were unable to stop it. “If we do anything, they come and kill us,” he was told.View image in fullscreenIndigenous Waorani campaigning against oil drilling in Yasuni national park in 2023. Although drilling was halted, illegal mining has grown and gangs are now involved.Photograph: AFP/GettyForced recruitment of young people and farmers locally has also increased, making it unclear who works for whom and who one can trust, says Robayo.Last year, EcoMinga had to cancel research trips by visiting academics aiming to study the region’s various endemic species and a bird-monitoring project with students, as their safety in the area could not be assured. He also had to halt a new water-monitoring project they had just received funding for and were about to implement with local communities.Robayo fears that any money coming in would put EcoMinga and those communities at increased risk of extortion and kidnappings.If we do anything, they come and kill usJavier Robayo“Until a few years ago, biologists were not part of the crime food chain,” says Robayo. “Today, the effects of illegal mining can quickly be associated with environmental damage, contamination, loss of species and loss of livelihoods.“And there we play an important role where we can show what’s going on,” he adds. “That’s where we start to make it uncomfortable.”Renato Rivera, director of theEcuadorian Organised Crime Observatory (OECO), a non-profit organisation, says armed groups have acted as de facto governing bodies in the border region for more than 40 years. They enforce social norms and bring order to the territories under their control, as state institutions in the area have been weak or nonexistent, allowing gangs to achieve a high level of legitimacy with local populations, he says.View image in fullscreenSinangoe men watch illegal mining on the Aguarico River. Indigenous people have also been put in the firing line as more armed groups encroach on their territory.Photograph: Amazon FrontlinesThe lack of a strong state presence and institutions means the state has been incapable of dealing with these new threats in the area, such as fragmented gangs, recruitment of local populations and increased illegal mining, says Rivera.Over the past four years, armed groups have also sought to control goldmining in the Amazon rainforest, putting scientists working in conservation or with Indigenous populations in danger as they stand to expose these activities, says Rivera.

He says somebiologists have already received death threats, warning them to leave areas they are studying, such as in El Oro.Given the local and global threats faced by the climate and biodiversity crises, any impediments to forest conservation are a big setback, Yépez says. “We are definitely exceeding the planetary limit. So, preventing the development of conservation and training programmes is a terrible detriment to everyone,” he adds.As many scientists also work with local communities, they too will be left isolated in violent territories if researchers are forced to pull out.View image in fullscreenCofan Indigenous guards in Sinangoe patrol to look for illegal hunting, mining and oil prospectors in their territory.Photograph: Rodrigo Buendía/AFP/GettyGiannina Zamora, a specialist in geography and health with theAldea Foundation, an education charity, says funders have already withdrawn money from projects in areas seen as high-risk, such as Esmeraldas province, where she has worked for more than 20 years.That has made it harder to access these territories, making it more challenging to involve local communities in conservation initiatives, which is a pre-requisite for them to succeed.From pristine forest to prison fortress: why Ecuador is sacrificing fragile ecosystems to build jailsRead moreBut more isolated communities then find it harder to confront illegal acts in their territories, says Zamora. In some cases, outside researchers or partnerships with universities are the only ways these communities can access healthcare, education and jobs, she says.Rivera says that for the state to gain control of these territories it needs to intervene, not just with police and military force but also with healthcare, education and social programmes.In the Chocó, Raul says local organisations have allied to confront the violence collectively and adjust to these new realities, as he does not expect the situation to change soon. They plan to get special training but also expand local networks to alert them to dangers in the region.“The uncertainty that is going on at the moment is huge,” says Raul. “We don’t know what will happen as a country.”*Name has been changed to protect his identityExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanAmazon rainforestEndangered habitatsConservationEcuadorAmericasTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The militia faced little resistance in its latest march.One Bukavu resident, Blaise Byamungu, said the had been “abandoned by all the authorities and [taken] without any loyalist force”.“Is the government waiting for them to take over other towns to take action? It’s cowardice,” he said.The rebels marched to the governor’s office over the weekend. Bernard Byamungu, a leader of the group, stood in front of the office and promised to change the status quo. “We are going to clean up the disorder left over from the old regime,” Byamungu said to a small cheering crowd, telling them they had been living in a “jungle”.M23 is one of more than 100 armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. It says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to the DRC after taking part in the 1994 genocide inRwandathat targeted Tutsis.The DRC, the US and other countries have all accused Rwanda of backing M23, which the Rwandan government denies. UN expertssay Rwanda’s army is in “de facto control”of the group.The Burundian army had been supporting the Congolese army to protect Bukavu. M23’s capture of the city marks an unprecedented expansion of territory by the militia since it resurfaced in 2022. It also further risks escalating the conflict into a regional war.Almost 3,000 people were killed and a similar number injured in the fight for Goma.Fighting this year has worsened the humanitarian crisis in eastern DRC. It has destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters around Goma and Minova, leaving about 350,000 internally displaced people without protection,according to the UN.On Saturday, the Congo River Alliance, a coalition of militias including M23, said it was committed to “defending” the people of Bukavu. “We call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,” the rebels’ spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said.The DRC government urged calm.“It calls on the population of Bukavu to stay at home and not expose themselves to avoid being targeted by the occupying forces,” the communications ministry said on X.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandanewsShareReuse this content"

His post linked to a website where the digital coin could be bought, the domain name of which included Milei’s popular catchphrase “long live freedom”.“The world wants to invest inArgentina,” Milei added in the post to his more than 3.8 million followers.The token immediatelysoared in value, from almost zero at the time of its launch to nearly $5, before plummeting to under $1,according to trading sites. Argentina’sfintech chambersaid that the case could amount to a “rug pull” – a scam which sees cryptocurrency rapidly inflated, or “pumped”, before crashing while insiders “dump” their stake, making the tokens worthless. Other economists and crypto specialists said the digital asset could be a fraud or Ponzi scheme.Milei deleted his post hours later, saying he was “not aware of the details of the project”, but the scandal has nonetheless sparked a political firestorm, and the federal prosecutor’s office will reportedly now examine whether the president engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties.A group of lawyers filed fraud complaints in the criminal court on Sunday, saying they “criminally denounce the president of the Argentine nation,Javier Milei, because we believe that he is a fundamental participant in the development, execution and planning of the mega-scam related to the launch of the $Libra token”.Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs,told the Associated Pressthat he saw an illicit association to commit “an indeterminate number of frauds” in the episode. “Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential,” he said.Opposition lawmakers, meanwhile, are calling forMilei’s impeachment. “This scandal, which embarrasses us on an international scale, requires us to launch an impeachment request against the president,” said lawmaker Leandro Santoro, a member of the opposition coalition.Myriam Bregman, a prominent socialist leader and former presidential candidate, said “Milei is the one who must answer to the Congress. We want to know, step by step, who has benefited from it and how. This isnot the first timehe has been involved in something like that, but it is aggravated by his current role as president.”Former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner wrote on social media: “You promoted a private cryptocurrency from your official X account, created by who knows who. You inflated its value taking advantage of your presidential investiture. And, to top it all off, you say that you were ‘unfamiliar’! … From self-proclaimed ‘global leader’ to CRYPTO SCAMMER.”Latin American leaders also weighed in, with Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, saying that “it is extremely serious if confirmed, especially in terms of a president’s powers to promote something private”.The incident has prompted comparisons with the US president, Donald Trump, who last month launched the $Trump memecoin, which alsosurged before crashing.Milei retaliated to the criticism by blaming his opponents, whom he called “filthy rats of the political caste”, and saying they wanted to “take advantage of this situation to do harm”. The presidential office said that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency’s development and decided to remove the social media post to limit further exposure. It added that the anti-corruption office had been instructed tostart an investigation.Political analyst Marcelo García, of the Horizon Engage political risk consultancy firm, said Milei and his government need to “contain the crisis by giving a clear explanation of what happened” in order to prevent the incident from “escalating to a credibility crisis that could discourage the largest investment community”.Cryptocurrency hasexploded in Argentinain recent years, as disillusioned savers sought to keep their money outside traditional banks amid a decades-long economic crisis and soaring inflation rates.Analysts have warned that the crisis could damage Milei’s reputation as a custodian of economic recovery – and an anti-corruption president – ahead of midterm elections later this year.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaCryptocurrenciesJavier MileiE-commerceAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Those supporting the deal, including the UK, the EU and Japan, are hoping the levy will raise billions of dollars a year, which could be used to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate breakdown.Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia and 12 other countriesmade a submission to the IMOon 31 January opposing the plans. They argued a levy could reduce exports from the developing world, raise food prices and increase inequalities.They wrote: “A levy would not deliver a just and equitable transition [to low-CO2 shipping] and its adoption may trigger negative, economy-wide impacts … a levy is a fundamentally divisive proposal.”The countries also claim a levy is not needed to meet the IMO’s greenhouse gas reduction targets.Experts said the levy could still pass despite this opposition, if the IMO took a firm stance. At least 46 countries, representing about two thirds of the global shipping fleet, are thought to favour a deal. Some countries may also be won round through concessions on how the levy could be used, and the level at which it is set.The countries that are keenest on a levy are those most at risk from climate breakdown, many of them among the planet’s poorest. It will be hard for countries such asBraziland China to present themselves as champions of the developing world if they are pitted against what the most vulnerable nations are calling for.The impact of the levy is likely to be small in overall terms, reducing GDP by between 0.03% and 0.07%, according to estimates quoted in the submission.Brazil will host the Cop30 UN climate summit this November in Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon. The country has been engaged in intense diplomacy for the past year, and stepped up further last month with the appointment of the Cop president-designate,the veteran diplomat André Corrêa do Lago.Brazil has also called for a global wealth tax on billionairesto fund development aid and climate adaptation efforts in poor countries.But maritime campaigners said Brazil’s stance on a shipping levy was the result of its highly export-dependent economy.John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at IMO, said: “Brazil is very sensitive, in thinking that because of its exports of large quantities of dry goods, the levy would have a greater impact.”If there is little sign of agreement, the IMO could force discussions to a point. By longstanding tradition, the organisation tries to seek consensus, but some measures have been forced through in the past despite disagreement from some of the 176 member states.Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the IMO, said he would “focus on identifying common ground and build consensus”, and pointed out that members had previously agreed to adopt some form of emissions pricing mechanism this year. He said: “The complexities cannot be underestimated. [But] I am positive that we can achieve the required progress to meet our timeline.”A further complicating factor is Donald Trump’s presidency of the US. The IMO is not thought to be one of his priorities, and the US has not formally adopted a position on the levy in the past. Some think the US could “sit this one out”, in the words of one diplomat.But even if the US does not obstruct a deal,Trump’s threats of sweeping tariffsare deeply unsettling for countries concerned about global trade.Delaine McCullough, a campaign manager at Ocean Conservancy, pointed out that Trump’s tariffs were far more disruptive than any likely impact from a shipping levy. “The cost of a levy would be dwarfed by the tariff levels [Trump is proposing],” she said.Friederike Roder, director of the secretariat for the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, which brings togethercountries calling for levies to fund climate action, saidTrump’s actions on freezing USAidshowed the need for stable, predictable means of financing development, of the kind that only levies and similar mechanisms can provide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Heavily polluting sectors should be taxed more than cleaner parts of the economy.”Among the likely flashpoints in the shipping levy discussions are the questions of how the proceeds from the levy should be spent, and the level at which it should be set.Some within the shipping industry want all the revenues to be devoted to helping countries and companies move to lower-CO2 fuels and vessels. But many poor developing countries vehemently oppose this, arguing that the revenues should be considered as climate finance, to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of extreme weather.In aproposal submitted in January, the International Chamber of Shipping and countries including the UK and Japan, as well as the EU, suggested the levy should be set between $18.75 (£14.95) and $150 (£120) per tonne of CO2. Even the upper end of the scale is likely to be the minimum needed to encourage real change in shipping practices, according to Maggs.The five-day negotiating session at the IMO headquarters in London, which ends on Friday, will be followed by another round of talks in March, before a decision is due to be taken in April. Talks on climate issues at the IMO have a history of dragging on. It was originally hoped that the levy would be agreed, after years of talks, in the summer of 2023, butthat round failed– and it tookmost of the past two decadesto force countries and their shipping industries toaccept the need for mandatory CO2 reductions.As well as the carbon levy, the talks will cover a “carbon intensity indicator”, fuel standards and energy efficiency. These are also essential for reducing the CO2 output of the shipping industry, which accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.In part because of the way that shipping contracts are drawn up, ships tend to get to ports as quickly as possible, even if they know there is no berth ready for them, in which case they linger near the ports until ready. This “go fast and wait” strategy is wasteful of fuel, and produces far more CO2 than necessary – a reduction of 10% in speed would equate to a 20% cut in emissions, according to Maggs.Agreeing on CO2 targets and efficiency measures could make a vast difference in the short term, he said. “It’s a very potent way to bring emissions down quickly.”This article was amended on 17 February 2025. An earlier version referred to John Maggs as shipping policy director at Seas At Risk. Maggs left that organisation in 2024, and is currently the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the International Maritime Organisation.Explore more on these topicsBrazilCop30Climate crisisShipping emissionsShipping industryAmericasUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the US will support Taiwan’s membership in international organisations “where applicable”.Taipei hailed the move as “positive and friendly” while Washington’s de facto embassy on the island described it as “routine” – but the language used to describe US-Taiwan relations is highly sensitive and has provoked an angry response in China.A spokesperson for Beijing’s Taiwan affairs office said on Monday that the change “sends seriously wrong signals to ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and will only damage peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”.“We urge the US side to … correct its mistakes and prudently handle the Taiwan issue,” spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said in a statement.The maps that show how China’s military is squeezing TaiwanRead more“No matter how much Taiwan and the US collude and scheme with each other, they will never be able to change the fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of it,” she said.The update to the website came roughly three weeks after Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White House.Beijing hasramped up pressure on Taipei in recent years, luring away its political allies and holding vast military drills around the island.The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” said a state department spokesperson.“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.Trump’s return has roiled the delicate diplomatic balance, with Taiwanese leaders seeking to get onside with his transactional worldview.Trump has frayed nerves by suggesting Taiwan should pay the United States for protection and by blaming the island for the woes of the American chip industry.Explore more on these topicsChinaTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He also said its private business had “broad prospects and great promise” to create wealth and opportunity.China’s governance and the scale of its market give it an inherent advantage in developing new industries, Xi said.“It is the right time for the majority of private business and entrepreneurs to show their talent,” he was quoted as saying in remarks state media called an “important speech”.Xi has spearheaded campaigns to increase government control over private industry, particularly in technology, which was considered to be unruly and disruptive as it underwent huge expansion, seemingly unconcerned by the tight state controls around other industries.But China is now struggling with an economic downturn driven by a housing crisis, stagnant low consumption and high youth unemployment.The meeting took place at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, with video on the state broadcaster CCTV on Monday showing Ma standing and applauding as Xi entered a room. Xi, Ren, and BYD’s Wang Chuanfu were filmed giving speeches but no audio or transcripts have been published.Liang Wenfeng, the founder of DeepSeek, a startup that is threatening to upset the tech world order with its artificial intelligence models, was also present.The presence of top executives and companies at these high-profile events are typically seen by foreign investors as a sign of the businesses or individuals that are favoured by the government.The meeting with Ma was closely watched as the billionaire was once the most high-profiletarget of Chinese regulators, and oncedisappeared from public view for several monthsafter a speech in 2020 in which he criticised Xi.Investors on Monday were scouring pictures and footage of the meeting to spot top bosses and trading accordingly.Executives from two of the Chinese tech industry’s biggest players – ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, and Baidu, which specialises in search and AI – did not attend, Reuters reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, reports of Xi’s visit to the symposium, which first emerged on Friday, helped spur gains in Asian markets as it raised hopes of renewed support in China’s private tech sector, which has been targeted by rounds of government crackdowns in the last few years.The tightly choreographed pro-business rally reflected policymakers’ concern about a slowdown in growth and efforts by the US to limit China’s technological development, analysts said.Xi’s move to gather business leaders underscores the importance of private-sector innovation for China to gain ground in technology, they said.“It’s a tacit acknowledgment that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the US,” said Christopher Beddor, the deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. “The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the US.”Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsChinese economyChinaAsia PacificTechnology sectorXi JinpingAlibabaJack ManewsShareReuse this content"

That scheme, originally designed to help smooth online shopping, is being revoked after it emerged that the number of shipments under the “de minimis” rules had ballooned to more than 1bn, valued at $54.5bn by 2023 – most of them from China or Hong Kong via firms includingSheinand Temu.“You are looking at an increase of $30 to $50 per consignment [group of parcels],” said Brad Ashton at the advisory firm RSM. “It is creating a perfect storm for online retailers putting goods into the US market. It has a lot of the hallmarks of Brexit in terms of its potential impact on small traders.Businesses will see their margins eroded because costs will increase. We may get to a point where the changes make a UK business uncompetitive in selling to the US.Brad Ashton, RSM“Businesses will see their margins eroded because costs will increase. We may get to a point where the changes make a UK business uncompetitive in selling to the US.”The widespread use of Chinese factories for many British brands, particularly in fashion, means businesses such asAsosand Boohoo will be drawn in, as well as many UK independent marketplace sellers.It will not just affect goods made inChinaand then sent from the UK, but potentially a much wider array, as any package containing even one product made in China may have to pay import tax and pass through customs checks, further increasing costs, according to experts.There is also an expectation that the de minimis rules will eventually be scrapped for all imports, no matter their origin.About $5bn worth of parcels were exported to the US from the UK under de minimis rules in 2021, according to aCongressional Research Service analysisof data from US Customs and Border Protection. About 80% of that was estimated to be related to online retail, with fashion likely to be a large proportion of it.Chris White, at the logistics company Fulfilmentcrowd, said that during the brief period when the rules were in place in early February, one-third of the parcels it shipped to the US from the UK were found to be of Chinese origin and subject to the new taxes.Fast-fashion specialists Asos and Boohoo sell about £300m of clothing a year to the US. Both are already struggling to compete with the rise of Shein and high street retailers, which have revived after the Covid pandemic. John Stevenson, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt, said Asos and Boohoo would have to “adjust prices or take a view on [the] profitability of operating in the US”.As well as the higher tax charges, customs checks required after the rule change will add as much as two days to the processing of orders, making UK retailers less competitive with US-based operators on the speed of delivery.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

White said that during the period when the new rules were in place, similar parcels were loaded with different levels of duty as local customs officers made different decisions.He said a further element of the rule change might be to expose brands that were “trading on an image of being British or European” as being “made in China and not Savile Row”, potentially damaging their appeal.There would be “lots of crossed fingers and puzzled faces” over the changes in legislation, with retailers potentially opening more US warehousing or, longer term, to switch sources of supply, White added.Boohoo closed its US warehouse earlier this year, and Asos is scheduled to close its facility there in November. However, a reversal could be on the cards if the de minimis rules are confirmed. Many fast-fashion companies have already diversified their supply chains – making more in India, Bangladesh or Turkey. Trump’s tax changes could accelerate this further.Shein is reportedly incentivising Chinese suppliers to set up in Vietnam, according to a report by Bloomberg.It is not clear when the new rules might be implemented as the US tries to put the technology and workforce in place to handle the new system. Experts say it could take weeks or months.While there is a chance that Trump will change his mind, as he has done on tariffs with Canada and Mexico, no business can bet on which way the US might jump.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeRetail industryE-commerceTrump administrationSmall businessChinaeBaynewsShareReuse this content"

Shanmugam had said there was no record in the police files of such an incident and Khan eventually admitted to lying about the story.Singh was then accused of lying to the parliamentary committee investigating Khan.He allegedly told the committee that he was not aware that Khan had made up the story about the rape victim, in an apparent attempt to downplay his own responsibility as party leader, court documents said.In the 2020 general elections,the PAP won 83 of the 93 seatsat stake to retain its dominance.Son of Singapore founder says ‘campaign of persecution’ forced him to seek asylum in UKRead moreBut the main opposition Workers’ Party stole the show when it captured 10 seats, four more than previously held, in its strongest performance yet since independence in 1965.Its leaders have said they hope to further increase the party’s numbers in parliament in the upcoming elections which will be new premier Lawrence Wong’s first major political test.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsSingaporeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

There areobligations between the two nationsto regularly consult on defence and security due to their special constitutional relationship.Brown said his country’s relations with New Zealand and other partners were not affected by the new accord.“The Cook Islands will continue to make strategic decisions in the best long-term interests of our people,” the prime minister said. “Our relationship and engagement with China complements, not replaces, our longstanding relationships with New Zealand and our various other bilateral, regional and multilateral partners.”The agreement would be released online “in the coming days”, Brown said.New Zealand prime minister Christopher Luxon told media on Monday that the government had not yet seen a copy of the agreement. “We want to see those documents, we’ll go through them and then we’ll have a conversation with the Cook Islands directly,” Luxon said.A spokesperson for New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters said he was reserving comment until details of the agreement were released, but noted the minister has complained of a lack of transparency and consultation over the trip, describing it as “a matter of significant concern”.In a statement released on Saturday, the last of day of his China visit, Brown said the accord set a framework for engagement in areas including trade, investment, ocean science, infrastructure and transport.“This provides opportunities for our government, our private sector and our people to benefit from enhanced partnership opportunities with China in areas aligned with our national interests and long-term development goals,” he said.Speaking to mediaon his return to the Cook Islands, Brown said he hoped to meet New Zealand officials in the coming weeks to “heal some of the rift that has occurred from our side”.“I’m sure once the New Zealand government has a look at it there will be nothing for them to be concerned about,” he said.Trawl the sea or mine for metals?

The NZD$500,000 campaign will run on radios and social media in Australia between February and March.“What this Tourism New Zealand campaign says to our Aussie mates is that we’re open for business, there are some great deals on, and we’d love to see you soon,” said Louise Upston, the tourism minister.But the tagline – set against photographs of people sightseeing – quickly became the subject of derision inside New Zealand, with opposition politicians and social media users likening it to a clearance sale advertisement, a marketing campaign for the apocalypse, or a desperate plea for access to the lavatory.The Green Party’s tourism spokesperson, Celia Wade-Brown, told national broadcaster RNZ the tagline “might refer to the need for toilets in some of our high-tourist spots. I mean, the queues are ridiculous”.Responding to the criticism, a spokesperson for the minister told the Guardian that Upston was “very pleased” with the campaign and said it had attracted positive feedback from tourism operators and amarketing expert.The tourism campaign is the latest in the government’sattempt to attract tourists, digital nomadsand overseas investors to New Zealand to boost the economy. Prior to the pandemic, tourism was New Zealand’s largest export industry and delivered $40.9bn to the country. The most recent figures show those numbers are creeping back up, with tourism bringing in $37.7bn in 2023.Australia is New Zealand’s largest tourism market, making up roughly 44% of international visitors a year. Visitor numbers are sitting at roughly 88% of pre-pandemic rates.“The number of Australian arrivals in New Zealand increased by more than 90,000, up from 1.27 million to 1.36 million over the past year, but we know there’s more room to grow,” Upston said in a release.New Zealand’s overseas tourism campaigns have a long history of attracting both praise and criticism. The award-winning 100% Pure New Zealand promotion - now one of the world’s longest-running tourism campaigns - is lauded for its catchiness but often scrutinised against New Zealand’s inconsistent environmental credentials.Labour’s tourism spokesperson Cushla Tangaere-Manuel told RNZ while she broadly supported growing tourism, the latest tourism tagline was tone-deaf at a time when the coalition government isdisestablishing thousands of rolesacross the public sector in a major cost-cutting drive.“The irony of that messaging is: that’s how Aotearoa New Zealanders are feeling right now – there have been so many cuts,” Tangaere-Manuel said.Some critics said the tagline was tactless for sounding like a directive to New Zealanders to leave the country amidrecord high departure rates.“If I was in a [government] seeing record emigration I simply would not pick “everyone must go” as a slogan,” said one social media user.Others took the opportunity to turn the campaign back on the government.“The upside of the gormless “everyone must go” slogan is that by rights it should be easy to invert for election posters and protest signs …. Done. Dusted. And their own fault,” wrote a BlueSky user.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandTourism (Australia)Asia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron said on X.“Otherwise, there is a risk that this ceasefire will end up like the Minsk agreements,” he said, referring to the pacts that sought to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015.Starmer insisted that the US is not poised to leave Nato, but said the issue of burden-sharing within the alliance had become pressing. “In this moment we have to realise the new era we are now in and not cling hopelessly to the comforts of the past and to take responsibility for our security and our continent,” he said.UK defence officials say that even if a 30,000-strong European force is deployed away from the frontline in a reassurance role, it will need the protections, including air cover and logistics, that only Nato – specifically the US – can provide.Scholz agreed with Starmer that such a force was inconceivable without US backing, but criticised the conversation about troops as “completely premature and the completely wrong time to have this discussion now”. He was “even a little irritated” by the debate. “We are not yet at peace, but in the middle of a war waged brutally by Russia, which is being pushed forward without consideration,” he said.In a summit that was never intended to reach a decision, the clearest consensus was around increasing defence spending.The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said: “We will not be able to effectively help Ukraine if we do not immediately take concrete steps regarding our own defence capabilities. If Europe, and this is the case today, is not able to counter Russia’s military potential, then we must immediately catch up.”Scholz too said he wanted a focus on how Europe could remove defence spending increases from fiscal debt rules. “It is quite clear that our continued and necessary support for Ukraine is only possible if we can decide to finance it separately,” he said. He added the German debt brake should not apply to defence spending above 2% and that the country could mobilise an additional €30bn annually.Criticising Trump’s decision to rush into peace talks with Russia, he said it was “highly inappropriate” that a debate had started about the outcome of talks that had not yet taken place, and were being conducted without the involvement of Ukraine. He said “it is very clear to us: we must continue to support Ukraine – and it must and can rely on us”.Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said all European nations should boost their support for Ukraine and defence spending at home to protect themselves against Moscow. “Russia is threatening all of Europe now, unfortunately,” she said.European leaders are increasingly concerned that Trump is rushing to strike an immediate ceasefire with Russia that Ukraine and Europe will only be able shape at the margin.Reflecting those concerns, Tusk said: “Everyone at this meeting is aware that transatlantic relations, the Nato alliance and our friendship with the United States have entered a new phase. We all see that.”Meanwhile, senior Russian and American diplomats are due to meet in Riyadh on Wednesday to follow up on the surprise phone call to Putin initiated by Trump last week.Trump’s special Ukraine envoy, Gen Keith Kellogg, stressed Trump wanted a quick deal: “We are now at Trump time, which means I get an assignment today and tomorrow at noon he asks me why it hasn’t been done yet.”Scholz argued there must be “no division of security and responsibility between Europe and the USA”, effectively ruling out German participation in a reassurance force in the context of a ceasefire if the US does not agree to participate militarily in the peacekeeping mission.So far the US has refused to commit to providing any help to a putative European force.“Nato is based on the fact that we always act together and take risks together, thereby ensuring our security. This must not be called into question,” Scholz said.Poland has long said it will not deploy troops in Ukraine, arguing its role as defending central Europe. Italy and Spain are also opposed to sending troops without greater clarity about the US role.Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who arrived nearly an hour late for the summit, said the option “that involves the deployment of European soldiers in Ukraine seems to me to be the most complex and perhaps the least effective”.“Other avenues should be explored that also include the involvement of the United States, because it is in the Euro-Atlantic context that European and American security is founded,” she said.France’s twin purpose in calling the meeting had been to conjure a vivid, unified display of European solidarity with Ukraine, and to forge a strategy to persuade Trump that Europe, with its own security and resources at stake in the Ukraine talks, has an unimpeachable right to a seat at the table.Macron, a lifelong exponent of a stronger European security dimension, also wanted the summit to open discussions on the level of contributions the big European powers could assemble for a reassurance force.With trust between Washington and Europe at a low ebb, there is also increasing concern among European diplomats that Trump may decide, as a goodwill gesture, to unilaterally lift key sanctions on Russia, relieving the growing pressure on its economy.Moscow is angling for sanctions to be lifted as part of the package that reopens diplomatic relations between Russia and the US. Russia is hoping the US will also signal a withdrawal of American troops from the continent.US officials, both in public and private, have put different emphases on aspects of the deal, including how Ukraine will be consulted, leading many European diplomats to believe the US does not yet have a single coherent plan.The US has sent mixed messages about Ukrainian and European involvement in the talks, with Michael Kellog saying it was “not reasonable to have everyone sitting at the table for a Ukraine peace deal”.In a bid to shore up Trump’s exclusion of Europe from the process, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: “I do not know what Europe would do at the negotiating table. Given the attitude of European states to the war, he is not sure what contribution they would make if they were invited. If Europe wants to continue the war in Ukraine, why should it be invited to negotiations.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerDonald TrumpEuropeOlaf ScholznewsShareReuse this content"

After dozens of summits at which a hesitant and discordant EU had failed to agree on anything like a cohesive plan for the end of the war inUkraine, this one had, suddenly and vitally, to be different.The leaders of France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain and – speaking for the Nordic and Baltic states – Denmark, plus Britain’s prime minister and the heads of Nato and the European Commission and Council, arrived in Paris reeling from a historic week.Last Monday, the US vice-president, JD Vance,had told Europeits “excessive regulation” of potentially harmful technologies was all wrong. Two days later,Donald Trump called Vladimir Putinto start talks between the US and Russia on ending the war.The same day, the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth,told his European opposite numbersat a meeting in Brussels that the US was no longer “primarily focused” on Europe’s security and the continent would have to take the lead in defending Ukraine.Zelenskyy’s week from hell: shock in Ukraine as Trump abandons KyivRead moreOn Friday came Vance’scoup de grâce:a violent ideological assaultaccusing European democracies of quashing free speech, bowing to multiculturalism and running scared of voters. Forget Russia: the real threat to Europe, he said, was “from within”.The US vice-president then declined to talk to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, insteadmeeting Alice Weidel, the leader of the far-right AfD, a party that Germany’s security agency keeps under surveillance as a potential threat to democracy.In five days, leaders were made forcefully aware of three realities: first, the US and Europe appeared no longer to share the values that, since 1945, had underpinned the transatlantic alliance. Second, Europe could no longer rely on the US to defend it.Third – on the immediate question to which Europe was most eagerly awaiting an answer – the US plan, insofar as it actually exists, did not seem to include a place at the table for Europe (including, for that matter, Ukraine).Monday’s Paris summit wasconvened by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, because, in the words of an Elysée adviser, “there is now a necessity for Europeans to do more, better and in a coherent way, for our collective security”.Those attending were deemed to be the most determined, but also the best equipped, a coalition not just of the willing but the capable – including Britain, no longer an EU member but a major contributor to Ukraine and a potent European military force.Arriving in Paris, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe’s security was “at a turning point. Yes, it’s about Ukraine – but also about us. We need an urgency mindset. We need a surge in defence. And we need both now.”But Monday’s summit is likely to be the first of many on the road to a coherent European security policy for Ukraine and for Europe more broadly: Europe’s security environment may have changed, fundamentally, but Europe has not.It has its “enemies within”:populist, far-right, Moscow-friendly, pro-Trump governmentsthat will block a common security policy where they can. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, lost no time in denouncing Monday’s summit.The meeting was a gathering of “pro-war, anti-Trump, frustrated European leaders” aimed at “preventing a peace agreement in Ukraine”, he said, adding that unlike them, Budapest “supports Donald Trump’s ambitions … and wants peace in Ukraine”.Robert Fico, Slovakia’s populist prime minister, also had a go. EU officials had no mandate for Europe’s role in any Ukraine ceasefire, he said, adding that the discussions did not concern the EU and their participation hurt confidence in the bloc.As the US retreats, Europe must look out for itself – so is Macron’s nuclear offer the answer? | Simon TisdallRead moreCountries not invited to the Paris talks were also grumbling. “Even within the EU, not all states are treated equally,” said Slovenia’s pro-European president, Nataša Pirc Musar. “This is not the Europe we aspire to [or] the Europe that will be respected.”Other leaders will dread the impact of a big increase in defence spending on already fraught domestic politics. According to Nato, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Croatia, Luxembourg and Slovenia all spend less than the target 2% of GDP on defence.There are mighty battles in prospect over more shared borrowing – which Germany, among others, strongly opposes – to fund Europe’s collective security needs, and over the use of frozen Russian assets.More immediately, there are differences over Ukraine’s postwar security guarantees.Macron had already raised the possibilityof an eventual European peacekeeping force in Ukraine last year, and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, said on Sunday the UK wasprepared to put troops on the ground. Sweden followed suit on Monday.The Netherlands said it was “not negative” about the idea, but Germany said it was “premature” and Poland – which at 4% spends more of its GDP per head on defence than any other Nato member – said it was “not planning to send any Polish troops”.EU diplomats acknowledge the Trump administration’s brutally transactional, unashamedly ideological stance could splinter Europe’s already fragile unity. Whether or not it does, they say, could depend on the process of which Monday’s Paris meeting is but the first step.Explore more on these topicsEuropeUkraineTrump administrationRussiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

All four were released in April 2014 after 10 months in captivity.The trial that opened in Paris on Monday comes after French investigators carried out a 10-year inquiry stretching across more than a dozen countries.In the dock alongside Nemmouche are Abdelmalek Tanem, 35, a French national accused of being another IS jailer, and a Syrian man, Kais Al Abdallah, 41, who is accused of having helped the terror group to kidnap the journalists. Both have denied the charges.Also on trial but not present in court are the high-ranking IS leader Oussama Atar, previously convicted in absentia for coordinating the wave of terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, including at the Bataclan concert hall, and Salim Benghalem, accused of being in charge of the terrorist group’s hostage-holding operation. Both are reported to have died in Syria.The prosecutor’s office accuses the five of running a “hostage factory” and “torture training centres” in which those being held were subject to psychological and physical punishment.On his release François recounted how Nemmouche had crushed his fingers and pulled out his nails. Hénin said the jihadist had made him kneel in front of a wall and prepare to be decapitated. At the opening of the trial on Monday, Nemmouche said the first time he saw Hénin “was at the court in Brussels”.Hénin said the IS cell treated Syrian captives even worse than the westerners. “The Syrian prisoners were terrified of being tortured by the jihadists who would scream at them in French,” he said, adding that local prisoners were often suspended on hooks and had their throats cut.“We asked ourselves if we would be next, they said we would end up having our heads cut off,” Hénin added.The former hostages told investigators they had recognised Nemmouche as one of their jailers, who had called himself Abu Omar, when he was arrested after the bombing in Belgium and his photograph circulated in the press.They told police Nemmouche was “talkative”, “perverse” and “committed to religious ethnic cleansing”.A number of other convicted jihadists, including one in jail in the US, are expected to give evidence in the trial, which will continue for five weeks.Explore more on these topicsFranceSyriaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He slowed down,he told Reuters, “because there were many people, some running, some scared, and some were shouting for help”.It was then that he noticed that one of the people at the scene had a knife. “I immediately understood what was happening – there were people on the ground bleeding, and this person was waving the knife in a threatening manner.”Al-Halabi sprang into action. “I immediately drove toward him and hit him with my car. The good thing is that the impact wasn’t too strong, thank God,” he said. “I mean, the goal of hitting him with the car was just to neutralise him or stop what he was doing. The goal wasn’t to harm anyone.”View image in fullscreenAlaaeddin al-Halabi.Photograph: ReutersIn the confusion that followed, al-Halabi said he was shocked to see some in the crowd turn on him,telling the newspaper Kleinen Zeitungthat he locked himself into his car as some people began to hit his vehicle. Speaking to Reuters, he said: “People attacked me after the incident – people on the street thought I was carrying out an attack like what happened in Germany.”The attack came days after a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seekerdrove a carinto a trade union demonstration in neighbouring Germany,killing a two-year-old girland her mother as well as injuring 37 others. It was the fifth high-profile attack involving migrants to Germany in the past nine months, leading politicians to seize onmigration as a talking pointbefore snap elections on 23 February.Saturday’s attack in Austria killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded five others, all of whom were believed to have been targeted randomly.Speaking to reporters, the police spokesperson Rainer Dionisio later said al-Halabi’s actions had played a role in halting the attack. “It was probably a heroic act, yes. It prevented something worse from happening,” he said.The sentiment was echoed by the mayor of Villach, Günther Albel. “We are very grateful to the man who intervened selflessly, courageously and decisively and thus prevented something even worse from happening, as well as to the rapid deployment of the police,” he saidin a statement.The state governor, Peter Kaiser, also thanked al-Halabi, saying that his intervention “shows how closely terrorist evil but also human good can be united in one and the same nationality”.As media across Austria described al-Halabi as a hero, the 42-year-old brushed off the label. “People look at me as a hero, but I don’t see it that way,” he said. “I say to people: ‘Please, if something like this happens again, you have to do something. You can’t just stand there, take photos and film videos.’”As Austria reeled from the stabbing, rightwing politicians sought toreinforce their hardline viewson migration. Late last year, Austria was among the dozen European countriesthat suspendedthe processing of asylum applications from Syrians after thefall of the Assad regimein Damascus. Officials in Austria said they were preparing a “repatriation and deportation” programme to the country.The attack was the country’s second deadly extremist attack in recent years. In November 2020, a man who had previously attempted to join the Islamic State group carried out arampage in Vienna, armed with an automatic rifle and a fake explosive vest, killing four people before he was fatally shot by police.In August, authorities foiled plansfor an attackon a Taylor Swift concert that was inspired by the Islamic State group.In the wake of Saturday’s attack, those who weighed in included the Free Syrian Community of Austria, a support group for Syrians, who expressed its deepest condolences to the victims’ families and sought to distance the suspect from the tens of thousands of Syrians who live in the country peacefully.“We all had to flee Syria, our home country, because we were no longer safe there – no one left their country voluntarily. We are grateful to have found asylum and protection in Austria,” it said on social media. “We would like to emphasise: anyone who causes strife and disturbs the peace of society does not represent the Syrians who have sought and received protection here.”Explore more on these topicsAustriaEuropeIslamic StatenewsShareReuse this content"

The new administration will only talk to Iran, Waltz added, if “they want to give up their entire programme and not play games as we’ve seen Iran do in the past in prior negotiations”.Earlier this month, Trump offered the Iranian regime a stark choice.“I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear,” hetold the New York Post. “I would prefer that to bombing the hell out of it.”In politics as in business, Trump’s vaunted “art of the deal” has relied heavily on bluster and threats, but analysts question how well that will work with Tehran. They also warn that the window for a diplomatic resolution to the standoff with Tehran will get narrower with each passing month, as Iranian nuclear capabilities progress, and Netanyahu works to persuade Trump to participate in joint strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities while it is at its most vulnerable.Israel’s prime minister has tried and failed to convince successive US administrations to take part in military action against Iran, including Trump’s. During his first term in the White House, Trump declined, in line with his aim of keeping the US out of foreign wars.In 2018, however, Trump did fulfil another Netanyahu request,withdrawing the USfrom a three-year-old multilateral agreement that had constrained Iran’s programme in return for sanctions relief. Since then, Iran haspushed forward with nuclear developmentand now produces increasing amounts of 60%-enriched uranium, which means it is a small technical step away from the production of weapons-grade fissile material.Tehran insists it has no intention of making a nuclear weapon and remains a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, could upend that policy if Iran’s nuclear sites came under threat.Israel and Iran launched a series of tit-for-tat attacks on each other last year, culminating in substantialIsraeli airstrikes on 25 Octoberthat inflicted significant damage on Iran’s air defences.That damage, combined with Israel’s crippling campaign over the past year against Iran’s most important ally in the region, Hezbollah, has left Iran in its most militarily vulnerable state for decades.View image in fullscreenIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, with members of the air force in Tehran earlier this month.Photograph: Iranian supreme leader's website/AFP/Getty ImagesStanding alongside the new US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Sunday, Netanyahu made clear he wanted to take advantage of that vulnerability.“Over the last 16 months, Israel has dealt a mighty blow to Iran’s terror axis. Under the strong leadership of President Trump, and with your unflinching support, I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,” he said.US intelligence agencies have been briefing reporters over the past week that they believeIsrael is likely to attackIranian nuclear sites in the first half of 2025. Butthe intelligence assessmentsalso underlined Israeli reliance on US support in the form of aerial refuelling, intelligence and reconnaissance. US officials also said such strikes would, at most, set back Iran’s programme by a few months, and could trigger Tehran’s decision to take the decisive step towards making weapons-grade uranium.Whatever the misgivings in Washington, theTrump administrationapproved the sale earlier this month of guidance kits for bunker-busting BLU-109 bombs, likely to be essential in inflicting damage on Iran’s most deeply buried enrichment plant at Fordow.Netanyahu was the first foreign visitor to be invited to the White House after Trump’s re-election, andaccording to the Washington Post, the two leaders discussed “several possible levels of American backing, ranging from active military support for a kinetic strike – such as intelligence, refuelling or other assistance – to more limited political backing for a coercive ultimatum”.Raz Zimmt, a research fellow and Iran expert at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said there was another clock ticking on diplomacy with Iran. Under the 2015 nuclear agreement, its remaining signatories, including the UK, France and Germany, can trigger a “snap back” of all international sanctions on Iran, but that leverage expires in October this year, giving European capitals the options of “use it or lose it”. If the mechanism is triggered, it could lead to a further escalation, Zimmt said.Top Iranian politician appeals to Trump to restart nuclear deal negotiationsRead more“I think there is a very limited diplomatic window of opportunity until August or September, to reach some kind of settlement between Iran and the US,” he said. “If there is no agreement by then … I think it will be much easier for Netanyahu to get not just a green light [from Washington] but perhaps some kind of military capabilities which will make it easier for Israel to achieve a broader and more effective impact.”Netanyahu regularly describes Trump as the “best friend” Israel ever had in the White House, a description echoed by Rubio and other administration officials, but that friendship will be put to a decisive test as Israel continues to press the case for an attack on Iran.Ariane Tabatabai, a Pentagon policy adviser in the Biden administration, said it would fuel “tension between the ‘restraint’ camp in the administration and the more traditional Republicans who are more inclined toward a more forceful approach to Iran”.“It’s not clear yet in these early days which group will have more influence in the inter-agency process and ultimately drive policy, but that’ll be a factor as well.” Tabatabai said.Trump prides himself in keeping the US out of foreign wars, but he has shown himself ready to take military action against Tehran, ordering theassassination by droneof a Revolutionary Guards commander, Qassem Suleimani, in Baghdad in January 2020.Saudi Arabia isreportedly offering to mediateto avoid a conflagration, but even if Trump wanted to hammer out a deal, argued Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, Trump’s browbeating style of negotiation could easily backfire when it came to Tehran.“The Trump style is he goes in heavy,” Vatanka said. “But Ali Khamenei has to be extremely careful how he responds to Trump so his personal image is not damaged.”“Iran has been weakened in the region – no doubt about it – but they still claim to be leading proponents of the Islamic cause who stand up to western bullying,” he added. “So what might work with certain countries in Europe or in Latin America will not necessarily work with the Iranian regime.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranIsraelIran nuclear dealMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

I am committed to US president Trump’s plan for the creation of a different Gaza.”The remarks come after a report by Sky News Arabia on Sunday night thatHamaswas prepared to hand over control of Gaza to its West Bank-based rival, the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority (PA), following pressure from mediator Egypt.The broadcaster said, citing Egyptian sources, that the Palestinian militant group had agreed to the establishment of a temporary committee to overseethe reconstruction of the territory,which has been levelled by Israeli airstrikes over 16 months of war.Netanyahu’s latest comments will weigh heavily over the future of the month-old truce after italmost collapsed last weekfollowing news of Trump’s surprise plan for the US to “take over” Gaza and“relocate” its 2.3 million people to countries such as Egypt and Jordan.International humanitarian law experts say the proposal amounts to ethnic cleansing.Netanyahu’s defence minister, Israel Katz, announced the establishment of a new agency late on Monday to oversee the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians fromGaza.A three-month-old ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah is also in doubt ahead of Tuesday’s deadline for Israel to withdraw remaining troops from its northern neighbour.In a briefing on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson, Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, told reporters that Israeli forces would remain in five “strategic locations” over the border in order to protect nearby Israeli towns and villages, an announcement met with frustration by Lebanese officials.Israel’s security cabinet is set to decide on Monday evening whether to send a delegation to the Qatari capital, Doha, to discuss the difficult second stage of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. The second phase is scheduled to begin in early March, and would involve the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, effectively ending the war. The third phase is supposed to address the exchange of bodies, a reconstruction plan for Gaza, and future governance.Donald Trump’s Gaza plan: the key takeawaysRead moreAccording to Israeli media, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich’s far-right Religious Zionism party, which was opposed to the ceasefire, is still threatening to collapse Netanyahu’s coalition if Israel does not return to fighting when the first stage of the truce expires.It is widely believed at home and abroad that Netanyahu, afraid that losing office will leave him more vulnerable to corruption charges, has prioritised the survival of his government over a hostage deal.While Israeli public opinion isunlikely to swaygovernment decision making on the war, protests were held across the country on Monday to mark 500 days since Israeli hostages were kidnapped and taken to Gaza in the Hamas attack of October 2023 that triggered the conflict. In Jerusalem, dozens of demonstrators marched to Netanyahu’s residence, chanting slogans and carrying banners that read “Home Now”, before meeting lawmakers at the Knesset.Captives have been released in batches of three or four in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees on a weekly basis since 19 January, but about 45 more Israelis and foreign nationals are not eligible for release until the second stage of the agreement.Israel is preparing to receive the bodies of four hostages from Gaza on Thursday and is working on bringing back six living hostages in the next scheduled release on Saturday, an Israeli security official said on Monday. If the handovers are successful, the timeline for the start of the second stage of the truce will be moved up by a week.Netanyahu has repeatedly publicly embraced Trump’s plan for the US to take ownership of Gaza and redevelop the coastal strip as a resort, telling reporters on Sunday during a visit to Israel by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, that the government was “working closely” alongside Washington to implement the Trump proposal.The US president’s vision for Gaza has been flatly rejected by the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world, which is now scrambling to come up with alternatives.Saudi Arabia is hosting a summit for delegations from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Friday, and the Arab League will convene to discuss the reconstruction of Gaza and governance options on 27 February.Reuters reported on Monday that the EU is planning to tell Israel next week that Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza should be ensured a dignified return and that Europe will contribute to rebuilding the shattered territory.In Lebanon, the IDF said the decision to maintain five positions in the country was a temporary measure that was approved by the US-led body monitoring the truce. The ceasefire was extended for another three weeks after the first deadline at the end of January.Lebanon’s president, Joseph Aoun, said in a statement that Lebanese officials were working diplomatically to achieve the Israeli withdrawal, and that he “will not accept that a single Israeli remains on Lebanese territory”. Under the agreement, the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers are supposed to patrol a buffer zone after the Israeli pullout.Also on Monday, the Israeli military said it had killed Muhammad Shaheen, a Hamas leader, in an airstrike in Sidon in southern Lebanon. The attack was the deepest Israeli strike on Lebanese territory since the ceasefire went into effect in November, freezing a two-month-old Israeli ground operation. Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel began trading cross-border fire on 8 October 2023, a day after the Hamas attack that began the war in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

After all this, you could say we’re experts.”Abdullah, now 14 and heading back to his prewar home in the north of the shattered territory, is the English-speaking narrator – one of three children whose stories of hope and endurance are at the heart of an hour-long film, a distinctive and deliberate choice intended to make the film resonate after 15 months of war.In an email exchange via theBBC, Abdullah said he wanted to be part of the programme “to explain the suffering that people here in Gaza witness with the language that the world understands, English” – and so that viewers learn about the situation on the ground without being “blurred by misinformation”.The documentary also features Renad, 10, who films herself cooking recipes “Gaza style” with her sister while trying to look brave when there is nearby bombing. “I get creative and it relieves my depression,” she says. Her goal (now achieved) is to reach 1 million Instagram followers.View image in fullscreenRenad, 10.Photograph: Renad/BBC/Hoyo FilmsAnd Zakaria, 11, who helps at the al-Aqsa hospital, where he lives, with the enforced maturity of an adult, transporting the dead and wounded, cleaning the ambulances, and dreaming one day to become a paramedic himself. Blood from patients stains the white gloves he is wearing, though he is barely disconcerted by it.View image in fullscreenZakaria, 11.Photograph: Amjad Al Fayoumi/BBC/Hoyo FilmsThe product of nine months of filming, the documentary by two BBC producers, Jamie Roberts (whose previous work includesUkraine: Enemy in the Woods) and Palestinian Yousef Hammash, was not originally to focus so heavily on children but the idea gradually emerged as the two reviewed footage collected by two Palestinian camera operators working in the besieged strip.“Focusing on children humanises the story,” said Hammash. “The news doesn’t give you a full image – our aim was to go beyond the news. It’s more than a film. The idea was to really engage with people’s living conditions, working with camera operators embedded in Gaza”.Around half of Gaza’s 2.1 million population are children, but Roberts said they only feature intermittently in news reports. Making them central characters in a documentary, filmed often in intimate close up, is intended to help viewers “see the war through their own eyes,” Roberts said, in an environment from where it has been difficult to report and harder still to follow individual stories.International media were banned from Gaza from the start of the conflict, and remain unable to access the territory where a fragile peace now holds. But there is an active community of Palestinian journalists and film-makers in the territory and through Hammash the production team were able to recruit two to work on the project.Amjad Al Fayoumi, a commercial film-maker whose studio in the north had been destroyed, and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba, who worked in news, went out filming daily, typically after what Roberts said was “an hour-long conversation in the morning” – and constant messaging, often to make sure everybody involved was safe.The first of the children the team focused on was Zakaria, who was spotted in passing after a bombing at the hospital, while they were filming with a taxi driver. “We saw him in the rushes, and we asked about him – he was well known around the area, and so he popped up as the first child we started to film,” Hammash said.Safety was an unending concern, the directors said, only partly mitigated by focusing on an Israel designated “safe zone” on the strip, which, as the documentary shows, was regularly bombed. Al Fayoumi’s tent was bombed four times, Hammash said, and at one point he was at the al-Aqsa hospital, from where he refused to leave despite an Israeli evacuation order.Israeli forces pushed up to the perimeter of the hospital but the paramedics were also intent of staying, fearful that if they left they would not be able to return. “He had got to the state of mind where there is no safe place in Gaza, and thankfully the tanks withdrew,” Roberts said.Though the trauma of the conflict is well known, the film, though at times unflinching, is often positive. It ends on the hopeful note of the ceasefire announcement – a moment now made more poignant because there are fears the peace will not hold. “Now I have hope,” Renad beams with a sincerity it would be heartbreaking to see extinguished.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warBBCMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Presented with a complex fire in a historically significant building, formerly Manchester Square fire station, firefighters successfully contained the fire, preventing it from spreading to neighbouring properties.”About 100 people were evacuated and there were no injuries as a result of the blaze, which was tackled by about 125 firefighters using 20 fire engines.Explore more on these topicsLondonHotelsHospitality industryFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

That means ensuring that President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy isn’t bullied into accepting a deal which effectively hands victory to Russia.”A Lib Dem spokesperson said that the party would back the deployment, but parliament “should have the opportunity to have its say”.The Labour MP Diane Abbott said she was concerned about the proposal to use British troops to keep the peace. She posted on X: “If it is a durable, lasting peace then there will be no need for British troops on ground. If not, and it could put this country at risk and troops in harm’s way – then parliament should vote on it first.”The Conservatives have no plans to push for any Commons vote on troop deployment. The party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, who was speaking at a conference on Monday morning about threats to western civilisation, did not mention Ukraine in her address.No 10 did not explicitly commit to allowing parliament to vote on any potential deployment, saying it was too early in the process. During Starmer’s time in opposition he called for a law that military action needed consent from the Commons.Starmer’s spokesperson said there was no change to that position but committing to a vote would be “getting ahead of ourselves”. He said: “There has more broadly been cross-party support for the UK’s backing of Ukraine since the conflict first began and we’ve always been very clear that we are going to play our role in future security guarantees but we’re not going to get ahead of decisions on that and obviously parliament will continue to be updated and consulted as appropriate.”No 10 also confirmed on Monday that Starmer would meet Trump in Washington next week, saying he would seek to “deepen the special relationship across trade and investment, security”.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is leading a delegation to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russian officials on the outline of a ceasefire agreement. Ukraine has not been invited to the talks and Zelenskyy said Kyiv would not accept the outcome if it was not involved.Speaking before the Paris summit, Starmer said the UK was facing “a generational challenge when it comes to national security”.He said it was important to have “realistic and credible answers” for how to make any peace agreement last. “I think that we need to do more. We need to step up in terms of our collective response in Europe, and by that I mean capability. By that, I mean playing our full part when it comes to the defence of the sovereignty of Ukraine if there’s a peace agreement, and, of course, when it comes to funding and training.“So, on all those fronts, I want the UK and all European allies to step up, and for the UK to play a leading part in that.”After the summit, a No 10 source said Starmer was clear that any decision to commit troops to Ukraine was entirely conditional on strong security guarantees from the US.Starmer intends to start the conversation about what that might look like when he meets Trump in Washington next week. “It’s not realistic Europe can do it on its own. But the nature of that backstop obviously has a variety of options,” the source said.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyHouse of CommonsKeir StarmerUkraineForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He denies all the charges.Giving evidence in his own defence, he said he was “in the habit” of taking consensual pictures of his sexual activity.Questioned about video material he watched, the PhD student at University College London said he liked “time stop” pornography, in which “the females are passive and unresponsive during sex”, according to a definition agreed by the defence and prosecution.His barrister, Mark Cotter KC, asked why he preferred that type of sexually explicit material, to which Zou replied: “I like it because the girl appears to be still and quiet when they are having sex.”Cotter then asked Zou: “What about being asleep?”He replied: “Yes, that’s my favourite type. But I could not find that.”Zou is on trial at Inner London crown court and the jury heard he had grown up in China. When he came to London to study he came into contact, the court heard, with drugs including ketamine, cocaine and ecstasy.After his arrest in January 2024 Zou told police he used the drug butanediol as a moisturiser, but now claims he put it in his drink to get high. He said that after his arrest he did not want police to think he was a drug user.The prosecution said it was one of a series of drugs found when his home was raided and searched, which Zou used to stupefy and subdue women so he could carry out his attacks.He denies attacks on three women in London and seven in China from 2019-23.After his arrest, Zou told police: “Firstly, I wish to say that reference has been made to pictures retrieved from my mobile phones, however I have not seen these and I do not recall when and where I took them.“I can say, however, that I am in the habit of taking pictures of my sexual activity with my sexual partners. The pictures are only taken with her consent and agreement.“As to the allegation of rape, I deny having sexual intercourse with a partner without her consent and I always believed she consented to it.”The engineering student told the jury he did not know how many houses his parents had in China. His father worked in a state-owned enterprise and his mother was a teacher.He said he had insomnia, which caused his hair to fall out. He had a number of cosmetic procedures, including a hair transplant and work on his eyelids and chin.He gave evidence with the help of an interpreter, speaking in Mandarin.Zou denies 11 counts of rape as well as three counts of voyeurism, 12 counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and eight of having a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence.The prosecution said Zou seemed charming and smart but was in fact a “predator, voyeur and rapist” who ignored pleas from his victims to stop.Zou, who grew up in Guangdong province, will continue giving evidence in his own defence on Tuesday and the trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

At least seven prosecutors have resigned rather than comply with the request.According to WNBC, Adams held a Zoom call on Sunday with at least three of his deputies who expressed their intention to resign. The Democratic mayor is facing mounting calls for his own resignation, first over corruption charges filed last summer, and now over their resignations.Adams has pleaded not guilty, denied any wrongdoing and rejected calls for his resignation. He has also indicated he believes the charges were brought in retaliation for criticizing the Biden administration’s immigration policies, blaming them for the city’s struggles with absorbing tens of thousands of new arrivals.Adams has reportedly agreed to some cooperation with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) immigration agents, including allowing federal authorities to restart operations on Rikers Island, which holds the city’s largest jail.The mayor has also rejected accusations that dropping the federal charges against him would amount to making him a political prisoner of theTrump administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brafman allegedly fired 17 times, striking one victim in the left shoulder and grazing the other’s left forearm.While in custody, Brafman spontaneously told detectives that while he was driving his truck, “he saw two Palestinians and shot and killed both”, arrest documents said.Law enforcement officials did not confirm if the victims were in fact Palestinians andthe Miami Heraldreported that they were actually two vacationing Israelis, naming them as Ari Rabey and his father.Facebook posts after the shooting show Rabey at Miami’s Jackson memorial hospital and his Hyundai with several bullet holes and markings.The outlet reported that as of Monday afternoon, Brafman, the alleged shooter, was being held at the Miami-Dade correctional center on two counts of attempted second-degree murder.Further complicating the incident, one of the injured men reportedly posted “death to the Arabs” in a message on social media after the shooting. “My father and I went through a murder attempt against antisemitic background,”he wrote.The Council on American-Islamic Relations’Floridachapter has called for federal hate crime charges in the shooting.“It is deeply ironic and telling that both the alleged pro-Israel perpetrator and the pro-Israel victim in the Miami Beach shooting reportedly hold racist anti-Palestinian views,” said Cair’s national executive director, Nihad Awad,on X.“This just the latest example of the hate targeting the Palestinian-American community in this country and Palestinians in their homeland. Policymakers in our nation should stop fomenting the anti-Palestinian hate that led to the genocide in Gaza and to hate crimes in America.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaGun crimeRaceUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The positions terminated include maintenance mechanics, aeronautical information specialists, environmental protection specialists, aviation safety assistants and management administration personnel.Former FAA air traffic controller Dylan Sullivanclaimed on social mediathat agency personnel who were terminated “maintain every piece of equipment that keeps flying safe, from the radars to the ILS, to ATC automation”.Job cuts at the FAA are likely to raise concerns. The agency has struggled to recruit air traffic controllers in recent years. An increase in recruitment during the previous two administrations was hobbled by budget cuts that limited training and certification.The move also comes less than three weeks since a midair collision between an army helicopter and a civilian jet over Washington DC that killed 67 people. Initial reports suggested there was just one air traffic controller working both civilian and military flights in the notoriously busy airspace at the time of the collision.Since then, seven people died when a plane crashed near Philadelphia; 10 died when another crashed in Alaska; and one person died when the landing gear on a private plane belonging to Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil failed as it landed and crashed into another parked aircraft.On Monday, a Delta aircraft flipped over when arriving at Pearson international airport in Toronto, Canada, with 80 people onboard. Early reports suggested all survived.The Pass union, which represents more than 11,000 FAA and Department of Defense workers who install, inspect and maintain air traffic control systems,posted on its website: “Staffing decisions should be based on an individual agency’s mission-critical needs. To do otherwise is dangerous when it comes to public safety.”David Spero, national president of Pass, saidon Xof the fired employees: “They are our family, friends, neighbors. Many are veterans. It is shameful to toss aside dedicated public servants.”Spero added that the move was “especially unconscionable in the aftermath of three deadly aircraft accidents in the past month”.The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy,said on Xthat he “talked to the DOGE [‘department of government efficiency’] team” and “they are going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system”. Aviation experts have long pointed to outdated air traffic control systems used by the FAA as a source of concern.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Department of Energy later said that fewer than 50 were removed from “primarily administrative and clerical roles”.Federal News Network,a federal government news source, said it had obtained a termination letter to an employee at the Department of Agriculture that indicated that the onus is on the employee to demonstrate why they should not be fired.“Until the probationary period has been completed, a probationer has ‘the burden to demonstrate why it is in the public interest for the government to finalize an appointment to the civil service for this particular individual.’ The agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest. For this reason, the agency informs you that the agency is removing you from your position.”Sullivan, the former FAA air traffic controller, said in his social media post: “FAA technicians undergo years of specialized training to maintain mission critical systems and cannot be replaced quickly. In the 30 years since I began my controller career, we have never had a surplus of technicians and engineers.“Once our aviation safety infrastructure is compromised, it will take decades to bring it back.

Conservative Trump supporters have been pushing for the supreme court to overturn the1935 supreme court rulingprotecting Congress’s power to shield the heads of independent agencies from being fired by a president.“Since my arrival at OSC last year, I could not be more proud of all we have accomplished,” Dellinger said in a statement to Politico last week. “The agency’s work has earned praise from advocates for whistleblowers, veterans, and others. The effort to remove me has no factual nor legal basis – none – which means it is illegal.”The office of the special counsel is separate from justice department special counsels, who are appointed by the attorney general for specific investigations, such asJack Smith.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Rupert’s death, instead ofthe evenly split family trust previously planned, power would go solely to his older son.He lost his effort to hand the reins to Lachlanin December last year.Detailing the many power struggles within the family, Coppins writes that one former News Corp employee claimed Lachlan had referred to the media side of the business as “ShitCo” (a claim a spokesperson for Lachlan denied to Coppins) – a possible echo of RoyCo, the fictional company created by patriarch Logan Roy in Succession, commonly regarded as having been inspired by the Murdochs.When discussing why the battle for succession saw Rupert pit James and Lachlan against each other, leaving Prudence and Elisabeth on the sidelines, the Atlantic piece quotes James calling his father a “misogynist”.For years, as power and control waxed and waned between the male Murdochs over various parts of the organisation, there had been reports of James’sunease with News Corp’s reporting of the climate crisisand Fox News’s apparentembrace of rightwing conspiracy theories. Coppins’ interview details all of it, including James’ discomfort with the company’s support of Brexit andof Donald Trump, andprevarications on Charlottesville.Coppins writes that James “had come to see Fox News as a blight on his family’s name and a menace to American democracy” and that “drastic changes were needed to save the companies from the consequences of his father’s reckless mismanagement”.James reportedly told him: “If lying to your audience is how you juice ratings … a good culture wouldn’t do that.”In 2010 Rupert invited his children to a family counselling retreat with a specialist therapist. A leak to Vanity Fair described it as a “loving, supportive” experience.But the truth, Coppins writes, is that the counselling session “devolved into posturing, gaslighting, and recriminations”. James tells him: “It was a car crash. Everyone was more alienated from each other at the end.”After the Guardian in 2011revealedthat Murdoch’s News of the World Sunday UK paper illegally hacked the phone of the missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, James called his father to say the tabloid should be shut down, Coppins writes.Rupert “was not happy” and “instructed his son not to say a word to the press, James recalled. He’d be in London soon.”James was apparently alarmed and saw his father looking “frail and confused – nothing like the decisive, towering figure he’d long admired and tangled with, according to Coppins. “He remembers calling Lachlan in Australia and fretting, ‘Dude, our old man has gone crazy. This is terrible.’”It was Australia’s 2019-20 bushfires that prompted a rare public sign of the split.In a statement, James and his wife, Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch, shared their frustration with News Corp and Fox’s coverage.“They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary,” their spokesperson said in a statement at the time.Later in 2020, Jamesresigned from the News Corp board.How departure of James laid bare the Murdoch family riftsRead moreCoppins’ interview traces the relationship between James and his father as it disintegrated.By the time of the court battle, “James and Rupert had barely spoken in years,” the piece says, then detailing a handwritten note from Rupert delivered along with legal documents:Dear James, still time to talk? Love, Dad. P.S.: Love to see my grandchildren one day.“James, who could not remember the last time Rupert had taken an interest in his grandchildren, didn’t bother to reply,” Coppins notes.Coppins also describes a series of “withering questions” put to James by Rupert’s lawyer in a nearly five-hour session at a Manhattan law office. .According to the Atlantic, the questions included: “Have you ever done anything successful on your own?” “Why were you too busy to say ‘Happy birthday’ to your father when he turned 90?” “Does it strike you that, in your account, everything that goes wrong is always somebody else’s fault?”The lawyer also referred to James and and his sisters as “white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies”.James, Coppins writes, realised Rupert, who was seated silently, was texting the questions to the lawyer. “How fucking twisted is that?” he asks Coppins.At the end of the session Rupert left the law office conference room without saying a word, Coppins writes.View image in fullscreenPrudence, James and Elisabeth Murdoch arrive at court for the hearing on the matter of succession of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire in Reno, Nevada, September 2024.Photograph: Alan Devall/ReutersAt Thanksgiving 2024, after the trial had finished, James and his sisters wrote a letter to their father saying they missed and loved him.“Put an end to this destructive judicial path so that we can have a chance to heal as a collaborative and loving family,” they pleaded, according to the Atlantic.Rupert, the piece goes on, said they should contact his lawyers if they wanted to talk to him.The Atlantic piece also goes some way to answering the tantalising question of whether the Murdochs watched or admired Succession.Coppins writes that James only watched one episode and “found it too painful. But other members of the Murdoch clan were obsessed with the show; certain scenes and storylines seemed un­cannily true to life”.A spokesperson for Rupert and Lachlan described James’s claims in the interview as a “litany of falsehoods … from someone who no longer works for the companies but still benefits from them financially”.Last week, New York Times Magazine reporters scoured through 3,000 pages of evidence from the trial, and reported thatthe trust will expire in 2030. At that point, or when Rupert dies, the siblings have to work out what to do next.Coppins writes that James, who “quotes Shakespeare and cites Roman imperial history in casual conversation”, is now struggling with the question: “How did we let it come to this?”“His 93-year-old father will, despite his most fervent wishes, die one day,” he writes. “And when he does, he will leave behind a family at war with itself.”Explore more on these topicsJames MurdochRupert MurdochNews CorporationLachlan MurdochAustralian medianewsShareReuse this content"

Now Trump is clearing the way for kleptocratsOliver BulloughBritain used to solicit money that the US would not touch – but with oligarchs and fraudsters on the rise, it must now uphold the lawMon 17 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 10.01 ESTShareFive decades ago, the United States was in turmoil. Along and unpopular warwas ending in defeat;inflation was high; and American politicians were accused ofhigh-handed and illegal behaviour.If all this sounds remarkably similar to the last few years, that’s because it is. But the mid-1970s was different in one crucial respect: how the US responded to it, and particularly how it responded to corruption. Major corporations had been giving bribes to win contracts in South Korea, Italy and Saudi Arabia; US politicians were appalled – and they acted to uphold values other than money.Congress held hearings, examined witnesses and ultimately passed theForeign Corrupt Practices Act(FCPA) of 1977, which meant that US companies that paid bribes abroad would be prosecuted at home. No other country had any equivalent legislation, and some politicians worriedabout its effect on business, but US prosecutions under the FCPA continuedyear after yearas a sign that its leaders expected better of its corporations than foreigners did.Until this week, when Donald Trump decided that fighting corruption was getting in the way of making money. “FCPA enforcement … actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security,” the US president stated inan executive orderinstructing his Department of Justice to stop enforcing the law.This rapid strike was just one part of a blitzkrieg on US efforts against corruption that the White House has launched over the past three weeks. The aid agencyUSAid supported anti-corruptiongroups and investigative journalists in dozens of countries; the White House’s Task Force KleptoCapture and theKleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiativeled western efforts to find wealth owned by the Kremlin or its allies; theForeign Agents Registration Actbrought transparency to who was funding US lobbyists; the FBI’sForeign Influence Task Forcesought to unearth infiltration by the Kremlin and other regimes. All of that is gone, as is the corruption case againstNew York’s mayor, Eric Adams, who was accused of taking bribes and soliciting funding from overseas.US foreign policy is far from perfect, and its catastrophic mistakes in the Middle East and elsewhere are behind many of the world’s most intractable crises. However, it is hard to overstate how central Washington has been to global efforts to tackle corruption, financial crime and kleptocracy. It invented the idea offighting money laundering; its sanctions against Kremlin elites went further and faster than European equivalents; its prosecutions against money laundering by banks, crypto exchanges and others have been more ambitious than ours; its indictments against corrupt foreign officials have achieved better results.Trump’s unilateral decision to abandon the battlefield is devastating, not least because of the risk that European countries will now surrender too. It is imperative this does not happen. Putin’s kleptocratic regime still poses a huge risk to our continent’s security; organised criminal groups are spreading, and even trying to reclaimlost ground in Sicily; fraudsters are stealingmore money every year. Our law enforcement agencies are struggling to handle the challenge as it is. If we stop cooperating with each other, we’ll be overwhelmed.David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has madefighting corruptioncentral to his time in office, and the UK needs to step up where the US is stepping back, not least to push back against the inevitable demands from Trump’s allies in Europe that we follow his lead. Lammy has proposed asummit of international financial centresto discuss tackling corruption, and he should move ahead with that as a matter of urgency.The political focus on irregular immigrants has led to specialist anti-corruption officers being moved to tackle immigration. They should be moved back.The UK should support organisations whose future is imperilled by the end of US funding. Groups like theAnti-Corruption Action Centrein Kyiv do crucial work pushing for new standards in the battle against bribery in Ukraine; networks like theOrganized Crime and Corruption Reporting Projectdo indispensable journalistic work investigating the misdeeds of the rich and crooked in eastern Europe. Without them, kleptocrats can operate without scrutiny, and banks’ compliance departments would have no idea whether to accept them as clients or not. There are dozens of other organisations doing equally important work that will close or retreat because of Trump’s decision to cutUSAidfunding, and we could save them.There is an obvious irony here. In the decades when the US was prosecuting its companies for paying bribes abroad, the UK was establishing a network of tax havens, and selling anonymous shell companies, so as to profit from their corruption. Not only did we ignore bribe-taking, when British prosecutors tried to bring a case against BAE Systems for kickbacks in Saudi arms contracts,our government steppedin to shut it down. It was prosecutedin the US instead.City of London institutions’ business strategy for decades was to solicit money their US rivals would not touch, whether it came from Russian oligarchs, Nigerian kleptocrats or Middle Eastern bullies. Over the last decade that has started to change, with successive governments finally bringingtransparency to offshore-owned property, beginning to giveadequate fundingto law enforcement agencies, and trying to restrainthe worst excessesof our overseas territories.Anyone tempted to reverse these improvements in the interest of either appeasing Trump or chasing illusory economic growth should remember the logic behind that pioneering US anti-bribery legislation. “Bribes and kickbacks may bolster sales in the short run,” said Senator Frank Church of Idaho at a committee hearing almost exactly 50 years ago. “Ultimately, they create the conditions which bring to power political forces that are no friends of ours.”We are never going to be better at corruption than Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping, nor should we try. Our moral, political, and financial interests are all aligned: Britain will only thrive in a world governed by the rule of law; a world without corruption is better in every way. The fact that the US has forgotten this makes it all the more important that we do not.Oliver Bullough is the author of Butler to the World: How Britain Became the Servant of Tycoons, Tax Dodgers, Kleptocrats and Criminals, and Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World and How to Take It BackDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He also said its private business had “broad prospects and great promise” to create wealth and opportunity.China’s governance and the scale of its market give it an inherent advantage in developing new industries, Xi said.“It is the right time for the majority of private business and entrepreneurs to show their talent,” he was quoted as saying in remarks state media called an “important speech”.Xi has spearheaded campaigns to increase government control over private industry, particularly in technology, which was considered to be unruly and disruptive as it underwent huge expansion, seemingly unconcerned by the tight state controls around other industries.But China is now struggling with an economic downturn driven by a housing crisis, stagnant low consumption and high youth unemployment.The meeting took place at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, with video on the state broadcaster CCTV on Monday showing Ma standing and applauding as Xi entered a room. Xi, Ren, and BYD’s Wang Chuanfu were filmed giving speeches but no audio or transcripts have been published.Liang Wenfeng, the founder of DeepSeek, a startup that is threatening to upset the tech world order with its artificial intelligence models, was also present.The presence of top executives and companies at these high-profile events are typically seen by foreign investors as a sign of the businesses or individuals that are favoured by the government.The meeting with Ma was closely watched as the billionaire was once the most high-profiletarget of Chinese regulators, and oncedisappeared from public view for several monthsafter a speech in 2020 in which he criticised Xi.Investors on Monday were scouring pictures and footage of the meeting to spot top bosses and trading accordingly.Executives from two of the Chinese tech industry’s biggest players – ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, and Baidu, which specialises in search and AI – did not attend, Reuters reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, reports of Xi’s visit to the symposium, which first emerged on Friday, helped spur gains in Asian markets as it raised hopes of renewed support in China’s private tech sector, which has been targeted by rounds of government crackdowns in the last few years.The tightly choreographed pro-business rally reflected policymakers’ concern about a slowdown in growth and efforts by the US to limit China’s technological development, analysts said.Xi’s move to gather business leaders underscores the importance of private-sector innovation for China to gain ground in technology, they said.“It’s a tacit acknowledgment that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the US,” said Christopher Beddor, the deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. “The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the US.”Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsChinese economyChinaAsia PacificTechnology sectorXi JinpingAlibabaJack ManewsShareReuse this content"

Sinner’s explanation that he was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by his physio was accepted byWada, but the agency added that “the athlete bears responsibility for the entourage’s negligence”.The world No 1 is therefore suspended from 9 February until 4 May, meaning he will be eligible to play at the French Open, which starts on 19 May. Speaking at the Qatar Open, Djokovic said: “There’s a majority of the players that I’ve talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled.Emma Raducanu ‘really proud’ after ending losing run with win over SakkariRead more“A majority of the players don’t feel it’s fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers.”Sinner’s was the first of two high-profile cases in tennis in quick succession, with the women’s world No 2, Iga Swiatek,handed a one-month suspension in Novemberafter a positive test for the angina medication trimetazidine. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted it was caused by contamination of a medicine Swiatek was taking to help combat jet lag.By contrast, the former world No 1 Simona Halepwas given a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022after a positive test, although it was later reduced to nine months. Meanwhile, Britain’s Tara Moore, a far less well-known player, was suspended in May 2022 while an investigation lasted 18 months before an independent tribunal determined that contaminated meat was the source of the prohibited substances for which she tested positive.“Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have got the ban for years … there is so much inconsistencies between the cases,” said Djokovic. “Sinner has got a suspension for three months because of mistakes and negligence of his team members, who are working on the tour. This is also something that I personally and many other players find strange.“Now it’s a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn’t work, anti-doping, it’s obvious. I hope that in the near future the governing bodies are going to come together and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes. It’s inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair.”Moore, 32, wrote on X on Monday: “I don’t think any of this was Sinner’s fault. I’m simply asking that everyone get the same treatment. I hope his case will further improve the conditions in which players are treated and will be a precedent for future cases’ timelines.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t think he loses any points or his No 1 spot either, so it’s an interesting ban.”The British No 1, Jack Draper, told Sky Sports: “I’m sure he wouldn’t have done anything intentional but we have to be accountable for what goes in our bodies.

Who will dominate the league next?Doug FarrarMon 17 Feb 2025 03.50 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 03.53 ESTShareNFLfans are spoiled when it comes to dynasties this century. Just as Bill Belichick’s New England Patriots ran out of gas after two decades of dominance, along came theKansas City Chiefsto replace them. But the manner in which the Eaglesdestroyed those Chiefsin this year’sSuper Bowl– and the way in which general manager Howie Roseman has apparentlyset-up Philadelphiafor long-term success – has called Kansas City’s dominance into question. Here are a few candidates for the NFL’s next dynasty.Kansas City ChiefsWhat they have:Let’s start with the Chiefs, who may not be done quite yet. Yes, the Eagles utterly outplayed them in the Super Bowl, but one game (or one season) is a small sample size. The Chiefs, after all, have head coach Andy Reid, defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, and Patrick Mahomes. That’s three future Hall of Famers, which is a nice place to start. If Travis Kelcereturns for his 13th NFL season, that’s four guys who will eventually have busts in Canton. The Chiefs also have defensive lineman Chris Jones, who is on a Hall of Fame track too.Reid’s team have an unusual knackfor pulling the right things out at the right times to win one-score games. That’s enough to put them right back in the running for their sixth Super Bowl appearance in the last seven years, which is just as unprecedented as it sounds.General manager Brett Veach has done masterful work in teaming with Spagnuolo to create a defense that is top-notch at every level, and it’s young enough to sustain itself over time. Also, 2024 first-round receiver Xavier Worthy started to come on near the end of his inaugural campaign as the deep threat he was supposed to be.Our 2024 NFL predictions revisited: the Chiefs weren’t inevitable after allRead moreWhat they need:A better and more consistent foundation beyond the Hall of Famers and good fortune. While the Chiefs have plenty going for them, there’s also the matter of an offensive line that has alternated between problematic and horrible over the last couple of seasons. The Eagles didn’t blitz the Chiefs once in that Super Bowl demolition – and still sacked Mahomes six times – a damning indictment of KC’s pass protection. The run game could also use a boost, and there’s the matter of Mahomes’s targets not named Kelce and Worthy – especially if Kelce, whoadmits he is not the player he once was, decides to move on from football.In the 2024 season, Mahomes was the NFL’s worst deep passer by any metric you care to choose – he had a completion rate of 29.6%, and a passer rating of 78.7, on throws of 20 or more air yards, and that includes the 158.3 passer rating on deep throws he put together in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl when the Eagles’ defense was in celebration mode. Mahomes had never been remotely as bad a deep passer before, and it’s time for Veach and Reid to get reinforcements to help him out.They could also use a jump start at edge-rusher, but the offense has most of the problems here. There’s only so much Mahomes can do, and the wear was showing long before what happened in New Orleans on 9 February.Philadelphia EaglesWhat they have:The Super Bowl champions have Saquon Barkley, who set the single-season NFL record for rushing yards (including the postseason) with 2,507. Had the league’s MVP been taken after Super Bowl LIX, Barkley may well have have won it. The Eagles also have the NFL’s best offensive line, and run game coordinator/offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland is starting to look like one of the best assistant coaches… well, ever.View image in fullscreenIs another Eagles Super Bowl just a matter of time?Photograph: David J Phillip/APSpeaking of legendary assistant coaches, the Eagles have defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who took the players he had and created perhaps the most dominant defensive performance in Super Bowl history. They also have three top-tier targets for Jalen Hurts in AJ Brown, DeVonta Smith, and Dallas Goedert. Finally, they have Roseman, who has been the NFL’s best personnel and salary cap guy for a while. This team is locked and loaded from top to bottom, and there shouldn’t be any talk of fluke around this Lombardi Trophy.What they need:The primary thing the Eagles need is the version of Hurtswho turned the Chiefs’ defense outafter it loaded up to stop Barkley. Hurts was named Super Bowl MVP with a bravura performance after a regular- and postseason in which things were not as stable in the passing game as they should have been. If the Hurts we saw in his last game is the Hurts we get from now on, stopping Philly from repeating will be exceptionally tough.But Hurts still needs developmentwhen it comes to reading the field, and that process may be affected by the loss of offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, who is now the New Orleans Saints’ head coach.Baltimore RavensWhat they have:Lamar Jackson, the two-time NFL MVP, who could easily have won the award again in 2024. Jackson’s running ability has always been one of one, and he’s improved exponentially as a pure passer throughout his NFL career. Then there’s Derrick Henry, who set every opposing defense on edge in 2024, because now, they had to deal with Jackson’s known abilitiesandHenry’s intelligent smashmouth style. Pair that with an outstanding group of pass-catchers in tight ends Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely, along with receivers Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman, and this offense is built to both grind and bomb opponents into submission. Unless Henry starts to fade after a career full of workload worries, and there isn’t an impetus to either re-sign or replace left tackle Ronnie Stanley, who may test the market in free agency, there isn’t a ton to worry about on this side of the ball.What they need:Last season, the Ravens had two edge defenders, Odafe Oweh and Kyle Van Noy, who exceeded expectations, and not much else. Baltimore have an outstanding interior line rotation led by Nnamdi Madubuike, but you have to worry a bit about the edges. Perhaps it may be time to look at linebacker as well; the Ravens missed Patrick Queen, who signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore’s AFC North rival, before the 2024 season. Neither Roquan Smith nor Queen were quite as good on their own. The secondary took a major step forward halfway through last season when the Ravens placed Kyle Hamilton and Ar’Darius Washington as the deep safeties; that should continue. The cornerback rotation is solid with youngsters Nate Wiggins and TJ Tampa, as well as veteran Marlon Humphrey, who can play everywhere. This is one of the NFL’s most consistent franchises from year to year; they may be just a few tweaks away from dominance.Buffalo BillsWhat they have:Josh Allen is the NFL’s reigning MVP, and with good reason. Since the 2018 season when Allen became Buffalo’s starting quarterback, the Bills have 77 regular-season wins, third in the league over that time behind the Chiefs (90) and the Ravens (78). And no other team this successful in that era has placed more responsibility on their quarterback.Under offensive coordinator Joe Brady, the Bills have also finally developed an outstanding and multi-faceted run game led by James Cook, who may be the league’s most underrated running back. The offensive line has really solidified under Brady, and when everybody on defense is healthy, head coach Sean McDermott and defensive coordinator Bobby Babich have outstanding talent from front to back.What they need:Of course, the Bills needto start winning enough in the postseason to actually get to the Super Bowl. Buffalo’s 7-6 postseason record with Allen is far from being entirely his fault, but you know what they say about quarterbacks getting too much credit and too much blame.What Allen needs more than anything else to high-step over the Chiefs and Ravens and all other AFC contenders is a true No 1 receiver. Including the postseason, no Bills receiver had a 1,000-yard season in 2024. Khalil Shakir is the closest thing Allen has to an alpha, but he is mostly a slot man. 2024 rookie Keon Coleman has potential, but it’s too early to say exactly what standard of player he will be. Mack Hollins and Amari Cooper are impending free agents, and probably replaceable in the draft or free agency. And it’s probably time to see more from tight end Dalton Kincaid. If the Bills can get the kinds of targets around Allen who can really scald defenses, and continue with their strong run game and a potentially great defense, they have a recipe for success.Washington CommandersWhat they have:The Commanders are a long-shot but they have a quarterback who may have put up the best rookie season in NFL history. Jayden Daniels had the league on a string through most of the season. The Eagles’ defense turned him out in the NFC championship game, but as the Eagles’ defense did the same thing to Patrick Mahomes two weeks later, let’s not hold that against the kid. Daniels was transformational in the pass and run game, and that should play forward. Offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury choosing to stay with the team rather than looking at head coaching opportunities elsewhere is another boost.View image in fullscreenJayden Daniels had a brilliant rookie campaign.Photograph: Lon Horwedel/USA Today SportsThe Commanders also have an excellent head coach in Dan Quinn, who knows how to get maximum buy-in from his players, and the fulcrums of the defense in linebackers Bobby Wagner and Frankie Luvu, although Wagner is 34 so won’t be around in the long-term. And they have a very nice receiver corps led by Terry McLaurin, who deserves all his current good fortune after surviving Washington’s QB Purgatory from his 2019 rookie season until Daniels’ arrival.Patrick Mahomes was chasing Super Bowl history. He left humbled and harassedRead moreWhat they need:While Brian Robinson is a good running back, you’d like to see someone perhaps a bit more dynamic in the backfield, especially because Kingsbury did a brilliant job last season in designingWashington’s Pistol Pony run game. There are needs along both lines, especially at offensive tackle and edge-rusher. Dorance Armstrong and Dante Fowler Jr were decent pressure providers from the edge, but more is needed, and Fowler is due for free agency.Quinn, who is a defensive mastermind, will also need to preside over a rethinking of the secondary, though 2023 rookie cornerback Mike Sainristil, who was thought to be just a slot defender when he came out of Michigan, can do more, and would seem to be the fulcrum of that rebuild. Of all the teams on this list, the Commanders are the one who progressed the most from 2023 to 2024, and with the right moves, they’re the one with the capacity for another giant leap in 2025.Post-imperial chaosOf course, dynasties aren’t required for any sport to be great – in fact, some would say that open competition is the ideal. If the Chiefs can’t put their offense back together, if the Eagles regress to the mean, if the Ravens and Bills just stay where they are, and if the Commanders don’t take that next step, we could be in for a relatively long stretch of non-repeat and new Super Bowl winners, which we had from Super Bowl XLIII (the Pittsburgh Steelers at the end of the 2008 season) through Super Bowl 50 (the Denver Broncos at the end of the 2015 season). When looking back at that era, there was nothing less special about the time – it’s just that there was no clear and obvious ruler of the NFL.Explore more on these topicsNFLKansas City ChiefsWashington CommandersPhiladelphia EaglesBaltimore RavensBuffalo BillsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m doing it for myself now’Donald McRaeNew Zealand fighter has appreciated spending time with his family as he prepares to challenge Daniel Dubois for the IBF world heavyweight titleMon 17 Feb 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 16.16 ESTShareThere’s nothing quite like watching Joe Parker lip-syncing to Take That to lift the mood in the back of an Uber on a drizzly morning in Dublin. The dangerous threat Parker faces against another big-hitting monster of the ring in Daniel Dubois, in Riyadh on Saturday night, fades with the laughter.Even the depressing reality that boxing will continue toignore human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, as Parker’s intriguing bout with Dubois headlines an outstanding bill bankrolled by the country’s General Entertainment Authority, can’t erode the wit and charm of the New Zealand heavyweight channelling his inner Gary Barlow.It’s a long drive from the heart of Dublin to the Ballybrack Boxing Club, where Parker has prepared for Dubois, and soI watch the video the fighter made last April. In December 2023 Parker hadoutclassed Deontay Wilder, a knockout merchant expected to crush him, and he was looking for a new opponent. Settling on Dillian Whyte, against whom he had losta slugfest in 2018, Parker created an amusing parody of the usual abusive call-out.Rather than being belligerent or crude, Parker pretended to croon and dance his way into Whyte’s heart by serenading him to the plaintive strains of Take That’s Back for Good. Featuring framed photographs of Whyte, and lipstick-stained mugs, Parker and his crew of South Auckland homeboys shuffled and sang their seemingly love-struck lament as a way of trying to set up a rematch. Those few minutes captured the essence of Parker.‘A lovely sweet kid’: tributes paid to John Cooney after Irish boxer’s deathRead moreHearing about this diversion on my way to see him, a beaming Parker exclaims happily soon after I step into the gym. “That’s my favourite,” he says of the Whyte spoof which belongs to an entertaining collection of videos Parker began making during Covid lockdowns with his wife, Laine, and their children in 2020. Laine was initially dubious but the videos became an internet sensation and she joined him in making them – including her as Olivia Newton-John to his John Travolta intheir version of Grease.Last month Laine and their five kids surprised Parker by arriving in Dublin – as a way of bringing the family back together amid the grind of fight camp. “It’s been very beneficial,” Parker says of their reunion, “because I worry when I’m in camp. I always think: ‘What’s happening back home? How are they? They’re missing out on time seeing their dad. Is my wife OK looking after five kids?’“The toughest part about boxing is saying goodbye to your family and being away in camp. They’re now staying in a separate house but it’s six minutes away and I get to see them for two hours every evening. It’s a great boost.”Parker is the most amiable man in boxing but his good mood, as the days tick down to his fight against the formidable Dubois, is not just because his family have been around him. It seems rooted in his sense that he has a serious chance of upsetting Dubois and replacing him as the IBF heavyweight champion. His team is led by Andy Lee, the astute and inspirational Irish trainer, and also includes George Lockhart, the American nutritionist and strength and conditioning coach.Lee has transformed Parker after the heavyweight, who was ill with a virus,lost against Joe Joyceon an 11th‑round stoppage in 2022. Parker has since been on a five‑fight winning run, with his most recent two victories against Wilder and the Chinese giant Zhilei Zhang catapulting him towards the heavyweight summit.View image in fullscreenJoe Parker: ‘The toughest part about boxing is saying goodbye to your family.’Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The GuardianAfter an hour in the ring, the steam rising from him on a freezing morning, Parker sits down with me for an hour. Conviction pours from him as he says: “I feel a real belief going into this fight – not just because of those two wins but because George and I have been quietly working away since April, and Andy and I have done such great work the last three months.”Dubois is also on a roll. He has shown grit and explosive power when stopping his past three opponents – Jarrell Miller, Filip Hrgovic and Anthony Joshua. “Even though Daniel’s in good form I don’t see the threat,” Parker says coolly. “I know he’s a beast but I’m extremely confident because of the work I’ve done. I’m more focused on the process. I enjoy going to the gym, training,eating honey, resting. If I do everything right, and do exactly what Andy tells me, the result will come.”Parker is heartened by speculation that Dubois is overlooking him and focusing on a possible heavyweight title unification fight against Oleksandr Usyk, who remains the real world champion and is in possession of the three other belts: “Mmm, it’s good. He might be in two minds. His focus might be split on that fight and our fight. He deserves the praise he’s got recently but that can take him away from what’s actually important and what he needs to work on.”Was he surprised thatDubois beat Joshua, knocking him down multiple times in five one-sided rounds? “I was,” Parker says, “because the only people that said Daniel would win were his team and George Lockhart. The whole week George told us that Daniel beats Joshua.”What is Lockhart’s prediction for Dubois v Parker? “George said I’m going to finish him off in three rounds. And Daniel’s said he’s going to finish me in three rounds. So it’s interesting.”Lee, meanwhile, told me how much he trusts Parker’s intelligence to negate Dubois’ shocking power. If the 33-year-old Kiwi of Samoan heritage can withstand the brutal punches being thrown his way he has the ring smarts to test Dubois – who has lost previouslyagainst JoyceandUsyk. The young British heavyweight was criticised unfairly in both contests and accused of quitting – even though he sustained a broken orbital bone against Joyce.But Dubois remains under the domineering sway of his father and he used to be withdrawn and painfully shy. His confidence has blossomed sincehe defeated Joshuabut does Parker believe Dubois might be psychologically fragile if momentum swings away from him? “If you haven’t worked on your weaknesses you can revert to them,” Parker says.“When things get hard in the fight, you might latch on to that again. But he’s showing growth and confidence and strength. It’s just hard to know because he’s not really a man who says a lot. I also don’t trash-talk anyone. In that sense we’re similar. There is no crap talk towards each other.”Parker and Dubois were first scheduled to fight in late 2023. “Andy, George and me were all on board for that one but, five days after agreeing, I got a call: ‘Sorry, Joe. You’re not fighting Daniel. You want to fight Wilder?’ Me, Andy and George were keen and so I got Wilder instead of Dubois.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was just another opponent for him to look good before fighting Joshua. It was so sweet for myself, Andy and George and after the fight I was like: ‘Oh piss off, man.’ Beautiful.”View image in fullscreenParker on his way to victory over Deontay Wilder in 2023.Photograph: Str/APIt was the same beforehe defeated Zhanglast March. “They were lining Zhang up for Joshua because I wasn’t meant to win. It was just the one fight after the other I was meant to lose.”Parker has been authoritative and convincing recently but does he worry about the damage of boxing having turned pro in 2012 and after 38 fights? “Yeah. Big time. I said to my team: ‘If you ever see any signs [of brain damage] I’m out. If my speech goes off track, please jump in and tell me.’ Andy would do it. George would. I’ve said I’ve only got two more years. When I’m 35, I’m out.”Parker’s great friend Tyson Fury, who introduced him to Lee, has retired four times previously. But was Parker surprised byFury’s latest retirementlast month? “I was because I still think Tyson’s got a lot to give. He was in two very competitive fights with Usyk [who narrowlywon both last year] and Tyson still loves the sport.When he announced his retirement I called him straight up that evening. I said: ‘What’s happened?’ He goes: ‘Joe, it’s one of those things. I don’t feel like fighting any more.’ But you never know with Tyson. He can do whatever he wants. He’s made lots of money, he’s got a loving family, achieved everything in boxing. So I told him: ‘It’s fine if you want to walk away. Enjoy your life, you’ve done everything.’”Parker is a passionate ambassador forManuka Doctor honey, while devouring the sweet stuff before he fights, and he has a supportive family. He credits his parents for all they have done. “They both came from Samoa. My dad lived in the bush and had a hard life. He lived on bats and eels, and went diving into the waterfall to get shrimp. He was very resourceful and like a bushman. But he had a hard upbringing in Samoa. My mum also lived up in the mountains of Samoa and it was tough for her.“But it was even harder for them when they moved to South Auckland. They only spoke Samoan and they had to get work. Back then there was racism but they survived and made a living for us as a family [of five]. My dad’s been working in the same steel plant for 35 years and it’s a tough job. He’s still there now and he’s almost 65. But they are so proud of me.”Parker reveals: “My mum’s dad had over 20 kids and my dad is one of something like 28 kids. I’ve got a very big family.”Is the heavyweight planning to add to his own immediate family? “I think No 6 would be perfect. I’ve got four girls and one boy. One more would balance it out, hopefully another boy. You want to spend time with each of them and make sure they’re all given the time they need and want.”Does his wife get nervous watching him fight? “I’m sure she still does, but she sees how Andy, George and me operate, how in sync we are, how we work so well together and it gives her confidence. She knows that if I win this fight it’ll probably be my best achievement. This will mean something different because I’m doing it more for myself now. Before it was for my dad, New Zealand and Samoa. Now it’s for me, my wife and kids.”If he does win, will another lip‑syncing video be on the way? “I’d love that,” Parker says as he points to another trusted member of his camp. Kerry Russell helps the boxer to make his surreal and humorous videos and Parker says: “He’s the magic man and we’d need to do something special together after I beat Dubois.”Explore more on these topicsBoxinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

And in the end, Boston’s Jayson Tatum had the dunk that decided a crown.Unrivaled’s 1-on-1 tournament was everything the NBA All-Star Game wants to beRead moreShaq’s OGs won the first All-Star mini-tournament inNBAhistory on Sunday night, getting 15 points from Tatum and 12 from Stephen Curry – three of them on a half-court shot, the sort of highlight the All-Star Game is known for – to beat Chuck’s Global Stars 41-25 in the final.Curry was the MVP on his home floor at Chase Center, where he and the Golden State Warriors play. He said the weekend was “a celebration of a lot of great things”.“It’s obviously our responsibility to come out and put on a show,” Curry said, flanked by his fellow OGs. “And I thank them for helping me do that.”The title game was basically over early, and the half-time show – an 18-minute tribute to TNT – lasted longer than the game did. The Global Stars started the title game 0 for 10 from the field, 0 for 6 from 3-point range and fell into a quick 11-0 hole.In a regular NBA game, that’s no big deal. In a first-to-40 game against some of the best players on the planet, that’s a problem.San Antonio’s Victor Wembanyama led the Global Stars with 11 points in the final. He was visibly frustrated when Tatum scored the title-clinching basket.Wembanyama came into his All-Star debut saying he would play hard, like a real game. And he did.“To me, that is the only way to play basketball,” Wembanyama said.It was the debut of the All-Star mini-tournament format: four teams, three games, with only 40 points needed to end each contest.The league opted for the untimed, short games with hopes that asking All-Stars to play fewer minutes would lead to better competition. Last year’s game in Indianapolis had a 211-186 final score, setting a slew of records but prompting the league to take action after years of urging players to take the exhibition a bit more seriously.And no, there wasn’t exactly a playoff-type intensity. Or at least, not much of it.“I think they’re just looking for a more competitive game and trying to find ways to create that,” said Milwaukee’s Damian Lillard, who helped Shaq’s OGs to the title. “I thought tonight was a little bit more competitive than it had been in past years.”There were some less-than-serious efforts the likes of which have been seen in past years — underhand lobs from half-court, for example, and a whole lot of interjection from on-court emcee Kevin Hart — but there was at least some defense played. Phoenix’s Kevin Durant argued for a foul late in his team’s first semifinal win, and probably merited a call that would have sent him to the line for what could have been a game-winning free throw.The first two-shot foul of the night came early in the title game. Denver’s Nikola Jokić of the Global Stars missed both shots.“I just wanted tonight to be fun,” Curry said. “I think it was fun.”It was fun for the winners, for certain: Dallas’ Kyrie Irving of the OGs carried the All-Star trophy into the Global Stars’ locker room after the game.“Y’all good?” Irving playfully asked the runners-up. They booed him.View image in fullscreenShaq’s OGs guard Kyrie Irving (11) of the Dallas Mavericks sails to the goal as Chuck’s Global Stars forward Victor Wembanyama (1) of the San Antonio Spurs looks on on Sunday night.Photograph: Kyle Terada/USA Today SportsThe OGs were without LeBron James, who was ruled out earlier Sunday because of ongoing left foot and ankle discomfort. James was not replaced on the roster, meaning the OGs had seven players available.Anthony Edwards didn’t play for Kenny’s Young Stars because of a groin issue.The three teams of 24 NBA All-Stars were drafted by TNT analysts Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith. The fourth team – Candace’s Rising Stars, which earned its way into the All-Star tournament by winning the Rising Stars event Friday night – was named for another TNT analyst, Candace Parker.The OGs got into the final with a win over Candace’s Rising Stars, while the Global Stars beat Kenny’s Young Stars in the first semifinal.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of Oklahoma City scored 12 points, including the clinching basket, and Chuck’s Global Stars advanced to the title game by beating Kenny’s Young Stars.Wembanyama and New York’s Karl-Anthony Towns each had six points for the Global Stars. Cleveland teammates Darius Garland and Evan Mobley, along with Miami’s Tyler Herro, each had six points for the Young Stars. Edwards was a last-second scratch with a groin issue.“My groin’s been messed up for a little minute,” said Edwards, who had been listed as a starter for the first semifinal. He added that with the short warmup before Game 1, he didn’t think there was time to test it out and see if he could go.“You always want to play,” Edwards said. “But when they put two minutes on the clock for warmup, I didn’t get no time to warm up my groin and it was all bad.”Lillard scored nine points, including the 3-pointer to push his team past the target score, and the OGs survived.The Rising Stars – a team of first- and second-year players – weren’t an easy out against a roster with a combined 86 All-Star appearances and $2.7bn in on-court earnings. There were nine lead changes and five ties.Curry scored eight points for the OGs, while the Los Angeles Lakers’ Dalton Knecht and Phoenix’s Ryan Dunn each had eight for the Rising Stars.Next season’s All-Star weekend – 13-15 February 2026 – will be headquartered at Intuit Dome, the Los Angeles Clippers’ new home in Inglewood, California.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Based in Boston and neighboring Cambridge, their teams competed against all-white squads in the Massachusetts Cricket League. By the early 20th century, Black teams were dominating the league. The 1931 final was played between two such teams – Windsor and Standard.Not exactly the narrative you may be accustomed to hearing in the land of Dunkin’, Big Papi and Brady, eh? And perhaps not a narrative that fits easily intothe story of race and Boston sport, with its recognizable highs (the Boston Celtics drafting the NBA’s first Black player in Chuck Cooper in 1950, and making their longtime star Bill Russell the league’s first Black coach in 1966) and lows (the Boston Red Sox being the last Major League Baseball team to integrate, with Pumpsie Green in 1959).Yet this is exactly the kind of narrative that co-editors Robert Cvornyek and Douglas Stark were looking for in their recently released anthology,Race and Resistance in Boston: A Contested Sports History. Published in time for Black History Month, with a foreword by the New England Patriots’ three-time Super Bowl champion Devin McCourty, the book sheds light on Black sporting achievements in Boston that may be lesser-known to the broader community.Boston has a race and sports problem. But it’s hardly alone among ‘liberal’ citiesRead more“These stories resonate within the African American community,” Cvornyek says. “They never left the community. We would never say we discovered these stories.”Stark adds: “You always hear about the Red Sox as the last team to integrate. On the other side, you hear about Bill Russell and theBoston Celticsand how progressive they were … If you’re in Massachusetts, that’s a large narrative about race and sport in the city, two polar opposites. I think Bob and I tried to find a kind of counter-narrative, a more complete story.”The book’s chapters span 150 years of Boston history, and include examinations of Black athletes in lesser-covered Boston sports such as soccer, boxing, golf and tennis. Even when it comes to the national pastime, there’s room for a reappraisal. There’s similarly comprehensive treatment of better-known names such as Russell and Willie O’Ree – in 1958, the latter became the first Black player in the NHL with theBoston Bruins. O’Ree’s Canadian roots are explored by Canadian-born historian, documentarian and publisher George Fosty.Several chapters address intersectionality – one, by Texas Christian University journalism professor Jaime Loke, looks at fans’ differing reactions to the coming-out narratives of men’s basketball player Jason Collins (overwhelmingly positive) and women’s basketball player Brittney Griner (largely negative).And then there’s the chapter on cricket, authored by Texas A&M University history professor Violet Showers Johnson.“The cricket piece comes out ofthe CLR James tradition, looking at cricket as a form of resistance,” Cvornyek says. “Professor Johnson did a wonderful job with that.”This chapter goes beyond describing the great Black teams and players. It explores their wider social milieu in the West Indian immigrant community – such as worship at St Cyprian’s Episcopal Church and identification as part of a British global community that went unrecognized by at least one British colonial official. In the Massachusetts Cricket League, there was a degree of equality. There were Black umpires and even a Black league president, although segregated rosters and unequal field conditions persisted.As the editors explain, the idea for their project arose during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.“Bob’s platform is the academic world,” Stark says, noting Cvornyek’s career as an emeritus history professor at Rhode Island College and his own experience in the worlds of preservation and interpretation. “My background is public history, museums, sports museums. We leveraged all of our contacts in these areas.”Among the earliest they reached out to was Joseph Cooper, the inaugural chair of sport leadership and administration at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where he is also a special assistant to the chancellor for Black life as well as an associate professor.“His response was, ‘this book has to be written, it’s not out there,’” Stark says. And, Stark says, “I think what makes the book unique among books on race and sport is that you don’t find one focusing on a particular city.” He calls the book’s subject “one particular northern city with sort of a troubled, racist past.”“The question is always, is Boston the most racist sports city?” Cvornyek says. “I don’t think it’s a good historical question, it’s not something we talk about in the book. But it’s out there.”As he explains, “The whole notion of Boston as the cradle of liberty, people see Boston as a fairly liberal city. On issues of sports, it’s simply not the case.”Cvornyek cites Russell’s description of Boston as a “flea market of racism – specifically regarding the fans. One of the ways we sort of take a look at Boston’s troubled racial history is through a multitude of sports, sports figures and fans.”One chapter in the anthology, authored by critic and literary historian Bijan Bayne, looks at an especially controversial moment from the city’s history – the busing crisis of the 1970s, in which a court order mandated desegregation in the Boston public school system. As Bayne relates in the chapter, he grew up in the predominantly Black Boston neighborhood of Roxbury before leaving as a youth with his family for Washington DC. He notes the racist white mobs who protested outside Boston schools that were compelled to admit Black students.Arguably best remembered for the protests that gained national attention and stained Boston’s reputation as a liberal city, busing had unintended consequences for Black student-athletes, according to Bayne. Some left the Boston public schools for alternatives in affluent suburbs through a program known as Metco, which remains in existence. Or, like many white classmates, they went to Catholic schools.“As these transitions unfolded, sports went on,” Bayne writes. “Children who grew up on Bobby Orr, John Havlicek, and Carl Yasterzemski weren’t going to be stopped by relocation – they were disheartened maybe, and feeling displaced, but far from inactive.”The chapter concludes with a look at the glittering high school basketball career of future hall of famer Patrick Ewing of Cambridge Rindge & Latin, who went on to play college ball for John Thompson at Georgetown and was the top NBA draft pick in 1985 by the New York Knicks. Throughout the chapter, Bayne maintains a sense of balance regarding race and sports in Boston.“There are bigoted fans and all-white school enclaves and communities across the United States,” he writes. “While not perfect, Boston has been a place for Black athletes from all over the world to showcase their gifts – long before and long after the busing mandate.”Get ready for more explorations of less-chartered terrain: The anthology is the first in an intended multi-volume series.“We don’t feel this is the end for us,” Stark says. “It’s sort of the beginning.”Explore more on these topicsSportUS sportsBostonNew England PatriotsBoston CelticsBoston Red SoxBoston BruinsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A key upshot was the generally ­acrimonious departure of several big names from the PGA Tour to LIV. Despite thesigning of a framework agreementbetween the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public ­Investment Fund in the summer of 2023, progress has been glacial.Patrick Reed hits hole-in-one on famed party hole at LIV Golf AdelaideRead moreAccording to Woods this is about to change. Trump met with Adam Scott, aPGA Tourboard member, and Jay Monahan, its commissioner, at the White House this month. Trump previously claimed he could resolve golf’s deep-rooted issues in 15 minutes.“I think we’re in a very ­positive place right now,” said Woods, ­speaking to CBS during the final round of the Genesis Invitational on Sunday.“We had a meeting with the ­president. Unfortunately, I had some other circumstances that came up, but Jay and Adam, they did great ­during the meeting and we have another subsequent meeting ­coming up.“Things are going to heal quickly. We’re going to get this game going in the right ­direction. It’s been heading in the wrong direction for a number of years. The fans want all the top ­players playing together and we’re going to make that happen.”Asked if a reunification could ­happen soon, including this year, Woods added: “Yes and yes.”Woods’s sentiment is significant. Not only the most famous player of his generation, the 15-times major winner has also previously spoken of what would be best for the PGA Tour, rather than golf in general. Woods floating the idea of LIV ­players returning to the PGA Tour, plus PGA Tour golfers featuring for LIV, is a departure from his earlier comments.Trump was always thought to be a useful ally to golf upon hisreturn to the presidency, owing to his ­potential influence on the US Department of Justice. That body keeps close eyes on deals between American ­organisations and Saudi Arabia.The “other circumstances” Woods referred to involved the death of his mother, Kultida. Her death wasannounced on 4 February. “Mom was my rock,” said Woods. “Tough process to go through but I’ve had amazing family support. All the ­players have reached out that were playing here this week. The amount of texts and emails and nice messages of support I got has really helped and has really meant a lot to me.”Woods was vague on his playing ambitions for 2025. He had planned to compete at the Genesis before his mother’s death. Attention will now turn towards the Arnold Palmer ­Invitational or Players ­Championship before theMastersin early April. ­Ludvig Åberg claimed the Genesis by one shot from Maverick McNealy, ­maintaining a strong start to the year for European players on the PGA Tour.Explore more on these topicsTiger WoodsDonald TrumpGolfUS sportsLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourSaudi Arabia and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Their Sunday defeat at Tottenham was an engaging if bitty affair that finished 1-0 largely because the low quality of defending on show was compensated for by the low level of attacking. It wasfun in its way, but it didn’t feel a lot like Premier League football.It also meant United dropped to 15th in the table, having won just four of 14 league games under Ruben Amorim. Under Erik ten Hag this season, United were taking 1.22 points per game; under Amorim that’s down to 1.00. Nobody was under any illusions about the scale of the task he was taking on, but four months after Amorim took the job it would be very difficult to identify any concrete signs of progress. There has been the resilience of the performance in the league at Anfield, in the FA Cup at the Emirates, and not a lot else.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreAmad Diallo has impressed, raising further questions about why he was used so sparingly by Ten Hag, but he is now out for the season after sustaining an ankle injury in training. The starting XI on Sunday featured perhaps three players who feel as though they might be part of the long-term future of the club, and even that’s being slightly generous given Patrick Dorgu has only just arrived and thus hasn’t had time to be afflicted by the general malaise. In January, United seemed willing to sell one of the other two, Alejandro Garnacho, if only because as an academy product he would represent pure profit in the Premier Leagues profit and sustainability rules (PSR), thus allowing them to further restock the squad.This, of course, is a large part of Amorim’s problem. The squad he has inherited is a shambles. And while it’s legitimate to wonder why Casemiro is still clanking around the United midfield, a glance at United’s bench, which featured eight teenagers plus Victor Lindelöf, makes clear just how few options Amorim had. It’s probable now that United will suffer their first lower-half finish since 1989-90 – the season when, by legend at least, Mark Robins’s winner at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round kept Alex Ferguson in the job – but nobody should think that is the fault of anybody but the club’s owners.This week will mark a year since Jim Ratcliffe bought just over quarter of the club and the right to run the football operations from the Glazers. He was greeted with optimism; he is local and logic said nobody could be as bad as the last lot. Since then he has imposed a bevy of cost-cutting measures – many bafflingly petty. He has done away with discounts for pensioners and children and installed an array of expensive executives. Dan Ashworth was installed as sporting director, presumably to try to ensure the sort of coordinated approach that has been so obviously lacking since Ferguson left in 2013, only to leave after five months, seemingly for opposing the appointment of Amorim.The 40-year-old’s record in Portugal makes clear he is a gifted coach, but that does not make him the right coach for United. He reiterated again on Sunday that he will keep playing his 3-4-3, that this is a season that almost has to be written off as the players familiarise himself with the system. But he must know that most of this squad cannot play it. He also must realise that there will be no great infusion of cash to rebuild the squad in the summer; United are already under pressure to avoid breaching PSR regulations.Even with a fair wind, as Gary Neville said on the It Was What It Was podcast, it would be an enormous task for Amorim to transform the tactical identity of a club that has almost never previously played with a back three. And that leads to questions: just how certain are the hierarchy that Amorim is the right man? Defining the philosophy should be a job for a sporting director, who would then recruit players and coaches accordingly. The absence of such a guiding hand has been one of the biggest problems for United for over a decade – then they appoint one and immediately ignore his advice.And the wind is not fair. Fans are becoming frustrated by the lack of progress, which on the one hand is hard on Amorim, but on the other is readily understandable, given the way they are being squeezed by the club, paying extra to watch the worst football United have produced in 35 years.The danger is that, even if Amorim is the right man, his reputation will be so tarnished by the end of the season that he will never be able to inspire the belief successful management requires. This is a mess with no easy solutions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had won three European Cups with the Amsterdam club, but he needed to stretch his wings. As Spain relaxed its regulations on foreigners, Real Madrid sniffed around, but it was Barcelona who pounced to reunite Cruyff with the Dutch coach who had so inspired him at Ajax, Rinus Michels. The deal was agreed on 13 August but that breached Dutch regulations which stated that all transfers should happen in July. It took two and half months for the bureaucracy to be resolved, and Cruyff finally made his debut on 28 October.He joined a team just beginning to find its feet after winning only one of their opening five games of the season. They didn’t lose again until after their first league title in 14 years had been decided. But the high point, without question, came on 17 February 1974, when Barcelona went to the Bernabéu for the Clásico. Cruyff ran the game, setting up three goals and scoring one, showing remarkable balance and strength to beat two players in the edge of the box, as Barça won 5-0.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Less than four years later a magnificent, imposing, futuristic stadium has opened on the banks of the River Mersey. A torturous journey decades in the making has been worth every step.History, memory, grief and belonging: my bittersweet Goodison farewellRead moreIt was July 2019 at the nearby Titanic Hotel when the architect Dan Meis unveiled his grand plans for Everton’s new home. Tonight it welcomed its first guests, the 10,000 fortunate Evertonians selected via a ballot to attend the first test event and game at Bramley-Moore dock. A friendly between Everton’s and Wigan’s under-18s has never felt so significant, or such a privilege to observe. Future quiz question answers: Everton’s Demi Akarakiri kicked the first ball and Wigan’s Harrison Rimmer scored the first goal at Everton Stadium. Everton lost 2-1.Everyone present was sat in the South Stand, a steep bank of 14,000 seats that will function as the home end when Everton relocate here next season. In all likelihood as a Premier League club, something that could not have been said with great certainty before David Moyes returned last month as manager. The views are superb, no obstructions here, and also impressive when looking out from the back of the South Stand at a panorama of the city skyline. The facilities are excellent, too. The concourses have vast amounts of space, refreshment kiosks and toilets. The upper Gwladys Street at the 133-year-old Goodison Park this is not.View image in fullscreenEverton’s under-18s take on Wigan in front of a 10,000 crowd in the first game at the club’s new stadium.Photograph: Tony McArdle/Everton FC official photoWigan’s visit was the first of three test events required for Everton to obtain the licence and safety certificate to operate at 52,888 capacity next season. All four stands will be open for the second and third events, albeit at a reduced 25,000 capacity and near capacity respectively. It is estimated the stadium will attract 1.4 million visitors to the city annually, create 15,000 jobs and contribute £1.3bn to the UK economy over its lifetime.What a quest it has been to get here. Everton went through two failed stadium projects at King’s Dock and Kirkby, plus a proposal that never really got off the ground at Walton Hall Park, before settling on this site in the early years of Farhad Moshiri’s ownership.View image in fullscreenA general view of the interior before the test match.Photograph: Emma Simpson/Everton FC official photoMoshiri’s one positive legacy should be celebrated, even though the £750m-£800m project came close to sinking Everton at times: £55m of that sum was spent preserving and restoring heritage works at Bramley-Moore, including the original dock walls that remain under the stadium, the railway tracks that carried coal to steamships on the Mersey and the Grade II-listed hydraulic tower that forms a symbolic part of a 17,000-capacity outdoor plaza. The infill of the dock took three months and 480,000 cubic metres of sand dredged from the Irish Sea. Two porpoises had to be guided out of the dock before it was sealed for good. Architecturally, Everton Stadium is the most striking, ambitious addition to the Liverpool waterfront since the Three Graces were built in the early 1900s. They were also built on an infilled dock, St George’s.The inevitable teething problems that have arisen so far mainly concern access and have been beyond Everton’s control. Liverpool city council recently announced a raft of parking restrictions within a 30-minute walk of the stadium that have caused uproar among local businesses. The restrictions, which came into effect on Monday and are scheduled to last 18 months, apply not only on match days but 365 days of the year. More than 7,000 people have signed a petition calling on the council to scrap the year-round parking restrictions. Local residents and businesses claim they were enforced without consultation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By 10pm on a bitterly cold night at Elland Road, any notions that Leeds would capture the mood courtesy of a suitably cadenced performance had been thoroughly disabused as Daniel Farke’s side fought their way to a dramatic last-gasp win after Wilson Isidor had givenSunderlandthe lead.Yet if it was hardly poetic, substitute Pascal Struijk’s gamechanging double returned Leeds to the top of theChampionship, leaving them two points ahead of Sheffield United, seven clear of third-placed Burnley and 10 in front of Régis Le Bris’s team.Leeds United 2-1 Sunderland: Championship – live reactionRead moreIt was a cruel end for Sunderland as their nasty habit of conceding late goals once again returned to haunt them. “We want to be promoted and the result is tough to take but we can be proud of the way we played,” said Le Bris, whose side look destined for the playoffs. We’re still young and still learning. We played a good first half but Leeds were very good and you could see they had more experience than us. We need more depth in the squad.”Leeds are now unbeaten in 15 league games. Farke was so excited by Struijk’s winner that he was booked in the midst of a wild celebration and fears he will have to watch next Monday night’s game at Sheffield United from the stands. “These are the best sort of wins,” he said. “It was a great night but it was difficult. Sunderland are one of this league’s best counterattacking sides and we had to be patient and we had to fight but this is a major step in our development. I’m pretty proud of my players tonight.”By the end Sunderland were forfeiting possession far too cheaply but they began well and Illan Meslier was swiftly called to arms when Enzo Le Fée sped down the left and squared for the unmarked Jobe Bellingham to test the goalkeeper’s reflexes with a low shot perhaps lacking a little power. When that effort was parried the rebound fell to Patrick Roberts but, once again, Meslier proved equal to the challenge.Nonetheless Le Fée – incidentally a former school friend of Meslier’s in Brittany and fellow product of the Lorient academy once run by Le Bris – had served notice of the talent that once prompted the loanee’s parent club Roma to pay Rennes £20m for his services.View image in fullscreenPascal Struijk heads a late winner for Leeds.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAlthough, even at this early stage, Leeds had plenty of possession, Sunderland kept their cool and waited to pounce. Sure enough an opening arrived thanks to a long ball from Dan Ballard diligently chased down by the increasingly ruthless Isidor, who expertly turned the outmuscled Ethan Ampadu before directing a fabulous angled shot into the net via the inside of both uprights.Too strong, too swift and, above all, too skilful for Ampadu to handle, the former Zenit St Petersburg striker had a lot to do after springing the Leeds offside trap but Isidor’s 12th goal of the season suggested the Frenchman would not be out of place in the Premier League.Farke’s team are not accustomed to trailing at Elland Road in the Championship and, as Sunderland fans serenaded them with renditions of “Leeds are falling apart again”, turned tetchy. Jayden Bogle’s booking for a frustrated tackle on Bellingham after the midfielder’s connection with Le Fée’s gorgeous flick encapsulated the mood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farke’s players were clearly unhappy at their guests’ audacity in breaking Meslier’s run of six clean sheets in the second tier but struggled to fathom out how to exact revenge.Manor Solomon did his best but although the winger dazzled at times as Sunderland withstood a barrage of home pressure, Leeds created precious few clearcut chances until a double substitution on Farke’s part proved inspired as Struijk’s powerful header following Joe Rothwell’s free-kick finally defied Anthony Patterson.In the 95th minute that duo did it again. As Rothwell crossed and Struijk’s close-range header hit the back of the net an extraordinary rescue act was fully accomplished and a high decibel blast of the Kaiser Chiefs’ I Predict a Riot boomed out of the sound system.“If you enjoy watching football, you enjoy watching Joe Rothwell,” said Farke. “His technique is outstanding.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipLeeds UnitedSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Bayern manager, Vincent Kompany, said he would wait until Tuesday before deciding whether the England captain can line up against the Scottish champions.Champions League review: a fired up Vinícius Júnior and McKennie’s screamerRead more“It’s nothing bad with Harry but we’ve not got much time to recover,” Kompany said. “Sometimes you need an extra day. But we’ll see how Harry feels tomorrow morning. I’m assuming it’s nothing bad.”Kompany admitted his description of Kane’s situation was “blurry”. Kane scored the second of Bayern’s goals in Glasgow. Thehosts take a 2-1 leadinto the return and Kompany’s desire to use Kane or otherwise may depend on whether he believes Bayern already have sufficient leeway as they plot a path towards the last 16. Publicly, Kompany is hugely respectful of Celtic.“When you’re playing against teams who are used to dominating and scoring lots of goals in their domestic league, then you have a team who are always dangerous when they get forward,” he said.NeitherBrendan Rodgersnor his goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, appears to be placing much stock in facing a Kane-free Bayern. “He will play,” Schmeichel said with a broad smile. “I know Harry from our time together at Leicester and I have played against him so many times that I can’t imagine he wouldn’t play.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane holds his face during Bayern Munich’s draw at Bayer Leverkusen.Photograph: Marius Becker/APKane, it should be noted, has found the net 19 times against Schmeichel for club and country. Rodgers, theCelticmanager, was only marginally less strong with his sentiment. “It doesn’t change anything in terms of, we need to win the game and we want to win the game,” he said. “If Harry didn’t play then of course it’s a big miss for them but I’m pretty sure there’s another world-class player that would come in and play. I would expect Harry to play.”Rodgers readily admitted Bayern were firm favourites but it is a sign of Celtic’s development at Champions League level that they arrived with a spring in their step. Regardless of the outcome, Rodgers can look back on this European campaign as one containing tangible progress. He has challenged his players to leave Munich with no regrets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So for us, we want to ensure that when we come in after the game, if we don’t go through we’ve given it absolutely everything.“We’ve got the one opportunity. We’ve got to be clever, we’ve got to be bright, we’ve got to be brave in the game. And if we can do that, we’ve shown, and history’s shown in sport, that anything can happen.”The key Rodgers decision is also in attack. Daizen Maeda’s success in a central position in the closing stages of the first leg may mean the Japanese starts in that role, with Adam Idah left out and Jota on the left wing. Celtic’s alternative is to retain Idah and field Maeda on the left.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueCelticBayern MunichHarry KaneVincent KompanyBrendan RodgersEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Among supporters there is growing dismay at the running of the club.Swansea were only four points outside the playoffs towards the end of last year but Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at struggling Stoke proved Williams’ last game in charge. He leaves 14 months into a three-and-a-half-year contract after his team took four points from the last available 27.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The decision comes less than a week after the appointment as director of football of Richard Montague, with whom Williams worked en route to promotion to the Football League with Notts County in 2022-23. Williams predicted Montague “would help a huge amount” but made clear he had no role in his arrival.Swansea’s first-team coach Alan Sheehan has been placed in caretaker charge after Williams’ assistant Ryan Harley and analyst George Lawtey were also dispensed with. Sheehan took interim charge after Michael Duff’s departure in December 2023, overseeing three wins from seven matches.The fans’ forum has been rearranged for 3 March, with Swansea saying the process to appoint Williams’ successor is under way. The under-pressure chairman, Andy Coleman, and Montague are leading the search.“This was a difficult decision and one that has not been taken lightly,” Coleman said in a club statement. “Unfortunately, since the turn of the year our performances and results have not been of the standard required at this level.”Explore more on these topicsSwansea CityChampionshipShareReuse this content"

But now he is in the record books at OsasunaSid LoweMon 17 Feb 2025 11.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 16.28 ESTShareMari Carmen was 78 and late. It was a January morning in Pamplona, cold and wet, and the taxi that was supposed to take her to hospital hadn’t turned up. Standing in the street watching time and traffic pass but no cabs, she was getting a bit worried when she saw a young man she thought she recognised. She, after all, is anOsasunasupporter and he is their striker. Although, like her, he wasn’t having the best of times back then; he was halfway through the season, well into the winter, and had scored just once, when she approached. “Excuse me,” Mari Carmen said. “Are you Ante Budimir? Could you do me a favour? Could you take me to the hospital?”So he did, and there was the selfie to prove it. Mari Carmen knew her family would never believe her but, originally from tiny Carcastillo 50 miles south, recently widowed and having moved to the capital for health reasons, a tumour returning, that was definitely her in the front seat and that was definitely him alongside her. The picture eventually appeared weeks later when her daughter Myriamposted a cartoon stripto thank the many people who had helped her mum over a couple of difficult, lonely months, in which it felt like everything was going wrong at once. “Good on Osasuna for signing people before stars,” she wrote.Leverkusen glitter but muted Bayern grind to get exactly what they need | Andy BrassellRead moreBeforestars, sure, but stars too. “I’d like to think if my mum or grandmother needed help in the street people would be there,” Budimir said when asked about it. That, he said, was “nothing”;this, on the other hand, was quite something. On Saturday afternoon, Mari Carmen’s driver scored against Real Madrid, 22,390 people at El Sadar celebrating as he ran towards teammates who know exactly what this takes, and then handing him a standing ovation when he withdrew. His goal had given Osasuna a 1-1 draw with the leaders and momentarily taken them to seventh, equalling their highest finish in 18 years; it also took him above Sabino Andonegui, the striker who arrived 71 years ago and they called the Hammer of San Juan, history made amid the hysteria.On a weekend in which all the attention was on Jude Bellinghamgetting sent off, an inescapable and childishly hilarious mass debate started about what heactuallysaid and whether it made a difference, everyone everywhere throwing accented English expletives about to the point where a primetime TV setwas literally emblazonedwith “fuck off-fuck you”, you might not know it but something actually remarkable had happened. The baby born in Zenica, Bosnia, whose family had been forced to move to Croatia and begin again, the 33-year-old who hadn’t evenplayedinprimerauntil he was 29, had become Osasuna’s all time top scorer there. “To make history at a club over 100 years old makes me very proud,” he said. And then he said “thank you”: he wouldn’t have got there without help.“People from the Balkans know that the path to success is a long one,”Budimir once told Ara, and while the war is not something he talks about much, it is something that “marks all of us”. From the town of Ozimica, although he was born 50km away in 1991, within six months was taken to Croatia, where his aunt lived. They wayhe tells it, he started playing in the street, usually in goal against bigger kids and within view of the 4,500-capacity Velika Gorica stadium. That, he told his mum, was where he wanted to play but he did better: he played at Radnik, Zapresic and Kranjceviceva, at St Pauli, Crotone and Sampdoria, although there were no Serie A goals. When he joined Mallorca in 2019, they were in the second division;he helped them upand the following season, his first inprimera, scored 13. In 2020, he became Osasuna’s most expensive signing, at €8m, albeit the move was initially a loan. Since then, only three men in Spain have scored more. At Osasuna no one ever has.View image in fullscreenAnte Budimir scores from the penalty spot.Photograph: Ander Gillenea/AFP/Getty ImagesIt had started well – there were 11 first division goals in his debut season, a total only beaten at Osasuna once since 2001, and eight the year after – but the day he took Mari Carmen to the hospital, Budimir had just one. Call it karma if you like, kindness repaid, or just a coincidence, but seven more followed, then 17 the season after, and 16 so far this. Only Robert Lewandowski and Kylian Mbappé have more, and at clubs that create twice as many chances; over the last two, only Lewandowski has.That slump was never likely to last. “Budimir is special,” Osasuna’s keeper Sergio Herrera says. “We have to put up with him sometimes and sometimes we give him some back. He’s so demanding of himself and us that we have to be patient.”Budimir is profoundly religious, a university economics student who describes himself as serious and speaks in a slow, quiet, almost emotionless voice, but also the man who pinned up a handwritten note on Osasuna notebook paper when he moved flats, thanking his neighbours and wishing them all the best. Eighty-five percent of his goals have been scored with a single touch, which feels fitting somehow: no adornment, no flash, just efficiency: always there, over and over again. “It’s madness. And it’s not just the goals; it’s everything he generates, everything he transmits to us,” teammate Aimar Oroz says. No one inLa Ligahas made more aerial challenges; no one has won more, either.He’s the one sending the latest European coefficients to Osasuna’s sporting director, Braulio Vazquez, another opening for La Liga clubs leaving no excuse for failing to update the objective from survival to Europe. “He’s methodical and a bit stubborn: an old-young man,” Braulio says. He’s the one, coach Vicente Moreno reveals, who called before joining, wanting to knoweverything. “No one else has done that,” Moreno says. At Mallorca, where they worked together, Moreno admits some teammates thought the attention to detail was “a bit absurd”; but, he says, Budimir was “convinced that improvement was about repetition”. He recently described the Croatian as a guy that doesn’t treat every match like it was his last, he treats every training session like it is. “I’d invite you to watch him; everything is a product of work,” he said.View image in fullscreenAnte Budimir’s goal took him to 57 inprimera.Photograph: Rubén Albarrán/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockHe is the one who would be on to Jagoba Arrasate, the former Osasuna coach, and especially his assistants, asking for stats, videos, extra drills, dragging them to the training pitch after sessions. The one drafting in some young player to deliver cross after cross. In a press conference after training at Tajonar this week, Herrera was asked about him. The first response was probably the most telling: the goalkeeper just laughed. Then he looked left as if to ask: how do I explainhimtothem? “He’s out of the ordinary: he’s probably still out there working now,” the goalkeeper said, which would be standard stuff, only it turned out he actually was. Within 10 minutes someone had provided a video, live, and there was Budimir alone, finally packing up, wheeling off the wooden box against which he hits countless extra touches every day.“He might not be the best centre forward in the world, but he’s very smart, he knows how to make the most of his qualities and work on his weaknesses,” Herrera said. “It’s every day and you see it. We’re proud to have him. He is an example to us all, and not just because he is going to make history.”And so, a few days later, he did. And if Osasuna were a little fortunate to get a 1-1 draw with Madrid, what he does is no fluke. Madrid started strongly, scored through Mbappé and might have got more: Vinícius could have had a penalty and missed two good opportunities, Bellingham was sent off before half-time, Vinícius and Mbappé still made chances even a man down, Herrera producing a superb stop in injury time, and when Budimir got the chance to equalise on the hour, it came from a penalty they contested. The Croatian’s shot was already rolling wide when Eduardo Camavinga took him out, but the VAR gave a penalty.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowGirona 1-2 Getafe, Leganés 3-3 Alavés, Osasuna 1-1 Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid 1-1 Celta Vigo, Villarreal 1-1 Valencia, Espanyol 1-1 Athletic Bilbao, Real Valladolid 0-4 Sevilla, Real Mallorca 3-1 Las Palmas, Real Betis 3-0 Real Sociedad, Barcelona v Rayo Vallecano (Monday 8pm)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was Budimir’s fifth penalty this season but he won all five himself and you still have to put them away. Last season, he produced the most baffling miss you’re ever likely to see when in the 97th minute at Mestalla his legs just stopped working,as if his brain had jammedand he couldn’t decide which way round his feet went; this time, he sent Thibaut Courtois one way and coolly put the ball the other, the place erupting. Already the highest scoring foreigner in Osasuna’s history ahead of Jan Urban andJohn Aloisi, his 16th goal in all competitions, took him to 57 inprimeraand another record. “He deserves it,” Herrera said. “And his success is ours too.”It was not chance; instead this was the product of a man for whom every detail matters and the people who helped him along the way, someone who does every little thing to the letter. Every. Single. Time. Well, almost. On the morning he became Osasuna’s record scorer, Budimir failed to turn up to the team meeting on time. “I thought it was at 25-past, not quarter-past,” he admitted afterwards. “It’s the first time in my whole career it’s happened, and my teammates enjoyed reminding me. I got a fine but they waived it because of the record and I’ll invite them all to dinner instead.” There was a smile as their greatest ever striker told the story, maybe even a hint of embarrassment too. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Sometimes, though, life’s better like that. Once in a while, Mari Carmen can tell him, good things happen when you’re late and days that start out all wrong turn out all right in the end.PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid2429512Atletico Madrid2423503Barcelona2339484Athletic Bilbao2416455Villarreal2412416Rayo Vallecano233357Mallorca24-7348Real Betis24-1329Osasuna24-43210Girona24-33111Real Sociedad24-33112Sevilla24-53113Getafe2423014Celta Vigo24-32915Espanyol24-132416Leganes24-132417Las Palmas24-122318Valencia24-132319Alaves24-102220Valladolid24-3715Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballOsasunafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet it paid offAndy Brassellin LeverkusenMon 17 Feb 2025 08.09 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 16.31 ESTShare“We played almost perfectly,” reflected Xabi Alonso with, as per usual, not so much as a hint of grandstanding, and it was impossible to disagree. Bayer Leverkusen left the fieldafter Saturday’s Topspielwith plenty of respect, and admiration for their continued excellence. They also left the arena with the feeling that for all their accomplishment, there is every chance the Bundesliga title is going back south to its perpetual home at Bayern Munich.The gap at the top remains at eight points and while a league season should never be distilled to the contents of one game what we took from this was so persuasive, so emphatic without the knockout blow actually being delivered, that the only feeling a neutral could take away was one of incredulity. SinceBundesligastatistics have been recorded never have a Bayern team been so mute. They had no shots on target and the two efforts they did have were not especially notable; a blocked Harry Kane shot and a tame header from the substitute Leon Goretzka that went well wide.Randal Kolo Muani serves up treat for Juve to leave Serie A race wide open | Nicky BandiniRead moreOn the other side of the fence, the tide was relentless. Jeremie Frimpong and Nathan Tella both hit the crossbar in the first half and Tella again had chances after the break. As the finish line approached the best player on the park, Florian Wirtz, screwed a gilt-edged chance wide to the astonishment of everyone inside the BayArena, including Wirtz himself. Rarely has a goalless scoreline so inadequately described a game because make no mistake, this was one-way traffic. At times it felt like an attack-v-defence training exercise, with the defence not allowed to leave their half.If Leverkusen do fail to retain their crown then it won’t be because of their inability to top off this performance with a goal but because of what Alonso described as “some shitty draws we had” against Holstein Kiel, Bochum and Werder Bremen, where points were casually allowed to slip before Christmas. Frimpong and Tella spoke of there being scope to turn it around – there are 12 games to play (“still a long way to go,” said the latter) – but they know they need snookers. The result was, as Alonso put it: “Not enough [in terms of] the table but the feeling in the stadium is OK.”That Bayern chose to play like this – Thomas Müller spoke about how frustrating Leverkusen had been a plan his team had worked on for weeks – was the ultimate compliment, if also a reality of the leaders having had a taxing midweek Champions League tieat Celtic, whileDie Werkselfhad enjoyed a rare week off. If Vincent Kompany and his charges enjoyed a bit of luck here and there, it felt deserved for their doggedness and commitment. Of all the new elements we might have expected from the Belgian taking charge, largely eradicating the defensive gremlins that have undercut his recent predecessors was maybe not one of them.Bayern and Kompany learned fromlast year’s corresponding fixtureat almost the exact same stage. The entry point was different, with Leverkusen coming into the game last February leading Bayern by five points rather than trailing by eight. We should also avoid retrospectively claiming that they intended to cede possession to the hosts (Leverkusen had 56% here opposed to 39% in their 3-0 win in 2024). Alonso’s men pressed and pushed, hassled and harried – on the very borders of illegality in their treatment of Jamal Musiala – and leaving both Patrik Schick and Victor Boniface on the bench was a choice in this direction.View image in fullscreenA view of the BayArena during Saturday’s stalemate.Photograph: Thilo Schmülgen/ReutersYet Bayern’s ability to cope was really something. It is hard to remember a game in which they were dominated like this, yet Manuel Neuer was hardly overworked. “We trained defending our box,” the goalkeeper said after the game, a remarkable admission for a Bayern player. The numbers bear out the change in attitude and application. Thomas Tuchel’s Bayern leaked 45 Bundesliga goals last season. Kompany’s have given up 19 with more than two-thirds of the campaign gone, the best in the division. The man who was pursued for a long time so he could provide the solidity in front of the backline to make it easier, João Palhinha, has made just three league starts, initially through Kompany’s choice and then through injuries. Aleksandar Pavlovic’s mobility, next to a renewed Joshua Kimmich (whose contract extension, to follow up on Musiala’s, is close), has helped, with Dayot Upamecano and Kim Min-jae increasingly good together. They were excellent here.So the leaders got everything they came for. Apart, perhaps, from Wirtz. Bayern have made no secret that they would love to take him – Uli Hoeness, Christoph Freund and other directors have intermittently sent verbal shots of praise and desire, much as Leverkusen rotated the fouls on Musiala, who Bayern wish they could pair him with. Yet lucrative contract extensions for Alphonso Davies, Musiala (who extended to 2030), Kimmich and Neuer all at once have priced Bayern out, as well as Wirtz’s own soaring value. He showed his worth here, almost managing to chip Neuer from halfway and dominating the game before that late, heartbreaking miss. It was his second straight failure to bag an injury-time winner after last week at Wolfsburg, in which he mesmerised the home defence and having made the magic, fluffed the simple bit of putting away a straightforward chance.Which is Leverkusen in a nutshell right now, really. Impossible to criticise, but liable to fall short in this season’s Bundesliga – not least because, this year, it’s a different Bayern.Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowAugsburg 0-0 RB Leipzig, Union Berlin 1-2 Mönchengladbach, Bochum 2-0 Borussia Dortmund, St Pauli 0-1 Freiburg, Stuttgart 1-2 Wolfsburg, Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Bayern Munich, Werder Bremen 1-3 Hoffenheim, Eintracht Frankfurt 3-1 Holsten Kiel, Heidenheim 0-2 MainzWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsNearly title winners in 2023, Dortmund can only dream of competing at such a level these days, with the 2-0 defeat at Bochum – their usually too-small-to-be-acknowledged-as local rivals – the newest low in a season of them. Jamie Gittins, increasing liable to be sold with Champions League re-qualification becoming a shot at the moon, argued with fans after his second-half substitution on an afternoon where the BVB ultras’ patience appeared to snap. “A completely overrated, overpriced and poorly put together squad … completely insulting their own fans,” was the verdict of Bild’s Michael Makus, with Dortmund 16th in the form table over the past six matches.View image in fullscreenTimo Horn in the Bochum goal blocks an effort from Emre Can.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockBochum, though, deserved to celebrate wildly (as they did) after this win that lifts them level with Heidenheim in the relegation playoff spot, a huge success after a disastrous start of just three points and no wins registered before the fourth week of December. With Heidenheim losing again at home to Mainz – after a famous win away at Copenhagen in the Conference League on Thursday – and seven points adrift of fourth-bottom Hoffenheim, who won at Werder Bremen, the bottom three look increasingly stranded.Escape of the weekend goes to Wolfsburg, who won at Stuttgart despite not having a shot on or off target until Tiago Tomás struck a 77th-minute equaliser and Mohamed Amoura scored a later penalty. It was Stuttgart’s fourth defeat in eight weeks, form that is undermining their efforts to return to the Champions League.PosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich2246552Bayer Leverkusen2222473Eintracht Frankfurt2220424RB Leipzig227375Freiburg22-7366Mainz2211357Stuttgart227358Borussia M'gladbach223349Wolfsburg2293310Werder Bremen22-73011Borussia Dortmund22-12912Augsburg22-112813Union Berlin22-82414St Pauli22-72115Hoffenheim22-162116Heidenheim22-201417VfL Bochum22-251418Holstein Kiel22-2313Explore more on these topicsBundesligaEuropean club footballBayern MunichBayer LeverkusenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Randal Kolo Muani tamed the ball and retained it as he was assailed by five Inter defenders who arrived one at a time like henchmen in a Hollywood movie: allowing him to overcome each of them in turn.He evaded Hakan Calhanoglu with a half-step backwards, leaving the Turkey captain to fall under his own momentum, held off Nicolò Barella, dragged the ball back under his boot to spin away from Henrikh Mkhitaryan, flicked it across Francesco Acerbi with the outside of his boot and then poked it with a toe beyond Carlos Augusto and into the path of Conceição.Lyon train their sights on Champions League after Fonseca boost | Eric DevinRead moreAn assist so good it could pull you back from the afterlife. Oh fine, we all know Conceição was only using a figure of speech when he described himself as “morto” in a post-game interview, conveying the exhaustion he had felt right there, in the 74th minute of a fervid, oscillating, and up to that point inexplicably goallessDerby d’Italia. He hid it well as he took a touch on his right foot before sweeping with his left into the bottom corner.Allianz Stadium erupted. Juventus supporters had not seen their team beat Inter here since 2022. The stadium announcer delivered heavy-handed reminders of Juventus’s historical dominance during team introductions, but this decade has so far belonged to theNerazzurri. Reigning Serie A champions, with a further league win, two Coppa Italia triumphs and aChampions League final appearancesince 2020-21, Inter kicked off on Sunday knowing victory would take them back to the top of the table.They played like it in the first half, dominating the ball and repeatedly opening up Juventus’s defence. Michele Di Gregorio did well to keep out an overhead kick from Mehdi Taremi, but Denzel Dumfries and Lautaro Martínez missed the target from straightforward chances.Juventusposed some threat on the break, Conceição and Nicolás González forcing a smart double save from Yann Sommer, but there was no doubting which team was on top.That changed after the interval. Emerging from the tunnel, Thiago Motta told Dazn’s sideline reporter that Juventus needed to win more challenges and make better decisions with the ball. If that sounded too simple then maybe it was, because his players did both things and now looked the more threatening – right up until Marcus Thuram came on for Inter and almost immediately set up Dumfries again. His shot this time was on target, but Di Gregorio pushed it on to the post.View image in fullscreenLautaro Martínez sticks his boot in as he battles for the ball with Renato Veiga.Photograph: Isabella Bonotto/AFP/Getty ImagesAn illusion. Thuram, Inter’s best attacker this season, has been sidelined with an ankle injury and still did not appear to be moving fluidly. Across the pitch, Inter looked surprisingly tired for a team who – unlike Juventus – had not played in midweek.Or perhaps that should not surprise us at all. Inter’s starting XI had an average age of 30 years and 306 days, according to Opta, the oldest they have fielded in aDerby d’Italiasince the league went to three points for a win. Juventus’s was more than five years younger on average.Nor was this game any sort of outlier. Inter have fielded Serie A’s oldest teams all season, and Juventus the second-youngest. TheNerazzurri, furthermore, have used the second-fewest players of any team in the division. Watching them fade in Turin, it was natural to wonder whether those numbers are starting to catch up to them.More likely that was just one piece of the puzzle. One of Motta’s favourite phrases, repeated after Juventus’s 2-1 Champions League playoff round first-leg win over PSV on Tuesday night, is “nel calcio conta tutto” – everything has an impact on the football pitch.Some interventions are more obvious than others. Signing Kolo Muani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain this January has drastically upgraded Juventus’s attack. The Frenchman had scored five goals in his first three appearances for the club, and his assist here in the fourth was as impactful as any of them. He has already displaced Dusan Vlahovic as the team’s first-choice No 9.View image in fullscreenRandal Kolo Muani has upgraded Juve’s attack since arriving in Turin.Photograph: Massimo Pinca/ReutersAn explosive runner and proficient dribbler, he interprets the role very differently to the Serbian. That, in turn, has a knock-on impact for Juventus’s tactics, encouraging them to lean into a more direct, fast-break approach. Until now, they have had the second-highest possession percentage of any team in Serie A – just as Motta’s Bologna team did last season. But Sunday’s game was the third in a row when Juventus have had under 50% of the ball, and the fourth in a row they have won, their longest-such run all season.Perhaps that is only a coincidence, and also reflects the nature of their opponents. Or maybe Motta is becoming more pragmatic. Certainly, the Italian media have been quick to observe how his Bologna team went on a run at this exact point last season – winning six out of seven games from the start of February and drawing the other, against Milan. It was a crucial phase in their path toward Champions League qualification.Might we look back on Conceição’s goal as one of the pivotal moments of this season? The game finished 1-0 to Juventus, lifting them back up to joint-fourth alongside Lazio, and costing Inter their chance to reclaim top spot after Napoli’s 2-2 draw withI Biancocelestion Saturday.Both the title race and the chase for Champions League spots are wide open. Serie A’s top three are separated by five points, a number that only feels smaller for the fact that none of them are in good form. Napoli have dropped six points in three games. Atalanta could have closed to within a game of the leaders, but instead drew 0-0 at home to Cagliari.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowBologna 3-2 Torino, Atalanta 0-0 Cagliari, Lazio 2-2 Napoli, Milan 1-0 Verona, Fiorentina 0-2 Como, Monza 0-0 Lecce, Udinese 3-0 Empoli, Parma 0-1 Roma, Juventus 1-0 Inter, Genoa v Venezia (Monday 7.45pm)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That ought to bode well for Inter, the strongest of the three sides on paper, but they have now taken just four points from their last four matches. Even beyond the poor finishing and tired legs seen on Sunday, there were other surprising signs of sloppiness. Alessandro Bastoni was uncharacteristically off-target with his crossing.The gap from fourth to eighth is also five points. Lazio and Juventus lead the way, but Fiorentina reminded us of their potential in a 3-0 rout of Inter this month, Milan are surging under Conceição’s father, Sérgio, and Bologna, after a tough start under Motta’s successor, Vincenzo Italiano, have lost only once in their last 17 matches.We do not even know how many Champions League places they are fighting for, but Italy’s chances of winning a fifth spot would take a blow if any of Atalanta, Milan or Juventus should fail to make the last 16 of the Champions League. The first two of those are trailing before the second legs of their playoffs.“We need to carry on like this,” said Conceição on Sunday. “The Champions League game is too important. We have to win all over again.”PosTeamPGDPts1Napoli2522562Inter Milan2534543Atalanta2528514Juventus2521465Lazio2513466Fiorentina2514427AC Milan2412418Bologna249419Roma2573710Udinese25-53311Torino25-42812Genoa24-112713Como25-102514Cagliari25-132515Lecce25-232516Verona25-282317Empoli25-162118Parma25-152019Venezia24-171620Monza25-1814Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballJuventusInternazionalefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wubben-Moy missed Sunday’s game because of a muscle injury and Arsenal’s head coach, Renée Slegers, said the defender was awaiting a scan. Mead was an unused substitute.England’s 24 players are due to fly to the Algarve for Friday’s match against Portugal, before hosting Spain, the world champions, at Wembley next Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamArsenal WomenWomen's footballWomen's Nations LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Preston said Osmajic had “strongly refuted the claims” in a meeting with the match officials after the full-time whistle.Championship: Burnley’s Mejbri makes racism allegation after Preston incidentRead moreThe incident is alleged to have occurred midway through the second half of the stalemate, when Osmajic was involved in a heated verbal exchange with Mejbri. TheBurnleyplayer informed the referee, Andrew Kitchen, of the incident and later posted on social media: “I will not be silent about what happened today. I will always call out racism whenever I hear or see it. That is the only way we change as a sport and a society. I am a strong person but nobody should have to experience this disgusting abuse on the pitch.”Preston said in a statement: “Milutin Osmajic has strongly refuted the claims of a comment made towards Hannibal Mejbri in a post-match meeting with today’s match officials. The club would like to thank the match officials for the way they have handled the issue and will assist with the investigation until a conclusion has been found.”The FA, which must decide whether to bring charges, confirmed it was looking into the claims.Kick It Out, the anti-discrimination organisation, said: “When allegations occur, reporting them immediately and through the right channels helps them be addressed. Hannibal deserves credit for bringing the incident to the referee’s attention. Speaking up takes huge courage. We also commend the officials for following the correct protocols. We expect an investigation to be carried out swiftly and sensitively.”Explore more on these topicsPreston North EndBurnleyChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

Slot admitted Liverpool’s second-half performance was the first time this season his team haveplayed with doubt, and Andy Robertson appealed to the crowd at one point to calm down.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreVan Dijk believes tension was understandable after Matheus Cunha reduced the deficit and with Everton’s 98th-minute equaliser in theMerseyside derbystill fresh in the mind. But he is adamant the league leaders, who remain seven points clear of Arsenal, have the experience and mentality required for the tests to come.The captain said of Robertson’s crowd interaction: “Did he say that? I didn’t even know. We are all human beings. I can fully understand that side at times and I think they [the crowd] would love to keep supporting and shouting. If the third goal [a disallowed Mohamed Salah shot] had counted it would have been completely different.“I said it weeks ago: we just have to buckle up and enjoy the ride. There will be a lot of twists and turns. If you’re not ready for it – and we have been there already – it will be a difficult couple of months for you but I feel like we as a team are ready for it. We will give it everything we’ve got and we will see in 13 games if that is enough. I totally understand anxiety or nervousness can kick in but we need the fans in the best shape of their lives and they need us to be in the best shape of our lives as well. Hopefully by the end of the season we can all enjoy it even more.”Liverpool travel to Aston Villa on Wednesday, Manchester City on Sunday and host Newcastle the following midweek in what could prove a key period. Van Dijk admits the title favourites must raise their game having struggled against Wolves and Everton.“Yes we have to up it because you play against teams who can hurt you even more, especially at two away grounds where the teams are very good,” he said. “If you’re not ready for it you don’t deserve anything.”Liverpool have announced a freeze on general admission and season-ticket prices for next season after discussions with the club’ssupporters board.

But the head coach is waiting on the second-rower George Martin, who was not part of full training on Monday because of discomfort in his knee.Six Nations half-term report: Ireland top of class but Wales go from bad to worse | Ugo MonyeRead moreScotland are the only Six Nations team England have yet to beat under Borthwick after they clinched a29-23 victoryin the head coach’s first match in charge in 2023 beforeprevailing 30-21 at Murrayfieldlast year.Tom Curry said there had been an “edginess” to training this week as England seek a win that would keep theirSix Nationstitle hopes alive, and his fellow back‑rower Ben Earl explained how the squad have been shown video clips as they bid to stop Scotland’s four-match winning run.“We’ve watched some of that back, we’ve learnt some lessons,” Earl said. “We’re not going to be short of motivation, that’s for sure. There will be a unit meeting and we’ll be told that they mauled us for 7.1 metres per maul last year … that’s not a great stat for the forward pack, is it? It’s stuff like that, dropping that in. We know that there’s a job to do and that might contribute to the feeling we’ve got in the group at the moment.”Two years ago at Twickenham, Duhan van der Merwe ran riot, beating five defenders on the way to the tryline, before the South Africa‑born winger racked up a hat-trick at Murrayfield 12 months ago.For Earl, the Twickenham defeat was particularly painful and prompted some soul-searching as he soon found himself dropped from Borthwick’s squad, while the loss last year sparked England into changing their attacking approach.“It is [difficult to watch] but I’m a big believer that those are the kind of games where you learn the harshest lessons,” Earl said.“I distinctly remember 2023 Scotland at home was a big turning point for me. That was a time where the penny really dropped and I felt I had to learn some lessons. It’s something I’ve looked back on and am almost grateful for. But it’s never nice. [I learned] I was unfit, that I didn’t know what it takes to become a top‑class international rugby player, I didn’t know what it took to play under Steve. Some harsh lessons but nothing I’d change.Quick GuideRussell and Graham may be fit to face EnglandShowScotland backs Finn Russell and Darcy Graham are both \"in the hunt\" to be involved in Saturday's match against England at Allianz Stadium, according to assistant coach Pete Horne. The pair were cast as doubts for the Calcutta Cup  after sustaining head injuries in a nasty collision with each other during the first half of last Sunday's 32-18 defeat by Ireland at Murrayfield.However, both players remain with the squad and have been taking part in light training at Scotland's warm-weather base in Oliva Nova, south-east Spain, over the past few days. Their 12-day stand-down period from full contact rugby is due to end on Thursday – the day the squad fly from Spain to London – and if they pass the required protocols, they will be free to train on Friday with a view to playing on Saturday.\"They're both progressing well through the protocols,\" Horne said. \"I think depending on how that goes over the next couple of days, there's a chance that they could both play. There won't be any risks taken. I'm sure the medics are right on top of it. They're both in the hunt.\"Scotland have added Bath centre Cameron Redpath, Edinburgh scrum-half Ali Price and Edinburgh wing Ross McCann to their squad, with centre Matt Currie dropping out due to concussion, back-rower Alexander Masibaka returning to his club Soyaux Angouleme and scrum-half George Horne having a facial injury assessed.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s not necessarily unfit in terms of physiologically.

With England players given last weekend off, Curry was able to spend time with his miniature dachshund, Toby, and revealed dog-walking plays a part in his recovery programme.“It is more the way I walk,” Curry said. “I just make sure I am walking on my heels and it is a good distraction so having Toby is good. My run-in from Christmas was really good physically. It felt like I was finally playing with two hips, which was nice. Coming into this tournament, it feels like the first time I’ve played in an England shirt where all I’ve been focused on is the game, the ball, where I am with the ball. That’s been a lot of weight off my shoulders. Just go out and throw yourself into it.“I have won big games and sometimes you come back in and the first session everyone is on their heels a bit.

Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine being a pro for 19 years. There’ll be lots of time to reflect but, before then, I’ve got some big races to prep for.”Thomas added to BBC Breakfast: “Since I was a kid I dreamed of riding the Tour and being part of the Olympics and winning was obviously a dream as well, but to achieve that was just nuts. Beijing was massive, my first Olympics and winning gold there. But the Tour’s what changed my life, being recognised all over the place. The yellow jersey is iconic. You go anywhere in the world and people will know the yellow jersey, how it signifies cycling and its history. So to be a part of that history and to win it, I just pinch myself.”Thomas played a supporting role in all four of Chris Froome’s Tour de France successes between 2013 and 2017 and finished second to teammate Egan Bernal in the 2019 edition, before claiming a third podium place in 2022.He won Commonwealth gold for Wales in the road race in 2014, was British champion in both the road race and time trial and finished on the podium twice at the Giro d’Italia.

It was difficult to really trouble the performance of the chip, so it should handle anything most people want to do with a phone.

The drawing assist tool turns crude sketches into various styles of art (left).Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSamsung has built on the numerous“Galaxy AI” tools added last year, including new drawing features and a fresh AI select tool. This allows you to simply tap on images, text, icons and other items on your screen to see what you can do with them – such as drawing, editing or searching.The“Now” bar at the bottom of the lock screenshows a stack of widgets such as live sports scores from Google, currently playing music, timers, reminders for flights and other timely things. It is a cross betweenGoogle’s At a Glanceand Apple’sDynamic Island on iPhones, and is useful. Live notifications, such as scores, can also show in the status bar.It also produces an AI-curated snapshot of your day featuring local weather, calendar events, photos you’ve taken, reminders, health information, Spotify playlists and other bits. It once told me to be careful using my phone while walking as apparently I had used it for 42 minutes out of three hours of walking. I didn’t find that particularly useful.View image in fullscreenThe S Pen stylus remains for drawing on the screen, but its magic wand and remote features that have been one of key selling points since thedays of the Galaxy Note serieshave been removed.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe star addition is thenext generation of Google’s Gemini assistant, which has the ability to perform multiple tasks at once using apps on your phone and the web. For example, it can pull times and dates from the web to set a reminder for you or send the info to friends.It promises a lot, and when it works properly it can be thoroughly impressive. But it also trips up on trivial things, such as failing to send a WhatsApp to a friend because they spell their name “Paterson” with one “t” not two. Or confidently adding a reminder for the nextFantasy Premier Leaguetransfer deadline, but getting the date and time wrong. Fundamentally it can’t be trusted to just get on with things without you needing to check it for accuracy, which is a problem for all AI tools at the moment.The rest of theOne UI 7 software experience, the latest version of the operating system, is pretty slick. Parts of it are more like Apple’s iOS than ever, but it has enough customisation options to make the phone look and behave how you want. Samsung will support the S25 Ultra with software and security updatesfor seven years from release, which matches the best from Google and Apple.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is fairly simple to operate despite being packed with capabilities.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe S25 Ultra has a very similar camera system on the back asits recentpredecessors, including the main 200MP camera, a 10MP 3x telephoto and a 50MP 5x telephoto camera capable of optically zooming to 10x magnification, or beyond with digital zoom. New for this year is a much improved 50MP ultra wide camera, which has much better low-light performance producing crisper and better detailed images indoors and in other dim environments.The camera app is also packed with plenty of fun and useful modes, including its best-in-class portrait mode, full manual control and various advanced tools. But as with its predecessors, the S25 Ultra’s best feature is simply the adaptability of having four cameras with multiple different magnifications available.PriceThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs from£1,249(€1,449/$1,299.99/A$2,149) with 256GB of storage.For comparison, the Galaxy S25 costs£799, the S25+ costs£999, theZ Fold 6costs£1,519, theGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XLcosts£1,099and theiPhone 16 Pro Maxcosts£1,199.VerdictThe Galaxy S25 Ultra kicks off the year as the most powerful and adaptable of mainstream slab Android phones.The camera is great with more lens choices than others. It has the most powerful Android chip going, long battery life, plenty of storage, a huge screen and a stylus.But Samsung hasn’t added much to the formula that made the model such a killer device several years ago. The design feels like an endpoint for the high-end smartphone. It’s not obvious where you go from here to meaningfully change the experience on a hardware level.That leaves its AI features to offer something new. Some of them are great, many are gimmicky and some features, such as the upgraded Gemini assistant, are very hit and miss. Sometimes it can be fabulous, while being annoyingly dumb or simply untrustworthy in other moments.The Ultra is a great phone that will go the distance. Just don’t buy it for the overhyped AI features.Pros:massive 120Hz screen, highly capable camera with 3x and 10x optical zoom, good software with seven years’ support, top Android chip, long battery life, access to the latest AI features.Cons:huge, extremely expensive, S Pen lacks a little magic of previous versions, doesn’t meaningfully improve on formula of predecessors, AI capabilities overhyped for now.View image in fullscreenThe matt glass back has a similar monolithic and imposing look to the screen on the front.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsSamsungAndroidSmartphonesMobile phonesTelecomsreviewsShareReuse this content"

As a kid, I’d hurkle-durkle while blearily watching my school uniform warming on the radiator. These days, I set smartphone alarms for several consecutive minutes, just to make sure I’m roused. It’s too dark, and I’m too groggy.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’d heard ofsunrise alarm clocksbefore the Filterasked me to review them, but little did I suspect they could resolve my waking woes. Essentially, they’re a combination of alarm clock and light-therapy device that glows with increasing brightness as your wake-up time approaches. The light interacts with our circadian rhythms, much as the sun does when it rises, so we wake up biologically prepared for the day.How sunrise alarm clocks made my mornings betterAs a writer interested in tech, I often review fascinating and useful gadgets, fromelectric heatersto, erm, smart drinking fountains for cats. It’s enjoyable – but only a few of the products change my lifestyle in the long run. Sunrise alarm clocks soon proved to fall into this exclusive category. Through much of the winter I wake in darkness, so my organs probably won’t have received signals from my brain to prep them for the day.My top sunrise alarm clock picks – theLumie Bodyclock Spark 100and thePhilips SmartSleep wake-up light– have tangibly changed the equation. I’m waking up feeling more energetic, less groggy and mentally sharper.What matters in a sunrise alarm clockAll of the sunrise alarm clocks I’ve tested had their strengths – lilting wake-up sounds, pleasing design, useful features, and so on – but only certain models surpassed the brightness threshold that seems to wind my circadian clock. Whereas seasonal affective disorder (Sad) lamps are often advertised with a lux rating for brightness, this important stat tends to be absent from sunrise alarm spec sheets, which makes it difficult to know how bright a model will be. One good indicator is if they have certification as a medical device, as is present with the Bodyclock Spark 100.How these devices play into healthy sleepSleep is personal, and no single device will suit every slumberer. For me, sunrise alarm clocks have benefited my sleep-wake cycle more than any other product – perhaps excluding mymemory foam mattress. Very good models such as theLumie Sunrise Alarmcan be bought for less than £40, so it’s worth trying one if you find dark mornings difficult.An important benefit ofsunrise alarm clocksis that your morning wake-up no longer involves your phone. Stopping a smartphone alarm means your day begins with eyes on-screen – and the road from here to doom scrolling is about the length of a thumbprint. By using any kind of alarm clock you can start the morning smartphone-free.If you’re still waking up on the wrong side of the bed, you can find further recommendations in the Filter’s guides to thebest mattresses,sleep aidsandelectric blankets.

They are wrongCarlo Invernizzi-AccettiFor many, going to college is the very definition of the American dream. Relieved from familial burdens and toil work: it is a brief and precious period of freedomMon 17 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 18.05 ESTShareOne of the many guises in which the Trump-Musk duo presents itself to the American public, as they take office in the new administration, is as ”employers-in-chief”: seasoned businessmen entitled to give life advice to their fellow citizens on the basis of a purported real-life experience that cuts against received wisdom.It is in this guise that both Trump and Musk recurrently attack higher education institutions as one of the as yet unconquered bastions of the “liberal America” they are now keen to tear down. Already during his first presidential bid in 2016, Trump famouslystatedthat he “loves the poorly educated”. More recently, at a campaign rally in support of Trump’s re-election bid, Muskstatedthat “too many people spend four years in college, accumulate a ton of debt, and don’t have any useful skills they can apply afterwards”.The message appears to be landing. According to recentpolls, the percentage of Americans who express “a lot of confidence” in higher education has declined from 57% to 36% over the past decade, and only about one in four now believe it is “extremely” or “very important” to have a college degree to get a well-paying job in today’s economy.Defending the emancipatory promise that has historically been at the heart of the United States’ higher education system against these attacks and widespread concerns requires going back to the basics about the nature of that promise. Simply pointing to statistics about the monetary returns of a college education won’t cut it, for at least two reasons.To begin with, aggregate data says little about individual life or investment decisions. While it is true thaton averagecollege graduates make between 60% and 80% more than workers without college degrees, a lot depends on what you study, where and at what cost. A more detailedprogram-level assessmentconducted by Wharton professor Peter Cappelli found that “the cost-adjusted payoff from many college programs across the country – as much as one in four – is actually negative”.More importantly, however, this purely monetary way of assessing the value of a college education already concedes too much to its critics. By focusing exclusively on the economic returnsaftergraduation, it ignores the broader educational – but also moral and political – value of the experience of actuallybeingin college.There are not many times in most people’s lives nowadays when they can devote themselves to cultivating their own talents and opinions, without immediate regard to external constraints. Prior to entering college, most young people remain under the tutelage of their parents and are therefore at least in part constrained to do whattheythink is best for them. Afterwards, they usually have to enter the labor market, thereby falling under the authority of their employers, or at least the economic constraints of their revenue-generating activities.That is why, in his recent book entitledThe Student: A Short History, Wesleyan University’s president, Michael Roth, reminds us that the college experience has historically been construed as a “concrete exercise offreedom”. In advocating for the creation of a publicly funded university in the state of Virginia at the beginning of the 19th century, for instance, Thomas Jefferson maintained that it was essential for a citizenry aspiring to be “self-governing” to have the opportunity of spending a period of their lives dedicated to cultivating the capacity to “judge for themselves what will secure or endanger their freedom”, unencumbered from both familial authority and the burdens of toil work.The usual retort against this conception of higher education as an intrinsically valuable exercise in freedom is that it can at best be available to a privileged few. The former director of the (for-profit) University of Phoenix, Mark DeFusco, ison recordstating: “I’m happy that there are places in the world where people sit down and think. We need that. But that’s very expensive. And not everyone can do that. So for the vast majority of folks who don’t get that privilege, then I think it’s just business.”Upon reflection, however, this is the stance that turns out to be most truly elitist, since it assumes that the freedom afforded by a dedicated period of cultivation of one’s own talents and opinions cannot – or indeed shouldn’t – be available to everyone. As a professor at a higher education institution – the City College of New York, founded with the explicit goal of “educating thewholepeople” – I cannot abide by such a surrender of America’s democratic promise, masquerading as realism.For most of thepredominantly working class and first-generation studentson our campus, the decision to enroll is not a consequence of “privilege”. It involves significant costs and also risks. That is why it is generally experienced as an achievement in itself. By the very fact of going to college, these students already get to take part in what they themselves frequently – and unironically – refer to as the “American dream”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also includes a direct experience of freedom in the present. And although many City College students also have to work to support themselves while studying, they usually see their jobs as instrumental to their education, not the other way around.I take there to be a lesson in this also for our “employers-in-chief” – which is that the American dream they are so fond of referring to as well isn’t for most people about rushing to servethem(more or less lucratively) on the job market, but rather about a more expansive life of freedom, of which higher education remains a core component.Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti is executive director of the Moynihan Center and full professor of political science at the City College of New York.Explore more on these topicsUS educationOpinionUS universitiesDonald TrumpElon MuskUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s frightening and dispiriting to watchDonald Trumpand his sidekick Elon Musk wreak havoc on institutions from the National Archives to the Treasury to USAid – infiltrating data systems, firing internal watchdogs, taking the side of every ne’er-do-well, threatening the wellbeing of dedicated civil servants and persecuting the most vulnerable people in our society.The insults to common sense, basic morality and good government seem to come hourly. Some are disastrous – like the anti-science RFK Jr picked for health and human services secretary – and some are relatively small, like the furor over the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.Here’s how Democrats should fight back against Trump | Margaret SullivanRead morePut them all together, and it feels as if we’re watching the US implode before our eyes. Not that this nation was ever anything but deeply flawed, but it did hew to democratic norms like the rule of law.And it’s all happening so fast and so relentlessly.Lofty media discussions of whether we are in a constitutional crisis fail to grasp the severity. That term “does not even begin to capture the radicalism of what is unfolding in the federal bureaucracy and of what Congress’s decision not to act may liquidate in terms of constitutional meaning”, as the New York Times columnistJamelle Bouieput it earlier this month.What’s worse, there’s little reason to think things will improve any time soon, or perhaps at all.In an important piece published this week inForeign Affairsmagazine, the prominent scholars Steven Levitsky and Lucan A Way wrote that democracy is in greater peril now than at any time in modern US history.They forecast that US democracy “will likely break down during the secondTrump administration, in the sense that it will cease to meet standard criteria for liberal democracy: full adult suffrage, free and fair elections, and broad protection of civil liberties”.These political scientists see us moving into “comparative authoritarianism” – not a full-blown autocracy but certainly going that way.They do have some advice for those who want to slow this juggernaut. This includes public officials, journalists, lawyers, judges – and ordinary Americans.“Hold the line,” they say.“Trump will be vulnerable. The administration’s limited public support and inevitable mistakes will create opportunities for democratic forces – in Congress, in courtrooms, and at the ballot box.”But here’s the caveat: “The opposition can win only if it stays in the game.”That won’t be easy. The endless harassment and threats – downright intimidation – will discourage many of Trump’s critics from taking a stand.We see plenty of that already with the way some news organizations have softened their tone toward Trump, reporting the facts but not getting the outrage across.We see it in ABC News’s decision to settle a defamation claim by Trump that they should have fought and probably would have won. Even before the election, we saw it in the abrupt withdrawal of anti-Trump editorials at the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times.Some of this retreat is invisible, Levitsky and Lucan note. Talented young lawyers, the kind who might have run for public office in the past, may decide that, in this ugly environment, that’s a bad idea.Without making a direct statement, many who oppose Trump’s movement will move to the sidelines and keep their heads down.“Such a retreat would be perilous,” the authors note. “When fear, exhaustion, or resignation crowds out citizens’ commitment to democracy, emergent authoritarianism begins to take root.”At some point, there’s no turning back.What can regular Americans do? Perhaps most crucially, they can stay informed and engaged.Want to defeat Trump? Support unions | Eric BlancRead moreThey can keep track of what’s happening, not just throw up their hands and think only of sports, entertainment and family life.They can support democratic institutions, including news organizations (no matter how imperfect) or individual journalists. They can help to make sure voting can happen fairly and freely in their communities, including by volunteering as poll workers.They can communicate with their elected representatives, telling them what they find unacceptable and encouraging them when they do something right. They can do the same with journalists and their bosses.They can donate to organizations that defend press and speech rights like the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press or PEN America. They can seek out trusted voices, like that of my Guardian colleague Robert Reich and many others.Sadly, some of my most idealistic friends have decided to check out. After all, they did what they could to keep Trump from getting a second term – they voted, they donated, they wrote letters to prospective voters, they worked on campaigns.Having failed, as they see it, they say that they’re done caring.I understand that attitude. I might be tempted to do the same if I weren’t a journalist writing about politics and media.I’m far from certain that staying aware and engaged will make any difference.What I do know is that if we all tune out, there’s no hope at all.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

King Abdullah of Jordan squirmed in the Oval Officelast week, as the press asked him and Donald Trump about the latter’s Gaza plan. He is in a tight spot, wanting to keep Trump onside while at the same time not agreeing to the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Immediately after, anonymousEgyptian “security sources”– not parties prone to leaking without strategic direction from President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi – said that Sisi would not accept an invitation to visit Washington as long as the Gaza displacement plan was on the agenda. Now, this was probably more for the Egyptian public’s consumption than for Trump’s benefit – Egypt is in no position to make an enemy of the new administration – but it nonetheless shows how hard it is for Trump to secure the acquiescence of even the US’s closest allies.Saudi Arabia alsopostponed a visit to the USonce Trump announced his intentions for Gaza. And in a remarkable change of tune, Saudi, which before 7 October 2023 was en route to normalisation with Israel and is not usually a country to make heated statements, lost its patience. When Benjamin Netanyahu quipped that maybe it would like to take Palestinians from Gaza (“they have a lot of territory”, he said), Saudi state media unleashed astorm of invectiveagainst him. When Trump announced his plan, Saudi Arabian authorities immediately put out a statement rejecting it. So keen was the government to signal that rejection that itreleased the statement at 4amlocal time.Leaders are scrambling to calibrate their responses atan emergency summit on Thursdayhastily convened in Saudi Arabia. But they will struggle to do so without landing themselves in hot water with Trump, members of the Arab public or global opinion on the illegality of the plan. “The current approach is going to be difficult,” the United Arab Emirates (UAE) ambassador to the US said when asked if his government could find “common ground” with Trump on Gaza. He might have got away with that. But perhaps feeling that it was a little too strong, he went on to say that “we are all in the solution-seeking business” and he doesn’t really “see an alternative to what’s being proposed”. The clip immediately starteddoing the roundson social media as evidence of the UAE’s endorsement of ethnic cleansing. There is clearly no consensus on Trump’s Gaza approach, or even how to respond to it, between countries that make up a political bloc but have divergent interests.Time is running out. On Sunday, Marco Rubio kicked off atrip to Israel and the Middle East. Conversations that some have been avoiding on Trump’s home turf will have to happen there. A need to come up with a common line and strategy on behalf of Arab countries is now pressing. The task is to thread a needle: flattery of Trump and rejection of his Gaza plan are irreconcilable, and each time even a single head of state engages with Trump or is asked about Gaza, there is the risk of a comment that inflames feelings or infuriates the US emperor. The Arab summit seems a very long way away when every day brings another Trump gambit or threats to the end of the ceasefire in Gaza.The scramble is part of a bigger problem. Arab states are unable to settle on a position on Palestine. Before 7 October, normalisation agreements with Israel had been secured bysome Arab nationsand were under way with others, with Palestinian statehood a nominally plausible prospect subject to technical questions, even though in reality everyone knew it was more remote than ever. The war killed that plausibility, and Trump buried it.1:26Trump puts Jordan's king on the spot about plan to take in displaced Palestinians – videoWith the stakes so raised, it is impossible for Arab nations to engage with Israel and the US on Gaza and Palestine one way or the other without undoing something big. The political landscape is finely balanced. Egypt and Jordan are the most important parties when it comes to any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza due to their proximity, and would be most affected by any resettlement campaign. They are also big USforeign assistance recipientswith weak economies and governments with shaky mandates. These payments andmilitary aidare in part remuneration for these states being “stabilising” parties in the region, serving as buffers between Israel, Iran, Hamas and all proxies, absorbing refugees and facilitating the movement of US military assets through the region. Losing US aid weakens not only their economies, but also theirmilitaries, security agencies and ability to maintain the patronages and oppressions needed to stabilise politics.But there areother calculations. Agreeing to a plan that involves the expulsion of Palestinians in essence turns all receiving and facilitating countries into parties to what will simply be a wider, differently configured Israel-Palestine conflict. Instead of the removal of Palestinians from Gaza being an end to something, it would be the beginning of something else, with the horror of mass displacement on top. It is unfathomable not only in cruelty and criminality, but also in terms of practicality: already,35% of Jordan’s populationare refugees. Also – and Trump can be forgiven for not getting his head around this, considering how invisible they are – people live in these countries, millions of them. They might not have a say in how their politics is run, but they have an opinion. That opinion has historically been managed but by no means erased. It’s not a safe bet to assume that the mass removal of Palestinians won’t set off something explosive, either in terms of popular discord, or its exploitation by competing political or even extremist players.To stop Trump’s Gaza plans, Palestinians need solidarity and support | Omar BarghoutiRead moreIn short, Arab governments are being forced to confront and settle a question that goes to the very soul of the contemporary region – what does Arab identity even mean any more? Is it just a group of countries that speak the same language and share borders, but with regimes and elites that have become too enmeshed with the west to be viable on their own terms? Or is there still some residual sense of agency in those regimes, some echo of political integrity and duty towards other Arabs?Beyond the existential, though, here is what Arab leaders should learn from Trump giving them orders about their territories and people: the price of their US-stabilised status quo is now so high that it makes less and less sense on a practical basis. To submit to Trump would be to accept full vassal status and summon new domestic challenges, and all for an unreliable benefactor. To defy him would entail a full-blown reconfiguration of politics in the region that might seem too colossal to contemplate. Arab political elites find themselves in this mortifying position because of their historic feebleness on Palestine: it is a concentrated expression of their own weakness, capture and shortsighted self-interest. The future ofGazais no longer an issue that can be finessed while saving face indefinitely. Trump’s plan is a gateway to the final erosion of the integrity and sovereignty of the wider Middle East.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Polling suggests he has a reasonable chance of moving into the Lodge in a few weeks.If he’s good as his word, Dutton would attempt to put the brakes on investment in large-scale solar and windfarms and battery storage, which has just taken off and begun to approach the pace needed to get close to Labor’s goal of 82% renewable energy by 2030 and replace a fleet of coal-fired power plants nearing the end of their lives.It would require billions of dollars of taxpayer funding to maintain the old, run-down coal plants in an effort to keep them functioning for longer. Experts say there is no guarantee it would succeed.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailDutton and his climate and energy shadow minister, Ted O’Brien, suggest this approach – limiting the amount of new capacity entering the system, reducing competition in the electricity market and relying more on ageing infrastructure – would somehow improve grid reliability and lead to cheaper bills in the short-term than otherwise would be expected. He hasn’t explained how.4:36Here's why Peter Dutton's nuclear power plan is a fantasy - videoOver the past year, coal-fired power on the national grid has on averagecost 2 ½ times more for each megawatt hour of electricity than solar energyand 60% more than wind energy. Gas-fired power was even more expensive – about twice as much as coal.Dutton’s claim that his plan would lead to cheaper power bills in the near futureisn’t supported by the modelling that was released to back it up. But the soundbite survives.The Coalition’s approach of burning more coal and gas for longer would alsosubstantially increase greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity gridfor at least the next two decades, just as scientists are stressing – again – the need for urgent action and investors are highlighting the potential benefits of developing green industriesthat may no longer see a future in the US.Dutton appears immune to these arguments. He has opposed and said he wouldreview, and possibly abolish, measures introduced to limit climate pollutionfrom heavy industryand transport (which, together, are responsible for more than 50% of Australia’s emissions). Both skyrocketed in the Coalition’s near decade in power last time around.View image in fullscreenBeyond naming the seven sites where the Coalition might build power plants, Peter Dutton has not answered any of the key questions about how his nuclear energy pitch would work.Composite: Guardian AustraliaDespite this, the Coalition claims that it is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. There is nothing at all to back that up, but the strategy is clear: say the line, watch it be repeated by news media, and voilà! Political problem dealt with.Fans of meaningful political debate should hope it’s not that simple. Certainly, some within the Coalition tent see problems with their party’s position.Take senator Matt Canavan, a former cabinet minister and leading climate-denying voice from the Coalition’s right flank. He doesn’t like renewable energy but believes his colleagues are “not serious” about nuclear energy, that it “ain’t the cheapest form of power” and that Dutton is promoting itbecause it “fixes a political issue for us”.Or take Christopher Pyne, from the Liberals’ moderate wing and a senior minister under three Liberal prime ministers. Writing in Nine newspapers last month, he argued compellingly thata nuclear power plant would never be commissionedif the opposition was elected but – in what he described as “good news for Dutton” – suggested it was unlikely this reality would dawn on most people before the election.Put another way: the Coalition could sail into power arguing for something that people within the party realise can’t and won’t be delivered.The east coast grid now runs on about 43% renewable energyThat’s certainly the view of many in the energy sector. The chief executive of AGL, Damien Nicks, last week stressed what many say privately – that time and costmade nuclear a non-option to meet Australia’s electricity needs, and the focus must be building what the grid needs now – renewables, batteries, pumped hydro and fast-start gas “peakers” as backup on the few days a year when they are needed.Nicks could hardly have been more dismissive of Dutton’s short-term positioning, saying: “We’re making 20-year decisions that will outlive changes in politics every three or four years.”AGL is not without sin in the chequered history of Australian climate politics, but this sort of long-term view is the only sensible position an energy company can take.The transition of the power grid is a challenging logistical exercise, and all sides of politics are guilty of over-simplifying what is involved – and their ability to keep power prices down. Labor has spent the past three years regretting its pre-election claim that its policies would lead to a $275 cut in household bills by 2025, something it couldn’t have guaranteed even if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine hadn’t triggered a sharp rise in the price of coal and gas.The reality is that power prices are not likely to come down whoever is in power. The goal is to limit the rise and set the country up with a reliable and clean system as rapidly as possible.The job is made much harder without bipartisan support. What’s galling to those working in the industry is that the Coalition is proposing to upend the current path just as a version of a workable future is starting to take shape.The east coast grid now runs on about 43% renewable energy. Despite what is claimed, this is not causing blackouts. Clean Energy Council data last week showed investors committed to about 1.6GW of new solar and wind capacityin the final quarter of 2024, roughly the scale that is needed every three months to get somewhere near Labor’s 82% target.AGL rejects Coalition’s nuclear option and doubles down on big batteriesRead moreIt was published as the parliament passed a bill that delivers tax credits to green industries – hydrogen and critical minerals – that reach production stage from 2027. Labor also accepted a Greens amendment to a separate electricity-related bill that formalised its targets for clean energy expansion – at least 23 GW of new renewable energy plants and 9 GW of storage capacity – in law.These are substantial changes that passed with relatively little fanfare. They are evidence of what can happen through cross-parliamentary agreement.But the Coalition continues to head in another direction, arguing – as the Nationals’ leader David Littleprouddid on Monday– that you can’t run an economy the size of Australia on renewable energy. Why not,given the Australian Energy Market Operator has found otherwise? He didn’t say.Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editorExplore more on these topicsEnergyClear AirRenewable energyNuclear powercommentShareReuse this content"

Why aren’t all women getting it?Rhiannon Lucy CosslettThe tragic loss of a mother of three highlights how widespread perinatal mental illness is – and that care is patchy and underfundedMon 17 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 11.09 ESTShareTwo sobering facts for you: 1) Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death in the period from six weeks to a year after birth, and 2) There are only 22 mother and baby units in the whole of the UK, with not a single one in Northern Ireland.Perinatal mental illness – a leading complication of pregnancy – is in the news again. Services are crumbling and overstretched, anda postcode lotterymeans women are often struggling to access treatment, with devastating consequences. The new Labour MP Laura Kyrke-Smith has beenspeaking movinglyabout the death by suicide of her friend Sophie, who ended her life 10 weeks after the birth of her third child. Sophie had been suffering from anxiety, especially around her baby’s feeding, and they had spent a night in A&E, but it is unclear whether signs that she was at risk were picked up by professionals.Her friend has been left wonderingif, amid all the worry about the baby, anyone asked her mother if she was OK, and what a difference that might have made not only to Sophie, but to the three young daughters she left behind.In pregnancy, you are monitored for all sorts of physical complications. In fact, the average woman during pregnancy has 16 contacts with health professionals. They measure you and scan you and take your blood and urine samples and monitor you for pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. They should also ask you about your mood, but this doesn’t always happen, or not often enough. After you have your baby, your health visitor and GP should check the baby’s health and ask about the mum’s wellbeing, but it can sometimes feel like a tickbox exercise, and the attention paid to this, and the help available, can vary wildly from place to place.The Maternal MentalHealthAlliance and the Royal College of Midwives say that there are stark variations in the levels of care and the length of time it’s taking to access what could be lifesaving support. They and Kyrke-Smith want to prevent women at risk from slipping through the cracks by making mental health support fully embedded into routine maternity care. There have been great improvements in recent years – including the creation of designated mental health midwife posts – but there is a desperate need for more funding and staff.I am a mother with some firsthand experience of the perinatal mental health system. I have waddled through the crumbling temporary buildings. I have sat on hold on the phone in tears. And I have felt the shame that sometimes hampers women for asking for help during what everyone tells you should be a wholly joyful period of your life. It took three referrals – two from a hospital consultant, and one from a particularly tenacious health visitor – to get me some specialist help.There is, understandably, a high threshold for referral (though let’s be honest, it is probably too high). Services are so stretched that it can be difficult to think that you are deserving of care. “There must be so many women worse off than I am,” you think, even if you’re told that you absolutely should be receiving help. At a time of acute need and decades-long issues of underfunding, the notion of preventative maternal mental health care seems like a luxury, even though – as in my case – getting support established in pregnancy can help stop things reaching crisis point once the baby arrives.I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I received outstanding care, especially from the mental health nurse, who made home visits and was in touch by phone. But sadly, it is help I would not necessarily have got in another borough or region. So many mums that I have met have soldiered on alone, or said, many years after the fact, “I think I had postnatal depression”, or “the thoughts I was having were not normal”. Helping women and their loved ones recognise when they need that extra support – and that they are deserving of it – should be a crucial part of the pregnancy journey. Asking how they are, listening to them, noticing any alarm signals, and signposting to relevant services is now standard in some trusts, but it should be everywhere.There are places where charities are trying to fill the gaps, but lots of women need a higher level of care than free counselling delivered by volunteers. A friend who moved from London to Somerset is testament to this. She received brilliant care in her first, twin pregnancy, in Islington, but during her second pregnancy she had to opt for expensive private therapy. This was despite writing up a document summarising her history of postnatal depression (PND) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and asking health professionals to read it.What does this tell us? Depressingly, it suggests that even the most vocal self-advocates can struggle to access support, so what hope is there for those who feel they do not deserve it, who are vulnerable, or who haven’t spotted the signs that they need help?Labour MP to push for better maternal mental health care after friend’s suicideRead moreThere are many awful details in the story of Sophie’s case, from the messages she sent in those desperate first weeks, to the rich life she left behind. What made my own heart sink was reading about her difficulties with feeding. Kyrke-Smith has said how she doesn’t know “whether the conversations they were having about the baby’s feeding were done in a way that was considerate of the mental health struggles that my friend may have been having”. Since I wrote about my own challenges with breastfeeding, several mental health professionals have told me in private that they believe the way the NHS delivers Unicef’s baby-friendly breastfeeding policy can be incompatible with thesafeguarding of women’s mental health. A 2022 study in Nature alsoraised concernsthat exclusive breastfeeding promotion policies may exacerbate adverse maternal mental health outcomes. A truly baby-friendly policy values the sanity of that baby’s mother.I am so glad that the conversation about maternal mental health is happening, and measures such as the introduction of specialist mental health midwives are a step in the right direction, but more funding, more staff, more education, more monitoring, more data, and more outreach are urgently needed. One in five women suffer from a mental illness in the perinatal period. When will mothers stop being left to cry it out?Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author.

Don’t let science ruin the joyful imperfection of home cookingAlicia KennedyYes, I’ve made balsamic vinegar pearls and sous-vide swede – but trial and error still produces the most delicious foodMon 17 Feb 2025 05.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 13.40 ESTShareTo make pearls of balsamic vinegar, first chill a good amount of olive oil in a tall glass. While it waits in the fridge, in a small saucepan over a medium heat, bring the vinegar and agar-agar to the beginning of a boil – just until the agar-agar has dissolved. Let this mixture cool, remove the oil from the fridge, and use a pipette to drop balls of the agar-stiffened vinegar into the oil to form the pearls. Drain into another container using a small sieve to catch the pearls. Reserve the oil for another use.I remember making these, my first and only foray into what is known as “molecular gastronomy”, in 2013. It was already a bit passe at that time, but the science experiment aspect of creating a simple acidic garnish for a chocolate and strawberry cupcake that Valentine’s Day was undoubtedly fun. The lesson influenced how I’d go on to use agar-agar, a seaweed-derived vegan gelatin, in dishes like panna cotta or flan, but I never made the pearls again. They were a novelty, and now I have a fond memory of cosplaying as Ferran Adrià, a Spanish chef who popularised these sorts of processes through the restaurant El Bulli.The pearls came to mind while reading about an experiment conducted by Ernesto Di Maio at the University of Naples in Italy. His team found that if you swap an egg between boiling water and 30C water every two minutes for eight cycles, totalling 32 minutes, the egg will be perfectly evenly cooked between white and yolk. New Scientistreported on this findingrather credulously, as though home cooks are truly perplexed about how to boil an egg to their liking.Rather than cooking science that’s about making something pretty and fun, like the vinegar pearls, this experiment was about making an instance of everyday cooking labour intensive, water-wasteful and time-consuming. I could see someone doing this experiment once, the way I made the vinegar pearls, and then going back to their tried-and-true method. (For what it’s worth, dropping eggs into already boiling water and letting them cook for seven minutes is how I get my preferred texture of jammy orange yolk.)In the long history of the relationship between cooking and chemistry, there’s often been this kind of push-pull between what is actually going to enliven and enlighten a home cook, and a pursuit of perfection – whether in technique and taste or in nutrition. Indeed, cuisine in the US throughout the early part of the 20th century was defined by a divide between gourmands, who were interested in food and wine for the pleasure it gave them, and the “scientific cooks”, who were obsessed with eating as a means of ingesting the proper amount of vitamins, minerals and calories without any interest in the joys of the table.“Food science” differs from the restaurant-driven style of molecular cooking because it’s usually focused on nutrition, flavour chemistry and shelf stability to the most common ends of creating industrial products. Molecular gastronomy, a term coined in 1988 by Hungarian-born British physicist Nicholas Kurti and French physical chemist Hervé This, has been focused on culinary applications of scientific principles and processes: sous-vide cooking a steak by sealing it in a vacuum bag and cooking it slowly in a water bath; using liquid nitrogen to create a carrot foam; or transforming the texture of olive juice through spherification. These techniques were popularised through El Bulli, Wylie Dufresne’s New York City restaurant wd~50, and Grant Achatz’s Chicago restaurant Alinea – and the latter is the only one of these still open and wowing diners with apple candy filled with helium that arrives to the tablein the form of a balloon. (I’ve eaten there, and it inspired me to sous-vide slices of rutabaga – swede – again, just once.)A chance encounter took me from a New York skyscraper to a London food market – and a new life | Franco FubiniRead moreRather than these kinds of perhaps gimmicky tasting-menu ideas, “innovation” in food these days tends to come in forms that are focused on an ideally sustainable future: plant-based faux meats; chef-driven proprietary seed companies like Dan Barber’s Row 7; or strawberries grown indoors year-round by the company Oishii. These are more in line with what food science has always been about, which is precision, uniformity and replication: products that can scale and turn a profit, but retain the culinary considerations learned from molecular gastronomy.If there is to be a scientific touch to food, it’s come to be understood that there should be an element of that higher-minded gastronomic purpose afoot in order to convince people of its worth.While it’s always been fun to mix scientific approaches with home cooking, what worries me about a focus on “innovation” for the sake of a “perfect” squash or strawberry, a profit-driven soy patty, or new techniques for simple things like boiling eggs is that they could have the effect of deterring people from cooking. Learning how to pick fruit or vegetables at the market and getting into the kitchen to cook them will always be acts of trial and error, and they should be fun.Cooking is an experiment, every day, in how water, oil, salt and so many other elements can come together for the purpose of making something delicious. But unlike a laboratory or a factory, the result doesn’t need to be the same every single time, or held to a precise scientific standard. Weather, moods and attention all influence how a human cooks – and there’s a lot to enjoy in the imperfections.Alicia Kennedy is a food and culture writer and author of No Meat Required: The Cultural History and Culinary Future of Plant-Based Eating, and a forthcoming memoir On Eating: The Making and Unmaking of My AppetitesExplore more on these topicsFoodOpinionChemistrycommentShareReuse this content"

Now the prime minister wants to put it outMon 17 Feb 2025 03.51 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 03.55 ESTShareAs the devastation in Gaza continues, Palestinian families in Britain are racing against the clock to try to bring our loved ones to safety. Newsfinally cameof a successful family reunification – but instead of being able to feel a moment of relief for this one family, we’ve had to face a vicious political and media backlash.The UK media, government and even the prime minister have fixated on a “loophole” that allowed a mother, father and four children fromGazato be granted the right to live in the UK via the Ukraine family scheme. It obscures the reality that there is no Gaza family reunification scheme, forcing Palestinians to navigate an immigration system that offers no clear pathway to safety.Here are the facts:the legal team representing the family did not argue for their entry under the Ukrainian scheme, but simply used that form as a vehicle to submit a human rights application because no dedicated form exists for Palestinians. The court ruled in the family’s favour underarticle 8of the European convention on human rights, which protects the right to family life. The judge made it explicitly clear that the Ukrainian scheme was irrelevant to the case, yet Keir Starmer has chosen to pledge to “close the loophole” while the media vilify the family’s success, using inflammatory language such as “opening the floodgates” to justify inhumane policies.For me, a Palestinian from Gaza, this is not just an abstract policy debate – it is deeply personal. My mother, father and three siblings, after enduring six months of genocide and being displaced more than five times, managed to evacuate to Egypt. Their home in Gaza was bombed, and they survived starvation and constant terror. They have no family or legal status in Egypt, and they have a right to be here with their family after everything they have endured. And so for months I have fought through a hostile UK system, desperately trying to secure a way to bring them to safety.Yet rather than recognising its moral and legal obligation to establish safe pathways for Palestinian families to be reunited, the government has chosen to manufacture outrage over a legal ruling that reaffirmed a fundamental human right. This decision should have been a catalyst for action, prompting the UK to introduce aformal Gaza family reunification schemefor families such as mine. Instead, the government seeks to shut down any possibility of reuniting in safety, fuelling anti-Palestinian sentiment and legitimising further inhumane policies. We want our families to be safe, and we are met with closed doors.TheGaza Families Reunitedcampaign, alongside 350 families in the UK, has been tirelessly advocating for an immediate family reunification scheme. But the government’s refusal to act leaves families in limbo, suffering through endless legal and bureaucratic hurdles just to be with their loved ones.Judge who granted Palestinian family right to live in UK made wrong call, says Keir StarmerRead moreThe contrast between the UK’s response to Ukrainian refugees and its treatment of Palestinians could not be more glaring. After Russia’s invasion, the UK swiftly created astructured schemefor Ukrainian families. In comparison, Palestinians – who have endured 15 months of genocide, starvation and mass displacement – are left without any dedicated family reunification pathway.This is not about seeking refuge out of choice, but the fundamental right to family unity. Despite what is stipulated in article 8 of the European convention on human rights, Palestinians are forced to fight legal battles just to be together. The legal process is already prolonged and complex, and many families are unable to secure legal representation to even begin applications.Family reunification is about more than just immediate survival – it is about dignity, healing and justice. We, the Gaza Families Reunited campaign, are not seeking permanent resettlement in the UK. We only want to be with our families while they are unable to return to Gaza.Israel’s systematic and forced displacement of Palestinians – whether through military aggression, starvation or forced exile – is aclear breach of international law. The UK cannot claim to uphold international law while simultaneously denying Palestinians the right to safety and family unity.Palestinian families in the UK have watched helplessly as their loved ones in Gaza experience relentless bombings, starvation and forced displacement. They have the right to be reunited, to heal, and to find safety together until it is safe to return home.Ghassan Ghaben is a member of the Gaza Families Reunited campaignDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fresh Peruvian air still rejuvenated my lungs and the brain fog induced by my daily smartphone addiction hadn’t yet crept back in.The disastrous events that followed began once I turned my phone back on. Responding to a Twitter solicitation for Peru recommendations, a man I’d never met posted: “Go mountain biking down a volcano in Arequipa!”Those eight words would change my life.I didn’t even know what Arequipa was, and yet within an hour of the tweet I’d resolved to change all my plans and go. I waved goodbye to my hiking buddy and swapped my flight to Lima, Peru’s capital, for Arequipa, its second biggest city, noted for its striking volcanoes, valleys and adventure sports.As I’m a lifelong adrenaline junkie, the opportunity felt irresistible. I’ve skydived, sand-dune surfed, paraglided, bungee-jumped off New Zealand’s tallest tower, been propelled from the water into the air by a jet pack and doneTough Mudder-style adventure events which included ice baths and an “electroshock therapy” obstacle of 10,000 volts.These experiences shouldn’t be taken as braggadocio that claims: “I’m mad, me!” but more as a recognition of a lifelong problem. I had always found the pedestrian, repetitive monotony of daily life stultifying without a semi-regular thrill to remind me of my own mortality. Descending a volcano by mountain bike felt too seductive, a once-in-a-lifetime experience I couldn’t let pass.I struggled to find a tour company that would take me as a solo rider. Three suppliers cancelled at the last minute the night before. It was almost as if the universe was telling me something bad would happen. Still, I ignored such signs and finally found a guide.My head brushed the roof of the 4x4 as I set out with my guide and a driver for the two-hour journey up the winding Pichu Pichu volcano which dominates the city’s skyline, so tall at 4,200m that my ears popped on the ascent. As the SUV rolled over the volcano’s ancient lava-encrusted bumps, a familiar feeling returned to my gut: nervousness, excitement, the feeling of being alive.My guide offered me four routes, increasing in order of difficulty. He tried to get me to buy the fourth – the hardest (and most expensive). I opted for the third. At the summit I geared up: knee pads, elbow pads, helmet, extra layers. Initially the descent – down a spiralling gravel path which wrapped around Pichu Pichu – was glorious. I belted Life by Des’ree as we whizzed down the winding track. Adrenaline surged through me. My guide showed me three “shortcut” off-road descents straight down from the spiral. I declined each for being too steep until it started to get awkward – I’d literally paid him to take me off road, and I was staying on road. I agreed to the fourth descent.Suddenly the hills felt perilous; I was almost at a 90-degree angle. My singing abruptly stopped. My colon travelled to my larynx. I screamed at an emasculating pitch and surprising volume. “Well done, Mr Gary!” my guide said, laughing, as I completed a steep descent. “Remember: don’t brake on the hill.”The bike then picked up an alarming pace. I felt panic travel through me. I resisted braking for most of the descent till it felt too dangerously fast. I saw my guide, who’d stopped ahead of me on the narrow rocky trail, rapidly nearing. Fearful I’d knock him over, I braked too hard into a skid.Furious amounts of dry dust erupted from the hilly dirt ground in protest. My back wheel flipped up, throwing me over the handlebars. In a wallop, my entire body weight landed on my right wrist. Through the clouds of dirt, I briefly saw the outline of my bike in the air. The dust cleared enough for me to see it hurtling towards me before landing on top of me, instantly winding me. At altitude.View image in fullscreenGary Nunn after breaking his wrist mountain biking in Peru.Photograph: Gary NunnArid soil filled my mouth; the first thing I did was spit. I could barely breathe. My hearing faded back in. “Mr Gary? Mr Gary, are you OK?”I was too winded and in shock to respond. “Catch your breath, Mr Gary,” my guide said. The first word I choked out was an expletive. The first feeling was sheer embarrassment. Then disappointment. Then pain.My guide insisted my wrist definitely wasn’t broken; he’s a former paramedic, and if it was broken, it would have swollen more, he said. He even tried getting me back on the bike, but I was in too much pain. Deflated, I asked him to radio the van-of-shame to drive me the rest of the way down the volcano. I slipped and slid down the dusty narrow trail, swearing each time I bumped my wrist.The next day, in agony, I headed to a private clinic. My wrist was definitely broken. Broken so badly that, eight months on, my wrist still isn’t fully functional.Looking back on that last adrenaline-fuelled ride, I feel both idiotic and philosophical, sad and cautious. I should have eased in more gently on an easier route.Cyclingfast both on and off road has long been my passion, but at the age of 42 I have reluctantly conceded that my mountain-biking days are probably over. Doing the same thing and expecting different results is madness. Twenty minutes of euphoria just isn’t worth the risk of two months in a plaster cast then many more in physio.And it’s not just mountain biking I’ve turned the page on. Gently letting go of the thrill-seeking side of myself is a reluctant metamorphosis, but one that recognises both a 36-hour rave atBerghainand a broken bone will take longer to recover from as I ease into middle-age. Each action has an equal and opposite reaction, and that reaction lengthens and intensifies, arguably from your 40s onwards. Each activity will now require a clear-headed risk assessment by speaking it through with someone less gung-ho than me. Four-day hiking with tents? Yes. Canyoning? Maybe. Free solo rockclimbing? Absolutely not. I’m currently deciding whether to ride theworld’s largest zip-line system in Mexiconext month. Jury’s still out. The old me would’ve already booked it.Quitting adrenaline-seeking activities has made me take a closer look at my thrill-seeking need and what it says about me. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist. I’m still figuring out what this means for me, and how to manage it, but it contextualises my risk-taking. While it’s a popular aphorism for wellness memes and trite wall-hangings, the spontaneity of the “carpe diem” or “yolo” mindset is all well and good till you’re in a foreign hospital being told you need bone-resetting surgery costing £4,000 – and your travel insurance won’t pay. I’ve realised: sometimes living for tomorrow is healthier than living for today.Gary Nunn is a freelance journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsCyclingWhy I quitHealth & wellbeingMountainscommentShareReuse this content"

China certainly doesn’t relish a trade war with the US, but it was better prepared than others for Mr Trump’stariffs, and both sides appear to be leaving room for a potential deal. And, though China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is poised for worse to come, the second Trump term is bringing Beijing opportunities as well as problems.International respect for the USplummetedunder his last administration. As the US president turns the screws on long-term partners, China is looking to take advantage. Colombia quickly caved to Mr Trump on the matter of migrant returns, but China’s ambassador has beencelebratingthe “best moment” in relations between Bogotá and Beijing. Under pressure from the Trump administration, Panamaannouncedthat it would allow its participation in China’s global infrastructure plan, the belt and road initiative (BRI), to expire. Yet behind-the-scenes arm-twisting had already beguntilting Panama backtowards the US. Mr Trump’s attempts to humiliate and bully may backfire there and across the region.He is likely to find it harder going, too, away from his back yard, in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The US has never been afraid to use hard power, but trade, aid and military alliances have also been key to its hegemony. No longer. Mr Trump’s attack on South Africa,cutting financial assistance, may delight Elon Musk, but pointlessly alienates an important middle power. His declaration that the US will expand its territory in various locations – using military force if necessary – shows his utter contempt for the law, as does his order tohalt enforcementof US legislation banning the bribery of foreign officials.China might well benefit byaddressing some of the impactof the US axing aid – it funds at least one affected group. But it has focused more on loans and infrastructure than partnership with local organisations, and its record suggests it is unlikely to fill the financial holes left by the US.There is little naivety about engagement with Beijing these days, but many countries will conclude that they have little choice but to hedge their bets. China is most likely to gain ground in multilateral institutions, and among middle‑income nations thatview it much more positivelythan high-income ones.Mr Vance’s blast at European leaders at the Munich security conference, and promotion of the hard right, was ashocking moment of clarity. Yet far from holding out a velvet-gloved hand, Beijing has just appointed a controversial “wolf warrior” diplomat as its special representative for European affairs. Lu Shayesparked furywhen, as ambassador to France, he questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet states and Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea. As China and the US contend, others are likely to find themselves not wooed but pressured by both sides.China rose more rapidly in the global order than it could have expected. Now it is watching US power deteriorate far more quickly. That’s promising for a country that wants a multipolar world without inconvenient universal values. Yet the question is not just how others react to Beijing’s growing power but whether a security free-rider may find itself taking on roles it hoped to avoid, or having to cope with the vacuum left if it doesn’t.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As the great musical ‘disruptor’ unveils his new murder-and-mandolins epic, he looks back on his most famous collaborationAlexis PetridisMon 17 Feb 2025 12.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 12.55 ESTShareAsk a set designer to create a bohemian Paris apartment and they’ll probably come up with something that looks a lot like Jean-Claude Vannier’s: books everywhere, vintage Bauhaus armchairs, art on every bit of wall space. You would say the living room was dominated by his grand piano, but your eye keeps getting drawn to a plethora of toy pianos that sit on and around it. On closer inspection, there are toy pianos on the shelves too, crammed among the books. “I’ve got more in the other rooms,” shrugs Vannier, speaking through an interpreter, “and I have a house in the country that’s full of them too. I take them to concerts and play a note or two. I find it adds something to a live performance that is filled with virtuosos. I have an open-tuned guitar that I kick, too – it makes a big boom.”Disrupting an orchestral performance by playing a toy piano or kicking a guitar seems characteristic: Vannier, now in his early 80s, has been a disruptive presence in French pop for 60 years. His latest project is pretty odd: a song cycle performed by a vast mandolin orchestra, accompanied by a story written by Vannier that involves a broken romance, alcoholism, homelessness and murder.His album Corpse Flowers featured songs about despairing monkeys and the danger of voiding one’s bowels when drunk“All the great love stories are sad,” he says, “because if people live happily ever after and have lots of children, there’s not much to say.” In fairness, it’s certainly less strange than the story Vannier’s most famous collaborator,Serge Gainsbourg, came up with for his 1972 album L’Enfant Assassin des Mouches (The Child Fly Killer). This involved a small boy persecuting a fly before being smothered to death by a swarm of the insects.If Jean-Claude Vannier et Son Orchestre de Mandolines seems an unlikely diversion, it’s no more peculiar than Vannier’s 2019 album Corpse Flower, a collaboration with Faith No More’s vocalist Mike Patton (a Vannier superfan who’s releasing his mandolin album on his label Ipecac) that featured songs about despairing monkeys and the danger of voiding one’s bowels when drunk. Nor indeed Vannier’s own career as a singer-songwriter in the 70s, which came about, he says, because no one else wanted to sing his chanson-inspired songs.It’s meant as no reflection on the quality of the albums to say you can see why: Vannier’s idea of a single was a song called Merde, V’la le Printemps, or Shit, Here Comes Spring. “It wasn’t my intention to shock anyone,” he says. “I just wanted to talk about what I saw around me. I had a song called Mon Beau Travelo – My Beautiful Transvestite. I was doing the music for a ballet withRoland Petit. After the performance, he would take me to the side streets off the old Paris Opera. There were many drag queens there. We used to watch them and that’s what inspired the song. It was very controversial at the time, and no one was willing to sing it, but it’s not shocking. It’s just what I wanted to express.”Vannier’s reputation, however, really rests on his arrangement and soundtrack work. David Holmes, DJ and creator of soundtracks for a host ofSteven Soderberghmovies, has called Vannier “the greatest soundtrack composer of them all, a true genius”. Vannier has worked with everyone from singerFrançoise Hardyto literary provocateur Michel Houellebecq. He wrote and recorded songs with the latter, Houellebecq even taking singing lessons to get his voice up to scratch.Mentioning his name provokes a frown from Vannier: “It’s true that I’ve worked with him, but he’s someone who will never be my friend. I met one of his publishers in an antique shop near here and they [joked], ‘Houellebecqis worse than a gangster!’ He has a terrible reputation, so I would never associate with him. But I’m a huge fan of his actual writing.”For all of these people, Vannier constructed astonishingly inventive orchestral arrangements, that occasionally touch on atonality and often bear the influence of music from the Middle East – the result, he says, of his disastrous first job, as an engineer in a Paris studio.View image in fullscreenPoses … Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin in the 1970 film Cannabis.Photograph: Sunset Boulevard/Corbis/Getty Images“I started with yé-yé singers, young girls and boys, and I made a lot of mistakes. So they had me record accordionists, who at that time were seen as very vulgar: their music was for Saturday night dances that were a bit violent. They didn’t have a good reputation. I messed up again, because I wasn’t particularly interested in this music, so they had me record Arab musicians. This was during theAlgerian war: there was a lot of fear aimed at Arab people, they were not popular at all in France. I loved working with them. I was happy, because I loved Arab music.”But it’s Gainsbourg who remains his most celebrated client. Vannier worked with him on the lauded soundtracks for the films Cannabis, La Horse, and Les Chemins de Katmandou and, most lauded of all, on 1971 record Histoire de Melody Nelson. A flop on release, it’s now acclaimed not just as Gainsbourg’s masterpiece, but one of the greatest French-language albums in pop history.Its belated rediscovery by crate-digging sample hunters and musicians in the 90s also seemed to spark a broader shift in anglophone listeners’ traditionally snobbish, dismissive attitude to French pop: if something as extraordinary asthishad escaped widespread attention, what else had the country’s musicians produced?“I think you’re right,” says Vannier. “When I first started receiving emails from kids in the UK that went on about how amazing this record was, I thought they were laughing at me – I know the British are very big on sarcasm. But then Mojo magazine called my daughter saying they wanted to do a big spread on me. I was astonished. I think that, quite simply, they just didn’t have access to these records before. They accepted me with open arms and more. I realised I had influenced a lot of people.”You can say that again. Echoes of his dramatic Melody Nelson orchestrations can be heard everywhere from Beck’s Sea Change to the Arctic Monkeys’ Tranquility Base Hotel And Casino, and they’ve been sampled by everyone from Portishead to De La Soul. In recent years, Vannier has conducted huge, star-studded concerts of the music in London, Paris and LA.Prankster … Vannier with one of his toy pianos.Photograph: Courtesy Jean-Claude VannierYet his relationship with Melody Nelson is a tricky one. Vannier says he wrote most of the music – “Sometimes Gainsbourg would come and see me with a melody, but more and more he would turn up with absolutely nothing and I would have free rein” – but Gainsbourg declined to give him a writing credit. They remained friends until the French singer’s death in 1991, but Vannier seems to have found Gainsbourg’s penchant for provocation a little trying.“He pretended to be a shit-stirrer,” he says, “because it was profitable for him financially. He wasn’t really interested in politics or philosophy or psychology – he was just prompted by whatever his press people told him to do. Before TV appearances, he’d run his hands through his hair so he looked more dishevelled. At the start, he actually pretended to be an alcoholic when he wasn’t – he was trying to shock on purpose to amuse his audience. At the end of his career, he genuinely was an alcoholic, but at the beginning that was a pose as well.”Melody Nelson had another belated effect. While working for a French label, the British DJ, producer and “Gainsbourg obsessive” Andy Votel heard “garbled rumours in Parisian record shops” about a mysterious “Melody Nelson follow-up” that had never been released. Some of the rumours were pretty lurid: it was based on Lord of the Flies, it had an “X-rated cover”, it had been banned.It turned out they were talking about L’Enfant Assassin des Mouches. “The guy who produced it worked with a guy called Mike Brandt, a really kitsch singer who was big in the 70s, although Eminem later sampled elements of arrangements I had created for him.” This was on 2009’s Crack a Bottle. “I’d made a few hits with this guy, so to thank me, his producer said he’d make a record with me and I could do exactly what I wanted. It was very, very expensive to make. I don’t think anyone today would throw so much money at such a strange project.”My parents hated artists – there was no way I was going into musicThe results were astonishing, if deeply weird: a melange of funk, free jazz, hard rock, musique concrète and stunning orchestrations. His label was so horrified, it refused to press more than a handful of copies. If Vannier was surprised by the belated interest in Melody Nelson, it was nothing compared to his bafflement when Votel contacted him, asking to rerelease it, which he did in 2005 to vast acclaim.It’s been quite a career. At 82, Vannier “doesn’t do much work” nowadays, but doesn’t give much outward impression of slowing down, with another soundtrack coming up. Perhaps he can’t stop. “When you love music,” he says, “there’s absolutely nothing that can prevent you from making your own music. My parents were devout Protestants. They absolutely hated artists. There was absolutely no way I was going to pursue a career in music. But once I turned 18, I had the right to do so. When your real passion is music, it’s like a tide that absolutely nothing can stop.”Jean-Claude Vannier et Son Orchestre de Mandolines is out now on Ipecac.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockSerge GainsbourgFranceClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s been one celebration after another, includinga star-studded live concertthat aired this past Friday, a repeat of the show’s very first episode during its regular Saturday-night time slot, and any number of self-produced and third-party retrospectives across the media landscape.Lady Gaga, Will Ferrell and Lauryn Hill headline star-studded SNL concertRead moreAll of it was leading up to Sunday’s three-hour anniversary special. From previous specials, we knew about what to expect: the return of popular cast members, characters, sketches and guest stars; an audience of A-list celebrities; a diverse array of musical guests; and equal amounts of self-deprecation and self-mythologizing. Still, you knew there’d be plenty of fun surprises and probably a good bit of emotion on display.That latter quality comes on heavy at the top of the show, with Sabrina Carpenter sharing a duet with showrunner Lorne Michael’s close personal friend Paul Simon. The song they’ve chosen is Simon & Garfunkel’s Homeward Bound, which the former previously played onSaturday Night Live, alongside George Harrison, in 1976. Carpenter gets in a funny line about how neither she nor her parents were alive then, but given how frail the 83-year-old Simon both looks and sounds, there is a real gravitas and gravity to this opening performance.Favorite recurring host and “new diversity hire”Steve Martinis given the honor of delivering the opening monologue, which he regards as “typically the worst part of the show”. He takes digs SNL’s age (“A person born during the first season … could today be easily dead of natural causes”) as well as his own (“I turned 79, but I feel like I’m 65 … which is also not good”). He is interrupted first by former show writer John Mulaney, who pays tribute to the celebrity hosts (“894 people have hosted … only two of them have committed murder”), and later by best frenemy/Canadian national Martin Short, who is dragged off stage kicking and screaming by Ice agents.Martin jokes about “frontloading” the monologue so that they can slack off for the rest of the show, but it’s actually a pretty low-key intro. Nevertheless, Martin makes the most of it by being his funny, goofy self.The first sketch of the night has Fred Armisen’s variety show host Laurence Welk introduces a musical act from horndog lounge singer Robert Goulet (Will Ferrell) and the three lovely Maharelle sisters (Anna Gasteyer, Kim Kardashian and Scarlett Johansson). But it’s freakish fourth sibling Denise (Kristen Wiig) who steals both the show and Goulet’s heart. A solid mashup of memorable characters from different eras of SNL.We then get a new edition of Black Jeopardy. Keenan Thompson stars as host Darnelle Hayes, while the contestants are played by Leslie Jones, Tracy Morgan andEddie Murphyas Tracy Morgan (this reveal earns the biggest laugh so far). The running joke of the sketch is that Black people don’t watch Saturday Night Live. The contestants are utterly clueless about it, even when Chris Rock shows up to remind them that he was once on it. Things do change when “Tracy Morgan” leaves and is replaced by returning champion/Maga voter Doug (Tom Hanks). It should come as no surprise that Murphy – the greatest cast member of all time – absolutely walks away with this one.Emma Stone pops in to talk about the show’s history of contrarianism, before being interrupted by the high-kicking Sally O’Malley (Molly Shannon), who is also celebrating turning 50 this year. Together, they intro a video tribute to SNL’s long tradition of physical comedy. The likes of Shannon, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Chris Farley and more are honored for their commitment to pratfalls, before the video wraps up with a lovely dance montage centered around the late Gilda Radner.Then, Short and Shannon return as the absolutely soused parents of newlyweds Kelsey and Matt (Chloe Fineman and Andrew Dismukes). Their reception speech devolves into a drunken make-out session, before the bridesmaids (Carpenter, alongside Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner and Sarah Sherman) perform renditions of Wicked and Taylor Swift songs about the bride’s affair with “hung Latin guy” Domingo (Marcello Hernandez), who has once again made a cuck of poor Matt. This time though, Matt’s got backup in the form of his groomsmen (Bowen Yang, Kyle Mooney, Andy Samberg and Beck Bennett). Along with Carpenter, they sing a version of Espresso about Matt’s own affair with Domingo’s brother Renaldo (Pedro Pascal). Meanwhile, a third half-brother, Santiago (Bad Bunny), has been having sex with Kelsey’s parents. I’ll admit to not getting the appeal of the Domingo sketches beyond the fact that they always feature a singer with a huge fanbase on TikTok, but he is the first breakout character the show has had in ages, so it makes sense that they’d give a segment over to him here.Following a brand new Deep Thought by Jack Handey – “Looking back over 50 years, we treasure the laughs, the friendships, the fond memories … but the real treasure was how much money we were making” – Tina Fey andAmy Poehlertake center stage.The pair field questions and answers from celebrity audience members Quinta Brunson, Tim Meadows,Ryan Reynolds(who alludes to the ongoing drama between himself, wife Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni), Nate Bargatze, Jon Lovitz, wardrobe team member Donna Richards, John Lovitz, Julia Louis-Dreyfus (and her service dog), Adam Driver, Keith Richards, Zach Galifianakis, Jon Hamm, Bad Bunny, Al Sharpton, Ray Romano, Seth Meyers, Jason Momoa and Peyton Manning. An obvious excuse to milk the celebrity star power in the building and (as Meyers points out) shove in people they don’t have anything else for.A new Digital Short has Samberg and Yang singing about how everybody who every worked at SNL had anxiety (and IBS). Lorne Michaels, Chris Parnell, Will Forte and the show’s crew all pop in.Then Aubrey Plaza drops by to introduce the next musical act,Miley Cyrusand Brittany Howard, who perform Nothing Compares 2 U. Although originally a Prince song, the track became a number one hit when Sinéad O’Connor covered it in 1990. O’Connor infamously had her career derailed after tearing up a picture of Pope John Paul II (in protest for Catholic church’s culpability in wiping out indigenous cultures and its widespread sexual abuse of minors) while performing on SNL in 1992. The show disavowed her and her actions in the aftermath. This seems to be a tribute to the late Irish singer, but because there is no explicit mea culpa (despite history proving her actions 100% justified), it plays as false and even galling.Colin Jost and Michael Che look back on 50years of Weekend Update with the help of some old friends. First though, they thank the crew (and congratulate them “on their January 6 pardons) and give a heartfelt shoutout to the late, great Norm McDonald’s nemesis OJ Simpson. Norm would undoubtedly have loved this.Guests include segment favorites The Girl You Wish You Hadn’t Started a Conversation With at a Party (Cecily Strong) and Drunk Uncle (Bobby Moynihan), who’ve shacked up and are expecting a baby; Lorne’s Best Friends from Growing Up (Armisen and Vanessa Bayer) who whisper gossip about the cruel showrunner; and former anchors Seth Meyers andBill Murray, who is there to share his personal ranking of the 10 best Update anchors. Everyone in this Update segment does great work, but, as with Eddie Murphy, Murray is operating on another level.Up next is the return of perennial alien abductee, Coleen Rafferty (Kate McKinnon). She and two of her trailer park buds (Pascal and Woody Harrelson) give testimony of their outer space adventures to two Pentagon officials (Hamm and Aidy Bryant). While the bros shared a transcendent experience, Rafferty had her “unkempt private area” poked and prodded by a group of horny Grays before being unceremoniously pushed out of the spaceship’s hatch. Something feels missing here and its easy to figure out what – there’s no Ryan Gosling to crack up at McKinnon’s mugging.Meryl Streepdoes show up as Coleen Sr, but she noticeably struggles with the material.Season one cast member Laraine Newman has her nostalgic tour of the studio interrupted by slacker idiot Chad (Pete Davidson), then we get the absolute pleasure of a surprise appearance fromJack Nicholson.He introduces his Anger Management co-starAdam Sandlerfor the next musical number. Sandler, guitar in hand, sings a very sweet song about 50 years of SNL. While he mainly lists off the indignities of working on the show – having sketches cut, hosts visibly reading from cue cards, waking up Sunday afternoons depressed and, above all, living in perpetual fear of Lorne Michaels – the song climaxes with a moving look back at the tenures of various cast members, the last two spots reserved for his pals Farley and Norm.We continue with the musical acts by way of a brand-new Broadway revue. Anchored by Mulaney and Davidson (as well as David Spade), this giant song-and-dance number pays charts the sleazy history of New York City from the 1970s up to now, via twisted spins on classic showtunes from the likes of Paul Schafer, Maya Rudolph, Nathan Lane, Jason Sudeikis, Will Forte, Wiig, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Paul Rudd, Nick Jonas, Taran Killam and others. For all its big production, the best bit is Mulaney cavalierly dunking on Sherman’s ultra-brief Michael Bloomberg impression.SNL’s greatest-ever hostAlec Baldwinfinally shows up to set up a montage of the best commercial parodies in the show’s history, then we get a new Bronx Beat sketch.Rudolph and Poehler’s flirty, brassy hosts pick actor Miles Teller from the audience and bring him on stage to harangue him until they get tired of him. They’re about to sign off when they get a surprise visit from their idol Linda Richman (Mike Myers), host of Coffee Talk. She kvetches with the girls before dispensing some hard-won wisdom: “Maybe the secret of life is there are no big whoops, only a series of small, agonizing whoops.” Myers, like Murphy and Murray, hasn’t missed a beat.Dave Chappelle introduces Lil Wayne and the Roots, then Tom Hanks solemnly takes the stage for what seems to be an in-memoriam segment of dead cast members but, as revealed in a hilarious rug pull, is actually a look back at the “SNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly”.The list includes long roll call of ethnic stereotypes, sexual harassment, underage sexual harassment, animal cruelty, body shaming, slut shaming, gay panic, ableism, sexism, child molestation, questionable makeup (featuring blurred out instances of blackface, brownface and yellowface), problematic guests (OJ Simpson, Robert Blake, Diddy, R Kelly, Jared Fogle), racial slurs and the utterly uncategorizable (Adrien Brody’s baffling and unauthorized Rasta Man act). Kudos for a legitimately sharp bit of self-flagellation.Jimmy Fallon celebrates the occasion by sharing a drink with Ayo Edebiri and Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately for them, their bartender is none other than Debbie Downer (Rachel Dratch), who proceeds to bum them out with depressing facts about alcoholism, animal extinction, bird flu and her gout. She scares them away, only forRobert De Niroto show up. Already on edge because of everything happening in the world, it doesn’t take long for the actor to snap and try to strangle her.Sudeikis returns to play an NYPD officer intent on scaring straight a couple of young shoplifters with the help of Thompson, Murphy and Ferrell’s crazy convicts. Their hardscrabble personal stories and sexual threats fall flat, given that they’re all clearly based around the plots of family movies like Harry Potter, The Nutty Professor and Elf. An odd choice of sketch for this show, but at least Murphy and Ferrell are having a blast.OG cast member Garret Morris pulls up a chair and introduces Tom Schiller’s 1978 black-and-white short film Don’t Look Back in Anger, which finds an elderly John Belushi as the last living cast member of what was then known as, simply, Saturday Night. He visits the graves of his long-gone friends and co-workers, reminiscing about how they each met their end: Jane Curtin died from complications of cosmetic surgery, Morris OD’d on heroin, Chevy Chase bit it right after his first movie with Goldie Hawn, Dan Aykroyd was obliterated in a motorcycle accident. It makes for somewhat eerie viewing considering what real life held in store for all these people, especially Belushi. But it also feels the exact right note to close out the comedy section of this show: edgy (for its time anyway) and unsentimental.Yet, thisisan emotional night for the people involved with the show, which makes Paul McCartney’s climactic rendition of the Beatles’ Carry That Weight properly cathartic. As with Simon at the beginning of the special, McCartney looks and sounds his 82 years of age, which adds more power to the lyrics.Martin Short is given the honors of signing off. He shout outs to the original cast members gathered on stage, concluding with a tribute to Lorne Michaels. The hugging then commences.This was a fun, appropriately star-studded celebration, but running throughout was an unmistakable sense of, if not death, then mortality. Man, woman or sketch comedy show – time comes for us all.Explore more on these topicsSaturday Night LiveSaturday Night Live recapUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionSteve MartinSabrina CarpenterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here, he reflects on a remarkable lifeMon 17 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 06.16 ESTShareFor a man who was supposed to be dead next month, Ian Smith looks good. Astoundingly good: huge smile, glowing skin, that famous wobbly chin. There is only one visible clue that he has terminal cancer: a freshly shaved head, over which he frequently rubs his hand. Chemotherapy left him with “an awful half shaggy, half bald look”, so he buzzed it all off. “First time I’ve been bald since I was a baby,” he says, happily. “Apart from no hair, you can’t tell I’m sick at all.”Smith is among Australia’s most recognisable actors, although you may not know him by his name. Charlie Brookeronce describedhim as “probably the friendliest face on television – a cross between 10 Toytown mayors and a baby”. Perhaps you know him as Harold Bishop from Neighbours. Smith joined the cast in 1987, two years after the show launched, and became one of its longest-serving members, appearing in more than 2,100 episodes over five decades.Harold had the most spectacular storylines. He was swept out to sea and returned five years later with no memory. He almost strangled a guy to death. He had a stroke, which temporarily turned him into a peeping tom. He survived cancer, car accidents, a heart attack. He was a Christian white-bread suburban patriarch, decency personified – and an audience favourite. When the cast flew to the UK to perform in the 1988 Royal Variety show, it was at the personal request of the queen mother, a hugeNeighboursfan: “She shook my hand and said: ‘Oh Mr Smith, Idoenjoy your Harold.’” George Harrison once came up to say hello: “And he asked formysignature!” Smith says, delighted. “For his niece.”View image in fullscreenInimitable … Harold Bishop in a spot of bother, in Neighbours.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockNeighbours was a hit in Australia, but a bigger one in the UK, launching the international careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce, Margot Robbie and Jason Donovan. While other actors came and went, Smith was always Harold. When he and Pearce returned for the finale in 2022, he told Pearce: “I could have been an actor.” Pearce laughed, but Smith wasn’t entirely joking: “I saw so many good actors come and go – but they always go. My father had instilled in me to never walk away from money. And the money was very good. To be in work, I learned, is a privileged position. And to be in permanent work, with holidays for Christmas, is fantastic.”By the time he realised the world saw him only as Harold, “it was too late. I had been on the show too long. I would love to play something outlandish, like a vampire or a serial killer,” he says wistfully. “But all the people in casting today were brought up with Harold – one even told me that was the reason I was being typecast.” Did he make peace with that? “Unwillingly,” he snorts.Smith is nothing like dithery Harold: he is a cheeky old thesp, who wants nothing more than to talk about his days in the theatre, touring Gilbert and Sullivan or doing pantos in the UK. “Wonderful work. I remember this one kid in York – on opening night, I went out and he yelled: ‘It’s behind you!’ I said: ‘What’s behind me?’ and he said: ‘Your career!’ Apparently, he did it every year.”Permanent work with holidays for Christmas? Neighbours is fantasticSmith dialled back his involvement in Neighbours in 2007, then left the show to go travelling with his wife, Gail, in 2009. Over the following decade, he returned for a few short stints to fund their travels and came back for the final episode. When Amazon surprised everyone by rebooting the show, he returned for a few episodes, before signing on again as a regular in May 2024. It seemed Smith was never quite done with Harold – but, then again, neither were we.Then, in December 2024, Smith announced he was leaving Neighbours again, this time for good: he had beendiagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma,a rare and aggressive lung cancer. His doctor cried when he delivered the news. Smith collapsed: “I thought I would be stronger, but I am as a weak as any human.” He began doing “very dramatic things, like looking at every sunset, watching children play. The week before, I would have killed them!” he says, with a twinkle in his eye.Smith was told he would be dead by March. “Dying does change how you live,” he says. How has he changed? “I vainly say I am a better person now, but I think I am more forgiving, more understanding. It is a pity that I couldn’t have come to all these realisations [before] I was sick – I could have done somebody some good in the world.”He began chemotherapy and immunotherapy, a newer treatment that uses your immune system to fight the cancer. Remarkably, just after he revealed his cancer to the world, his doctor called with good news. He jabs at his phone and shows me his first scan, two tumours blazing red in his chest. He then shows me his latest scan. It’s startlingly clear, without a speck of red in sight.View image in fullscreenSmith as Harold Bishop in 1988.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images“That’s why I’ve got this solid grin on my face,” he says. “Apart from being 86, I feel good. I’m in no pain. I know how strange that sounds.” Suddenly, he has more time than he thought; he is mulling over buying an electric car and he has just got a new cat, named Sisi (“after the Hungarian empress”).“I know I have cancer, because doctors keep telling me I have it,” he says, smiling. “I may get very sick again one day. But I have lived the most privileged life.”Smith was raised by working-class parents in Williamstown, now a boojie seaside suburb in Melbourne. He was a Walter Mitty type, “always the hero of my daydreams”. He had the “most spoiled childhood” and “the best education I didn’t want”. His parents, Connie and Gordon, were “beautiful people”: even though neither of them had a flashy bone in their bodies, they encouraged their teenage son when he began performing in amateur musical theatre.“I was in heaven,” he says wistfully. “I had been working in a warehouse and here were young people who talked about the things I thought about – loveliness, beauty, poetry, how a piece of art could affect you. At work, it was all about pies and sheilas. It was a revelation; it was the start of my life.”Smith was a natural on stage: his first role (in Oklahoma!) was in the chorus; by his second (Carousel), he was the lead. He was “a very romantic, impressionable, randy little bugger”, constantly falling in love with his co-stars. “I thought I looked old-fashioned, but some of the girls later told me I was very good-looking. I had such a big head. It took a long time for me to become this perfect,” he jokes.Acting was a revelation – my previous job was all pies and sheilasHow did he meet his wife? “This won’t make me sound like a very nice person,” he warns. “At my ex-fiancee’s birthday.” Smith was performing in Fiddler on the Roof in Melbourne; his fiancee was working as an usher at another theatre, with Gail. “I walked in and, honestly, it was like a dreadful, soppy American soap – we saw each other and that was it. The next night, I went into the show and told everyone I had just met the future Mrs Smith. They all laughed at me!“Gail was the biggest softie under the sun,” he says, tearing up. They were married for 51 years, until her death from pancreatic cancer in 2019. “I discovered I knew very little and she taught me everything. She taught me how to be a decent human being. I was caught up in beinga star.”It was “the most beautiful marriage”, he says. They never had children “because we found out what caused them”. He is joking, but they never wanted them.“Gail and I just didn’t suffer – and I used the word deliberately – maternal or paternal instinct,” he says. “We had completely different childhoods. Gail was one of nine; I was one of one. She was always trying to escape her family – all through our marriage, she loved being one of two.”View image in fullscreenSpectacular … Harold in action.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyBut for all their happiness, Smith suffered from depression and panic attacks. “I was going to a shrink about it and he said: ‘You know, you are so typical of someone who was adopted,’” he recalls. “I went back a week later and said: ‘Guess what!’”That week, his mother, Connie, called unexpectedly. She was about to undergo hip surgery and was worried that she wouldn’t survive. She told her 54-year-old son that he was adopted.Smith doesn’t know what happened next. “I think I passed out, standing up. One day, I was Ian Smith, born in 1938, this is my mum and this my dad. All of a sudden, that is not my mum and that is not my cousin and my grandma wasn’t my grandma. Everyone had lied to me. And I hated them all. They were asked not to tell me. But I hated them.”At first, he didn’t want to know who his biological mother was. Eventually, he changed his mind. He went to an organisation that specialised in helping adopted children affected by past adoption practices, which tracked down his mother.Her name was Peg Kline. She was only 14 years older than her son; she had been raped by her older brother’s friend when she was 13 and he was 26. “He was a paedophile and a rapist,” Smith says, bluntly. When Kline went into labour, the nurses held a blanket over her lower half and whisked him out of the room before she could see him.Smith wrote her a letter. The first time Kline laid eyes on her son, he was a greying, middle-aged man, although they both felt relief at their resemblance; same watery blue eyes, same fleshy face. “There was nothing of my father left,” Smith says.Kline was married and had adult sons; Smith, always the only child, now had half-brothers. But he never developed a filial connection with Kline; she was just a good friend, until her death in 2005. “I never learned to love her,” he says. “I never called her mother. I think she would have loved that, but I couldn’t do it.”Smith got into television after he noticed that the actors who turned up to theatre rehearsals had better cars than he did. It turned out they all did television. He promptly made his way through several huge Australian shows: Homicide, Bellbird, Matlock Police, Division 4.He was still plugging away when a friend asked if he might try his hand as a script editor on Prisoner, a popular 1980s Australian soap set in a women’s prison. Smith edited the scripts, but also acted in it and even became an associate producer. On the final day, the creator, Reg Watson, thanked Smith for his time and asked if he would “care for a little part” in his new show, Neighbours.The five-week part was Harold, the childhood sweetheart of an established character, Madge Ramsay. Smith was desperate for the work: “Some people say you must suffer for your art – bullshit! If it is easy, you have a licence to try a few things, rather than just being desperate.”He played Harold for two uneventful weeks when, suddenly, the entire camera crew laughed at one of his takes. “They are a hard bunch to make laugh. I thought: what the hell did I just do? So I asked. One of them said: ‘Smithy, you were a silly old fart.’ I said: ‘Will you tell me if I do it again?’ So we went again, they all laughed and I said: ‘Right, I’ve got it.’ And that was Harold.” A week later, he got his first 12-month contract.I was so messed up. My black dog had had pups and they were all black tooHe played Harold for four years, until 1991, when the character was swept out to sea. In reality, Smith had been sacked – which he discovered by reading the storylines and realising Harold was no longer in them. “I was very angry. How could they do it without me? Don’t they know who I think I am?” he says, faux grandly. It was soon after this that he found out he was adopted.“I went down the gurgler. Way, way down,” he says, miming self-harm. Did he ever hurt himself? “No, no. But I went down the deepest, darkest hole and all the black dogs were waiting down there for me.”Gail saved him. “I can’t tell you what she did for me. She was beyond human,” he says, wiping his eyes.What was it like returning as Harold five years later? “Fantastic!” he says. “Because I still had my raw – and I meanraw– nerves working for me. I was playing a man who was totally messed up in the head, and I was so messed up. My black dog had pups and they were all black, too.”View image in fullscreenA love for the ages … Harold at the funeral of Madge Bishop.Photograph: Fremantle Media/ShutterstockWhen Smith met the qualifications for voluntary assisted dying (VAD) last year, a pharmacist rang and asked if he would like the drugs sent to his home, to keep for the day he decided to die. “And I said no,” he says. “I’m awfully glad I did, too, because there have been times I would have taken it. I really would have. And I would have missed out on that wonderful day in December when I was told of my progress. My first thought was: ‘My God, I could have been dead.’ And I would have been, if I’d had the mixture at home.”Smith “wholeheartedly” approves of VAD, having watched his parents, birth mother and wife die of cancer: “I just disagree with it being left in the home. For so many reasons – you could be robbed! It is as good as a loaded gun.”His life expectancy was first moved to this Christmas and is now Christmas 2026. “I am in this funny, vacuous place,” he says. “They can’t say the cancer has gone – in fact, they mustn’t, because it has come back in other people and they have died of it. But honestly, if they told me it had come back now, I would be ready this time.”Does he feel proud of his life? “You can’t help but be,” he replies. Recently, a film crew who are making a documentary about his experience with VAD were told their funding application was approved because Smith was “culturally significant”.“Culturally significant!” Smith crows. “I rang my agent and said: ‘I give you permission to tell your friends that you knew me.’ He said: ‘God, I was hoping they wouldn’t tell you.’”In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.In the US, call or textMental Health Americaat 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

She was thinking of buying the rights for a novel byJoan Lindsay, Picnic at Hanging Rock, a story about the mysterious disappearance of three schoolgirls at an ancient rock formation and she was looking for an up-and-coming director. I had been gripped by the book and was very keen to make it.In the early 70s, adapting a book was what they did overseas, not in the Australian film industry. Picnic set a precedent, but that didn’t stop us getting the funding we needed, which ended up being A$440,000 (£220,000). Even at that low budget, it was still a dangerous commercial enterprise: a mystery without a solution.Oh Miranda, it’s been so long!I thought about filming the outdoor scenes in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, but as soon as I saw the real Hanging Rock in Victoria, there was no doubt. A lot of the visual inspiration came fromAustralian impressionistsof the late 19th century: Frederick McCubbin, Tom Roberts and especially William Ford’s 1875 painting At the Hanging Rock.To get the soft focus look, cinematographer Russell Boyd, feeling very self-conscious, went to the wedding section of a Sydney department store to buy veils of differing thicknesses to use as lens filters. Some of the dreamlike moments, like the swan representing the “Botticelli angel” schoolgirl Miranda, were scripted; others, like the burst of lorikeets as she enters the picnic grounds, were put together later by the editor, Max Lemon.View image in fullscreenRachel Roberts as Mrs Appleyard, with Margaret Nelson as Sara, in Picnic at Hanging Rock.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyA couple of weeks into the shoot Vivien Merchant, who we’d cast as the strict headteacher Mrs Appleyard, was forced to withdraw because of illness. I went back to our original list, and miraculously Rachel Roberts, a British new-wave actor I admired, was free. The wig we’d made for Vivien also fitted her, but she said: “I simply can’t wear it.” It was bad luck in the English theatre to wear other actors’ wigs. Luckily, she had one of her own that she was able to use. She was a consummate performer.We shot an alternative ending where Mrs Appleyard goes back to the rock to search for the girls. But the last closeup of Rachel, a world of pain on her face, was so powerful I knew it had to be the closing shot – we didn’t even bother to cut together the other ending.A potential distributor in the US supposedly threw his coffee cup at the screen at the end of the film, saying: “Whodunnit?” He felt he’d wasted a couple of hours. The film was a modest success, but did very good business on college campuses. Picnic was one of those milestones for the Australian film industry as it evolved in the 70s – it was remarked upon around the world.When I went back to the site years later, they told me people often take pieces of the rock home as a souvenir – but return them, thinking they bring bad luck.Anne Louise Lambert, played MirandaIn the rough and tumble Australia of the 70s, it was pretty special to have something like Picnic come up. At the end of my teens, I felt I was born to play Miranda. With her free-spiritedness, she felt like an expression of my generation; that kind of flower-people stuff, unaffected by the colonialism of the culture we were raised in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They offered me the part, but reconsidered and gave it to another actor with very little explanation. I was incredibly disappointed. Then, out of the blue, they changed their minds because they thought the other girl was too big – a sign of the times.All the schoolgirls were lodged together, separately from the rest of the cast, at a Christian women’s guesthouse. It was like stepping back in time, with these sweet little rooms with lots of antimacassars. It was designed to help us bond, but it didn’t happen for me – I was missing my family. With these cliques of young women, there were lots of feelings. Some of them decided that Jane Vallis, who played Marion, another of the disappeared characters, would pair up with Dominic Guard, who played the young Englishman who follows them. Any time I was with him, suddenly there would be this wall of girls in front of me; this instant kind of intervention.Peter once said Miranda was more of a quality than a character. But the production designer Martin Sharp, who knew Joan Lindsay and the book well, helped me find her. In my room, for example, if I opened a drawer, it was full of things he’d put there that were meaningful for Miranda: Valentine’s cards, handkerchiefs, pressed flowers, photographs in lockets.There have been times when I thought it was a load of fluff, like a shampoo commercialI was the only character lucky enough not to have to wear a corset, but clambering about on the rock in those little Victorian boots was brutal. I was still feeling insecure, because there had been something not very wholehearted about my casting. One lunchtime, after a horrible morning filming where I’d had to re-do a scene a number of times, I came down the rock to see a little old woman staggering over some rough ground. I realised it was Joan Lindsay; she came up and threw her arms around me. Right in my ear, very emotionally, she said: “Oh, Miranda, it’s been so long!” That was incredibly validating.There have been times in my life when I thought the film was a load of fluff, like a shampoo commercial. About 10 years ago, Indigenous groups started objecting to it – which I understand, when the history of the rock is so much greater – and I decided not to talk about the film. But I recognise it’s got this extraordinary life force that keeps it going. I’m a psychotherapist now, and it has this Jungian aspect in the unsolved mystery: the exploration of society’s shadow side, all the murky stuff that is brought up when the girls disappear.Picnic at Hanging Rock is rereleased in cinemas on 21 February to celebrate its 50th anniversaryExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madePeter WeirDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This glacial, disquieting film, which appeared in English as Meetings With Anna, follows the titular director on an odyssey aroundEuropethat climaxes with her singing an Edith Piaf song to her lover. And that, apparently, was the final straw. “They wanted to attack me,” says Clément, who played Anna. “The journalist sitting next to me put his trenchcoat over me and got me out of there.”The film was the third feature fromChantal Akerman, who loosely based Anna on herself. It was undoubtedly a challenging, elusive film – a series of haunted confessions heard by this film-maker protagonist from lovers, family and wayfarers while on her travels promoting an unknown work. Anna’s existential solitude, her refusal to remake herself for her lovers, was quietly radical.“People weren’t ready to accept it at the time, its feminism,” says Clément of the film, which was released in 1978. “Society was still very closed, women didn’t have much say.”Chantal said the sound of the high heels was the sound of Germany. She didn’t have to say moreNearly 50 years on, audiences seem finally ready to embrace it. Meetings With Anna is part of amajor retrospective of Akerman’s work at the BFI in London, recognition that follows on the heels of her 1975 masterpiece – Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles – being voted the greatest film ever by Sight and Sound magazine. A formalistic masterstroke that expanded cinematic notions of time, the film made watching the daily chores of a Brussels housewife for over three hours utterly hypnotic.View image in fullscreenMother issues … with Sylvie Testud in Tomorrow We Move.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyMeetings With Anna is as much about absence as presence: its import presses in unseen from the outside, as with The Zone of Interest. A malaise, a sense of history and inheritance weighing on ordinary life, hangs over all of Anna’s conversations. “Three things,” specifies Clément, her blue-green eyes gazing at me from under a side-swept blond fringe. “It’s Europe, it’s the mother, and the Shoah.”We’re sitting in the study of her apartment in Paris’s 17th arrondissement, warmly lamp-lit against the dreary February afternoon outside. Clément, now 79, ushers me in like an old friend, bemoaning the Trumpian state of world affairs, slender and curtly chic in a checked dress, blue cardigan and pearl earrings. Scattered everywhere are sketches and paintings, and a beautiful ceiling mobile made by her husband, Dean Tavoularis, Francis Ford Coppola’s longtime production designer. She met him while filming Apocalypse Now, in which she had the role of an opium-proffering soldier’s widow.View image in fullscreen‘There was craziness’ … Clément.Photograph: Reynaud Julien/APS-Medias/ABACA/ShutterstockNot only did Clément play a version of Akerman in Meetings With Anna, she also played a version of the woman for whom Akerman had a “terrifying love”: her mother, who had survived Auschwitz. The mother character was called Catherine and Clément appeared as her in Akerman’s 2004 comedy, Demain On Déménage, or Tomorrow We Move, about the claustrophobic cohabitation of a mother and daughter. In fact, they made five features and several shorts together, even though Akerman initially thought Clément – this solemn, ethereal beauty – was too pretty to play Anna, only to return a year later to offer her the role.Clément became part of Akerman’s extended family, with whom she “danced, ate, laughed, drank, joked, all the time”. Popping a Freedent mint, the actor says she can’t explain the magic. “Chantal and I, it just happened all by itself, without us saying, ‘We’re going to work together for our whole lives.’ It was great.”“Pas de psychologie!”were Akerman’s watchwords for Clément. “No psychology!” She encouraged the actor instead to pay scrupulous attention to Anna’s appearance and gestures, starting with high heels they trawled through over 30 shops to find. The pair in question certainly hit the mark. “She said the sound of the heels was the sound of Germany,” recalls Clément. “She didn’t have to say more.”Working with Akerman meant acquiescing to a fastidiousness that extended to dialogue, which would be honed “down to the semicolon”. This was an echo of the control exhibited by the director’s mother, who inspired the title character’s exhaustive domestic regime in that 1975 masterpiece Jeanne Dielmann. Clément was only too happy to submit. “I saw very well where she was going. If she was happy and said, ‘This is it’, then that was it. She was the one who was right.”Maybe this obstinacy, this refusal to yield to the audience by having Anna finally and candidly reveal her interior life in the conventional dramatic way, was what unleashed the anger at that Paris premiere. Clément corrects me: “Anna holds everything in, but she’s not waiting to reveal anything. She’s already elsewhere. Elsewhere.”Clément shared Akerman’s fiercely prized independence. The actor grew up in grinding poverty, the daughter of two farm workers in the Aisne region, to the north-east of Paris. “A childhood of total solitude, no friends, no girlfriends,” she says. “Shut inside, sewing. No books, nothing.” When she was 17, her father died of cancer in her arms. She got a job at the sugar distillery he had worked at, to provide for her disabled mother, and her sister, who died three years later after an ectopic pregnancy.View image in fullscreenMasterstroke … Delphine Seyrig in Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.Photograph: Album/Alamy“That was the profound sorrow that led me to this,” she says, gesturing around her apartment, which is adorned with a lifetime of art and literature. At the age of 20, Clément drove to Paris, armed with books about Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman and Marilyn Monroe for inspiration. She points them out on the shelves. This young woman made for the prestigious Catherine Harlé modelling agency and announced that she wanted to do shoots for the likes of Vogue and Elle. Also waiting in the room were three statuesque models. An agent told her: “Don’t even think about it, my dear. Look at them, then look at yourself.”Yet, by the early 1970s, Clément was a regular on magazine covers. When director Louis Malle saw her on the front of Elle, he thought she might be right for his 1974 war film Lacombe, Lucien, about a young French boy who finds himself in the clutches of the Gestapo during Germany’s occupation. Clément got the part in the end by demanding Malle stop dilly-dallying. “I wanted to portray myself as I wanted to be,” she says. “And if you didn’t want me, I left.”This uncompromising stance allowed her to escape the worn grooves of the French industry for eye-catching roles: she would later appear as Anne Henderson in Wim Wenders’s Paris, Texas; as the Duchess of Chartres in Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette; and as Mireille in Luca Guadagnino’s A Bigger Splash. As for Apocalypse Now, she was marooned for weeks in the Philippines amid Coppola’s meltdown, only to see her role cut, although it was reinstated for 2001’s Redux version.Her husband built Don Corleone's study in The Godfather and Kurtz's temple in Apocalypse NowWhen Clément moved to Los Angeles to be with Tavoularis, leaving the director Miloš Forman, the Coppola family took her under their wing. She became friends with the likes of Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando, smuggling bananas on to the set of Apocalypse Now for the latter, who was under orders to lose weight. There was as much hard graft, she recalls, as drug-addled lost weekends: “There was craziness, but not just that. There was gigantic work to be accomplished – and I’m thinking of Dean there, leaving at 5am to build sets. People didn’t mess around.”Akermankilled herselfin 2015. Clément has never learned the details. Akerman had bipolar disorder, and had been depressed since her mother’s death the previous year. The two had been due to meet in Paris. Clément waited for an hour and a half, but Akerman never showed. “Everyone’s still stunned she’s not here,” she says. “Like everything you lose in life, it’s hard to explain.”Chantal Akerman: a director with a rare creative visionRead moreNow, 10 years on, Clément is working to maintain her legacy. On the table in front of us are boxes spilling over with Akerman’s papers, heavily edited and annotated by the actor for readings in Paris and her native Brussels. Going over all this old ground has been tough. “I’m worn out,” she says, “but it’s more an interior fatigue. It’s made me remember stuff. You have to stop after a given point.”Although Clément and Tavoularis live in Paris now, they are still in motion in their minds and ever busy. While we’re talking, a courier delivers a new script Clément’s been waiting for. As we finish up, she makes a call to “Deanie” to announce our imminent arrival at the 92-year-old’s nearby studio, to help him walk back up to the apartment. Stooped and bespectacled, the man who built Don Corleone’s study in The Godfather and Kurtz’s temple in Apocalypse Now seems nonplussed by the invasion. Surrounded by stacks of pop-artish canvases, he is clearly hard at it.“You see,” says Clément, gesturing all around. “We’re working! We’re working!”Chantal Akerman: Adventures in Perception is at the BFI Southbank, London, until 18 March.

Now the double bassist is the star of The Only Girl in the Orchestra, a documentary nominated for an Academy AwardMon 17 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 17 Feb 2025 05.39 ESTShareOne of the most fascinating, inspirational and talented creatives nominated for an Oscar this year will not be at the ceremony on 2 March. “Oh, I’m not going. No, no, no. I’ll be 90 in June, my dear,” says Orin O’Brien, double bassist and the star of nominated short documentary The Only Girl in the Orchestra. “That’s no excuse,” I tell her. Over Zoom, she looks and sounds more than capable of flying the plane there herself. “No. You couldn’t get me on a plane these days. People are so badly behaved. I’m staying here in my nice apartment inNew York. I will cook dinner for my friends in the orchestra. Some students will come over.”O’Brien has never sought the bright lights. Her chosen instrument, the double bass, means she sits at the back of the orchestra, providing harmonies and structure. One scene shows her telling her students: “You don’t want to stick out. You’re a support for what else is going on. You’re the floor under everybody that would collapse if it wasn’t secure.”I loved the vibration you feel in your whole body and how you feel its low tonesAnd yet shehasfound herself sticking out, like it or not. In 1966, aged 31, O’Brien made history by becoming the first woman to be employed full-time at the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, then 104 members. “All this attention now is old hat to me,” she says. “When I joined, I just wanted to be a part of my section, and part of the orchestra. But I was the centre of attention, which was upsetting and embarrassing. On tour, instead of having dinner with my friends in the orchestra, I did radio interviews in almost every city we played in.”View image in fullscreen‘I was the centre of attention’ … young Orin in The Only Girl in the Orchestra.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixPress coverage talked about her being “one of the boys”; “Miss O’Brien is as curvy as the double bass she plays,” leered Time magazine; “on tour, the men fall over themselves to carry her bags”.“No, they didn’t,” she says indignantly. “Nobody carried my suitcase because they were carrying their own instruments! I never let a man carry my bass for me.” She was a member of the orchestra for 55 years; this film, made by her niece Molly O’Brien, is a tribute to a remarkable life lived seeking to be unremarkable.“I chose the double bass because I liked the idea of playing with other musicians. I didn’t have ambition to be a soloist. I like being in the background,” says O’Brien, who started playing the instrument at 16. “I loved the vibration you feel in your whole body and how you feel its low tones, but I loved equally the harmony that it made playing with the others.” She insists she never heard from anyone even the suggestion that this almost two-metre high instrument weighing on average 15kg was not suitable for a girl. In fact, “my teacher in New York, Fred Zimmerman – who was a genius – told me that he thought that girls were more sensitive than boys about drawing a tone out of a double bass. Boys kind of tried to force it out using their strength, he said, but girls coaxed the tone out, which is the way you have to do it.”Likewise, in the orchestra, she was only ever welcomed and cherished, she insists. She joined the Philharmonic with 10 years’ orchestral experience playing already under her belt she points out. “The minute they knew I was experienced and wouldn’t make a fool out of myself or ruin their professional work, the players were fine. If people complained about me, well, nobody ever said it to me in person.”View image in fullscreen‘A kaleidoscope of musical thrills’ … with Leonard Bernstein.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixBut, astonishing as it now sounds, she did feel guilty for a while, she says, for taking a job that could have gone to a man. “In the 1950s and 60s, there was an opinion that if you gave a job to a single woman, you were depriving a married man with a family to support of one. It was something that I felt guilty about for a while. But then I thought, ‘I’m supporting me – I’m my family.’ And I stopped feeling guilty because there were other single people in the orchestra too and everybody works very hard for a job like that and not everybody can be chosen.”Back in 1966 it was the legendaryLeonard Bernsteinwho hired O’Brien. “I love Orin because she’s a source of radiance in the orchestra,” he said at the time. “Her musical involvement is total, and whenever I look in her direction, and inevitably find her looking intently back at me, I marvel at this concentration.”There was an opinion that if you gave a job to a single woman, you were depriving a married man with a family to support of one.“Yeah, well, he was very fun to look at,” laughs O’Brien. “If you blinked, you might miss an instruction or a hint about what he wanted us to do, or what he was thinking and feeling at the time – it was like a kaleidoscope of musical thrills.”Of today’s conductors, she singles out Vladimir Jurowski (“One of our favourite conductors ever … every gesture means something”) and Nathalie Stutzmann (“She’s outstanding. Totally professional and she has a wonderful spirit”). Stutzmann was in New York recently conducting the NY Phil and talked to O’Brien after the concert. “She told me she had seen my movie and loved it. And she said, I went through some of the same things that you did when I started out as a young female conductor.”I ask Molly about the film’s genesis. “I’ve had this little voice in the back of my head saying, ‘Make a film about your aunt Orin’ for at least 10 years,” she says. “In 2015, she invited me to go on tour with her in Europe, and she said I could bring a camera. But then she was unsure she wanted me to film, and I didn’t take it out of the bag the whole trip.”View image in fullscreenProudly in the background … Orin O’Brien, centre, on stage.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixBack in New York, her aunt’s packed schedule didn’t help. A full-time member of the orchestra, she was also teaching at three conservatories and had private students.Orin elaborates: “Each week, I had four rehearsals, four concerts. I basically had no private time at all, except on Sundays and then I used to bake bread and also teach. I would start the baking early in the morning. I would say to my first student, ‘OK, practice for five minutes’, and I’d go and punch up the dough. And by the end of the day the bread would be baked and the last student would get a slice of fresh bread!”“But I kept asking her about a film,” says Molly, through laughter, “and she kept saying ‘No’ until in 2021, when all the musicians were stuck at home during the pandemic’ and she made the decision to retire.”Why does she think her film has touched so many? “I certainly never expected that my documentary about my aunt in her 80s who plays the double bass would make it to theOscars,” she says. “But her story is inspiring, not only to young female musicians, but I’m getting calls from folks who are sharing it with their kids, and with their grandmothers and their aunts and their friends. The film is about the first woman ever hired full-time by the New York Philharmonic, but it’s also about rejecting the celebrity culture we’re so immersed in, and enjoying the work of those around you as much as you’re enjoying yourself. Put down the violin, pick up the double bass is maybe one way to put it.”‘It’s really a very dark comedy’: Festen, the explosive opera based on the dinner-party-from-hell filmRead moreHas Orin’s life changed since the film’s success? “No, I’m still just hiding behind my bass in my apartment and getting on with things,” she says.“But I have gotten a lot of fan mail from people I haven’t seen for years and also from people saying they cried when they saw the film because it reminded them of something in their lives.”Yes, you are beloved, Molly tells her, and despite your not wanting to be in the spotlight, you are celebrated all over the world.As the conversation draws to a close, Orin reminisces about her childhood when music was, even then, front and centre. “I used to listen to the New York Philharmonic radio broadcasts on Sunday instead of going to church. My father used to drive my brother, who was an altar boy, and me there. I’d say, ‘Dad, if you don’t mind, I’ll sit in the parking lot while you’re in church and listen to the Philharmonic.’ And he let me. I made up my mind that my religion was music.” Molly smiles: “I wish that story was in the film.”The Only Girl in the Orchestra is on Netflix.

After access to all library books was suspended for a week for a review, a “small number of items” were identified and have been kept for “further review”, it said.Moore’s Freckleface Strawberry, a story about a girl who dislikes her freckles but learns to live with them, is among the books caught up in the blanket review, according to a listobtained by the Guardian. However, it is not known whether the title was selected for further review or for withdrawal.“It is a book I wrote for my children and for other kids to remind them that we all struggle, but are united by our humanity and our community,” said Moore.The review of library books is part of an examination of all “instructional resources”, according to the Defense Department, to check that its schools are aligned with Trump’s recent executive ordersEnding Radical Indoctrination in K-12 SchoolingandDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism.Moore, who won an Oscar in 2015 for Still Alice, said that she is “particularly stunned” by the news because she is a “proud graduate” of the now-closed Frankfurt American high school, operated by the Defense Department, adding that her father is a Vietnam veteran and spent his career in the US army.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We’re told where to stand. And then we’re telling people how to vote?“You should be quiet, you should do your job. You should … entertain people – then shut the fuck up.”Basso added: “We’re court jesters. We’re entertaining. We’re public servants. We’re there to perform, to entertain, and then all of sudden, the jester, because he’s in the courtroom starts to be like: ‘I might want to go sit on the throne!’”The actor elaborated on remarks that he recently delivered toVariety, saying it was “weird” to him that his fate would probably be entwined with Vance’s to some degree for the rest of their careers.Vance wrote the bestselling2016 memoirthat was adapted into a 2020 Netflix movie, helmed by Howard, co-starring Basso as a younger Vance and nominated for two Oscars involving others who worked on the film. Topics explored by the book and movie include Vance’s recollection of a volatile childhood in Middletown, Kentucky, as his mother struggled with opioid addiction – before he became a US senator for Ohio and served as Donald Trump’s running mate as he successfully campaigned for a second presidency in November.“When he’s thinking about his life – they made a movie of his book, and my name will always be in the description,” Basso said on the podcast.Initially, Vance was seen by many as an albatross to Trump’s campaign. He was criticized as a misogynist for labelling women without children as “childless cat ladies”. He was pilloried in some quarters for admitting that he boosted debunked stories about Haitian immigrants eating family pets in his native Ohio. And he was mocked by opponents over false rumors that he hadsex with a couch, providing some context for when Howard toldVarietyin September that he was “surprised and concerned by a lot of the rhetoric coming out of that campaign” with which Vance had aligned himself.Hillbilly Elegy: what can the book and movie tell us about JD Vance?Read moreVance again raised eyebrows on Friday, when at the Munich Security Conference he accused European leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and loathing voters’ true beliefs. He also openly questioned whether Europe’s values deserved to be defended by the US.“If you’re running in fear of your voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor for that matter is there anything you can do for the American people,” Vance said.For his part, Basso said he perceived Vance to be “a cool dude” after spending time with him in connection with the Hillbilly Elegy film.“We talked a little bit,” Basso said. “We’re both from the midwest. We just talked about life – about growing up in the woods.”Judging just from Trump’s victory in November, many of Basso’s industry colleagues do not agree with his apolitical preferences.Among the actors to endorse Trump were Russell Brand, Jim Caviezel, Mel Gibson, Zachary Levi, Dennis Quaid and Drea de Matteo. Meanwhile, the actors Robert DeNiro, Matt Damon, Mark Hammill, Will Ferrell, Dick Van Dyke and Julia Roberts were among those to endorse the campaign of Kamala Harris, who was Joe Biden’s running mate when he won the 2020 election and ended Trump’s first presidency.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceUS politicsRon HowardnewsShareReuse this content"

Equally anti-war and anti-Russia, its interconnected stories kick off in the faintly theatrical and moralist mode sometimes seen in east European drama, before accelerating for the climax into a bravura cinematic sequence: a baby’s point of view on Russian pillaging and destruction.The film is comprised of five threads: an unnamed Polish traveller (Cezary Pazura) arrives inUkraineto meet his doctor lover (Oksana Cherkashyna), but is sidetracked into taking a group of orphans with visual impairments to the zoo. Tasked with escorting the kids back over the border, he stops in at her parents’ house – but the old war hero (Hryhorii Bokovenko) and his wife (Nina Naboka)refuse to abandon it. Tatiana Yurikova plays a blinged-up Russian mother who has paid her way to the frontline to look for her missing son; it turns out he is in a Ukrainian hospital bed and appalling the doctor we have already seen with his opinions on Russian superiority. And finally, the frame story, seen in bleary cot-cam: a huddle of Ukrainian women in a basement hidey-hole.Not every section of this wartime story-scrum has the desired impact; the senior-citizen portion, especially, feels like padding. And, arranged in nonlinear fashion, the interconnections don’t snap with as much dramatic force as they could – even if the poetic linkages, like the balloon animal from the zoo that later floats over the corpse incinerator in the third plotline, are neat. But some segments register on their own terms, like the callous satire of the Russian mother, in her Gucci jacket and Putin sweatshirt, begging a monstrous crematorium boss for mercy.Elsewhere, the three partially sighted wastrels, left to scramble alone through the ruins, gather metaphorical moss as symbols of universal wartime confusion. This rallying call for lost innocence reaches an unbearable pitch in the final section; filmed in long takes from underneath the cot-arch, Russian thugs violate the women from the cellar, until one of them (Maria Shtofa) flees into the chaos of invasion. It’s raw but epic film-making with an instinctive grasp of the obscenity of war.People (Ludzie) is in UK cinemas from 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWar filmsUkrainePolandRussiaEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she brings this crime melodrama to Berlin, an engaging if tonally uncertain high-wire adventure that satirises China’s hopeless addiction to gangster capitalism. It is also acidly unsentimental about the bread-and-circuses escapism of the country’s booming film and TV industry with all its period-costume wuxia nostalgia. It’s an appealing film, though it contains some strangely broad comedy and is also, in a couple of violent moments, a bit naive about exactly how easy it is for a young woman physically to fight off a big strong guy.Above all, Qu gives us a rather amazing set-piece scene on the set of a wire-fu action movie, a scene that feels real in a way that the rest of the film really doesn’t, for all that it is watchable. Fang Di (Wen Qi) is a tough woman employed as a stunt double on a movie set, playing the black clad, sword-wielding ninja bouncing over terracotta rooftops and whizzing through the air in long shot. For the closeup, the preening star in the same outfit steps in while Fang Di staggers over to get a coffee at the craft table. The work is exhausting and dangerous and Fang Di is doing it to pay off her family debts to mob matriarch Madame Wang.Desperate for more cash, she takes on a gruelling night shoot in which, attached to a wire harness, she has to be submerged under murky water to fly up into the air. The callous director demands this shot to be repeated endlessly, despite Fang Di’s obvious distress – and seeing that there are too many ripples from the last take, he commands she stay under the water for 15 seconds before the camera rolls, instead of the almost-safe three.Just at this unimaginably low point in Fang Di’s life, her long estranged cousin Tian Tian (Liu Haocun) appears; she is being pursued by the mob, having fallen into debt and drug addiction at the hands of the same criminals who supplied drugs to Tian Tian’s notoriously parasitic and waster dad, the source of all the family’s despair. Now Fang Di and Tian Tian have to evade the same duo of hatchet-faced tough guys, as well as a local cafe owner from their home town who the mobsters have bullied into joining them.There are entertaining, incidental scenes mocking the craziness of show business; looking to graduate away from stunt work, Fang Di auditions for a drama, doing an absurdly written scene, and bursts out laughing in the middle of the dialogue, to the director’s outrage. And there is a moment of pure (and implausible) farce when the gangster tough guys, taking a wrong turn in the movie studio, are inveigled into taking part in a hospital drama and a war epic. It’s amusing, but the silliness doesn’t entirely work. All this is interspersed with flashbacks showing the two young women’s former intimacy and the painful anguish of their family dysfunction, establishing a mood of sadness that is underscored by the final, desolate scene of their early childhood. A flawed, but involving spectacle.Girls on Wire screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsComedy filmsCrime filmsChinaComedyAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Author of more than a dozen books, he is gay, Jewish and an atheist. The questions he poses are personal, even existential. He places his own identity and experience at the fore.“I feel an immense pride in America’s pluralism and tolerance while remaining conscious … of my status as a minority and an outsider,” Rauch explains. “I feel that my sense of belonging to America does not translate into a sense that America belongs to me.”He loves the US but is now uncertain the country loves him back. The seemingly gentle mainline Protestantism that undergirded the US during the 1960s and 1970s gave way to something more jagged. Harsher and angrier, this Christianity is also less secure in its primacy of place, a cudgel fused to blood and soil.“All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity,” the prophet Isaiah once declared, seemingly forgottenby the Christian nationalists of today. Then again, scripture is read in myriad ways.Rauch labels the current iteration “Sharp Christianity, the Church of Fear”. It wields power, reaches into the Oval Office, yet sees itself besieged. It decries modernity and is very much of it.Sharp Christianity proclaims the word of God and makes deities of flesh and blood, in Rauch’s telling. At the Capitol on January 6, markers of Christianity and paganism stood adjacent to the gallows.Franklin Graham, son of the late Billy Graham, threatens Americans with God’s wrath if they criticize Donald Trump. “The Bible says it is appointed unto man once to die and then the judgment,” he posted to Facebook. Another famous scion, the disgraced Jerry Falwell Jr, admonished his flock to stop electing “nice guys”. Instead, he tweeted: “The US needs streetfighters like Donald Trump at every level of government.” In such words, resentment and grievance supplant the Bible and “What would Jesus do?”Then again, amid the carnage of the actual civil war, all combatants looked to Christianity for justification and succor.“Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other,” Lincoln observed, in his second Inaugural. “The prayers of both could not be answered – that of neither has been answered fully.” The Battle Hymn of the Republic, by Julia Ward Howe, an abolitionist, sings of “His terrible swift sword”, leaving no room for ambivalence or ambiguity. “As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free / While God is marching on.”At the same time, below the Mason-Dixon line, churches and stained-glass windows paid homage to Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The cross, the flag and the slaver’s whip were beatifically stitched together.Rauch also engages in personal soul-searching. “I was smug about secularization,” he confesses. “I began bending an ear to warnings that Christianity’s crisis is democracy’s, too. I came to realize that in American civic life, Christianity is a load-bearing wall. When it buckles, all the institutions around it come under stress, and some of them buckle, too.”By the numbers, religious “nones”, at 28%of the US population, exceed evangelical Protestants (24%) and non-evangelicals (16%). Attendance at worship drops. Twenty years ago,according to Gallup, 42% of US adults attended religious services every week or nearly every week. By the middle of the 2010s, it was 38%. Now, only three in 10 regularly fill the pews.“Both of its major streams, the ecumenical and the evangelical, have ‘thinned’, that is, secularized, albeit in very different ways,” Rauch writes. “Neither is as capable of providing meaning and moral grounding as it once was or today needs to be, and secular alternatives like science and SoulCycle cannot, even in principle, fill the void.”He acknowledges that he did not fully comprehend America’s civic religion.“I did not appreciate the implicit bargain between American democracy and American Christianity,” he states. “I would have said that the basic deal was to leave each other alone – ‘wall of separation’ and all that. Their only bargain, I thought, was to make no bargain; to the greatest extent possible, religion and government should tend to their separate businesses and not interfere with each other.”That take hasn’t aged well.‘Reactionary nihilism’: how a rightwing movement strives to end US democracyRead moreProtestantism was part of America’s big bang. Religious turmoil in England coincided with the first rounds of migration to the New World. The American revolution owed a particular debt of gratitude to Protestant dissenters. Colonial Congregationalists and Presbyterians came to owe little allegiance to the crown, less to Canterbury. Later, battles over slavery, prohibition, civil rights and the Vietnam war also played out within America’s churches. Those divisions have remained. Not all wounds heal.Rauch points to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and its capacity for compromise as a possible model for other segments ofChristianity to follow. But personal conservatism and social cohesion are born of Mormon homogeneity and conformity. Voluntary safety nets spring from self-identification with their beneficiaries. As Jonathan Haidt of New York University has repeatedly observed, diversity and cohesion seldom go hand in hand.The US marks its 250th birthday on 4 July next year. From the vantage points of 21st-century America, looking back over two millennia provides no clear solution.Cross Purposes: Christianity’s Broken Bargain with Democracyis publishedin the US by Yale University PressExplore more on these topicsBooksUS politicsRepublicansDemocratsReligionChristianityreviewsShareReuse this content"

He spent his teens on the open mic circuit and first broke ground during the pandemic when his TikTok covers went viral, before last year’sStargazingnotched up over half a billion streams on Spotify. No surprise, then, that his first UK tour of biggish venues feels like a victory lap at times. His youngish crowd don’t just film Smith singing the songs that have been released already, but film themselves singing along with them. In fairness, this is exactly the kind of atmosphere Smith’s pop-folk anthems are designed to create. With many of them clearly influenced by big hitters such as Ed Sheeran, George Ezra, Coldplay and Mumford & Sons, this year’sBrits Rising Staraward winner is certainly not aiming for the fringes. Every other chorus is laden with “ohh-ohhs”… or, for variety, some “ohh-ohh-ohhs” as well.One to watch: Myles SmithRead moreHowever, the Nottingham University sociology graduate seems to have more in his locker than being a cheery song-and-dance man. A gentle reggae lilt occasionally reflects his Jamaican heritage, the soulfully anthemic Little By Little showcases the affecting tremor in his voice, and his emotional frisson and hint of vulnerability elevates his material above the blandly formulaic. When a story looks like being drowned out in audience chatter, he respectfully but firmly requests that people stay quiet enough for him to deliver the emotional introduction to My First Heartbreak, a beautifully raw acoustic song about growing up with an absent father.Perhaps in time, Smith will draw from this deeper well more often. For now, he acknowledges that his fanbase isn’t here for “depressing shit” and the phones go up again for last year’s fiddle-tinged earworm/irritant Nice to Meet You. He sings Stargazing twice – once from the stage and again from the orchestra pit, encouraging the crowd to sing in sections. Smith can’t be blamed for milking his big moment, but there’s surely more to come from him as he starts to spread his wings.At 3Olympia theatre, Dublin, Tuesday 18 February. Then touring.

In it, intimations of climate breakdown, reflections on gendered violence and a rejection of the great Australian ugliness were grafted on to a narrative about a young woman adrift in the interregnum between the end of her university studies and a planned move abroad. Woven through it was a series of excerpts from the journals of the explorer John Oxley, detailing his search for Australia’s mythical inland sea.Water – imagined and real – also plays a big part in Watts’s enormously impressive second novel, Elegy, Southwest. Set in 2018, as the Camp Fire swept through northern California – destroying communities in Paradise, Concow and elsewhere, and blanketing much of the state in thick smoke – it follows young narrator Eloise and her partner, Lewis, as they take a road trip through California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. Eloise narrates these events from somewhere in the future, after an unnamed calamity has overtaken Lewis, leaving her raking over the events of those weeks for some clue to explain what happened.The trip they take is partly about work: Lewis is employed by a Las Vegas-based foundation for conceptual land art, much of which is “built on a fantastical scale in remote corners of nearby deserts”. He has been tasked to check on the progress of a vast piece that is supposed to be being completed by the partner of a recently deceased artist. Meanwhile, Eloise is researching a dissertation which will give shape to her deep fascination with the Colorado River, “its imminent loss”, “the miracle of it, and the tragedy”.It was a town’s only Black-owned bookstore. It is now a refuge for those displaced by the California firesRead moreThe trip’s purpose is not merely practical. Eloise hopes it will also serve as a circuit-breaker, a way of escaping the occluding pall of grief and depression in which Lewis has been mired since the death of his mother 10 months earlier. She suspects she may be pregnant too, a possibility freighted with complication and uncertainty.Against this backdrop the river, and water more generally, take on a powerful presence. Early in the novel Eloise cites Joan Didion’s celebration of dams in her 1979 essay Holy Water: the way her desire to see water under control grew out of a fear not just of its destructive potential, but also of its disappearance, “the terror of the tap running dry”. As in The Inland Sea, Watts recognises this desire for control as a kind of violence, the same gendered colonial impulse that fails to recognise the land for what it is, and instead dams and diverts rivers in order to “make them useful” for people to whom they never belonged.The damming and destruction of the Colorado River offers a brutal lesson in the costs of this process, as does the Salton Sea – although Eloise and Lewis find beauty there, in its post-apocalyptic landscape of dead fish and skeletal birds. The combined effect of the ruination of the river, and the smoke from the fires, suffuse the novel with a millennial dread, its atmosphere full of portent as we witness the slow breakdown of Eloise and Lewis’ relationship – depicted with precision and intimacy, and blanketed by her sense of incomprehension and loss. At one point Eloise visits a therapist who tells her to forget about the stages of grieving – but “if there wasn’t a narrative container”, Eloise thinks, “there may not be an actual end to your grief”. At another, she finds herself confronted by “the utter poverty of language in the face of calamity”. Instead, the novel suggests, loss moves beneath everything, flowing and spreading like water within the earth.This sense of life without resolution, of being suspended in-between, lends Elegy, Southwest real power. Watts captures something essential about the nature of grief as she blurs the boundaries between personal, bodily concerns and larger historical and environmental ones: just as Eloise’s pregnancy creates the potential for future loss, the fires burning in the background prefigure a future in which the only certainty is catastrophe.Yet rather than give way to hopelessness, the novel suggests it is necessary to find a way to inhabit that space of unknowing. Or, as Eloise says at one point, “that in itself … was a choice: to continue to live suspended in the amber of waiting, the caesura between the intake of breath and whatever came next”.Elegy, Southwest by Madeleine Watts is out now in the US via Simon & Schuster.

With two relatively affluent belligerents involved, mobile phone coverage is ubiquitous on both the civilian and soldier sides. Juxtaposing intercepted calls back home from frontline Russian troops with shots of the devastation they have wreaked inUkraine, this film is a bleak and searing wiretap into Putin’s warping effect on his people and the psychology of power.“A Russian is not a Russian if they don’t steal something,” jokes one woman when she hears her brave boy has looted some makeup for her. Set against the shots of ransacked living rooms, wrecked petrol stations and dimly lit bomb shelters, such casual banter hammers home a chilling normalisation of imperialism and aggression – which comes with varying justifications. There is the standard dehumanisation: that the “khokhols” (a derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians) deserve it. Many parrot Putin’s line that the special military operation is fighting fascists. Or, in some troops’ amazement at Ukrainian ice-cream and abundant livestock, we glimpse an economic envy that lets such lies slip down more easily.There are dissenters, too. “Putin cares about the land, not the people,” points out one grunt. What is truly chilling is how the largely female listeners on the other end of the line are often more gung-ho than the soldiers. In one horrific segment, another combatant tells his mother about Federal Security Service officers torturing individuals. He confesses to participating in and enjoying this sadism. “If I got there too, I would enjoy it like you,” says Mum. “You and I, we are the same.” With Russian civilians here regularly condoning the murder of their Ukrainian counterparts, it shows how deeply Putin has cankered the body politic.Amid the thriving micro-industry of documentaries about this conflict, there are, as always, questions to be asked about the purpose and perspective of individual films. Since this one presumably could only have been made with the cooperation of the Ukrainian intelligence services, it’s hard not to wonder about what material was made available to director Oksana Karpovychand what has been made prominent in the edit. Even so, this eavesdropping is totally compelling, often overpowering the visuals the conversations are matched with; a dissonant stratagem that both outlines and pierces the post-truth fog of war.Intercepted is at Bertha DocHouse, London, from 21 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineRussiaSurveillanceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Now instead of tennis and tea parties, it offers scenic treks and seafood feasts in glorious spring sunshineLiz BoulterMon 17 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTShare‘Why don’t theinglesicome here any more?” The question was asked by a customer atCaffè Romain the seaside town of Alassio, whose pre-second world war British population could reach 5,000.There are several reasons, I think. From the late 19th century, wealthy Britons would arrive in October to escape the winter cold, stay until May, and then head home before the torrid Italian summer. These days, British people with that kind of wealth probably winter between Zermatt and the Caribbean. But neither has Alassio great appeal to more ordinary Britons wanting a summer holiday: August temperatures can hit the high 30s, crowds and prices surge and, as in so many Italian resorts, the sands are taken over by beach concessions from Easter to September.View image in fullscreenHowever, lovers of blue skies, warm sunshine, good food and outdoor pursuits may find this Ligurian resort a perfect spring or autumn destination. Just over an hour from Genoa (not much more from Nice), this lucky little town faces south-east over the Ligurian Sea, protected by a ring of hills on a shallow curve of silvery sand called Baia del Sole (Sunshine Bay). Alassio’s microclimate sees it consistently a few degrees warmer than its neighbours, with clear skies punctuated by a few spring showers.A spring trip to Alassio could also take inFlauer(4-6 April in 2025), the town’s festival of cooking with flowers, this year with invited Sicilian chefs widening the offering of stalls, tastings and guided hikes. As a preview I nibble a few pinky-red begonia petals and am surprised at their zingy citrus taste – perfect in gelato.The cobbled path winds up and up, under carob and olive trees, views getting more spectacular with each hairpinMany Flauer events take place on Piazza dei Partigiani, which has the sea on one long side and is minutes from the town’s smart pier, Molo Bestoso, a setting for contemporary art exhibitions until late October. Inland are the narrow streets of the old town, called Il Budello (the gut), where the Old Alassio Association keeps photographs dating from before the British “discovered” it. An image taken in 1860 shows Alassio a mere fishing village, with just sheep and a few drying nets on the unspoilt sand.The green hills above Alassio are a little more built up now, but still ripe for exploring. I hear all about them from lawyer Igor Colombi, who recently finished a project to maintain,  waymark and map the 56 miles (90km) of former mule tracks leading into the hills. Armed with his map (available at the tourist office), I take the railway underpass off the main road to find the cobbled path toSolva. It winds up and up, views getting more spectacular with each hairpin, past gardens and allotments, under carob and olive trees, to the village square and a church with 14th-century frescoes designed to frighten the faithful into behaving.View image in fullscreenThe island of Gallinara sits off Alassio, to the north-east.Photograph: Mauritius Images /AlamyThere are no refreshments in Solva, but it’s only a half-hour walk back, with the track ending close to wonderfulOsteria I Matetti(see below). At Solva’s July festival, hungry hikers can gorge onbiscette, dough fritters similar to churros, and probably just as bad for you.A longer trail leads from Alassio’s south-west edge to Moglio village, with its pretty multicoloured houses and views of the bay from a different angle. Moglio’s summer festival celebrates a less-appealing speciality: stewed tuna entrails. They are said to have a “decisive” taste. However, there is also Bar a Nió, with simple – intestine-free – snacks on a panoramic terrace.View image in fullscreenAn old poster for Balzola’s Baci biscuits, created in the town’s historic pastry shop.Photograph: Liz BoulterFor a deeper dive into Alassio’s hinterland, I consult a wise woman, Laura Brattel, who will be leading foraging walks (in English if required) during the Flauer festival. She learned about wild plants for food and healing from her mother and grandmother, but only after she’d promised, in a ceremony held when she was just five, not to use the knowledge to do harm. The lore can only be passed between women, so she is not allowed to share it with her only child, a son.On a lung- and thigh-stretching walk to Vegliasco, a village with a 16th-century watchtower, she shows me wild celery, several types of dandelion and an edible bush with lush spinachy leaves. She shows me how to spot poisonous plants and explains how a herbal tea made from rosehips is a natural Prozac.The strawberry tree’s leaves are good for stomach, bladder and circulatory problems, while the waxy leaves ofcaccialepre (Reichardia picroides)are good in salad or cooked in ravioli.Laura runs foraging walks year round, and offers bespoke bookings.Back in town I take a look at what all the British left behind: a tennis club straight out of Agatha Christie, still thriving under eightysomething British owner Joe Skordis; the Anglican church, not so thriving; and the English Library, presided over on Wednesday and Friday afternoons by another long-term resident Brit,Jacqueline Rosadoni.A century ago, Alassio was all about mixed doubles, garden parties and new year balls. Times have changedBut for more of what today’s visitors might enjoy, I take to the water, meeting fisher Stefano Roascio at the town’s marina. He offers tours (from €30, ask at the tourist office) of the bay andGallinara, the rocky island visible from all the mainland villages. The public can’t land there as yet, but in 2020 the authorities stepped in to stop a Russian oligarch buying it, and there are plans to open a museum and some Roman ruins as a tourist attraction. For now, it’s a handy shelter from chill breezes: Stefano anchors his boat, L’Orizzonte, in the island’s lee and even in low season it’s warm enough for a pre-lunch dip.View image in fullscreenThe palm-fringed streets of Alassio’s old town, leading down to the sea.Photograph: Panther Media/AlamyWhen not entertaining tourists, Stefano supplies fish to top restaurants, so knows what this coast can offer. We tuck into marinated anchovy antipasti, tartare of sea bream, amberjack sashimi and swordfish carpaccio, then cuttlefish salad and pasta with sea urchins, confit tomatoes andtrombette, long, delicate, yellow courgettes.After, I go to theCarlo Levi Gallery(Saturday, 3pm-6pm, free), having previously known the man only for his books and leftwing politics. He was a regular visitor to Alassio until his death in 1975, and his paintings include post-impressionist-feeling carob trees and expressive portraiture. There are also leaflets, posters and artefacts from his activist life.A century ago, Alassio was all about mixed doubles, garden parties and new year balls for assorted upper-crust Dalrymples and Hanburys. Times have changed, but so has the town. The sun still shines in spring and autumn, and with scenic treks instead of tennis tournaments, seafood feasts instead of vicarage teas, Alassio could find theinglesifalling for it all over again.Where to stayView image in fullscreenA room in Villa della Pergola.Photograph: Matteo CarassaleOn the edge of the old town,Casa d’Artista(doubles from €150 B&B) has sea views from the back and paintings by the owner’s mother, artist Maria Teresa Preve, everywhere, including the book-lined breakfast room.For a splurge,Villa della Pergola(doubles from €310 B&B) has been owned by several wealthy British families and sits amid beautifully restoredbotanical gardenstransformed bytennis club founderDaniel Hanbury in the 1920s. The garden has one of Italy’s biggest collections of wisteria, and spring sees a “waterfall” of them in full glory.Where to eatOsteria I Matettilooks unassuming, but inside you are hit by a loud hum of happy patrons. The walls are lined with old school photos: every local over a certain age can find themselves somewhere. Young staff dash about handing plates of pasta to office workers. Pesto comes withgasse, large flat pasta tubes, though I am also tempted by greentaglioliniwithbottarga. Booking is essential, but be aware that it is the local HQ for Inter Milan fans, who watch on a big screen unrolled from the ceiling on match days.Balzola, the town’s opulent bakery and cafe, does crepes and gelato as well asbaci dialassio, signature hazelnut biscuits sandwiched with chocolate cream.Noveis the Michelin-starred restaurant of Villa della Pergola. A glorious vegan menu offers pasta with peanut, broccoli andchinottofoam, green gazpacho over tomatoes cooked at just 63C, and sweet delicatetrombettewith truffles.A mostly plant-based lunch at La Vigna, in hills north of town, can mean organic wine from their own nearby vineyard, starters of hotpanissa– chickpea-flour fritters with lemon – and fresh fried porcini, then a main ofpinzimonio –olive oil dip with pesto and anchovy – with the region’s freshest veg: raw spring onions, fennel, chicory, carrot, celery and boiled waxy potatoes.The trip was provided by the town of Alassio and Alassio MarinaExplore more on these topicsItaly holidaysEurope holidaysCultural tripsGenoa holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You could make a batch of the salad by itself for lunchboxes, but the trout elevates it to a filling dinner for two. You can, of course, use your preferred fish: any thick fillets, such as cod, pollack or haddock, would work well here. And if you don’t have pumpkin seeds, substitute breadcrumbs or any type of nut.Baked trout with beetroot, lentil and pomegranate saladPrep15 minCook30 minServes24 medium beetroot, peeled and cut into 2cm chunks1 red onion, peeled and roughly chopped1tbsp olive oil1tsp ground cumin1½tsp flaky sea salt250g packet cooked puyand green lentils50g baby leaf spinach, roughly chopped90g pomegranate seeds(from about ½ pomegranate)3tbsp roughly chopped walnuts2tbsp extra-virgin olive oil½-1 large lemon, juiced2 trout fillets2tsp smoothdijon mustard2 heapedtsp pumpkin seeds, roughly choppedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.

He laughed, noting that those words in relation to recipes made him both curious and, because of their foggy closeness to mythologising, suspicious.It was his recipe for hazelnut ragu that started it all, sending us down more or less the same paths in books and online, where we met more of the same thing: fabulously contradictory stories in which ragu made from hazelnuts was an ancient Piedmontese dish of great beauty born out of economy and hardship, and also “forgotten”, which justifies the lack of any evidence as to where it actually came from. Yet also, a breezy, contemporary dish that, like so many modern dishes, was scorned by those faithful to more traditional (ancient, authentic) versions. There were other claims, too, such as “This is the authentic recipe” and “This is an improvisational dish: do as you wish”. In short, a big tangle, which makes for entertaining reading. Although maybe not for those of the opinion that recipe writers should stop the self-indulgent introductions and get straight to the recipe – which is what we did.Armed with half a dozen sets of advice and opinions, we mixed together hazelnuts, mushrooms, diced vegetables, herbs, wine, tomato, heat and time with the aim of creating – in Stefano’s words – a deeply flavoured sauce and sumptuous condiment that is as satisfying as a conventional meat ragu. Not that this is in any way attempting to be a substitute for anything: it is a dish in its own right, and one that reminds us what delicious, useful, oily, satisfying things hazelnuts (andcobnuts) are, especially when they are paired with mushrooms. The secrets of success are softening the finely diced vegetables and herbs slowly, so as to bring out their depth of flavour; chopping the nuts roughly for a mixed texture (the rubbly bits give body, while the more floury bits help to thicken the sauce); and simmering the ragu slowly for about an hour, so everything comes together and steams up the kitchen windows.One option is to serve this with mashed potato, or polenta, or gnocchi made from potatoes or pumpkin, or long pasta – in which case boil 400-500g fresh egg tagliatelle or linguine in well-salted water. While the pasta is boiling, pour the ragu into a warm bowl, then, once the pasta is ready, either drain or use a spider to lift it directly into the sauce. Add a handful of grated cheese, too, if you like, then toss gently and serve this timeless dish immediately with lots of red wine.Hazelnut and mushroom ragu with pastaServes4150g shelled hazelnuts or cobnuts, lightly toasted in a pan4 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and very finely diced1 carrot, trimmed and very finely diced1 celery stalk, trimmed and very finely dicedSalt1 bushy sprig fresh rosemary2 bay leaves, crushed but whole250ml glass red wine1 small dried or fresh red chilli½ tin (200g)whole or chopped tomatoesA knob of butter400g mixed mushrooms, sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and minced400-500g egg tagliatelle, or linguineGrated parmesan, to serve (optional)Using a knife or food processor, cut or pulse the nuts until they have a rough, sandy texture. Working in a heavy-based pan or casserole, warm the olive oil and soften the diced vegetables with a pinch of salt, plus the rosemary and bay leaves for about five minutes. Add the nuts and cook, stirring, for five minutes more.Raise the heat slightly, add the wine and leave everything to bubble for a while, then add the chilli, tip in the tomatoes, season with salt if necessary, and simmer over a low heat for 45 minutes.Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan and, once it’s foaming, add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they collapse and are just starting to take on some colour. Pull the pan off the heat, add the minced garlic, then tip the lot, along with any pan juices, into the simmering ragu. Cook for another 15 minutes, until the ragu is dense and tasty, then adjust for salt, if need be.Boil the pasta in well-salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain and lift directly into the ragu pan. Add grated parmesan, if you like, then toss well and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsPastaA kitchen in RomeSauces and graviesFoodItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
