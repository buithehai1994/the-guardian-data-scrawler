This is a characteristically high-octane version of Ibsen’s play: loud, modern and led by screen stars Alicia Vikander and Andrew Lincoln. Yet his script, again created in the rehearsal process, retains all of Ibsen’s layers and adds some of its own in the updating.All mystical talk of the sea and mermaids is excised. The production brings a sharply lit realism to the privileged yet complex family at its heart that seems to be slowly drowning: Ellida (Vikander), as the young, second wife of neurologist Edward (Lincoln), is caught between life with her husband and a long lost, formative ex-lover, Finn (Brendan Cowell), who makes a reappearance. Ellida’s stepdaughters, Hilda (Isobel Akuwudike) and Asa (Gracie Oddie-James), are trying to stay afloat amid grief for their biological mother, who killed herself.‘It will be frightening but you have to do it’: Andrew Lincoln and Alicia Vikander’s nerve-shredding stage returnRead moreStone blends psychological intensity with overblown angst and amped-up humour. Where that mix of the comic, domestic and tragic grated in his recentPhaedra, here the ridiculously OTT family rows offset the razor-sharp tension of Vikander and Lincoln’s deeply felt performances. Vikander does not pull back from her character’s exposure while Lincoln is a pained alpha male forced to cede control and made vulnerable.The question of female free will, pivotal to so many of Ibsen’s plays, is key in the original: Ellida is “granted” her freedom by Edward. But in Stone’s version, she is not a passive or mentally fragile woman and it is clear she has free will, even though Edward is still medicating her. Here, she is not just caught between the security of middle-class existence with Edward versus freedom and passion with Finn – a charismatic climate activist – but also between ideology, responsibility in love and questions of consent.The play deftly unpicks the two male figures as well as her own psychology. Initially, they seem to represent Ibsen’s binary forces – Finn akin to elemental passion, Edward signifying convention. But there is more to it than that and Ellida wakes up to the imbalance of power and coercive elements in both relationships. Her past love for Finn is fleshed out and made more complicated by an age difference: she was 15 when she met him, he in his 30s. The myth of Leda, echoed in Ellida’s name, takes on eerie resonances. So does a storyline around climate protest and the criminalising of activism.View image in fullscreenGripping … The Lady from the Sea, designed by Lizzie Clachan.Photograph: Johan PerssonLizzie Clachan’s set wavers between realism and symbolism, changing from bright summer white to black in the second act, which becomes sodden with rainwater as the play’s dark passions are unleashed.The comic anger and rows remain, becoming shrill: distant cousin Lyle (John Macmillan) is amusingly wry but young sculptor Heath (Joe Alwyn), who has a terminal diagnosis (not the TB-like illness of the original), too inconceivably jokes about his imminent death. Hilda, whose mother was Black, speaks of being mixed-race in an overwhelmingly white town in shouty ways that seem latched on.None of this takes away from the full-bodied intensity of the production, which is fantastically original, gripping and magnificent to the end.AtBridge theatre, London, until 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlicia VikanderAndrew LincolnHenrik IbsenSimon StonereviewsShareReuse this content"

Standing around under gun-metal skies watching soldiers isn’t many people’s idea of fun but world leaders are a different breed. No bit of pageantry and flattery goes unnoticed. So why not giveDonald Trumpthe full Disney treatment he craves? After all, it wasn’t as if he was going to be allowed to stray outside the Windsor Castle compound and it was better than making the king sit indoors and watch Fox News.But if Wednesday was the softening up – “You’re great, you’re the best, the world would stop without you. We’ve never done anything like this for anyone else” Thursday was very much the business end of the state visit. And the one moment of real danger for the US president andKeir Starmer. The Chequers press conference at which everything could go tits up. The one bit of the trip that wasn’t entirely scripted.You could see the anxiety in Starmer’s eyes as he and the Sunbed King entered the Great Hall in Chequers. A room of wood panels and countless mediocre portraits. The US press corps all stood and applauded. Seriously? The UK pack remained seated. Keir gave an anxious glance towards the phalanx of journalists. “Please don’t screw this up for me, guys. Just give me this one win.” The Donald looked unmoved. As so often, lost in his own world. His own Truman show. The centre of the universe. Everyone else mere satellites to his ego. Even Keir. Especially Keir. Just another beta male.Starmer kicked things off with a run-of-the-mill speech designed not to rock the boat. Everything was fantastic. This had been the best state visit ever and no one could tell him differently. Britain and the US had always loved each other and always would. No more so than now. And all thanks to the US president. Perhaps Keir hadn’t bothered to check that The Donald isn’t that popular this side of the Atlantic. But back to Trump. He was the best. The bringer of tech trade deals. The architect of world peace. Better even than Bono.All the while, The Donald looked bored out of his mind. As if he would rather be anywhere other than answering questions from the media. As if he was tired of schmoozing the UK prime minister and couldn’t wait to get back to DC. Or maybe he was just reminiscing about Wednesday night’s farmhouse chicken at the state banquet. That’s what he had really come to the UK for. All this was just routine. No glitz. No glory.Eventually Keir wound up and handed over to Agent Orange. The Donald looked down at his notes. BE GRATEFUL. DON’T ROCK THE BOAT. TRY NOT TO HUMILIATE STARMER IN HIS OWN BACK YARD. Sure. He could just about manage that. He was thankful for the rightful honours that had been bestowed on him. The king – “a fantastic person” – would never have done this for Joe Biden. Biden was a loser. The worst.He, The Great Donald, had personally resolved seven of the most intractable wars around the world. He came in peace. Just a shame he hadn’t been able to make progress on Ukraine or Gaza. But he would get around to it sooner or later. Just don’t mention the recentAlaska summitin which he had been made to look a fool by Vladimir Putin.Then came the questions. The first from the BBC on Palestine and Israel. Trump was the only man with influence over Israel. Why wasn’t he using it? Starmer assured us they had talked a great deal about this. They both wanted the war to end and for the hostages to be released. Trump just mumbled. It seemed like the great peacemaker was as clueless on how to resolve the situation as the rest of us. The people of Gaza can expect to be bombed for a while yet.On the question of illegal immigration, The Donald had some kind words of advice. Send in the military. Crack a few skulls. Get some target practice in. That’s what he’d done and it had worked a treat. Keir looked twitchy at this. He hadreturned one Indianto France overnight. That was a start. Luckily, we quickly moved on to global politics again. In breaking news, The Donald declared that he had now ended one of the world’s worst conflicts. Between Albania and Azerbaijan. A war the world didn’t even know was taking place. For the simple reason that it wasn’t. Perhaps I have inadvertently stopped a war between Australia and Turkmenistan.Trump turns fire on Putin and lauds UK in press conference with StarmerRead moreThe Donald answered his three questions from the US media with ease. Largely because he had picked three stooges from rightwing organisations who were never going to ask anything difficult. Keir could only applaud. There are times when he must wish he was an American. Though we did get to find out that Keir – at least for the duration of the state visit – was now a devout Christian. Expect to see a pile of ashes.And that was about it. Starmer breathed a huge sigh of relief. He had survived the experience without anyone asking the killer question. Feeling demob happy, he invited a couple more questions from the UK pool. Big mistake. Sure enough, it was Sky’s Beth Rigby who asked the Mandelson/Epstein question. Really? REALLY? Did you have to ask that?Starmer crumpled. The Donald stepped in. He had never heard of Mandy. Never met him. Nothing to see here. This was one for Keir. It’s normally Peter who does the denying three times. This was a lie of epic proportions. Trump had loved Mandy. His lordship was almost ever present at the White House. A ghost of a smile crossed Starmer’s face. Perhaps he should try this bullshit.Time up. Keir had had enough. He had escaped from this more or less alive. It could have gone so much worse. He had known Trump was a rogue operator but he could live with this. Thank fuck the state visit was finally over. Time to focus on surviving his party conference. “That’s all,” said Starmer. The US press corps stood up again to applaud.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Pianist Faraj Suleiman’s fiery jazz fusion is delightfully proggy and strange, veering from theatrical chord stabs to intricate, fast-paced runs along the keys, while rapper El Far3i’s acoustic guitar and rhythmic vocal performance alongside actor Guy Pearce and poet Inua Ellams produces a poignant tribute to the dead Palestinian men often unaccounted for in official figures.View image in fullscreenThe crowdWest Bank-born singer Nai Barghouti steals the show with her full-throated, indefatigable vocals.

Which may be the understatement of the century. Borg, the greatest tennis player of his day, has spent 42 years saying nothing since he announced his retirement at the age of 26.When he broke that news in 1983, it was one of the biggest shocks in the history of sport. Not simply because he was at his peak, but also because he wastherock star tennis player – beautiful, mysterious and followed by a flock of teenybopper fans. When Spain’sCarlos Alcaraz triumphedin the US Open earlier this month, aged 22, he became the second youngest player to have won six major tournaments. Borg beat him by four months.View image in fullscreenBjörn Borg in Stockholm last month.Photograph: Rebecka Uhlin/The GuardianBorg was actually only 25 when he stopped playing major tournaments in 1981. That season, he had appeared in three of the four grand slam finals, winning the French Open and losing at Wimbledon and the US Open. In total he won Wimbledon men’s singles five times in a row (a record matched only by Roger Federer) and six French opens.And then he was gone, without a word. Borg devotees were traumatised. But perhaps they shouldn’t have been surprised at the lack of an explanation. The Swede was the samurai of tennis – immensely strong, disciplined and virtually silent. The “Ice Borg” never showed emotion on court, but many of us assumed there was a tumult roaring inside. And so it proved.At the age of 69 he has finally written his memoir, Heartbeats, and it answersevery question we’ve been askingfor the best part of half a century. It contains revelation after revelation, and is all the more shocking for the understated style in which it is written. Drugs, alcohol, despair, near-fatal overdoses, failed relationships, shame and self-imposed exile: for any Borg fan – and I was a huge one, growing up – it’s a painful read.We’re talking via video link. He’s in Stockholm at his publisher’s offices. His hair is now grey, but still luxuriant. He looks super-fit, partly because of an exercise regime so batty that only Borg could come up with it. From the off, he tells me how much he disliked talking in the old days. This accounts for the fact that so few TV interviews exist of him (you won’t have to look hard to find footage of rivals such asJimmy ConnorsorJohn McEnroe,or, from the women’s game,Martina NavratilovaandBillie Jean King). Borg tried his hand at commentary, but that proved a short-lived career when he just sat there in silence.“I’m a very secret person,” he says. “And I’m a very stubborn person.” That stubbornness, or discipline, was at the heart of his success – never giving up, never giving in to emotion, never giving into temptation. It was also at the heart of his failings – refusing to mix with his old tennis friends after he quit, refusing to use the new turbocharged rackets when he briefly returned in 1991 (which meant he had zero chance of winning) and refusing to explain why he retired in the first place.So why has he decided to tell his story now? “It’s been bothering me for many years. People know me as a tennis player, but not what I went through. The decisions I took in my life were stupid, so I wanted to tell that story.” It’s so Borg-like that he feels the need to own his stupidity rather than his success. But, he says, he knew he couldn’t tell his story to a stranger, and he didn’t feel capable of telling it himself.View image in fullscreenBorg and his wife, Patricia Östfeld, watch their son Leo Borg playing against Australia’s Aleksandar Vukic in Stockholm earlier this year.Photograph: Jonas Ekstromer/TT News Agency/AFP/Getty ImagesA few years ago he asked his third wife, Patricia Östfeld, whom he has been with for 23 years, if she would help him write the book. “I was very happy she said yes because if she hadn’t this book would never have come out. I would have taken my story to the grave. She said, ‘What d’you want to put in it?’ and I said, ‘Everything. I want to be open.’”Borg adored tennis in the early days – not just the success, but the game itself. But by 25 he was burnt out. “Up to that point I was entirely focused on my tennis. I was eating, sleeping, practising, playing matches. And I loved it. I had a great time.” So what happened? “I lost my motivation.”View image in fullscreenBorg with his first wife, the Romanian tennis player Mariana Simionescu, in 1983.Photograph: Express/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesBy the end, his desire had gone, he was depressed and had become divorced from his roots. He moved away fromSwedenand was living as a tax exile in Monte Carlo. Borg was a hero to some in Sweden, and a tax-dodging traitor to others. He and his first wife, the Romanian tennis player Mariana Simionescu, were catnip for the world’s media – young, gorgeous and clearly in love. But their relationship changed. She gave up the sport to look after Borg’s career and ended up more of a mother figure to him than a partner. At the 1981 US Open, the last major he competed in, he received death threats before and during the final. After losing the match, he was escorted off court by security before the awards ceremony.Did the death threats contribute to his decision to quit? “No, they had nothing to do with it,” he insists. The real reason, he says, is that he felt he no longer had a life. “In hotels when I checked in there were at least 100 people in reception wanting autographs. If I went to a restaurant there would be 15 photographers outside waiting and following me. In the end, when I was playing I just stayed in my room. I ate in my room. I didn’t go out. This is why I stepped away from tennis. I thought: ‘Is this going to be my life in the future?’ That was the reason I said enough is enough.”Sports people today prepare themselves for life after sport. They have agents, they have people who guide them. I had no one. I did everything by myselfThe first year of freedom was great, he says. He did exactly what he wanted, and loved it. He moved to America, lived on Long Island, New York, and partied. And then he partied some more. But he realised something was lacking – the buzz that tennis had given him. In the summer of 1982, he was introduced to cocaine. “I said to myself, ‘Oh, this is a different feeling. This is a different thing.’” In Heartbeats (so called because Borg has an exceptionally low resting heart rate of 32-34 beats per minute, and also a reference to a time he nearly died after overdosing), he writes: “I got the same kind of rush I got from tennis. The feeling itself was new, and it made me feel incredibly energised. I was hooked immediately.”The trouble was, Borg says now, he had nothing to fill his life with. “I was happy to step away from tennis, I could do anything, but I didn’t have a plan.” He was still struggling with depression. “It comes to a point where you ask yourself, ‘OK, what do I do now to be happy? To have joy, to feel good about myself, to feel good about life? I want to have the same satisfaction I had when I played tennis.’ I was lost. That’s why sports people today prepare themselves for life after sport. They have agents, they have people who guide them in the right way. I had no one, and I did everything by myself.”View image in fullscreenWith his son Robin in Monaco in 1988.Photograph: Patrick Siccoli/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesAnd he did it the wrong way. He started taking more cocaine, mixing it with uppers and downers and booze. He and Simionescu divorced in 1984, and in 1985 he fathered a son, Robin, with the Swedish model Jannike Björling. He says Robin was the only good thing that happened to him in the 1980s. But he was in no state to be a good father, and was lurching from relationship to relationship, usually before the previous one had finished. He continued to party hard. But the way he tells it, it sounds like the most miserable party on Earth. “When you feel bad you try to escape. I tried to escape with drugs, pills and a lot of alcohol. I was looking for something; I didn’t know what, though. So using these things, you don’t have to think about your problems.”When did he realise it was harming him? “In 1989, when I took the decision to start to play tennis again. I knew I couldn’t continue to live a life like this. I needed to find something else.”Was he an addict? “Put it this way: I wasn’t doing drugs, pills and alcohol every night. So not in that way.” But it was still enough to devastate his life. This was the year he married the Italian singer Loredana Bertè, moved to Milan and “life turned into a chaotic mess” – more drugs, a dysfunctional marriage, a young son based overseas in Sweden, and the bankruptcy of his fashion business, the BjörnBorg design group. Despite keeping physically fit through running and the gym (he was obsessive about maintaining his matchplay weight), he was destroying himself.I wondered, ‘Did I really play this sport before?’ I played so bad, it was ridiculousIn 1989, unsubstantiated stories emerged that he had tried to kill himself. Borg says this was untrue. Although he was in despair and no longer saw the point in living (in the book he writes: “I just thought: I can’t take this any more. I’m done”), he never actively tried to end his life. But that February an accidental overdose almost did for him. When Bertè couldn’t wake him, she called an ambulance. It saved his life.But he hadn’t learned his lesson. Once he recovered, it was back to the drugs, pills and alcohol. Eventually, he realised that he had to make a complete break – from Bertè, Milan and a lifestyle that was devouring him. In 1990, for the first time in eight years, he picked up a racket. “I wondered, ‘Did I really play this sport before?’ I played so bad, it was ridiculous. Then I told myself, ‘I’m not doing this to be a tennis player, I’m not doing this to win tournaments – I’m doing this for a different reason.’” He moved to London, went into rehab and began practising at Queen’s Club. Amazingly, this never made it into the newspapers.Then, in 1991, at the age of 34 and almost a decade after quitting, he announced he was coming out of retirement. That was when he returned with his tiny relic of a wooden racket. His professional comeback was as ludicrous as it was poignant. In April, he played at the Monte Carlo ATP tournament. Friends told him he should choose a smaller, less glitzy event. But this was Borg. Of course he ignored them. He played Jordi Arrese, a Spaniard ranked 52nd in the world, and lost 6-2, 6-3.View image in fullscreenBorg celebrates defeating Jan Kodes of Czechoslovakia during their men’s singles match to win the Davis Cup for Sweden in December 1975.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesHe says the Monte Carlo match was one of his happiest days on a tennis court, ranking it alongside his fifth successive Wimbledon triumph when he beat McEnroe after the famous tie-break (which he lost 18-16) and the defeat of Jan Kodes in 1975 to win the Davis Cup for Sweden when he was 19. “Afterwards, I’m sitting in the back seat of the car and my parents are in the front, and they see me and they say, ‘You look so happy.’ Yes, I was so happy and satisfied. It was a wonderful moment coming after all the things I had been through. Sitting in the car, I was so satisfied that I’d done this thing. I felt, ‘I’m back in life.FinallyI’m back in life.’ Only my parents knew the real reason why I came back to tennis. No one else.”What was that reason? He takes me back to his final days in Milan. “I told myself if I continued with this sort of life I’m not going to survive. If I had continued, you and me, we would not be talking to each other today. So I said, ‘I need to do something that makes me happy, something that makes me feel comfortable with myself. I need to wake up in the morning to do something and have a schedule. I need to do something in life to survive.’ So I said to myself, ‘Yes, I’m going to start to play tennis again.’”So you didn’t come back to win – you came back to stay alive? “Yes,” he says quietly. “To stay alive, exactly.” Between 1991 and 1993, he played 12 professional matches and lost every one. But it didn’t matter to him. He was surviving.The one guy who called me all the time and said, ‘You cannot quit, you cannot retire from tennis,’ was John McEnroe.I ask him what he said to his fellow players after he retired initially. “I didn’t keep in touch with the players,” he says. “When I left tennis, I left all my friends. I left everything.Everything. And that was a huge mistake. I went into a different crowd, people who weren’t interested in sport. That’s why I started with drugs and pills and drinking.”You had so many friends, I say. He nods. “Yes,somany.” Did they try to stop you? “The one guy who called me all the time and said, ‘You cannot quit, you cannot retire from tennis,’ was John McEnroe. He called me so many times. ‘What are you doing? I want to play you so many times. Björn. How can you leave tennis? You’re not even 26 years old,’ John said to me. ‘I’m sorry, John, I’ve taken this decision.’ He was very disappointed. Very sad.”View image in fullscreenJohn McEnroe and Borg before their finals match at the 1981 US Open tennis championships, which McEnroe won.Photograph: PCN Photography/AlamyIt makes sense. McEnroe was his greatest rival. They were opposites in style and temperament – Borg Zen and patiently overpowering his opponent; McEnroe feral and predatory on court. Tennis starArthur Ashesaid Borg was a sledgehammer of a player while McEnroe was a stiletto. The 2017 biopicBorg vs McEnroeis about their rivalry, and culminates in the Wimbledon final of 1980, regarded as one of the finest matches in tennis history. The film depicts Borg in his relentless intensity – travelling with 50 rackets, testing their tension by listening to the notes produced by the strings, never shaving and always wearing the identical Fila Settanta polo shirt at Wimbledon. The schoolboy Borg was played by his younger son Leo, from his marriage with Östfeld, today a 22-year-old tennis professional. Borg says Sverrir Guðnason’s depiction of his older self was a little too dour, even for him.Borg vs McEnroe recreates the scene in which they earned each other’s respect (albeit in a different match from the one where it actually happened). In 1979, Borg had just beaten McEnroe in Richmond, Virginia, and a week later was beating him again in New Orleans. “He was going completely crazy on the court. You would think this guy is coming out of the mental hospital,” he says. “So I said to John, ‘Can you come to the net?’ and he looked at me as if I was crazy. He came slowly to the net and said, ‘What d’you want?’ and I said, ‘It’s only a game, John,’ and again he looked at me like I’m crazy. So we went on playing. I had match point, and he won the match. After that everything changed. I respected him so much. And then all the matches we played after that he never said a word. But then when he played other players he could be a littlecomplicatedon the court, if you put it that way.”They renewed their friendship when Borg returned to tennis, and McEnroe was best man at his wedding in 1997. I say I think the two of them got on so well because they were opposites. “Yes, exactly.” You reminded me of a Bergman character when you played, I say – impassive on the outside, with a torrent of emotions raging internally. He laughs. “Yeah, you’re right, absolutely.” But he says it used to be different. As a boy, the rage was there for everybody to see. “When I was 12 they suspended me for six months in my home town. My parents’ tennis club had a meeting because I was behaving so badly on court, swearing, throwing rackets, cheating. Very, very bad. They said, ‘It’s embarrassing for this guy to walk on the court; it’s embarrassing for us.’ When they suspended me I was destroyed.”View image in fullscreenBorg on his way to defeating McEnroe in the men’s final of the Wimbledon Championships with a score of 1–6, 7–5, 6–3, 6–7 (16–18), 8–6 on 5 July 1980.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockThe young Borg was almost as good at ice hockey as tennis. “I played ice hockey in that time, but I couldn’t play tennis. When I came back I didn’t say a word because I was scared that if I showed my feelings again they might suspend me again. That was my first step in my behaving on the court. I was boiling inside, but I didn’t say anything. Then I told myself I had to learn to behave in a good professional way on the tennis court. It took a couple of years for me to understand what to do and not to do. After two or three years I was no longer boiling inside – I knew exactly how to behave. I was thinking, ‘Focus on the next point and then the next point’ until one day I was perfect. I knew exactly how to behave on the tennis court.”That’s when he became the samurai? “In a way, yes.” The closest he got to showing emotion mid-game was blowing on his knuckles while waiting to receive serve. When he won major titles, all that pent-up feeling would pour out as he fell to his knees at the moment of victory.After he lost in the 1981 Wimbledon final to McEnroe, he didn’t return until the centenary tournament of 2000. Every year, we would see former winners take their seat of honour on finals day, but Borg was always conspicuous by his absence. The commentators never mentioned his non-attendance, as if it was too painful to acknowledge. At times, it felt as if the spectre of Borg hovered over Wimbledon.View image in fullscreenAs a businessman in Monaco, March 1983.Photograph: Alain Mingam/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesThe real turning point in his recovery came not when he returned to the professional circuit but whenJimmy Connorslaunched the senior Champions tour in 1993. Borg knew it was pointless trying to beat the new generation, even with a modern racket. But he believed he could hold his own against his former peers. “The first year we had three or four tournaments and then it grew more and more. It was perfect for me to play in the senior tournaments, and people were really interested in seeing our generation – me, John, Jimmy, [Guillermo] Vilas, Vitas [Gerulaitis, who had been his best friend on the circuit and died from carbon monoxide poisoning owing to an improperly installed propane heater aged 40 in 1994]. I started to slowly get back into the tennis.” He even won five of the tournaments.But most importantly, returning to the fold was part of his recuperation. “I started to talk a lot to the other players, even if I had some relapses in the 90s. They knew what I’d been through because I spoke a little bit to them about that too.” He had now moved to Los Angeles and was spending time at thePlayboy founder Hugh Hefner’s mansion. “The place was full of temptations of every kind, and it was hard to say no,” Borg writes in the book.I fell down, and the next thing I knew I was was waking up in hospital with tubes in meDespite this, the media still never really got hold of his story. (The closest he came to being exposed was in 1990 when a Swedish magazine quoted Jannike Björling saying he used cocaine. He sued and won about £6,700 in damages.) That’s surely a sign of how loyal your fellow players were to you, I say. Yes, partly, he says, but it’s also because it was a different age. These days, if he was seen drunk or stoned, he thinks it would probably be on social media within hours.View image in fullscreenFan favourite … Borg at Wimbledon in 1973.Photograph: Harry Dempster/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesBjörn Borg takes life ‘day by day’ after ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer diagnosisRead moreHis worst relapse occurred in 1993 and resulted in another near-fatal overdose. He struggles to talk about it because he is so ashamed of what happened. Borg was with his father in Holland for an exhibition tournament. The previous night he had been at a party, drugs were there for the taking, and he weakened. “My father and I were walking to the club to play the final of this exhibition tournament. And I said to him, ‘I don’t feel too good. I don’t think I can make this.’ My father said, ‘Just take it easy.’ Then I fell down on the ground, and the next thing I knew I was was waking up in hospital with tubes in me. My father told me the ambulance came very quickly, and the doctor said, ‘You were very close to dying.’ That was probably the worst thing I ever did. It was terrible. When I woke up in the hospital I saw my father in front of me, and I was so embarrassed. When we flew home to Stockholm we didn’t say a word to each other. He was disappointed, sad, and I’m sure he was angry too.”The relapses became less frequent, and were never again as extreme. In 1999, he met Patricia, an estate agent. He got clean that year and has remained so ever since. In 2000, he returned to Wimbledon for a special parade at the Millennium Championships. The former champions were introduced to the crowd one by one. Nobody got a roar like Borg did.View image in fullscreen‘It was such a relief when I came back to Wimbledon. I feel at home there. I feel comfortable’ … Borg, right, with Boris Becker, left, and McEnroe marking Wimbledon’s Millenium Championships in 2000.Photograph: Gerry Penny/AFP/Getty ImagesPerhaps the saddest thing in the book, I say, is when you write that you stayed away from Wimbledon for so long because you were ashamed of what had become of you. “It’s true. They invited me all the time, but I didn’t feel comfortable. The way I’d been living, what had happened, all these things. But then one day soon after I met Patricia, I said, ‘Now I feel ready to go back to my favourite tournament.’ And I’ve been back almost every year since then. It was such a relief when I came back to Wimbledon. I feel at home there. I feel comfortable.”View image in fullscreenA 90s magazine advert for Borg’s underwear brand.Photograph: Retro AdArchives/AlamyThere are still testing times. He struggles withseasonal affective disorder, and knows that every autumn a mild depression will creep in. So now he spends these months in Ibiza where old tennis friends visit (includingBoris Becker, who was jailedfor financial misconduct related to bankruptcy fraud, with whom he bonds over the bad choices they’ve made).But over the past 20 years, he has enjoyed a new stability as a husband, father, now grandfather, entrepreneur (part of his business was bought out of bankruptcy by another company, rebranded as the Björn Borg Collection, and has made him wealthy once again from the royalties), captain of Sweden’s Davis Cup team and ageing former tennis giant. In 2014, he was voted Sweden’s top sportsman of all time by the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, which meant a huge amount to him.View image in fullscreen‘I’m so much lighter now’ … Borg in Stockholm.Photograph: Rebecka Uhlin/The GuardianAt the end of the book, just as we’re anticipating the perfect happy ending, he reveals that he was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer a couple of years ago. It comes as a shock, like so much in Heartbeats. In 2024, he was operated on. “A few days after the operation the surgeon said, ‘This was really, really bad. But you’re OK.’” He is dealing with it as calmly as you’d imagine the samurai of the 70s would have. “I have these sleeping cancer cells in my body. They could be sleeping for many years, but they could come out and give me problems. I just have to wait and see. I have to go back for six-monthly checks. Right now I feel good, no problem.”The greatest: Bjorn Borg – enigma with a bomb-proof winning mentality | Tim LewisRead moreThe cancer has done nothing to dampen his extreme fitness regime. Of all his revelations, perhaps the most astonishing is that he walks 12 miles (20km) a day around the TV couch in his Stockholm apartment. He can’t be serious? “Yep. I can think in that time.” He writes that Patricia can get “really annoyed” when she’s trying to relax with him and he suddenly gets up and starts walking.You’re bonkers, I say. He nods happily. Then I confess that I run around my living room (not 20km, I hasten to add). He laughs. “You do that? You’re like me! We’re the same! Haha! That’s good to hear.” What’s more, I say, when I played tennis as a teenager, I used to wear a headband like yours and blow on my knuckles when waiting to receive serve. “Oh, you did that with the hand, like I used to do?” Again, he laughs. It’s so lovely to see – the one thing we never saw in his playing years.Rarely has an interview left me so emotional. Partly it’s my age and what Borg means to me. But you’d need a heart of stone not to be moved by somebody who’s been through so much and has finally made peace with himself. Being able to talk about everything seems to have liberated you, I say. “Yes,” he says. And now his smile verges on the ecstatic. “Yes, I’ve got my backpack off my back. Liberated, exactly, that’s the word.” He exhales loudly. “I’m so much lighter now.”Heartbeats: A Memoir by Björn Borg is published by Sphere (£25).

There are scores of uniquely handsome and stylish actors, pop stars, sportsmen – but when it comes to their decades-long influence and a sense of permanence unaffected by trends in fashion, three square-jawed American boys next door stand out: Paul Newman, Steve McQueen – andRobert Redford, who died yesterday at 89.Redford’s death is, obviously, a loss to cinema. In the latter half of the 20th century, few actors so roundly embodied the soul of American film-making, or perhaps even the US itself. During a decade-long, career-defining run of hit movies, Redford established the archetype of the modern leading man. He wasimpossibly handsomeand warmly charismatic, of course, but also scrappy, soulful, athletic, bookishly intelligent and politically aware. A matinee idol who could fix your car while reciting Walt Whitman.View image in fullscreenRobert Redford, left, with Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Photograph: Cinetext/Sportsphoto/ AllstarBut his influence spread beyond Hollywood. For the menswear fraternity, especially those remaining few tasked with publishing men’s style magazines, Redford’s death is especially poignant. He was a paragon of masculine cool and a sartorial chameleon, able to take any aesthetic trope – the cowboy, the drifter, the clean-cut executive, the coastal intellectual – and make it shine with easy authenticity.Redford played with style, able to flit between macho tradition and 70s femininity, and always with innate sex appealRedford’s breakout role came in 1969 as the Sundance Kid, opposite Newman’s Butch Cassidy, in a film that remodelled the cowboy for 1960s pop culture. The pair were smart, irreverent and sensitive, dressed as much for Greenwich village as the OK Corral.In the same year, Redford popped up in the Swiss Alps as part of a fictitious Olympic ski team in Downhill Racer, swapping jumbo corduroy prairie-wear for a clean shave and one of the many singular garments that would gradually serve as tent poles for his sartorial lore. There are whole webpages dedicated to the shearling coat Redford wears in the movie, which is just a nice shearling coat. But on him it was somehowmore. In case you want to buy your own, sleuths have deduced that the coat had western pointed yokes, set-in sleeves with plain cuffs and pile-lined curved welts. But actually, it’s the garment’s blue-eyed contents that gives it such appeal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In each, Redford toils against some form of shady, systematic oppression in impeccable tweed, wool, or corduroy tailoring, which is invariably cast off in exasperation at some point in act three.Redford’s most assuredly menswear-y movie was, of course, 1974’s The Great Gatsby, which received little fanfare from the critics, but has become something of a sacred work for those interested in the history of men’s style, or at least a lurid interpretation of it. The wardrobe was largely supplied by American brand Ralph Lauren and serves as a sartorial time capsule from the roaring 20s, via the Hollywood mainstream.View image in fullscreenRedford in the 1974 film The Great Gatsby.Photograph: Cinetext/Para/Sportsphoto/AllstarAs Redford’s career progressed into the 1980s and 90s, his vibe – on screen and off – became more statesmanlike, and his style followed suit. Off-screen, he fused elements of workwear, western-wear and preppy tailoring separates that were true to the late mid-century but somehow more substantive when worn by him. Cowboy boots, blue jeans, button-down shirts, sporty tweed jackets, aviator-frame sunglasses, chunky steel dive watches … a porno-adjacent moustache and that mop of strawberry-blond hair. Redford played with style, able to flit between macho tradition and 70s femininity, and always with innate sex appeal.As he got older, that meant fewer flares and shirts open to the navel, and more sensible sweaters and muted suits. There were still occasional flashes of the dandy of old, most notably in 2001, when Redford starred opposite Brad Pitt in thriller Spy Game.The film harked back to his run of paranoid spy stories three decades before, and in turn, the chicly attired Boy Scout reappeared, replete with the aviators, the preppy tie, the floppy hair and even a tweed blazer.The film feels like a cinematic passing of the torch, a transference of tousle-haired heart-throbbery. The pair look so shockingly alike, but handsome as he is, it’s hard to imagine Pitt having the same sartorial – or perhaps even cinematic –legacy. In fact, it’s hard to think of any living soul ever coming close.Charlie Teasdale is a writer, stylist and consultant, and the former style director of EsquireTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterRobert RedfordMen's coats and jacketsMen's fashionCelebritynewslettersShareReuse this content"

Now she has written an insider’s take on the UK’s underfunded, overwhelmed justice systemZoe WilliamsThu 18 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 11.05 EDTShareWhen a supreme court judge is a household name, it’s either because they’re very outspoken on a hot topic, or because you’re living in choppy times, and there are so few grownups left among the legislators that the law has to put its hoof down.Brenda Hale, the right honourable Baroness Hale of Richmond (she doesn’t stand on ceremony, but she’d be annoyed if you got it wrong, preferring things to be right) emphatically doesn’t fall into the first camp, but was thrown into the spotlight in 2019. This was when she found Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament – which meant his government could evade scrutiny in the run-up to Britain’s exit from the EU – unlawful.Now retired, she was then head of the supreme court and boy could she accessorise. She handed down that ruling wearing a spider brooch with a body as big as a plum, and one headline that week ran: “Spider woman takes down Hulk: viewers transfixed by judge’s brooch as ruling crushes PM.” Johnson, of course, was not crushed, but got his miserable deal through and survived to make a complete, self-serving hash of the next crisis. “I’m not going to make any comment aboutBrexit,” she says, slightly incredulous that I would ask. I can’t help it, unfortunately. It’s like a tic.All that feels like a long time ago and far away as we meet at her home in Richmond, Yorkshire, a scene of unshowy comfort and order. Sofas match, light streams in; people rarely raise their voices in this house, one senses. She’s vexed at the rabbits destroying her beautiful garden, but her impatience is inexplicably charming.Both her stepdaughters live – I don’t want to say “in different wings”, which sounds inaccurately Brideshead – let’s just say, in different parts of the house. Hale lost her husband, the legal academic and QC, Julian Farrand, in 2020. Her new book, With the Law on Our Side: How the Law Works for Everyone and How We Can Make It Better, is dedicated to him, “a fearless fighter for rights and justice”.“Obviously,” she says of 2019, “we had two cases that were very high profile and attracted a lot of attention, mostly from people who didn’t understand what the cases were about.” One was whether or not the prorogation was justiciable – that is, whether it was right to involve the courts at all. The other was whether it was lawful. “They weren’t cases we had any choice about. We’re flung into these things which happen to have political ramifications, but we’re dealing with something other than the politics.”View image in fullscreenBrenda Hale reads the ruling in September 2019 that the prorogation was ‘unlawful’.Photograph: Supreme Court/APShe has now written a how-to book about the law – not how to practise it, but how to love it the way she does. In the first of its three parts, she operates as a kind of secret-shopper, dipping in to the Royal Courts of Justice, a county court in Middlesbrough, benefit and employment tribunals, a family court in central London, saying what she sees. The second section is about our rights under the law, and the third is about how laws get made. Given the two overriding elements of her post-referendum reputation – one, that she is a magnificent spider woman; two, that she will not take sides, politically, by accident or on purpose – it’s a surprise to read from the outset a completely unvarnished critique of government, that “the justice system has been starved of the resources it needs to do the job which we all need it to do”.She speaks in the distinctive way of a person who is used to having their words transcribed, always knowing when she starts a sentence how it’s going to end. “What I wanted to do was to write a book that said, on the whole, the good things about the justice system and what the justice system can doforpeople as well astothem. So if you’re writing a book which is mostly about what you think is good, you have to acknowledge the things that are not so good. Otherwise, it’s not fair to the people who are struggling. It’s not fair to the reader.”It was once taken as given, “often among people who had no direct knowledge of the justice system”, that it was “a site of national pride, the best in the world”. It’s still the case that “the people working in it really care about the system – the lawyers, the staff, the clerks, the prosecutors, the police, the judges. There are a lot of very dedicated people out there.” But the bottom line is, there isn’t enough money, particularly in criminal and family courts, and if it weren’t for those dedicated staff, “the whole thing would fall apart”. Public servants trying to fill the cracks in degraded state services with their own civic duty is hardly breaking news, but it’s pretty off-brand for the judiciary generally, and Hale in particular, to mention it.View image in fullscreenHale poses with her colleagues before they process from Westminster Abbey to the houses of parliament in 2017.Photograph: Paul Marriott/ShutterstockBefore she was the first woman to be appointed to the supreme court (in 2009), having been the youngest and first female commissioner to be appointed to the Law Commission in 1984, she was a judge on the family circuit, and has heard some awful things. “Sometimes it has to do with poverty and circumstances, but sometimes it has to do with genuine cruelty. Which people find really difficult to understand or accept, that some people are capable of treating children, especially tiny children, very, very badly.” All judges have had sleepless nights, she says, over assessing risk, especially in families.“Some of the stories,” she writes, “are quite mundane …” But the abiding atmosphere she creates, describing courtrooms, is not mundanity or anguish, but fascination. Even the most trivial battle – two people crashing on a roundabout, the case hanging on whether or not it was reasonable to enter with one’s view obscured by a white van – is weirdly engrossing, maybe because we’ve all made decisions while obscured by a white van, sometimes multiple times a day. Hale starts, however, in the court of appeal (criminal division), where a set of defendants have been recently convicted of sexual offences they committed some or many years ago. The question is, should they be sentenced according to the tariffs (minimum terms) of today, or to those of the era in which they committed their crimes (secondarily, how do you adjudicate the risk to the public posed by a 48-year-old whose offences were committed when he was 14?).It was pretty clear to Hale that “you cannot punish people other than the punishment that was appropriate at the time when they did the deeds”, she agreed with the sitting judge. The matter of tariffs per se is more complicated: sentences have gone up for sex offences, maybe because we “appreciate the harm” more, but there’s a potential for counter-productivity there, which they’ve been thrashing out since the 70s. “When I was a second-wave feminist, there was quite an argument about whether the tariff for rape should go up. A lot of people said rape is not taken as seriously as it should be. The counter argument was, with the sort of offences where there’s a slight ‘There, but for the grace of God, go I’ element – people can’t imagine robbing a bank, but they could imagine being accused of rape – the longer the sentence, the more reluctant the jury may be to convict.”In employment law, “the more rights you give workers, the more ways the world of work is going to find for getting work out of people without actually giving themanyrights”. Even while we naturally have our human rights – as children, as disabled people, as LGBTQ+ people, as women, as workers, as patients – the law can enforce the fairness a society has laid down, but there’s a bracing limit to how much it can make things fairer.View image in fullscreenHale at home in Yorkshire.Photograph: Florence Law/The GuardianBack to sentencing, though, because tariffs have gone up for everything. That’s “the main reason for the surge in the prison population”, she says, and it’s been a ratchet effect. “There are politicians, clearly, who want to be seen as tough on crime. There’s a public perception that there’s more crime than there actually is. There are certainly pressures from the media which the politicians pay attention to. And there will be other reasons as well, which have led to a relentless upping of the tariff, across the board.” All of which would be fine, if that same pressure and political posturing went into investment in prisons, but of course it doesn’t.All the pride you might take and interest you might find in the nation’s justice system are rooted in its transparency – you can actually see what’s going on, for a change. Only one or two of the cases in Hale’s book even have to be anonymised (those are ones heard in the family courts that concern children). That also means you can see what caused problems, and the overall picture is frankly depressing.So, in the benefits tribunals – Hale visits a court in Gray’s Inn Road, London – there are two cases. In one, a teenager’s care package has been reduced; in the other, a disabled man has had his benefits removed entirely. In both cases, their entitlement is restored. “This is not surprising given the evidence,” Hale writes of the man, “ but why did it have to get this far?”Well, to put it simply, it’s not a bug, it’s a feature. Campaigners have been saying this for years, that local authorities and the Department for Work and Pensions make decisions against claimants that they know won’t stand up in court, also knowing that the majority of people will be too exhausted to challenge them. Hale can’t, as a judge, be either unaware of that or happy about it? “I have no comment to make on that,” she says, continuing, “it used to be that both the tax people and the benefits people said: ‘we want to collect exactly the right amount, not a penny more, not a penny less, and we want to pay exactly the right amount of benefit, not a penny more, not a penny less.’ That was the mantra, and obviously it’s the right one. I’m not able to comment on whether more sinister things go on now.” Then, exasperated, “I’m not in politics! You know that.”But politics just won’t stop coming to her. Earlier this year, she appeared at a book festival with her daughter, Julia Hoggett, who is head of the London Stock Exchange. Hale made headlines again for saying that the supreme court’s ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex “has been misinterpreted… there’s nothing in that judgment that says that you can’t have gender neutral loos, as we have here in this festival.” These are statements she stands by, even though you can see every sinew of her professional identity straining against backseat-driving the supreme court. Except, that’s not what she was doing, Hale carefully explains. The topic came up when a trans woman in the audience made a remark that was very affecting. “You’re saying the law’s on our side, but it doesn’t feel that way.”“The supreme court dealt with it as a pure question of statutory construction,” Hale says, “and reached the conclusion that the Equality Act trumped theGenderRecognition Act. Now, the Equality Act allows for single-sex services, either separate but equal or separate and different. It allows for them, it doesn’t mandate them. So there’s nothing in that judgment that says anything about same-sex services. It doesn’t say anything about public toilets, changing rooms, hospital wards. But it has been taken to mean something that I don’t think it does mean.”Many people have jumped on that supreme court ruling “with a sigh of relief”, she says, “and said, ‘That toxic debate has been settled.’ Of course it’s not been settled.” Again, I circle back to whether this is accident or design – this misinterpretation, from “single-sex spaces can exist” to “must exist” feels deliberate and political. “You have to get on with what’syourjob,” she says with heavy emphasis. “Yourjob is deciding who is right and who’s wrong in the legal argument.” I feel like one of those annoying rabbits, always popping up looking for lettuce.The funny thing is, you can tell from Hale’s writing, even though there’s no trace of flippancy in it, and from her conversation, even when you’re getting on her nerves, that she has a keen and surprisingly dark sense of humour. “Anybody who’s been to a lecture that I’ve given will have had a few laughs,” she concedes.“Sometimes the cases are dark. Sometimes they’re not so dark, when people actually get what they want out of the justice system.” Does anybody ever truly get what they want? “One hundred per cent? No. The fact that you’ve got to be there at all means there’s a problem, doesn’t it?” For Brenda Hale, that’s the appeal. “You must have got the message,” she says, “that I do actually like legal problems.”With the Law on Our Side by Lady Hale (Vintage Publishing, £25).

Starmer insisted the timing had nothing to do with Trump’s visit.Trump’s visit, which was officially hosted by King Charles, came at the end of a turbulent few weeks for Starmer in which helost his deputy, Angela Rayner, and wasattacked for his handling of the Peter Mandelson row, with his position as leader coming under question by his own MPs.However, Downing Street sources said that his efforts in building a close relationship with Trump, despite criticism at home for doing so, had reaped rewards, with the pageantry of the state visit apparentlyhelping to secure £150bn of promised investment in the UKby US companies.At a closely managed press conference at Chequers, his official country residence, that prevented Trump taking many questions from journalists, Starmer avoided major potential bear traps, including coming under pressure over Mandelson’s links with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The president dismissed a question about the former US ambassador. “I don’t know him,” he said, even thoughthe pair have met previously, including for talks on whisky tariffs in the Oval Office this month. Trump has previously praised Mandelson’s “beautiful accent”.Trump ended the state visit by warning that illegal migration could destroy the UK, telling Starmer that he should follow the US in taking tough action to stop migrants unlawfully crossing its southern border.“I think your situation is very similar. You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn’t matter if you call out the military, it doesn’t matter what means you use,” Trump said.“It destroys countries from within and we’re actually now removing a lot of the people that came into our country.”Thefirst deportation of a Channel migrantto France took place on Thursday under Starmer’s “one in, one out” deal, with further flights due to take place in coming days.With public concern rising over the UK’s borders, and Nigel Farage’s Reform exploiting tensions over the issue, Downing Street believes it has to stop the highly visible crossings. The UK will accept an equal number of people through a newly established safe and legal route.Some Labour MPs have already suggested the government should send the Royal Navy into the Channel to prevent small boat crossings, an approach tried and failed under Boris Johnson in 2022 and 2023.Starmer has also come under pressure from his own party over the situation in Gaza, and the UK is preparing to recognise the state of Palestine even though the US opposes the move.While Starmer spoke of the “humanitarian catastrophe” unfolding in the devastated territory at Chequers, neither man condemned Israel’s actions in the strip, which has seen IDF troops pressing ahead with a ground offensive into Gaza City, forcing more people to flee their homes.Trump, asked when he would put more pressure on Israel to halt its military offensive, focused almost exclusively on the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas. He patted the prime minister on the back when he said the group would play no part in any future government.The US, now in effect opposed to a two-state solution as unobtainable and undesirable, has rejected the UK move as unhelpful, but Trump has decided not to make the matter a point of division with Starmer on the basis that Washington sees it as a largely symbolic act.In a significant change of tone on the Ukraine conflict, Trump said thatVladimir Putin had “really let me down”, to the delight of British officials who had hoped to use the unprecedented second state visit to isolate the Russian president on the world stage.“He’s killing many people, and he’s losing more people than he’s killing. The Russian soldiers are being killed at a higher rate than the Ukrainian soldiers,” Trump said.Just a month after the US president held talks in Alaska with Putin, he admitted he had thought it would be easier to negotiate a truce between the two countries. He did not say how he would put pressure on the Kremlin to end the war but urged Nato countries to stop buying Russian oil.In the biggest surprise of the press conference, Trump revealed the US isseeking to retake control of Bagram airbase from the Talibanafter it was surrendered during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.The US views it as an important strategic foothold in the region, which could help counter the threat of growing Chinese military might. “One of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,” he said.In another point of difference, Trump praised North Sea oil as a “phenomenal asset” and urged the UK to use more of it, while he dismissed wind power as a “very expensive joke”. Starmer, meanwhile, defended the importance of an energy mix, including renewables.After Trump was shown around Chequers, he was overheard telling his hosts that he had seen every memorial on this trip and that while they were beautiful, he had had enough. The US president said he had told the king that he was welcome to the US for dinner, but that he would not expect to show him around the Lincoln memorial.Later, on his flight back to the US onboard Air Force One, Trump claimed that Sadiq Khan had wanted to attend the state visit’s events but he had blocked it.“I asked that he not be there,” Trump told reporters. “I didn’t want him there, I asked that he not be there.“I think the mayor of London, Khan, is among the worst mayors in the world, and we have some bad ones.”Khan is understood to have made it clear weeks ago that he did not seek or expect an invitation to events held for the contentious state visit.At an event earlier on Thursday evening, Starmer said the UK-US technology pact agreed to mark Trump’s visit “put tech up there as a special feature of the special relationship”.“It’s a special day,” he said, as he joined Jensen Huang, chief executive of the $4tn chip manufacturer Nvidia at a tech industry event in London. “AI and tech are going to be absolutely transformative,” Starmer said, as Huang announced a £2bn in investment in UK tech companies.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerUkraineIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

How can western governments still refuse to act? | Steve CrawshawRead moreRecognition will bring a wave of criticism from Israel, including claims that it is a reward for Hamas and terrorism, a charge the UK rejects by saying it envisages only a Palestinian state in which Hamas is disarmed, plays no part in the future government, and the leadership of the Palestinian Authority is subject to elections within a year.Starmer emphasised there would be no place for Hamas, insisting the group were terrorists, and adding he agreed with Trump on the need for a roadmap.The UK prime minister said recognition was “part of that overall package which hopefully takes us from the appalling situation we’re in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state”.Graph showing international recognition of the Palestinian stateThe US, now in effect opposed to a two-state solution as unobtainable and undesirable, has rejected the UK move as unhelpful, but Trump has decided not to make the matter a point of division with Starmer given Washington sees it as a largely symbolic act that will not weaken Israel. The president has his own private frustrations with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to agree a ceasefire, as well as hisbombing of Qatarlast week.The UK Foreign Office had long parried calls for recognition, saying the step should only be taken when it had maximum impact on the peace process. Following intense consultations with French diplomats, the UK shifted to backing recognition four days after Emmanuel Macron made his announcement on 25 July.The delay gave Starmer time to talk privately to Trump on his visit to Scotland, and to set conditions that if fulfilled would delay UK recognition of Palestine. These included a resumption of humanitarian aid, a ceasefire, Israeli engagement in a sustained peace process, and no further Israeli land annexations in theWest Bank. Israel was never likely to meet these preconditions, making UK recognition largely an issue of timing rather than content.Britain’s choice has been whether to wait for a UN conference on Monday on a two-state solution or go earlier. Prompting the decision is anger at Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and a sense that if Britain does not act now Israel will, through annexation, have destroyed the last hope of Palestinian self-determination.The head of the Palestinian mission in the UK, Husam Zomlot, is due to unveil the Palestinian flag on Monday at what will become the Palestinian embassy.The act of recognition would make UK relations with Palestine as those between two states, but government legal advice is that that would not place any additional legal obligations on the UK to punish Israel for what Britain already regards as the unlawful occupation of Palestine.Critics in the UK claim recognition breaches the Montevideo effectiveness criteria that a state should only be recognised if it has clearly defined borders, a stable population and a single functioning government.The difficulty for ministers is that as claims that Israel is committing genocide start to become more frequent inside the Labour party, the demand to take further action will intensify, including cutting off trade links with Israel.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesForeign policyGazaWest BankMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

This is despite the regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC), recommending they be struck off the medical register.The GMC investigates complaints against doctors and refers the most serious cases to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) to adjudicate on whether they remain fit to practice.Doctor who left patient during operation to have sex with nurse allowed to practiseRead moreThe study analysed 222 new MPTS tribunal cases between August 2023 and August 2024 and found that out of the 46 proven cases of sexual misconduct identified, the MPTS imposed the same disciplinary sanction as the GMC recommended in 35. In 11 cases, the MPTS decided to only suspend the doctor rather than erase them from the medical register, and in no case did the MPTS impose a tougher sanction.Mei Nortley, a consultant vascular surgeon and lead author of the research, said: “We hope this study aids the MPTS to reflect on whether it delivers its aims of protecting the public, ensuring doctors meet professional standards and promoting public confidence in the medical profession. Allowing rapists, sexual predators and those who use manipulation and coercion to return as practising doctors brings this into question.”The research, published in the Bulletin of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, found that all perpetrators were male doctors, with more than 80% holding positions of authority. Several cases involved multiple targets, showing repeated and systemic abuse.In arelated paperin the British Medical Journal, the authors cited several recent high-profile cases that had “fuelled concerns about the consistency and adequacy” of sanctions. This included an MPTS tribunal earlier this year that found an acute medical consultant guilty of rape but handed him a 12-month suspension rather than striking him off, because it was deemed to be a “one-off event”.Another doctor was found to have “pursued and groomed” a vulnerable patient from the age of 14 but was only suspended from the register for 12 months, with the tribunal panel citing evidence of “insight, remediation and remorse” as the reason he was not struck off.The RCS said the findings of both papers showed that the system of medical regulation was “failing targets of misconduct”. Its vice-president Prof Vivien Lees said the research highlighted “deeply concerning inconsistencies”, which risked “leaving perpetrators in power and eroding trust in the profession”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said: “In cases of sexual misconduct, we will often ask for the doctor to be struck off the medical register. Where we feel the sanctions applied by the independent tribunal are too lenient, we can and do appeal. A significant proportion of our appeals are successful and result in stronger sanctions.”A spokesperson for the MPTS said: “We recognise the impact of our work and tribunal decisions on the lives of all those involved in our hearings. It is important that doctors have a fair hearing that thoroughly assesses all the evidence presented by both the GMC and the doctor and that the tribunal comes to an impartial decision.”The spokesperson said the MPTS was due to publish new guidance for tribunals on 30 September.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Sexual abuse or harassment in any healthcare setting is completely unacceptable, and this report is extremely concerning. We expect employers and regulators to properly investigate and take action against perpetrators of sexual misconduct.“This government is determined to create a culture where staff feel safe and supported. We have already taken decisive action and introduced the healthcare system’s first organisational sexual safety charter along with strengthened guidance for medical professions on reporting misconduct. We are also ensuring whistleblowers are free to speak up, knowing that they will be supported and their concerns listened to and acted upon.”Explore more on these topicsDoctorsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Rashford, he said, was a player he had long admired and could help improve.Newcastle United v Barcelona: Champions League – liveRead moreIn the 82nd minute, Rashford walked off wreathed in smiles before being wrapped in Flick’s heartfelt embrace. Ruben Amorim’s bete noire had just scored two splendid goals that not merely rendered Eddie Howe’s rather effective gameplan academic but silenced St James’ Park.With Faustino Asprilla – the scorer of a famous hat-trick for Newcastle as Barcelona succumbed 3-2 on Tyneside in 1997 – having flown in from Colombia to help cheer on his old team, it was not supposed to be like this. Not even Anthony Gordon’s 90th-minute consolation could upstage Rashford as Flick’s players expertly managed seven minutes of stoppage time.Until then it was no night for slow coaches. Not with so many explosions of pace all over the pitch and on the respective right wings in particular. If Raphinha’s rapid acceleration down that flank for Barcelona sometimes stretched Tino Livramento to the limit, the sprinting powers of Newcastle’s Anthony Elanga often seemed utterly irresistible.From one such advance Elanga scorched past Gerard Martín before crossing for Gordon but Newcastle’s out-of-position centre-forward failed to make contact. Might Nick Woltemade have done better? Quite possibly, but Newcastle’s £70m Germany striker began on the bench after Howe sensibly decided three games in a week might be beyond the 6ft 6in new boy at this stage.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford hits a stunning shot past Nick Pope to put Barcelona 2-0 in front.Photograph: Daniel Chesterton/Offside/Getty ImagesNonetheless, Newcastle’s manager could certainly have done with Woltemade’s sureness of touch as Harvey Barnes dinked the ball over Joan García only to direct it wide of a post. On that occasion Barnes’s blushes were spared by a linesman’s offside flag but he would later be denied by the goalkeeper when clean through on the counterattack.Yet, if their finishing was found wanting, Newcastle initially pressed so hard and high they refused to allow the La Liga champions to assert any sustained midfield control.The danger was that if Newcastle even momentarily lost concentration, Raphinha or Rashford would race away from them. Rashford looked razor sharp and had home hearts in mouths after tricking Kieran Trippier before leaving the former England full-back trailing in his wake. He ultimately shot wide but Howe knew it represented a reprieve.With Flick’s brightest talent, Lamine Yamal, back in Barcelona nursing his injured groin, opportunity beckoned for a Newcastle side cleverly mixing long balls with slick, short passing. Yet as well as they did to keep the match evenly balanced, García was hardly troubled.Although Sandro Tonali, once again tremendous in midfield, prompted a series of promising moves and cross after cross flew into Barcelona’s box, the lack of specialist striker ensured they came to nothing.Tonali’s presence as a disruptor also dictated that Nick Pope remained generally well protected as Barcelona struggled to join their attacking dots and a frustrated Robert Lewandowski implored the referee to book his assiduous minder, Fabian Schär.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scene was set for Rashford to jog a few memories by connecting with the excellent Koundé’s left-footed cross and flashing an unstoppable glancing header past Pope. A perfect fusion of power and accuracy, it was his first goal for Barcelona and arrived after he cleverly manoeuvred himself clear of Schär.It served as the signal for Howe to finally introduce Woltemade as part of a quadruple substitution but, before the newcomers could make a difference, Rashford struck again.If his opener was good, his second was sublime. Having dodged Tonali, he unleashed a 20-yard shot that pinged the crossbar en route to the back of the net. Rashford always tended to do well against Newcastle for Manchester United and it seems switching shirts has not lessened that appetite.Although Gordon finally proved he can score after all by sliding home Murphy’s cross at the far post, the first Englishman to score for Barcelona since Gary Lineker had already done enough.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedBarcelonamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He confirmed the party had referred the matter to the ICO and urged supporters to ignore an earlier email requesting funds and cancel any payments.Responding to claims from Sultana that she had been frozen out by a “sexist boys’ club” inside the party, Corbyn said late on Thursday that she had not been “excluded from any discussions” and remained part of a process “rooted in inclusivity and mutual respect”.Sultana rejected those claims, saying she acted because she was sidelined and frozen out of official accounts. She said her only aim was to “safeguard grassroots involvement”, as she accused Corbyn’s allies of trying to concentrate power over members’ money and the party’s conference.Allies of Sultana went further, suggesting a “paranoid anti-democratic faction” inside the project worked to exclude her from decision-making and was more concerned about preserving its own status than building the movement.They claimed this group had been developing a rival membership system that would divert money to its own company, giving it “complete control” over the party.Sultana’s allies claim there had been an internal agreement that one faction would hold mailing list data, while a different more pro-democratic group controlled donor information, in an attempt to split power.They allege she had exhausted every avenue to resolve the dispute privately before being “stonewalled”.The split emerged on Thursday when Sultana revealed a new membership portal on X, urging supporters to “be a part of history”.Within half an hour she celebrated “10,000 paid-up members” in a separate post and reassured her followers that the membership site was “safe and secure”, encouraging them to keep trying to sign up despite “issues due to such high traffic”.By early afternoon, Sultana said numbers had hit 20,000, dismissing suggestions from those she classed as “rightwing bad faith actors” who were claiming “this link is fake”.Sultana had posted about the new portal three times before Corbyn issued an “urgent message” telling his followers on X to ignore the site and indicated “legal advice is being taken”.“This morning, an unauthorised email was sent to allyourparty.uksupporters with details of a supposed membership portal hosted in a new domain name,” Corbyn said.“Legal advice is being taken. That email should be ignored by all supporters. If direct debits have been set up, they should immediately be cancelled.”Apparent Your party implosion leaves big political vacancy on the leftRead moreThe clash is the most dramatic in a series of tensions that have plagued the project since its staggered launch in July.Sultana, 31, who had been suspended fromLaboursince a rebellion over the two-child benefit cap, announced unilaterally she was co-leader of a new party along with Corbyn, 76.But some within the group felt the move was premature and potentially counterproductive, while others disagreed – saying the alliance would have never been launched if Corbyn was allowed to remain indecisive.Several hours later, the former Labour leader confirmed he was in discussions about creating the new party but avoided confirming any formal structure or leadership arrangement, giving his preference for collective decision-making.By late July the pair had formallyagreed to launch a partytogether, with a pledge to hold mass gatherings and a founding conference in the autumn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Insiders disagreed over whether the party should operate as a member-driven organisation – with a space for grassroots debate and policy setting – or take on a tighter model built around a small group of MPs and organisers.There have also been divisions over control of membership data and finances. It was those that burst into the open on Thursday, with Corbyn’s statement co-signed by all of the Independent Alliance MPs bar Sultana: Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed and Shockat Adam.Despite the chaos of its launch, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve | Andy BeckettRead moreThat joint statement from all of the other MPs in the alliance prompted Sultana to claim she had been sidelined and excluded from key decisions.“Neither of this week’s emails had the dual authorisation of both myself and Jeremy – which was the agreement made at the start of this process,” she said in a statement posted on X on Thursday.“After being sidelined by the MPs in today’s statement and effectively frozen out of the official accounts, I took the step of launching a membership portal so that the supporters could continue to engage and organise.”She added: “My sole motivation has been to safeguard the grassroots involvement that is essential to building this party. Unfortunately, I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys’ club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely.“They have refused to allow any other women with voting rights on the working group, blocking the gender-balanced committee that both Jeremy and I signed up to.”Sultana also warned about power being concentrated in too few hands, intimating she was uncomfortable with the control being exerted by former Corbyn staffers from when he was leader of the opposition.“I do not believe members will accept Karie Murphy [Corbyn’s former chief of staff] and her associates having sole financial control of members’ money and sole constitutional control of our conference. This undermines the democratic principles we agreed to uphold.”She called on Corbyn to meet her and “make public all agreed structures, processes and decision-making protocols”, adding: “This party is more important than any one person, and we all owe it to the movement to deliver a truly democratic and socialist party. No stitch-ups, no coronations: the members must decide.”Insiders have told the Guardian that allies of Corbyn have been asserting increasing control of the working group over financial and constitutional decisions, leaving Sultana pushing for a member-led structure. But others said Sultana had been on “wrecking manoeuvres” and “sought after nothing but power”.An ally of the project said the row risked sending a “terrible signal to supporters still deciding if this project is serious”. It remains unclear whether the project will survive in the same form until its own founding conference in the autumn.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaLabourInformation commissionernewsShareReuse this content"

Helsing’s software uses AI technology to analyse sensor and weapons system data from battlefields to inform real-time military decisions. It also makes its own military drone, the HX-2. Ek is also chairman of Helsing.The band made the announcement at the same time that they signed up to a new initiative, No Music for Genocide, in which a group of more than 400 artists and labels are blocking their music from streaming services in Israel.In a statement, the band said:Unconnected to this initiative and in light of the (reported) significant investments by its CEO in a company producing military munition drones and AI technology integrated into fighter aircraft, Massive Attack have made a separate request to our label that our music be removed from the Spotify streaming service in all territories.In our view, the historic precedent of effective artist action during apartheid South Africa and the apartheid, war crimes and genocide now being committed by the state of Israel renders the No Music for Genocide campaign imperative.In the separate case of Spotify, the economic burden that has long been placed on artists is now compounded by a moral and ethical burden, whereby the hard-earned money of fans and the creative endeavours of musicians ultimately funds lethal, dystopian technologies.Enough is more than enough.Another way is possible.​ASpotifyspokesperson said: “Spotify and Helsing are two totally separate companies.”They added that Helsing was “not involved in Gaza” and its efforts were “focused on Europe defending itself in Ukraine”.Helsing said in a statement: “Currently we see misinformation spreading that Helsing’s technology is deployed in war zones other than Ukraine. This is not correct.“Our technology is deployed to European countries for deterrence and for defence against the Russian aggression in Ukraine only.”Massive Attack join Australian psych group King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, Canadian post-rock group Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the Third Man Records-signed US band Hotline TNT, alternative US group Deerhoof and Manchester band Wu Lyf inremoving their musicfrom Spotify as a result of Ek’s investment in Helsing.Unlike those acts, Massive Attack will not be able to host their music on the widely used alternative Bandcamp, which is only available to acts on independent record labels. After moving to Bandcamp – and making their albums pay-what-you-want, including £0 – King Gizzard’s entire 27-album catalogue took the top 27 spots on the platform.The No Music for Genocide initiative also includes artists such as MJ Lenderman,Amyl and the Sniffers, Rina Sawayama, Jockstrap, KeiyaA,John Glacier, Erika de Casier, Smerz, Wednesday, Nourished by Time, Mike, Yaeji and Faye Webster. The artists involved either edited their release territories or asked their distributor or label to geo-block their releases.Massive Attack expanded on their participation in an Instagram post:In 1991 the scourge of apartheid violence fell from South Africa, aided from a distance by public boycotts, protests, and the withdrawal of work by artists, musicians and actors. Complicity with that state was considered unacceptable. In 2025 the same now applies to the genocidal state of Israel. As of today, there’s a musician’s equivalent of the recently announced @filmworkers4palestine campaign (signed by 4,500 filmmakers, actors, industry workers & institutions) – it can be found @nomusicforgenocide & supports the wider asks of the growing @bds.movement. We’d appeal to all musicians to transfer their sadness, anger and artistic contributions into a coherent, reasonable & vital action to end the unspeakable hell being visited upon the Palestinians hour after hour.Massive Attack previously formeda syndicate for artists speaking out in support of the Palestinian peoplealongside Brian Eno, Kneecap and Fontaines DC, to protect musicians from being “threatened into silence or career cancellation” by organisations such asUK Lawyers for Israel(UKLFI), which reported Bob Vylan to police for leading a chant of “death to the IDF” at Glastonbury, as well as reporting the BBC for broadcasting the set.Of the syndicate, Massive Attack told the Guardian: “This collective action is really about offering some kind of solidarity to those artists who are living day after day in a screen-time genocide, but are worried about using their platforms to express their horror at that because of the level of censorship within their industry or from highly organised external legal bodies, terrifying them and their management teams with aggressive legal actions. The intention is clear and obvious: to silence them.”Explore more on these topicsMassive AttackDaniel EkSpotifyDigital music and audioProtestArms tradeArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Now researchers have won an Ig Nobel prize for a radical new approach: slashing people’s calorie intake by feeding them Teflon.The left-field proposal was inspired by zero calorie drinks and envisaged food manufacturers blending powdered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) into their products in the hope it would sate people’s hunger before quietly sliding out.The team is one of 10 to be recognised at this year’s Ig Nobel awards, which celebrate research that first makes people laugh and then makes them think. They are not to be confused with the rather more prestigious, and lucrative,Nobel prizesthat will be doled out in Scandinavia next month.The latest crop of winners were handed their awards by bona fide Nobel laureates, and showered with paper planes, at a ceremony at Boston University on Thursday.Demis Hassabis: from video game designer to Nobel prize winnerRead moreResearchers honoured on the night discovered that alcohol, in small doses at least, boosted people’s foreign language skills; that cows disguised as zebras suffered fewer insect bites, and that people became more narcissistic after being told they were more intelligent than most, even when they weren’t. Another prize went to a fastidious doctor who measured the growth of his nails for 35 years.“I feel honoured,” said Dr Rotem Naftalovich at Rutgers University in New Jersey, whose work on the Teflon diet landed the chemistry prize. After discussing the idea for a zero calorie filler with his brother David, the pair hit on Teflon as their favoured substance.Making their case inObesity Technology, the researchers explained how PTFE could make up a quarter of our food by volume. But while Naftalovich made – and ate – chocolate bars containing Teflon, the US Food and Drug Administration was cool on the idea.“I don’t think they wanted to review it because it was such a wonky idea,” Natfalovich said.The peace prize went to a German, Dutch and British team who showed that a shot of vodka improved people’s foreign language skills. “A small sip seemed to boost confidence without making the words fall apart,” said Dr Fritz Renner, a psychologist at the University of Freiburg.But the improvement wasn’t huge. “It’s not like people were transformed into perfect Dutch speakers after a single drink,” added Prof Matt Field, a psychologist at the University of Sheffield who worked on the study.If communication with foreigners improved with alcohol, flying did not. The aviation prize went to researchers who plied Egyptian fruit bats with ethanol. The bats became slow and their echolocation faltered, much as speech becomes slurred in the inebriated. Bats that binged on fermented fruit may be “at higher risk of colliding with obstacles”, the team concluded.The science behind winning a Nobel Prize? Being a man from a wealthy family | Torsten BellRead moreFood featured heavily in the 2025 awards. An exploration into the impact of diet on breast milk flavour won the paediatric prize for showing that babies suckled for longer after their mothers ate garlic. A largely Italian team won the physics prize for elucidating a phase transition in pasta dish cacio e pepe that leads to unpleasant clumping. Another group discovered that, even when given a choice, rainbow lizards in Togo had an extreme preference for “four cheeses” pizzas, earning them the nutrition prize.Elsewhere, Indian researchers landed the engineering prize for building a shoe rack that neutralised the odour of smelly trainers. The rack, more of a cardboard box, contained a UV lamp that killed the offending bacteria in minutes. It also burnt the trainers. The psychology prize went to work that found people who were told they had above average intelligence believed it and were prone to bragging.Dr Tomoki Kojima at the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization in Japan won the biology prize. His team showed that cows suffered fewer fly bites when painted with black stripes. “I couldn’t believe it,” he said. “I thought I was dreaming.”The literature prize went posthumously to the late Dr William Bean of the University of Iowa. In a succession of papers, he documented the growth rate of his fingernails and toenails over 35 years. His son Bennett said the whole family was drawn into the effort.“He was interested in the world and we were part of it,” his son Bennett told the Guardian. “He would have loved this and used it as an event to write some perfect acceptance speech. He would say: ‘Finally, recognition!’”Explore more on these topicsIg Nobel prizesScience prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

About one in six teachers at primary and secondary schools went on strike, as well as school canteen staff and monitors. Several high schools from Paris to Amiens and Le Havre were blockaded by students. Protesters held more than 250 demonstrations and marched in cities from Paris to Marseille, Nantes, Lyon and Montpellier.View image in fullscreenCGT union members during a demonstration in Marseille. Sophie Binet, the head of the union, said: ‘It’s the streets that must decide the budget.’Photograph: Manon Cruz/Reuters“The anger is huge, and so is the determination – my message to Mr Lecornu today is this: it’s the streets that must decide the budget,” said Sophie Binet, head of the leftwing CGT union, as Macron’s new prime minister scramblesto put together a budget for next year, as well as form a new government.The day of strikes and protests came at a time of political crisis in France. Last week, Macron named his close ally Lecornu as the third prime minister in a year, after the previous two –François BayrouandMichel Barnier– were ousted by parliament amid bitter disagreements over budget cuts.Lecornu was appointed after his centrist predecessor, Bayrou, lost a confidence vote on 8 September over his unpopular plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt.The prime minister has said he will ditch Bayrou’s deeply unpopular proposal to scraptwo public holidays. But trade unions are concerned that other elements of Bayrou’s budget cuts – such as a freeze on most welfare spending – could be maintained. Lecornu has promised to abolish lifelong privileges for ex-prime ministers, but has so far not revealed his budget plans.Lecornu has only weeks to come up with a budget text and form another minority government. He has to avoid any budget being immediately rejected by opposition parties who could call a vote of no confidence and oust him from office. Since Macron called asudden snap electionlast June, the French parliament has been split between the left, the far right and the centre with no absolute majority. This has resulted in repeated deadlock over the budget.View image in fullscreenThe French interior ministry estimated that  between 600,000 and 900,000 people had taken part in street demonstrations across the day.Photograph: Tom Nicholson/Reuters“We’re here to protect public services, which are being chipped away at by successive government budget cuts,” said Sylvie, a public sector worker from Créteil outside Paris, who ran local creche provision after working for nearly 20 years in hospital child psychiatry.Carrying a flag of the FSU public sector union, she said: “France is one of the few countries that a still has a proper social security system and a safety net to look after those in society who need help, but year after year it is being eroded by funding cuts. Salaries for public sector workers are very low; we do this work because we love it and want to serve people, not – for profit. Yet we’re being blamed for the high public debt, when in fact it is Emmanuel Macron’s tax breaks to businesses that have damaged public finances. We’re marching peacefully today because we just want the government to start listening to us.”Christiane, who worked in cultural services in the Val-de-Marne outside Paris, said: “There are more and more working poor – people who have jobs who can’t afford rent and are sleeping in their cars.”Guillaume, 49, a youth worker for children excluded from the school system in Rouen, Normandy, had come to Paris to march with the SUD union health-workers’ branch. He said: “All social protections are being attacked, from pensions to social security and healthcare provisions. The rich are getting richer and there is more inequality. I see the impact of budget cuts in the social work sector – more children need help and Covid aggravated the situation because some children were shut inside with families who may have neglected or mistreated them. I’m here today to tell the government: stop giving money to big businesses as tax breaks and handouts, it is damaging society and the whole state sector. We need measures to tax the very wealthy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said he did not disagree with his host about much, save Starmer’s planto recognise a Palestinian state. And he teetered on the edge of being diplomatic, at least until he advised Starmerto use the militaryto stop small boats crossing the Channel.But the hour the two men spent away from the cameras will be the true test of whether Starmer was able to use this second state visit, withall its pomp, to change any of the US president’s thinking.Starmer – whose technique in public is to alight on whatever small patch of common ground he can find with Trump – will have used that precious private time to try to persuade him to think again about the trustworthiness ofVladimir Putinand the judgment of Benjamin Netanyahu.2:25'Putin has let me down': key takeaways from Trump and Starmer's press conference – videoOnGaza, judging by the press conference, Starmer failed. Trump nodded when he was told by an ITV reporter that he was “the only man on the planet capable of stopping the demolition of Gaza City, to stop the starvation of Palestine and stop the killing of civilians”.Trump replied that he could not forget 7 October, and said his demand was forHamasto hand over all the hostages in one go.Starmer and Trump are not that far apart, however, since the entire Arab world now backs plans for a government for Gaza in which Hamas plays no role. That will be underscored again at a UN conference next week.Trump is also privately supportive of the joint plan from Jared Kushnerand Tony BlairforGaza’s reconstruction, in which Palestinians would not be displaced from the territory. Displacement, with its echoes of the Nakba of 1948, would make it a non-starter with Gulf states, and in any case would run counter to the ideas generated by Egypt, France and the UK.Starmer’s difficulty lies in persuading Trump to weigh in behind specific plans in public, and convincing him that Gulf states will start to make their own plans for future security if he appears to subcontract his Middle East policy to Netanyahu.OnUkrainethere may have been something closer to a meeting of minds. Trump, sounding hurt, said he felt really let down by Putin, and acknowledged that the war had been more difficult to solve than he forecast.Starmer held back from saying Trump’s optimism had been misplaced. But he said Putin’s latest targets showed a new “recklessness” that demanded a stronger response.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So he and Europe now have little choice but to move faster on closing down the flow of oil to Europe. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has already promised to speed up its plan to stop buying Russian oil and gas, moving the deadline earlier than 2028.Starmer has something to work with in that Trump agreed that the lower the price of oil, the quicker Putin would settle.After the past two days, King Charles and Starmer can only hope Trump is closer to being convinced that if he stops talking about sanctions, and instead implements them, he can persuade Putin that his options are finally closed.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpForeign policyUS foreign policyKeir StarmerGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

But those who work in the system believe they do not reflect the reality of the way – and pace at which – the justice system and the framework for identifying victims of modern slavery work.The claimant only arrived on UK shores on 12 August and evidence shows it can take a considerable amount of time for someone to be identified as a potential victim of modern slavery, find legal representation and gather evidence to support their claim.On arrival in England and Wales, people can be referred to the national referral mechanism (NRM), which is the framework for identifying potential victims of modern slavery and is administered by theHome Office. This can be done by first responders, which includes some Home Office officials, the police, border force, local authorities and organisations such as the Salvation Army and the Refugee Council.The possibility of delay starts here, where traumatised people may be unable or unwilling to express what they have experienced, warned by their trafficker not to say anything on arrival, or not even appreciate that they are a victim.As the UK anti-slavery commissioner, Eleanor Lyons,told the Guardian: “Victims of modern slavery have endured horrific exploitation at the hands of criminals. Many victims are fearful of their traffickers and speaking about their experiences.“Often they do not recognise themselves as ‘victims’ and have been told by their exploiters that the authorities cannot be trusted or they fear violence or reprisals against their families.“That is why trained professionals, such as police, immigration officers and NGOs are tasked with identifying potential victims of modern slavery, not the victims themselves. It often takes time for victims to disclose their exploitation because trauma, fear and control by traffickers run deep.”At the same time, there is no guarantee that the first responders will identify them and the NRM has been criticised for leaving people waiting too long for decisions.An initial “reasonable grounds” decision on whether the individual is a victim of modern slavery is supposed to take five days but the Salvation Army said last yearit was taking 47 days on average(about the same length of time that the Eritrean claimant has been in the UK). A confirmation of status “conclusive grounds” decision is supposed to take 45 days but in 2023the median waiting time was 526 days.If a first responder does refer an individual to the NRM, it may refer them to a lawyer at the same time. People who are not referred might be unable to access legal advice until they are moved to an immigration removal centre – which could be after a week in a short-term holding facility – through the detained duty advice scheme (DDAS). This is staffed by contracted legal aid lawyers who provide free, 30-minute legal advice appointments for people detained in such centres inEnglandand Wales.The lawyer will have 10 appointments in a day and will not be able to take on a lot of the cases, which leaves people relying on an NGO to refer them – another possible point of delay – to a different legal aid lawyer.Experts have warned that there is a shortage of legal aid lawyers to assist asylum seekers. Researchpublished by the Jesuit Refugee Service in Julyfound that in Harmondsworth and Colnbrook immigration removal centres only 38% of respondents had any form of legal representation. Just 30% of the total were represented through the DDAS.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Judges are expected to throw out vexatious claims and lawyers can face a hearing of abuse of court under the so-called Hamid jurisdiction if deemed to have brought a hopeless application.Onthe Free Movement blog, Sonia Lenegan, an immigration, asylum and public law solicitor, wrote: “I suspect that she [Mahmood] knows perfectly well that the ‘intolerable … last-minute attempts to frustrate a removal’ are a direct result of the system as designed by the Home Office, which does its absolute best to prevent people being able to access lawyers and make effective claims at all.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodHome OfficeRefugeesHuman traffickingModern slaveryEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s not the funniest comedy, but it has so much more going for it than just laughsRachel AroestiThu 18 Sep 2025 16.25 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 16.26 EDTShareMawaan Rizwan began his career as a YouTuber; he later attended the prestigious Paris clown school, École Philippe Gaulier. In Juice, the 33-year-old’s BBC sitcom, he effortlessly unites these disparate comedy training grounds. As the fun-loving commitment-phobe Jamma, Rizwan channels the archetypal man-child vlogger. Puppyish and relatable, he wears his insecurities on his sleeve, and his attempts to conform to the expectations of adulthood are inevitably thwarted. But he is also a figure of more outre fun. With a severe bowl-cut and a penchant for retina-searing fashion, Jamma is overtly ridiculous: a master of slapstick and a magnet for chaos.In series one, Jamma spent most of his time clowning about: hardly working at a quirky marketing company (with mini trampolines instead of desk chairs) and messing around his sensible therapist boyfriend Guy (Russell Tovey). Now – having been fired from the job and broken up with Guy – he’s crashing with his friend Winnie and working as a clown in a care home. Jamma seems fine with his new gig and more interested in sleeping around than patching things up with lovelorn Guy. But after their paths cross again, he becomes determined to win him back.If Juice wasn’t quite a romcom the first time round, it is now: Jamma and Guy’s will-they-won’t-they? forms the backbone of this second series. The pair’s differences are myriad: Guy buys £31 hand-soap and decants his cereal into containers, activities Jamma finds borderline offensive. He, meanwhile, is a walking disaster zone, unable to take on even the most basic responsibility. Ultimately, Jamma realises it is he who must change, and does so with the help of a cloaked magician (the inimitable Kevin Eldon) who wants to buy his soul. Naturally.View image in fullscreenReal-life sibling … Mawaan Rizwan’s brother Nabhaan as Isaac and Emily Lloyd-Saini as Winnie.Photograph: BBC/Various Artists LimitedJuice is not overburdened with edgy jokes; its humour often relies on familiar sitcom tropes: urgent toilet visits, mistaken identity, repressed posh people. It rarely raises more than a titter and yet, strangely, that doesn’t matter; the show has more going for it than gags. The comedy may not be that distinctive, but Juice’s creativity comes at you like a tidal wave.From the enchantingly crafted model town in the opening titles and exterior shots to the makeshift house where Jamma’s dad lives (everything from the walls to the sofa cushions is made from cardboard and parcel paper), the set design is extraordinary. This combined with Rizwan’s playfulness – stories are told via the grammar of cheesy 1980s sitcoms, shadow-puppet-inspired animation and in fully fledged horror movie mode – means Juice has an anything-can-happen unreality. Its compelling fusion of vague dread and childlike imagination resembles a dream curdling into a nightmare.Grounding these surreal flourishes is a cast who radiate charm. Tovey brings an amiability to everything he does; his Guy is strait-laced but never a bore, and he and Jamma have palpable chemistry. Actor and comedian Emily Lloyd-Saini – who used to host a BBC Asian Network radio show with Rizwan – is giddy yet down-to-earth as Winnie, while the creator enlists his real-life sibling Nabhaan (an in-demand actor in his own right) to play Isaac, Jamma’s cool, inscrutable younger brother. Their mother Shahnaz – who was cast in one of India’s biggest TV shows as a result of her scene-stealing turns in her son’s YouTube sketches – is a little less low-key as matriarch Farida. Hunting for her estranged husband, Saif (comedian Jeff Mirza, steeped in sad bear energy) to get him to sign divorce papers so she can attend to her “bodily needs in a halal way”, she is a whirlwind of single-minded fury and imperious glam.‘I’ve spent a lot of my adult life trying to prove myself’: Mawaan Rizwan on his long journey from shopping centre performer to Bafta-winning actorRead moreInstead of chasing laughs, Juice 2.0 becomes increasingly intent on clawing at psychological insight. Guy is writing a book about intimacy, and the therapy theme drives deep into the fabric of the show. Thanks to their father’s behaviour, Jamma and Isaac have daddy issues, while Guy must reckon with his tendency to adopt the father figure role in relationships.The dominant psychodrama, however, involves Jamma’s attempt to suffocate his inner clown; the part of him that conflates love and attention and craves them at any cost – a reckoning that leads to enlightenment. The broader moral seems a bit muddled – that we should embrace each other’s true selves, but also change for each other? Yet the ending (which feels very final; you wouldn’t bet on a third series) is irresistibly heartwarming.Rizwan has described Juice as possessing the “chaos of a cheese-induced dream but the emotional truth of a good therapy session”. It may not be side-splitting, but this lovable, thought-provoking and visually arresting series lives up to its promises.Juice is on BBC Three and iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTV comedyTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It can be a tricky time to get dressed, switching between low-20s summer heat and sudden autumn chills – and the rain doesn’t help.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

In recent years, brands have been putting their own twist on this wardrobe classic, such as this asymmetric short design from Marks & Spencer. Perfect for wearing with jeans or a skirt, and not a bit boring.Rugby shirtView image in fullscreenStriped cotton rugby shirt£130 at Gant£130 at NextThanks to their thick cotton, long sleeves and “poppable” collars, traditional rugby shirts are a great choice at this time of year.

Just make sure to spray it withfabric protectorfirst; it’s bound to drizzle on its first trip out.A rain ponchoView image in fullscreenSmiley rain poncho£69 at RainkissI recently spent one of the soggiest weekends of my life at End of the Road festival, and these kinds of ponchos were everywhere. It struck me as a smart choice, and ideal for this time of year, when downpours seem to be frequent and quite dramatic. You can pop them over everything, including your bag, and stay dry enough that when the sun shines again, you can simply whip it off and pretend it never happened. Great for cycling, too.Knit poloView image in fullscreenMerino wool polo top£75 at Cos£75 at H&MThis is ideal for channelling Meg Ryan in You’ve Got Mail, whose shoulder-season wardrobe is a thing of beauty. She’d probably pair this with a pleated skirt and sensible shoes, but it would also look great with track pants, cargo trousers or jeans on the weekend, or pinstripe trousers to add a bit of workday direction. I’d also team this with shorts –Adidas three-stripes, say – on a still-warm day.A party frock, with long sleevesView image in fullscreenLong-sleevemini dress£105 at Damson Madder£105 at AnthropologieJust because summer’s over, it doesn’t mean the party needs to be.

These Falke ones in beige and grey are wholesome in all the right ways; I love the blue too. Perfect with loafers, mules or Mary Janes. Otherwise, a pair of Heattech ones should keep feet toasty on chillier days – Uniqlo is the don of the genre.A tank topView image in fullscreenMerino wool tank top£155 at ToastA wool tank can seem like a real flash-in-the-pan garment: too hot for summer, too chilly for autumn. But that needn’t be the case if you wear it flexibly either over a top, or under a chunky cardigan. For this time of year, a T-shirt or blouse underneath should keep you from overheating.An aside:the website of the very lovely, very pricey Spanish knitwear brand Babaàis often a brilliant source of knitwear layering inspiration.Back-to-school shoesView image in fullscreenLeather Weejuns shoes£100 at GH BassAfter a summer in flimsy sandals that make your feet slap the pavement, it can be tempting to leap straight for a firm, chunky boot when the weather gets cooler.

Now the star of Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film is creating a buzz in HollywoodThu 18 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 14.03 EDTShareTeyana Taylor is – as she often says to interviewers – the entertainment equivalent of “a Glade plug-in” air freshener: put her in “any socket” and she will make “every room smell good”. And, at 34, she has the CV to prove it. After kicking off her career at 15 as a choreographer for Beyoncé (she later showcased her own moves to millions in the headline-grabbing video for Kanye West’s 2016 single Fade), the New York native began making her own critically acclaimed, cutting-edge R&B. She has also acted in a slew of movies and TV shows – including an award-winning turn as a mother who kidnaps her son from the care system in 2023’sA Thousand and One– and worked as a creative director for brands and a host of other musicians.But Taylor also likens herself to another household item. “I am a sponge,” she says. “I’m never above being a student.” This was especially true on the set of her latest project, Paul Thomas Anderson’s vigilante group caper One Battle After Another. Observing castmates including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro – plus the director himself (to many, the greatest of his generation) – turned her into “SpongeBob SquarePants. I get to have my notebook and take all these notes and soak everything in.”Having seen her in action as the film’s swaggering, libidinous revolutionary Perfidia Beverly Hills, it is extremely difficult to imagine Taylor hunched in the corner between takes, scribbling down acting tips. On screen, she is absolutely cocksure, whether demanding fellow vigilante Ghetto Pat (DiCaprio) have sex with her on a car bonnet in the two minutes before the bomb they’ve just planted explodes, instructing Penn’s Colonel Lockjaw at gunpoint to get an erection, or firing off rounds with a machine gun resting on her heavily pregnant stomach before proclaiming: “Bitch! I felt like Tony Montana!”That priceless line was Taylor’s own. Anderson, she says, would frequently ask her to “do that thing that you do”, which meant “stop worrying about your lines” and “add my extra little spice to it”. Anderson had been impressed by her performance in A Thousand and One, she says. He ran the idea of casting her by DiCaprio, “knowing that me and Leo is cool” (the pair became pals after meeting a few years ago at Diana Ross’s birthday party). The punt paid off: the film’s first act relies almost entirely on Taylor’s ability to channel an alarming maelstrom of lust, fury, recklessness and righteousness in a crop top and cargo pants. She pulls it off with aplomb.When we speak, Taylor is in her hotel room in LA; One Battle After Another had its premiere in the city a couple of days earlier, generating instant Oscar buzz. Steven Spielberg describing it as “insane” and “really incredible” certainly helped. Taylor is thrilled: “That means he knows who I am, he knows what I look like!” she says with hushed disbelief.Soon, many more will know. One Battle After Another is likely to be one of the season’s biggest blockbusters – the car chases alone are worth the price of admission – but as you’d expect from Anderson, whose eclectic oeuvre includes Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood and Phantom Thread, this is by no means standard Hollywood fare. Loosely based on Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel Vineland, it combines political satire, stoner comedy, social realism and slick heist-film styling to chronicle the activities of the French 75, a fictional revolutionary gang who liberate immigration camps and rob banks for funds, before fast-forwarding 16 years to the moment when Perfidia’s daughter is kidnapped.View image in fullscreen‘I was always in go mode’ … Taylor performing in 2021.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty ImagesAs a protagonist, Perfidia is morally ambivalent, to put it mildly (the clue’s in the name), and it is her relationship with Penn’s brutal yet pathetic wannabe white supremacist that triggers the action. “I think she’s badass, I think she’s complex, I think she’s selfish,” is Taylor’s take on Perfidia. What about her baffling dalliance with Lockjaw? She lets out a short laugh. “I mean … that is so toxic. Was it manipulation, or was it just lust, or was it her falling for the bad guy? You never really know with Perfidia,” she says, sounding a little confounded.Perfidia’s other big, bewildering decision is to walk out on her baby and resume her violent activism, informing a horrified Pat: “I put myself first and reject your lack of originality.” It’s not the easiest move to empathise with, and Taylor, who has two daughters with her basketball player ex-husband Iman Shumpert, struggled to act it out. “It was one of the most difficult scenes for me to film without getting emotional. Just imagining myself walking out on my child, that’s a lot. Me personally, in real life, I wouldn’t do that.”Yet like Perfidia – who is clearly at a low ebb after giving birth – Taylor also struggled with her mental health in early motherhood. “I’ve been in survival mode before, I’ve dealt with postpartum depression. I know what it feels like to not receive grace and compassion [when you are] categorised as strong. Especially for black women, it’s just like: you’re a strong black woman. What does that even mean? Just because I’m strong doesn’t mean I don’t have moments of weakness, or moments of needing to feel heard and seen.” She commends Anderson “so much for spreading awareness” of postpartum depression.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve been in survival mode before’ … Taylor and Leonardo DiCaprio in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros PicturesUnlike the film’s bomb-dispensing, gun-toting vigilante, Taylor has been able to incorporate motherhood into her work. In 2020, she announced her retirement from music, having felt hemmed in by the industry (“thrown in a box where music is everything, you can’t do nothing else – and that’s not me”), only to return this August with a new collection of sultry R&B co-released by her own label. Escape Room, which deals with Taylor’s divorce, ends with a congratulatory message from her nine-year-old (“The world loves you so much / Thank you for coming back to music and back to you”). When she first heard her daughter’s words, Taylor “broke down. Her emotional intelligence is out of this world,” she says, describing her relationship with her children as “the purest form of love”.Both Taylor’s daughters – her youngest is five – already remind her of herself as a child (“Oh my God, this is what I was doing when I was five, this is what I was doing when I was nine”), but she wants them to keep their options open. “I’m not the parent who is like: ‘I did this so you have to do this too.’ So right now they’re in ballet, they do basketball, they dance, they sing, my youngest is a fashionista. At one point my daughter wanted to play drums. I got her a drum set. At another point she wanted to be a chef; OK, here’s the tools you need. They want to be a janitor? Here’s a broom.”View image in fullscreen‘As a 15-year-old, I had the opportunity to be around some of the most creative people in the industry’ … Taylor at the Met Gala in 2025.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesTaylor, on the other hand, always knew she wanted to be in show business. She describes her younger self as “a character. I was a bossy little thing, I always wanted to direct something.” Yet her experience was limited to singing and dancing around her local neighbourhood, “and Harlem is small”. Things changed abruptly in her mid-teens. “One of my mom’s good friends worked at Universal [Music] and I remember skateboarding back home and I ran into him on the block. He stopped me and was like: ‘Listen, you’re talented, you’re fly, I want you to meet my boss and I want you to sing to him.” When the record executive in question asked who she admired, she saidPharrell Williams. “And it’s so crazy, because the guy happened to be really close with Pharrell. So I met Pharrell and got signed on the spot [to his label] and everything happened from there.”It was a fairytale beginning – she released her first single, Google Me, at 17 – but Taylor never got swept up in the fantasy of overnight fame. “It was surreal, but I was always in go mode – I never got lost on that. I’m from Harlem, I’m a hustler, I’m a grinder. I’ve always been this little businesswoman.”Taylor spent the rest of her teens and early 20s as a protege, first for Williams, thenKanye West, whose label she signed to in 2012. She didn’t mind the dynamic. “I was their artist but we built an adult friendship and respect for each other in the fashion space as well. That’s how me and Ye got cool, we were fashion friends,” she says. “Being able to have those men in my life has really shaped me: imagine this 15-year-old girl already having this mind full of creativity and then have the opportunity to be around some of the most creative people in the industry. That’s a cheat sheet right there.”One Battle After Another review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caperRead moreYet in some ways her success has been a slow-burn: two decades on from that street-corner collision, it finally feels as if Taylor is taking off. Soon, she’ll star in Ryan Murphy’s hotly anticipated legal drama All’s Fair alongside Kim Kardashian, and in Kevin Hart’s action thriller 72 Hours. She’s also been hand-picked by Dionne Warwick to play her in a biopic. Next year she will direct her first feature film, about a New York dance crew.“As people we fly a plane,” she says. “And that air may be turbulent. The runway might be too crowded so you got to circle around for a few minutes. You might have an emergency landing. But ultimately the goal is to make it to the destination.” Taylor’s love of a career-based metaphor may know no bounds, but her combination of swagger and conscientiousness is infectious. Musician, actor, dancer, director, air freshener, sponge, pilot: Teyana Taylor can be anything she sets her mind to.One Battle After Another is released on 25 September in Australia, and on 26 September in the UK and USExplore more on these topicsFilmR&BPharrell WilliamsKanye WestFilm adaptationsPaul Thomas AndersonPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIn the 1970s, the radical leftwing German terrorist organisation may have spread fear through public acts of violence – but its inner workings were characterised by vanity and incompetenceByJason BurkeThu 18 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 06.44 EDTShareIn the summer of 1970, a group of aspirant revolutionaries arrived in Jordan from WestGermany. They sought military training though they had barely handled weapons before. They sought a guerrilla war in the streets of Europe, but had never done anything more than light a fire in a deserted department store. They sought the spurious glamour that spending time with a Palestinian armed group could confer. Above all, they sought a safe place where they could hide and plan.Some of the group had flown to Beirut on a direct flight from communist-run East Berlin. The better known members – Ulrike Meinhof, a prominent leftwing journalist, and two convicted arsonists called Gudrun Ensslin and Andreas Baader – had faced a more complicated journey. First, they’d had to cross into East Germany, then they took a train to Prague, where they boarded a plane to Lebanon. From Beirut, a taxi took them east across the mountains into Syria. Finally, they drove south from Damascus into Jordan.They were not the first such visitors. Among the broad coalition of activists and protest groups known as the New Left, commitment to the Palestinian cause had become a test of one’s ideological credentials. Israel was no longer seen as a beleaguered outpost of progressive values surrounded by despotic regimes dedicated to its destruction. After its victory in the 1967 war and subsequent occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, Israel was now frequently described by leftists as a bellicose outpost of imperialism, capitalism and colonialism. At the same time, many intellectuals on the left had come to believe that the radical transformation they longed for would never begin inEurope, where the proletariat appeared more interested in foreign holidays and saving up for fridges or cars than manning the barricades. Instead, they believed, the coming revolution would originate in Asia or Africa or Latin America, where the masses were ready to rise up and fight.The question was where to go. Unlike in Vietnam or Latin America, the Palestinian cause was one where direct involvement was both feasible and relatively risk-free. The Middle East was only a short flight or a cheap bus and boat trip away, and until the autumn of 1970, the worst that could be expected when one returned home would be some slightly difficult questions at border control.So they came, and in increasing numbers. A single camp north of Amman run by Fatah, the largest of the Palestinian armed factions that were active at the time, welcomed between 150 and 200 young volunteers in 1969 and 1970. The biggest contingent was British, though most western European countries were represented, along with some eastern Europeans and several Indians. These were an ideologically eclectic bunch. When in February 1970 the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the smaller armed factions, offered training and instruction to any “revolutionary and progressive forces” who wanted to build a “world front against imperialism, Zionism and reaction”, about 50 “militant Maoists, Trotskyites and members of … an extreme leftwing group in France” responded, according to the FBI. Most merely toured refugee camps, worked on farms, helped dig trenches and assisted at clinics. Some fired a few rounds from a Kalashnikov. Then “they picked up their [keffiyeh] headdress, several volumes of Palestinian poetry and went home souvenired and sun-tanned”, in the words of one foreign correspondent.The group that arrived in Amman from West Berlin in June 1970 was an odd assortment of violent activists, polemicists, self-publicists, adventurers and intellectuals. Their leader, though not the loudest or best-known among them, was Gudrun Ensslin, the 30-year-old daughter of a Protestant pastor. Tall, fair and serious, she had been brought up in a small village in an environment of strict moralism. There was no sign of any rebellion in her youthful years, only of a fierce intelligence. She won a scholarship to Berlin’s Free University to study for a doctorate in literature. She campaigned for the moderately leftwing Social Democrat party (SPD) in elections in 1965 and, like many others, felt deeply betrayed when the party entered government in coalition with conservatives the following year.A turning point for Ensslin came in June 1967, when Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran and a staunch US ally, visited West Germany, sparking major protests. The shah’s security men attacked the demonstrators in West Berlin and a local policeman shot dead a student. Immediately afterwards Ensslin told fellow activists that it was impossible to reason with “the generation that made Auschwitz” and that only violence could halt a government set on establishing a new authoritarian regime.As protests intensified across West Germany, Ensslin reached a moment of crisis. She left her infant son and his father, a fellow literature student, and dived deep into the world of radical activism in West Berlin. There, among the drifters, pranksters, runaways, petty criminals, draft dodgers, potheads, avant garde artists and the occasional ideologue who made the city such an exciting, anarchic place, she met Andreas Baader, with whom she fell in love.View image in fullscreenFamilies demonstrate at Berlin’s Tempelhof airport against the war in Vietnam, with Gudrun Ensslin, centre, July 1967.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyBaader was 24 years old. His father had disappeared on the Russian front during the second world war and Baader had grown up surrounded by bereaved women. A first brush with the police when he was nine was followed by expulsion from a series of educational establishments and a short time at art school. Formal study of any kind bored Baader; he was briefly involved in experimental “action-theatre”. He was, a friend said, “a Marlon Brando type”.Spoiled, arrogant and lazy but with a brooding, scruffy charm, Baader appealed to women, and some men too. He dressed fashionably and expensively, posed for erotic pictures for a gay men’s magazine, and occasionally wore makeup. Fast cars held a powerful appeal though obtaining a driving licence did not, resulting in a string of convictions for traffic offences. Baader was uninterested in politics and unmoved by progressive causes. He was attracted to Berlin primarily because residence there meant exemption from military service.Many Berlin activists found Baader profoundly irritating. One described him as “impossible to talk to”, prone to sulking, a bully and a braggart. In April 1968, an accidental fire in a department store in Brussels killed more than 250 people. Baader boasted of his intention to bring about a similar conflagration, but it was Ensslin who organised a car, obtained the necessary equipment and selected a multistorey department store in Frankfurt as their target. After the attack, which caused substantial damage but no loss of life, she and Baader headed to a well-known leftist bar to celebrate loudly. This was an error. So too was leaving bomb components in the car and a list of ingredients in a coat pocket.The mistakes made by Ensslin and Baader in Frankfurt led to their arrest within 36 hours. In October 1968, after six months in custody, they faced trial. In court, Ensslin, wearing a red leather jacket, waved a copy of Mao’s Little Red Book and claimed that the arson had been a protest against the failure of the German people to react to the horrors of the Vietnam war. Baader, wearing dark glasses, a T-shirt and Mao jacket, smoked a Cuban cigar in the dock and described students in Germany as the country’s equivalent of oppressed Black Americans. They each received three-year prison sentences but were released eight months later pending appeal.A condition of their provisional liberty was that they devote it to worthy social causes, so the following months were spent working with teenagers in institutions in Frankfurt. Ensslin organised sessions to discuss Mao. Baader appropriated the youths’ financial allowance, took them to bars, drank and lectured them about the coming revolution.When they heard that their appeal had been rejected, Baader and Ensslin fled rather than return to prison. They drove west to Paris where they stayed in the spectacular apartment of a radical French writer, enjoyed some lavish restaurant meals and photographed each other in cafes. When, after several weeks, the city’s charms palled, the couple drove to Italy. In Milan, Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, the wealthy leftwing publisher, welcomed them to his home and laid out his collection of guns for their admiration. There were long conversations about the forthcoming armed struggle. When their car was stolen, Baader broke into an Alfa Romeo which they drove back to Berlin. In need of somewhere to stay, they sought out the journalist Ulrike Meinhof, whom they had met when she had reported on their trial.View image in fullscreenAndreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin in 1968.Photograph: APMeinhof was almost a decade older than both. She had grown up in a small, conservative town in north-west Germany, a conscientious, mature, religious and idealistic young woman who won a scholarship for exceptionally gifted students to study pedagogy and psychology at university. She campaigned against the stationing of nuclear weapons in West Germany, joined the youth organisation of the Social Democratic party, listened to jazz and smoked a pipe.At this time she began to publish articles in student magazines. Her opinions were radical but not extreme; her arguments structured and well researched. She was soon writing regularly for Konkret, a leftwing magazine of culture and politics based in Hamburg. In 1961, she married Konkret’s publisher and gave birth to twin girls a year later. Over the following years, Meinhof’s journalism earned her respect, a good income, a few lawsuits and a new status as an unofficial spokesperson for the emerging protest movement in West Germany. She made frequent appearances on television and radio. A slightly smitten British correspondent interviewed her at home in Hamburg, and described “a nervous, pretty woman with two blond little girls rolling round her feet” who sadly confessed that other more militant activists dismissed her as a “peace-loving pancake”.But Meinhof was not happy. For many years, she and her publisher husband had been part of the local liberal social elite, invited to dances and dinner parties and spending their weekends at a fashionable coastal resort of Kampen, on the island of Sylt in the North Sea. This lifestyle filled her with unease. “Our house, the parties, Kampen, all of that is only partly enjoyable … TV appearances, contacts, the attention I get … I find it pleasant, but it doesn’t satisfy my need for warmth, solidarity, belonging to a group,” she wrote in her diary.Luckily for Ensslin and Baader, Meinhof eventually resolved the tension between her deepening ideological commitment and her lifestyle. In late 1967 she had divorced her unapologetically unfaithful husband and moved with her daughters to Berlin, where her apartment became a meeting place for activists, writers, students and young people on the run. When the two fugitive arsonists knocked on her door on their return from Italy, she agreed to let them stay.By 1969, Meinhof’s relatively moderate views had become more extreme, the language harsher, the arguments more direct. She was very busy, lecturing while also working hard on an investigation into young female runaways in state institutions, writing late into the night and early morning. Interviewers found her tense and angry, her already deep voice made harsh by chain smoking.“Protest is when I say I don’t like this. Resistance is when I put an end to what I don’t like. Protest is when I say I refuse to go along with this any more. Resistance is when I make sure everybody else stops going along too,” she wrote, in what would be one of her last columns in Konkret in April 1969.Ensslin and Baader lived with Meinhof for several weeks, an intense experience for everyone concerned. Meinhof’s daughters liked Ensslin, who played with them, but disliked Baader, who laughed when they hurt themselves. After a couple of months the guests moved on, but Meinhof was still unhappy. When Meinhof’s new partner proposed a Christmas tree, she accused him of bourgeois sentimentality and banned presents or any celebrations. Her daughters frequently missed school. Meinhof told collaborators she couldn’t see the point of journalism any more, but also railed against the restrictions imposed on her by motherhood.When Baader was re-arrested, driving a stolen car with false papers, and returned behind bars to serve out the rest of his sentence, Ensslin asked Meinhof to help her lover escape. The journalist agreed to write letters to the governor of the prison describing a book project that she was to undertake with Baader and so obtained permission for him to join her for research in a Berlin library. At about 10am on 14 May 1970, shortly after Meinhof and the prisoner had settled down with cigarettes and instant coffee in the reading room of the Institute of Social Issues, two women gained entry, then let in a man armed with a Beretta pistol, then Ensslin. Together, they overpowered the two armed prison guards with teargas and shot an elderly member of staff. Baader jumped from a first-floor window on to the institute’s well-tended lawn and ran. Meinhof faced a split-second decision: stay where she was, pretend to have been duped by Ensslin and so return to her writing, activism and children. Or follow Baader and the others and exchange all this for an uncertain and dangerous life as a wanted criminal on the run.View image in fullscreenFirefighters assess the damage on the burnt-out fourth floor of a Frankfurt department store after an arson attack in 1968.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyA stolen Alfa Romeo sports car had been prepared for their getaway – later found by police with a teargas gun and an introduction to Marx’s Das Kapital inside – but the bloodshed during the raid required a change of plan: now they would need to get further away than a single tank of petrol would take them. To complicate matters even more, Meinhof had chosen to follow Baader through the window and they now had a well-known public figure among them. Meinhof had no support network or false papers, and was encumbered by family commitments. One of the first things she did as a fugitive was to call a friend to arrange for her daughters to be picked up from school.The obvious solution was to leave West Germany, and ideally Europe too. Ensslin was in touch with the representative of Fatah in West Berlin who was able to organise a hurried departure. Clutching forged passports and amateurishly disguised with wigs and makeup, they assembled at Berlin’s Friedrichstrasse station just over three weeks after Baader’s escape and set out for the Middle East.After the chaos and excitement of the journey from West Berlin, Amman initially proved something of a disappointment. Their Fatah hosts had set up the standard itinerary offered to such visitors, but Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof and the half-dozen others who had accompanied them were not particularly interested in viewing clinics, villages and refugee camps. They had not come as tourists, they told their hosts, they wanted instruction in guerrilla warfare.Despite some misgivings, a senior Fatah official called Abu Hassan agreed to their request and sent the group to a training camp in the hills outside the Jordanian capital. Its two stone buildings, shooting range, dirt exercise yard and threadbare tents were guarded by Palestinian fighters and ringed by barbed wire fences. The trainees were issued Kalashnikovs, a rare honour.The following weeks could not be described as an unqualified success. Fatah instructors taught the Germans how to build incendiary bombs and other explosive devices, as well as how to rob a bank. But none of the volunteers was physically fit or knew anything about guns or explosives. When they had launched the operation to free their leader a month earlier, they had been obliged to hire an experienced criminal to carry the one lethal weapon and at least one of their number had vomited from nerves. Baader now refused to give up his tight velvet trousers even on an assault course, and Meinhof struggled with the physically demanding aspects of their training.Almost immediately there was a series of fierce disagreements between the Germans and the middle-aged Algerian who ran the camp, a veteran of the independence struggle against the French. The first of these was about Ensslin and Baader’s insistence that they be allowed to sleep together, which was unheard of in the conservative environment of Fatah’s training camps. The visitors complained about the diet. Then the women insisted on sunbathing either nude or topless, which provoked further outrage.View image in fullscreenUlrike Meinhof giving a press conference in the Republican Club in Hamburg.Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty ImagesA limit was placed on the ammunition that trainees could expend after they fired off hundreds of precious rounds with apparent abandon, and Baader, who frequently refused to follow orders, led the trainees in protest. Abu Hassan returned to calm tempers once again, but just when peace had been restored and a chicken slaughtered and cooked in his honour, Baader complained that it was unfair and “unrevolutionary” that a leader might receive better food than ordinary foot soldiers.Such tensions and mutual incomprehension were to be expected. Almost none of the visitors spoke Arabic and very few had travelled in the Middle East, or even overseas, before. For all their sympathy for the Palestinians’ grievances and enthusiasm for their cause, the European volunteers were profoundly ignorant of the society, history and culture of their hosts. A Fatah official later remembered that their guests’ interest in the Palestinian cause appeared “very recent indeed”. A group of British International Socialists smuggled alcohol into one training camp, got drunk, held an impromptu sing-song and then got into a fight, first with a group of British Maoists then with the guards who tried to confiscate their remaining bottles. Another group of volunteers refused to join in with the trainees digging trenches, only to leap into those very holes when an Israeli jet flew low over the camp.The group that Baader, Ensslin and Meinhof had led to Jordan was particularly vexatious. In early August, after seven weeks in Jordan, Baader provoked another argument by demanding to be treated as a militant commander equal in status to Abu Hassan, who was a senior intelligence official and a protege of Fatah’s founder and leader, Yasser Arafat. Shortly afterwards, Ensslin demanded that the Palestinians execute a member of her own group whom she suspected of being an Israeli spy, largely because he had listened to a Hebrew-language broadcast on a transistor radio. Abu Hassan’s polite refusal led to a new confrontation. This time Baader, Ensslin and the others were told that arrangements would be made for their swift return home.Three days before they had left Berlin, the half-dozen young men and women who had been involved in Baader’s escape had issued a communique, printed in a leftist magazine. It promised a campaign of violence to bring the latent conflict in Germany into the open and promised to “start [in Germany] what has already started in Vietnam, Palestine, Guatemala, in Oakland and Watts, in Cuba and China, in Angola and New York”. The statement did not attempt to explain the group’s actions “to the intellectual windbags, the know-it-alls and the shitting- in-their-pants brigade”, nor to the “petit bourgeois intellectuals” or “lefty ass-kissers”. Instead, its message was meant for the “potentially revolutionary segment of the population”: the underpaid workers, the teenage girls in institutions, the boys in care homes, the factory workers, the families on the housing projects, the labourers and apprentices, all those who were “exploited but receive no compensation in the form of good living standards, consumption, loans, automobiles”.The statement, probably written by Meinhof though signed by Ensslin, appeared under an image of a leaping black panther that was clearly inspired by the US activists they most admired. It ended with a series of lapidary exhortations: “Don’t go meekly off to slaughter … The end of the rule of the pigs is in sight! … Develop the class struggle. Organise the proletariat. Start the armed resistance.” The statement was titled: “It is time to build up the Red Army Faction.”But launching an armed struggle in Germany proved more difficult than Ensslin, Baader and Meinhof anticipated. The name they had chosen for their group reflected their belief that theirs was merely one of many efforts worldwide that would collectively bring about the downfall of capitalist, imperialist states such as the US and West Germany. But the reality was that some parts of the world were significantly more receptive to revolution than others. By the late spring of 1971, the group had been back in Germany for eight months, and yet had little to show for its efforts beyond a dozen or so bank robberies.In reality, life for Red Army Faction (RAF) members was mainly dull, stressful and frustrating, punctuated by infrequent moments of fear or great excitement. “You join the urban guerrillas and then you find yourself spending a month fixing up an apartment, and there’s always shopping to be done, things that are needed. That’s 99% of what goes on,” one remembered later. Another described tedious hours spent encoding and decoding addresses and messages. Errors could have serious consequences, though. Meinhof miswrote an address after she and three other RAF members broke into a town hall to steal blank identity cards and all the precious documents were sent to the wrong location and lost. Funds often ran low. Meinhof’s wealthy leftwing friends donated money and offered their weekend homes as temporary hideouts, but food was sometimes scarce and safe houses could be uncomfortable and cold.Their camaraderie helped ease the discomfort. “They debated, laughed, and joked with one another … They all loved Donald Duck comic books and read them together, laughing like children. Andreas and Gudrun often fooled around, giggling like teenagers. If four or five of them were there, and they had time, they cooked together,” wrote Margrit Schiller, a young recruit. She had never met people like Baader, Meinhof and Ensslin before. “Their political discussions, the way they handled weapons, their jokes, how they spoke to and treated one another. They seemed to be connected, to be on the same wavelength, almost as if they shared one mind.”Music and film provided diversion, too. Meinhof was ashamed of her fondness for the music of Rod Stewart. Baader had no such qualms about his taste in film, modelling himself on the anti-heroes of contemporary gangster films and wearing a trenchcoat and hat in imitation of the leading men of the nouvelle vague. In Jordan, when Ensslin had decided one of their group was a spy, Baader initially proposed that he, she and Meinhof shoot the suspect from different directions so no one would know who had fired the fatal shot. He drew the idea from a spaghetti western. A triple bank robbery was inspired by Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1966 film, The Battle of Algiers.The RAF stole many vehicles, but the small, fast BMW 2002 was such a favourite that owners across Germany placed stickers on their windscreens saying “I am not a member of the RAF” and joked that BMW actually stood for Baader Meinhof Wagen. Baader preferred top-of-the-range sports cars. In the autumn of 1971, he crashed a stolen Porsche 911 at more than 100mph on an autobahn, emerging from the wrecked vehicle without a scratch.View image in fullscreenPolice check a car after the gang’s bomb attempts in 1972.Photograph: Keystone Press/AlamyEnsslin tolerated her lover’s behaviour but was deeply irritated by her male comrades’ tendency to be more interested in sex than overthrowing capitalism. During a visit to the famous Kommune 2 in Berlin in the summer of 1971, she upbraided a leading local activist for “chasing round apartments, fucking little girls, smoking hashish”, angrily telling him that such activities were a distraction from the serious work of the armed struggle.In October 1971, the RAF committed its first murder. Two members in Hamburg shot a police officer who was attempting to arrest a third. The killing was barely discussed within the group, but it marked the start of a new and more violent phase of activity. A second policeman was killed during yet another bank robbery, then a third. Authorities responded with a series of vast dragnets that met with little success but did hinder the group’s ability to move freely.Eight months later, in April 1972, the RAF’s leaders decided that the moment had come to launch the blow that would, by provoking massive repression and revealing the “fascist” nature of the German state, definitively rupture the “false consciousness” of the working classes and so create the conditions for revolution. As ever, quite how to do this was unclear. When it was reported in the news that the US air force, engaged for several weeks in a massive bombing campaign in North Vietnam, had dropped mines to block the country’s principal port, Ensslin suggested bombing the numerous US military installations in West Germany in response. Baader’s response was typically unconsidered: “Let’s go then.”View image in fullscreenA police van drives by the lighted barbed wire fence of the Stuttgart-Stammheim maximum-security prison  1975.Photograph: APThe first target of this new campaign was the sprawling US base outside Frankfurt. The bomb they planted demolished part of the officers’ mess, killing an officer. They then released a communique. Written by Meinhof, it ended with Che Guevara’s call for revolutionaries worldwide to create “two, three, many Vietnams”. The RAF’s next effort wounded five at a police headquarters in Augsburg, and was swiftly followed by an abortive attempt to kill a federal judge. After a brief pause, a bomb was planted at the head office of the conservative newspaper group Springer, long a focus of antipathy among the German left. Their warning was ignored, and when the bomb exploded it injured dozens.Surprised by the public disgust this prompted, Baader telephoned Meinhof, who had overseen the attack, to berate her for her “stupidity” and ordered the group to revert to military targets. On 24 May the group stole two cars, placed a bomb in each with a timing device and drove them into the headquarters of the US army in Europe at Heidelberg. This attack killed three soldiers. Meinhof once more issued a statement, equating the US air offensive in Vietnam with the Allied bombing of Germany during the second world war, and saying that its further intensification would be “genocide, the final solution, Auschwitz”. Then, with its stock of pipebombs and its appetite for violence momentarily exhausted, the RAF rested.Some days after the attack in Heidelberg, police in Frankfurt were told by a resident about a garage on the outskirts of the city where men arrived at odd times of the day and night to work with some kind of powder stored in large sacks. Very early on the morning of 1 June, police officers hiding nearby watched a Porsche Targa drive the wrong way up a one-way street and come to a stop. Baader and Holger Meins, a former art student and film-maker who was close to the principal leaders of the RAF, got out and went to the garage. Police moved in.Meins eventually gave himself up when an armoured car was deployed, but Baader continued to shout abuse and shoot until he was hit in the thigh by a police sniper. TV footage showed him being carried on a stretcher to a police van, grimacing in pain, his dark hair dyed a lurid shade of orange. In the garage, police found explosives and a silver-grey ISO Rivolta, one of the most expensive and rare sports cars in Europe, stolen by Baader some weeks before.View image in fullscreenAndreas Baader being led away after his arrest.Photograph: ullstein bild Dtl./ullstein bild/Getty ImagesAuthorities now set about rounding up the rest of the group. The next RAF leader to be caught was Ensslin, who was arrested in a high street store in Hamburg after leaving a coat with a revolver in its pocket outside a fitting room as she tried on some sweaters. A shop assistant noted its weight, checked the pockets, found the gun and called the police. “I am glad that the hunt is now over,” her father told journalists.That left Meinhof still at liberty. But the violence of the previous weeks had alienated – or at least scared – many who had once been sympathetic to the RAF. Twelve days after the arrest of Baader, when a young teacher in Hanover was asked by an intermediary if he would allow two unidentified people to stay the night, he hesitated, spoke to his girlfriend, and made a phone call. When the police arrived they found a poster of Guevara on the sitting room wall, bags containing guns and a bomb, and Meinhof, underweight and exhausted, who offered no resistance whatsoever. The revolutionary campaign of the RAF’s first generation, as they would become known, was over.With the founder members in jail, a new generation of RAF members moved to the forefront. Though still nominally committed to global revolution, their only real goal was to liberate their leaders. In this, they were unsuccessful. In 1976 Meinhof, who had suffered weeks of solitary confinement and sensory deprivation, killed herself in her cell in Stammheim high security prison. In the months before she died, the former journalist had been bitterly and repeatedly criticised by Ensslin and Baader in statements circulated among RAF prisoners and followers.A year later, after the two remaining leaders had given an ultimatum to their followers to free them before they made their own desperate efforts to break out, the group launched a campaign of spectacular violence. It climaxed with the abduction of one of the country’s best-known industrialists and then, when the government of Helmut Schmidt refused to make any concessions, the hijacking of a Lufthansa passenger jet in Mallorca, which was eventually flown to Somalia. This final effort ended when a team of West German police commandos stormed the plane, killing three of the four attackers and freeing the hostages without loss. When they heard the news on a clandestine radio system rigged in their cells, Ensslin and Baader killed themselves.The myth of the ‘lone wolf’ terroristRead moreIn Baghdad, a temporary base, a dozen or so RAF members gathered in shock in the offices of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which had carried out the hijacking on the group’s behalf. Many wept, others made wild and entirely unrealistic plans for revenge. Brigitte Mohnhaupt, the uncompromising 28-year-old former philosophy student who now took over the leadership of the RAF, did neither. The suicides were “eine Aktion” – an operation – she insisted. “They were not victims and never were,” Mohnhaupt told the others. “You don’t get made a victim, you have to make yourself a victim. They were in charge of their own situation until the last minute. What does this mean? They did it to themselves, not that it was done to them.

In the first of a two-part series, our panelists recommend ways it can save itselfOur second group of panelists – including Rory Stewart and Shaista Aziz – will have their say tomorrowThu 18 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 09.18 EDTShareThree words – build social housingJohn HarrisGuardian columnistThere is no way we can reduce Britain’s sense of malaise and its febrile public mood down to a simple set of problems – nor should progressives fall into the trap of assuming rightwing sentiment about asylum and immigration can be reduced to supposed bread-and-butter economic issues. But in my experience, one particular issue really does sit at the heart of the UK’s sense of bitter disaffection: social housing, and ourdire lack of it.With good reason, Keir Starmer often rhapsodises about the wonders of home ownership. But putting down a deposit and getting a mortgage remains way beyond many people’s reach, not least at the younger end of the age range. Average rents for new private tenancies, meanwhile, are about 20% more expensive than three years ago. And one stark insistence continues to haunt our politics: the housing charity Shelter’s spot-onclaimthat we need to build 90,000 new social homes a year to convincingly tackle a crisis that will not go away.Whenever I am out reporting, all this is self-evident. In most cities and towns (and, it has to be said, the kind of former Labour heartlands where people are now supporting Reform), a couple of hours of street-level conversations will always bring out people’s desperate yearning for the kind of secure, dependable living arrangements that define happy lives – not least, where relevant, for their children and grandchildren. So why does it still feel like this Labour government is so painfully dragging its feet?As the early Starmer promise of building 1.5 million new homes by the time of the next election starts to look depressingly fragile, there are rays of light: one of the legacies of Angela Rayner’s time in the cabinet is a £39bn social and affordable housingprogrammethat ministers say will deliver at least 180,000 homes for social rentby 2035. That is progress, undoubtedly: it represents a six-fold increase on the number built in the decade to 2024. But note the inescapable meaning of those numbers: notwithstanding this country’s miserable recent policy record, the target amounts to 18,000 a year, which falls far short of the scale of the problem and the speed at which it ought to be tackled.Given the political emergency it faces, is quicker and more thoroughgoing building really beyond the government’s reach? Given the number of Labour local authorities, could it not use the party’s on-the-ground expertise to spark a council housing revival? And if “delivery” is how Starmer and his colleagues intend to tackle Nigel Farage, isn’t this by far the best example?A more ambitious, smarter government would already have started to set aside hundreds of local sites, trumpeted the fact that change was on its way, and contrasted such a clear promise with the empty bluster we tend to hear from the new right. Who knows: it might even have draped the relevant plots with union jacks, and hailed what was afoot as a genuine example of progressive patriotism. Instead, it is still leaving space for the most cynical and opportunistic politicians to tell people that nothing is going to get better, and be believed. Returning to one of Labour’s proudest traditions is surely the best way out of that impasse, but time is fast running out.Control inflation!Ann PettiforAuthor of The Global Casino: How Wall St Gambles with People and PlanetRachel Reeves has my sympathy. The government confronts a national political revolt and a climate crisis while big institutions of the state – the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) – work against her and the interests of the British people. All of this contributes to the rise of Reform UK. My advice is to restore the government as a transformative, democratic “big green state”, rather than a technocratic managerial one serving private wealth. To “kickstart” the economy and restore ecological stability, use the power of Labour’s majority to rewire and restructure powerful institutions.One problem is that the Treasury is wedded to market fundamentalism and austerity, its staff incapable of understanding government debt will only fall when investment and economic activity recover from recent crises. It needs a national economic and environmental strategy, such as those that guide China and Singapore. In fact, Reeves should create a Department for National Strategy to lead public green infrastructure investment that will revive private investment in a weakened, risk-averse economy.The Bank uses its “independence” to protect and bail out private global financial markets. Its current policy ofquantitative tighteningundermines the government’s fiscal policy. High interest rates at a time of economic weakness serve the interests of wealth, increasing the cost of private and public borrowing while failing to quell inflation.The Bank lacks tools and legitimacy to tackle inflation. Labour should transfer that role to a new Inflation Control Office, which could use taxes, price controls and even rationing to lower inflation. Then Reeves should change the Bank’s mandate, radically: to support the economic policy of the government, not the City.The OBR reflects George Osborne’s attack on the democratic legitimacy of the state. Today, this one institution in effect determines fiscal policy. With a new remit the OBR must become the Office of Fiscal Transparency, subordinated to the new Department of National Strategy.Elected successors must alone be its mouthpiece.With the right institutional framework, Labour could begin to right the wrongs of its first year in power.The PM must summon the activist lawyer withinSimon WoolleyPrincipal of Homerton College, CambridgeLabour must reclaim the political and moral high ground on immigration. The stakes could not be higher: this is not only about the shape of our politics, but the soul of the nation.Immigration can and should be debated – there are conversations to be had about gangs who exploit vulnerable people and the minority who commit crime. But that debate must never collapse into hatred of those whose only “crime” is seeking refuge from war-torn countries such as Afghanistan.We are overdue a speech from the prime minister that speaks to the silent majority who reject division. Those words must carry a message of hope: that diversity is Britain’s greatest strength. He should remind us that at our most vulnerable, we are cared for by people from every background – many migrants, many poorly paid – whose compassion, not skin colour, defines them.Yet these truths will ring hollow unless Labour also invests in the communities – often white and working-class – abandoned after the collapse of industry. Into that vacuum step the snake-oil salesmen of nationalism, peddling false solutions. Starmer must summon the activist lawyer within him. Or else enough Britons will think: why accept an Enoch Powell-lite, when the real thing always lurks in the wings?Explore more on these topicsLabourThe panelKeir StarmerReform UKGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

Yet it poses a grave threatRobert ReichThe president won’t prevail in court. But his cases against media companies have a potential chilling effect on criticism of the governmentThu 18 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 15.12 EDTShareDonald Trump has sued theNew York Timesfor, well, reporting on Trump.Rather than charging theTimeswith any specific libelous act, Trump’s lawsuit is just another of his angry bloviations.The lawsuit says he’s moving against “one of the worst and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming a virtual ‘mouthpiece’ for the Radical Left Democrat Party”. And so on.At least he sued theWall Street Journal’s parent company for something specific: reporting Trump’s birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein (which Trump continues to deny is his, even though itshowed up in the Epstein filesreleased by a US House committee).Last year, Trump sued ABC and its host George Stephanopoulos for having said that Trump was found liable for rape rather than “sexual abuse” in the civil suit brought by E Jean Carroll. The network settled for $16m.Trump sued CBS for allegedly editing an interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes to make her sound more coherent. CBS also agreed to pay $16m.Defamation lawsuits are a longstanding part of Trump’s repertoire, which he first learned at the feet of Roy Cohn, one of America’s most notorious legal bullies.In the 1980s, Trump sued the Pulitzer-winning Chicago Tribune architecture critic Paul Gapp for $500m,for criticizingTrump’s plan to build the world’s tallest building in Manhattan, a 150-story tower that Gapp called “one of the silliest things anyone could inflict on New York or any other city”.Trump charged that Gapp had “virtually torpedoed” the project and subjected Trump to “public ridicule and contempt”. A judge dismissed the suit as involving protected opinion.But such lawsuits are far worse when a president sues. He’s no longer just an individual whose reputation can be harmed. He’s the head of the government of the United States. One of the cardinal responsibilities of the media in our democracy is to report on a president – and often criticize him.The legal standard for defamation of a public figure, established in the 1964 supreme court caseNew York TimesCo v Sullivan, requires that public officials who bring such suits prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.That case arose from a libel suit filed by LB Sullivan, the police commissioner of Montgomery, Alabama, against the New York Times for an advertisement in the paper that, despite being mostly true, contained factual errors concerning the mistreatment of civil rights demonstrators.The supreme court ruled in favor of the Times, finding that the ad was protected speech under the first amendment and that the higher standard of proof was necessary to protect robust debate on public affairs.Under this standard, there’s no chance Trump will prevail in his latest lawsuits against the Times or Wall Street Journal. Nor would he have won his lawsuits against ABC and CBS, had they gone to trial.But Trump hasn’t filed these lawsuits to win in court. He has sought wins in the court of public opinion. These lawsuits are aspects of his performative presidency.ABC’s and CBS’s settlements are viewed by Trump as vindications of his gripes with the networks.He’s likewise using his lawsuit against the New York Times to advertise his longstanding grievances with the paper.His lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal is probably intended to send a message to the Journal’s publisher, Rupert Murdoch, that Trump doesn’t want Murdoch to muck around in the Jeffrey Epstein case.These lawsuits also put the media on notice that Trump could mess up their businesses.Not only is it expensive to defend against them, requiring attorneys’ fees, inordinate time from senior executives, and efforts to defend the media’s brand and reputation. When a lawsuit comes from the president of the United States, who also has the power to damage a business by imposing regulations and prosecuting the corporation for any alleged wrongdoings, the potential costs can be even bigger.Which presumably is why CBS caved rather than litigated. Its parent company, Paramount, wanted to be able to sell it for some $8bn to Skydance, whose CEO is David Ellison (scion of the second-richest person in America, Oracle’s Larry Ellison). But Paramount first needed the approval of Trump’s Federal Communications Commission – which held up the sale until the defamation lawsuit was settled.Here we come to the central danger of Trump’s wanton use of personal defamation law. The mere possibility of its use – coupled with Trump’s other powers of retribution – have a potential chilling effect on media criticism of Trump.We don’t know how much criticism has been stifled to date, but it’s suggestive that a CBS News president and the executive producer of 60 Minutes resigned over CBS’s handling of the lawsuit and settlement, presumably because they felt that management was limiting their ability to fairly and freely cover Trump.Among the capitulations CBS’s owners made to the Trump administration was to hire an “ombudsman” to police the network against so-called bias – and the person they hired was Kenneth R Weinstein, the former president and chief executive of the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute thinktank.It’s also suggestive that CBS ended Stephen Colbert’s contract, despite the fact that Colbert’s show is the highest-rated late-night comedy show on television. He’s also one of the most trenchant critics of Trump.If we need any more evidence, on Wednesday ABCpulled off the airanother popular late-night critic of Trump – Jimmy Kimmel – because Kimmel in a monologue earlier this week said “[w]e hit some new lows over the weekend with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.ABC announced the moveafter Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC, appeared to threaten ABC, and its parent company Disney, for airing Kimmel’s monologue — ominously saying: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”Jeff Bezos, executive chair of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, has muzzled the paper’s editorial page,prohibiting it from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and imposing a stringent set of criteria on all editorials and opinion columns, which has led to the resignations of its opinion page editor and a slew of its opinion writers.Trump hasn’t sued the Washington Post for defamation, but Bezos presumably understands Trump’s potential for harming his range of businesses and wants to avoid Trump’s wrath.Make no mistake. Trump’s efforts to silence media criticism of him and his administration constitute another of his attacks on democracy.What can be done? Two important steps are warranted.First, the New York Times v Sullivan standard should be far stricter when a president of the United States seeks to use defamation law against a newspaper or media platform that criticizes him.Instead of requiring that he prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth, he should have to prove that the false statement materially impaired his ability to perform his official duties.Better yet, a president should have no standing to bring defamation suits. He has no need to bring them. Through his office he already possesses sufficient – if not too much – power to suppress criticism.Second, antitrust authorities should not allow large corporations or ultra-wealthy individuals with many other business interests to buy major newspapers or media platforms. They cannot be trusted to prioritize the public’s right to know over their financial interests in their range of businesses.The richest person in the world was allowed to buy X, one of the most influential news platforms on earth, and has turned it into a cesspool of rightwing lies and conspiracy theories.The son of the second-richest person in the world now oversees CBS.The fourth-richest person now owns the Washington Post.The Disney corporation, with its wide range of business enterprises, owns ABC.The problem isn’t concentrated wealth per se.It’s that these business empires are potentially more important to their owners than is the public’s right to know.If Democrats win back control of Congress next year, they should encode these two initiatives in legislation.Democracy depends on a fearless press. Trump and the media that have caved in to him are jeopardizing it and thereby undermining our democracy.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

The PM must summon the courage to actThu 18 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 13.05 EDTShareAs Donald Trump met with a grinning Keir Starmer and senior royals on his UK state visit this week, I found myself needing aDaily Mail body language expert.Did Starmer’s hand wave suggest he wanted to ask about the migrantscurrently being jailedsurrounded by alligators in Florida? Did King Charles’s lip shape mean he was wondering about the women who’ve accused Trump of sexual assault?Still, best not to think about it. That seemed to be the mantra of the visit. As protesters lined the street, the British delegation stuck its fingers in its ears andpulled out the stops: a gilded carriage, a military ceremony and the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, doing the sort of enthused head tilt that looked as if she was trying to communicate she was being held hostage.It has felt at times as if we are all extras in an even worse version of Love Actually, in which liberal wet dream Hugh Grant does not in fact stand up to the villainous US president (but at least no one keeps banging on about the size of Martine McCutcheon’s thighs).There is, of course, a practical reason for wooing Trump. Continuing the special relationship has been credited with protecting the UK from sky-high tariffs, while the latest visit has reportedlybeen timed to coincide witha £150bn investment from US firms. And yet the fact that Trump’s itinerary has steered him away from London – avoiding the larger protestsbeing staged there– and has conveniently occurred when parliament is in recess does betray the sense that (whisper it) none of this is actually OK.Whether it is the horror in Gaza or the rise of inhumane anti-migrant policies, it is the pretence that the timeline we are living through is normal that is truly insanity-inducing. Or to put it another way: you know there is something wrong with a diplomatic trip when it begins with a photo of the guest of honour stood next to a child sex trafficker beingprojected on to Windsor Castle.Trump’s unprecedented second state visit to the UK is in essence realpolitik gaslighting, in which we are told a man who is threatening totake over the police forceof the US capital should be gifted the literal red carpet treatment (and the Red Arrows).That Trump is in the country only days after what is thought to have been the largest nationalist event in Britain in decades makes this unease all the more palpable. It is hard not to feel that a disease is being allowed to spread, as the far right bleed over Westminster Bridge and a US president who this week celebrated the removal of a late-night TV host formaking a critical jokeenjoys thelargest-ever guard of honourat a state visit.View image in fullscreenKing Charles and Donald Trump sit in a carriage during a procession through Windsor Castle.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe pomp and ceremony bestowed to Trump is a particularly blatant example of what is, on both sides of the Atlantic, a widespread acceptance of the unacceptable. While in the US the late Christian nationalist Charlie Kirk is sanctified, here an MP calls “the vast majority” of a crowdlistening to great replacement theory“good, ordinary, decent people”. (Spoiler: it was Nigel Farage.)The crisis we are facing is only worsened by the sense our elected officials are so staggeringly unequipped to deal with the scale of the challenge (or indeed, are busy stoking it themselves). There was a remarkable period over the weekend when it was unclear whether the prime minister would even respond to the march, as if Starmer had gone to the football and just forgotten to put his phone back on. In the end, it took 24 hours for Downing Street torelease a statementsaying the government would not tolerate people being “intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin”. As context, that response rate was slowerthan the band James’.Five days after Elon Musk called for thedissolution of parliament, the government is still using X for official purposes. “We are a fair, tolerant and decent country. But we are in the fight of our times,” Starmertweeted on Tuesday, notably falling short of referring to the far right. I imagine this is what it felt like to see the gunpowder plot foiled, if James I kept posting on Guy Fawkes’s social media platform.At the time of writing, the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, has not tweeted anything about 110,000 people attending a march organised by Tommy Robinson and has not wanted to talk about it when asked by the media. She has, however, found time to promote her new LBC show.I can’t help but think back fondly to the 2010 general election, when Gordon Brown said a voter was a “bigot” for lamenting “all these eastern European what are coming in”. I’m not suggesting Starmer starts insulting the public or presidents – at least not on mic! – or that Brown handled the encounter well but I find myself wondering: when will our leaders call a racist a racist? And what does it say about the current political culture that makes them so afraid to?That this week it was largely left to Sadiq Khan, one of Britain’s few senior Muslim figures and a keytarget for Islamophobic threats, tocall out Trumpfor fanning the “flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world” is a stark lesson in dereliction of duty versus bravery.By Friday morning, Trump will be off British soil. But the crisis he represents will remain. Hate and division cannot be sent away with a flight on Air Force One. It takes long, hard conversations and courageous action. Whether Starmer and co are up to the task is the question. One thing’s for sure: if you are ever to solve a threat, you must first name it.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionKeir StarmerFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

My team, West Brom, were outplayingDerby Countybut, importantly, without managing to score a goal. Ordinarily, as the second half went on, I would have given in to pessimism, assuming that for all our dominance we’d not score, though Derby somehow would, and I’d go home miserable. But on this occasion, I really thought the match would be ours. Until this thing happened.Play suddenly stopped, for reasons that were at first unclear. A few of the players were looking at something lying on the pitch. Gingerly, squeamishly, they edged closer to whatever it was. Bizarre. As opera glasses aren’t available on the backs of seats at football grounds, we couldn’t identify the object. Eventually a member of the ground staff appeared, wearing rubber gloves. He strode out to the middle of the pitch, picked the object up, and returned whence he came carrying half a pigeon – dead, obviously.View image in fullscreenPlayers look at the peregrine’s lunch …Photograph: Manjit Narotra/ProSports/ShutterstockI boiled my wooden spoons – and what emerged from them will haunt me for ever | Adrian ChilesRead moreYes, half a dead pigeon had fallen from the skies on to our pitch. My first thought wasn’t for the pigeon’s welfare, nor even where it had fallen from. All I could think of was that the game was now lost. There’s not a football team in the world able to survive such an obvious portent of doom. Half a dead animal falling from the heavens? Ye gods, I’ve seen some horrible things at West Brom, but nothing like this. I’ve not watchedGame of Thrones, but I assume this is the kind of thing that goes on in it all the time.I asked a club official what had happened. It turns out that we’ve long had a peregrine falcon nesting high up in our West Stand. I was told it often dines on pigeon and drops its leftovers on the pitch. But never, hitherto, on match days. A world of dark possibilities crowd into my mind. Could we not train it to drop its dinner on opposition strikers as they bear down on our goal? Or even, in extremis, have a little peck at the players? It’s the least this creature can do for us after Saturday’s debacle.Oh yes, I should have said, the half-pigeon of doom saw to it that Derby did indeed win, with their only on-target shot of the match.

When one journalist asked Trump how he was holding up after the death of his friend, the president responded: “I think very good. And by the way, right there, you see all the trucks? They just started construction for the new ballroom of the White House, which is something that they’ve been trying to get, as you know, for about 150 years. And it’s gonna be a beauty.”“This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend,” Kimmel said. “This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.”Explainer: What did Jimmy Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk’s killing?Read moreOn arightwing podcaston Wednesday, theFCC commissioner, Brendan Carr, an avowed Trump ally who wrote the FCC chapter ofProject 2025,said that Kimmel’s monologue – delivered before much about Kirk’s alleged attacker’s motivations was known – was “sick” for suggesting that the shooter may have been affiliated with the Maga movement. He said: “In what appears to be an action by Jimmy Kimmel to play into that narrative that this was somehow a Maga or Republican-motivated person. If that’s what happened here with his conduct, that is really really sick.” Carr went on to effusively praise Kirk. “He was an amazing man.”Turning to Kimmel and his broadcaster, Carr said: “We’re going to have remedies that we can look at.” “Frankly,” he said later, “when you see stuff like this – I mean, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.”Apparently, ABC, and its parent company, Disney, decided to do it the easy way: the suspension of Kimmel’s show was announced just hours after Carr’s comments. Reporting fromtrade publicationshas suggested that Nexstar, a broadcasting company that owns many of the ABC-affiliated stations that air Kimmel’s show, may have prompted the move from ABC after they pre-emptively said that they would not air Kimmel’s show in response to the comments. Nexstar is in the midst of a $6.2bn merger with the media company Tegna, a deal which Carr, in his capacity as FCC commissioner, would have the power to block.After ABC’s announcement, when Carr was asked by the CNN media analyst Brian Stelter if he had any new comment on Kimmel’s suspension, Carr repliedwith a giffrom the television series The Office, in which the show’s two exasperating idiot foils, Michael and Dwight, dance triumphantly.What appears to have happened is this: an executive agency with the power to regulate private actors threatened to take action to punish speech and to prevent more such speech from being made public in the future. And a corporation jumped to carry out this censorship in response to those threats. There is a word for this: jawboning. It is when the government pressures a third party to silence speech it does not like, and the US supreme courthas ruled unanimouslythat it is an illegal first amendment violation – that is, state censorship.TheTrump administrationhas advanced a sporadic crackdown on anti-regime speech since the president’s return to power in January. Kimmel is not even the first late-night host to be dismissed under agency pressure: Stephen Colbert, the host of The Late Show, had his program cancelled by CBS just two weeks after the network paid Trump a large settlement to end a frivolous defamation lawsuit against him. But the crackdown on anti-Trump speech has accelerated in the days since Kirk’s murder. On Monday,JD Vancehosted an episode of Kirk’s podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show, and told listeners that if they see someone criticizing Kirk, they should “call their employer”.Media has long been a precarious industry, one where employers and workers alike face slim margins and maximum scrutiny. And Trump has long used the media’s combination of public visibility and business vulnerability to his own advantage, casting coverage of his own misdeeds, malfeasance and malice as lies and encouraging his followers in their reflexive anti-elite sentiment about the generally well-educated cadre of New York and DC-based writers and editors, whom he has long referred to as “the enemy of the people”.More and more of the largest media companies in the American market are now controlled by billionaires who are Trump’s ideological allies: Elon Musk owns X; the rightwing Ellison family is set to acquire Paramount/Skydance; just this week, Trump announced a deal to sell TikTok to his rightwing billionaire supporters Marc Andreessen and Larry Ellison.With some noble exceptions, those large media companies that are still independent have generally responded to Trump’s pressure poorly, making what seem like ad-hoc and arbitrary choices to either resist or capitulate depending on the whims of management. One thinks of the Los Angeles Times, which pulled its endorsement of Kamala Harris from in the 2024 presidential election at the direction of Patrick Soon-Shiong, the paper’s billionaire owner. One thinks, too, of the Washington Post, where purges of newsroom and opinion desk writers and an editorial pivot towards the promotion of “free markets and individual liberties” have now replaced the slogan that the paper adopted during the first Trump administration: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” It is getting very dark indeed.When a regime can use the power of the law to punish speech because it does not like that speech’s content, then speech is not free.When media companies change their editorial strategies not in service to their readers, but out of fear of the repercussions from the government and its allies, then the press is not free. When an honest accounting of Kirk’s life leads to comedians, journalists, opinion columnists, political commentators and sports writers losing their jobs at the behest of state actors and in the service of regime interests, then the truth is not free.It is becoming dangerous – life-alteringly so – to tell the truth about the Trump regime, or even just to tell truths that the regime finds unflattering. Theirs is the dream of an insecure child: one of absolute power. They want to rule over us with malignant pettiness, to dispense favors and mercy to their allies and sycophants, and to dispense and encourage punishments to those who displease them. They want to control what we’re allowed to say, what we’re allowed to know. And they want to control what we are allowed to laugh at – certainly, never them.In the era of absolute monarchy, European countries often had laws on the books banning the mockery of the king. So-calledlèse-majestélaws made it treason to insult the “dignity” of the sovereign. The Trump administration seems to have taken this principle – that to mock is serious and punishable – and expanded it, extending the protective circle of the king’s authority outward until it encompasses all of his allies, too.Under Trump, it is not just Trump himself who must not be mocked, but also anyone Trump approves of, or finds useful, or needs to pretend to love. It is a sign of the regime’s profound insecurity and sense of their own weakness that they think they require this power, that they think they cannot withstand the laughter of their people. But even if Trump succeeds in his crackdown on speech, he seems unlikely to effectively silence the public’s mockery of himself and his allies. It would be impossible to ban jokes about these people; they are simply too ridiculous.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpStephen ColbertJimmy KimmelcommentShareReuse this content"

Friends will talk about those scenes, how London was packed with more than100,000 day-tripperschanting “send them back”. Then they’ll say: “It’s the 1970s all over again.” I can almost see their minds playing the old reels of Enoch Powell and the National Front.Being of similar vintage, I too know about abuse in playgrounds and getting chased by skinheads and the house-warming gift of a brick through the window (which the police didn’t deem racist because the motive wasn’t sufficiently explicit – guys, next time wrap it in a memo!). We’re still some way from those days, thankfully, but one important aspect is much worse. Back then, racism was a furtive, guilty pleasure: deep down, even bigots knew their bigotry was ugly. No more.What was striking about last weekend’s march wasn’t the turnout, easily matched by some of the protests about Gaza. It’s the lack of shame, the brazen insistence on an Englishman’s right to make others feel small. It’s the normalisation of what was until recently considered malicious extremism. And a big driver isn’t the crowds down in the street, but the suits in our supposedly progressive government.Whenever confronted with violent prejudice,Keir Starmercoughs, splutters and takes the coward’s way out. He either pretends not to see racism or panders to it.Just over a couple of months ago, in smalltowns across Northern Ireland, migrants were burned out of their homes and a mosque was petrol bombed. The prime minister’s response? First and foremost, he deplored attacks on the police. Muslims deluged with hate and fearing for their lives got only a promise of “every step possibleto keep you safe”. Stripped of rhetorical flourish, this is the bare minimum any citizen might expect from a state. It was much the same from No 10 after last summer’s riots: a huge and often heavy-handed crackdown on law-breaking, and a vast and strategic silence on the prejudice and disinformation that fuelled the savagery.Worse still is when Starmer simpers in the face of prejudice, something he is doing more and more as his approval ratings go further and further south. At the end of last month, Nigel Farage promised mass deportation of practically anyone seeking asylum in this country, even if it meant handing Afghan women over to the Taliban and sending Iranian dissidents to their deaths. To the press, No 10 didn’t so much as raise an eyebrow at the Reform UK leader referring to other humans as a“scourge” or an “invasion”. For the great unwashed, it posted the mostextraordinary advert. “Whilst Nigel Farage moans from the sidelines, Labour is getting on with the job,” it read, showing an image of Starmer stamped with “removed over 35,000 people from the UK”. Why vote for the full-fat hatemongers when diet racists will do the job just fine?Plenty ofLabourpeople will say they aren’t racist at all, and I wouldn’t wish to argue. But one lesson about prejudice I learned fast growing up was to focus on impact rather than quibble about intention. A brick, in other words, is always a brick, whatever the reasons of the clown chucking it.However impeccably liberal Labour ministers might think themselves, they are in effect dabbling in the politics of hatred in order to gain a point or two in opinion polls. Getting thrashed by Reform? Then we’ll get the prime minister to call migration a “squalid chapter” causing “incalculable” damage to Britain. Voters won’t wear that? Then we’ll say the entire speechwas a big mistakecaused by, um, the PM having a lot in his in-tray.For the sake of a few inglorious careers, no tactic is too cheap and every single principle can be chucked out of the window. So after a bit of throat-clearing, No 10 tells the Guardian and other leftwing outlets how worried it is about Saturday’s march of extremists, while sending a minister on TV to tell everyone else that Tommy Robinson’s rally shows free speech is “alive and well”.“The British people have a far more nuanced view of immigration than the media and political narrative would have us believe,” observesNick Lowlesof anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate in his new book, How to Defeat the Far Right. Only one out of 10 Britons is outright opposed to immigration, while many who identify, say, asylum seekers as a huge issue have never met one. Of the top 50 areas in the UK most vehemently opposed to Muslims, Lowles finds that 27 are in the district of Tendring, in Farage’s constituency of Clacton. Yet how much of Tendring’s population is Muslim? Fewer than one out of 200: 0.4%.I left the Tommy Robinson rally with the worrying realisation: this movement is only going to get bigger | Helen PiddRead moreArmed with such findings and a historic majority, Labour could easily counter some of the wild extremism. Ministers might point out that “English patriot” Robinson is an Irish passport-holder (up until last summer, anyway) who hunkers down in Spain and has a list of criminal convictions long enough for a tattoo sleeve. Starmer might observe how much of the UK would simply fall apart without migrants and their children – from your local hospital to the school to the care home. How universities are facing collapse without foreign students and their bumper fees. He might even point out – imagine! – that migrants are human too, with their own lives and dreams for themselves and their families. We could get on to the legacy of empire, and about how the climate crisis and poverty force other populations to move.But who am I kidding? This government would rather entertain a planeload of rich Americans, over here this week to take our landfor their datacentres, our subsidies for their businesses, and demand we alter our tax code for their investors. As for the rest of us, any hope of material improvement is forbidden by “the markets”, “fiscal rules” and of course “asylum seekers”.History has a habit of giving little men big tasks. Joe Biden had one job: to stop Donald Trump returning to power. His failure will have consequences for the world. Starmer’s one historic role is to stave off the hard right. He is not only failing, he is paving the way for Farage and his crew. The supposed “centrists” are ushering fringe politics into the mainstream and normalising the abhorrent.But just listen to the speeches and chants made by the extremists. Robinson no longer talks about small boats; he wants his country back. After years of resisting mass deportations as “impossible”, Farage now touts them as the solution. The Overton window is shifting further and further to the right. The ultimate price for that will not be paid by a politician, but by people far from power: an Ethiopian boy, perhaps, with no family, or an Asian kid looking out the window one evening.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFar rightOpinionTommy RobinsonLabourNigel FarageKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

We know there will be a quid pro quo; we just don’t know what it is yetThu 18 Sep 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 15.01 EDTSharePeter Kyle, until two weeks ago the technology secretary, once warned that tech companies such as Meta, Google and Microsoft were so powerful that the UK needed to approach them with“a sense of statecraft” and “humility”, and treat negotiations with them similarly to diplomacy between nations. That vision endures in the form of theUK-US tech prosperity agreementstruckthis week. While officially a new bilateral partnership, this seems to be a deal aimed at facilitating investment from US technology companies rather than advancing collaboration on goals such as AI safety, copyright protections for British rights holders or a digital services tax.The rationale is clear: US firmsstand aloneatop the global AI value chain, making the country an obvious partner for a UK government seeking to“turbocharge” its AI sector. Against a challenging economic backdrop, the promise of “a combined £31bn”in support for UK AI infrastructuresuch as datacentres offers welcome headlines.The potential challenges are nonetheless also pronounced. We know that the publicharbours concernsabout the motivation of these companies and theirincreasing entanglementwith the British state. And they may reasonably have questions about this deal, too: in particular the quid pro quo that comes with investment from big tech. The firms making these pledges are not charities, and it remains unclear what local communities inareas such as Blyth, in Northumberland, will see in exchange for offering up their land and grid capacity.AI will make the rich unfathomably richer. Is this really what we want? | Dustin GuastellaRead moreIn the US itself, datacentre developments have led torising energy billsanddisrupted water supplieswhile supportingremarkably few jobs. It is unsurprising, then, that existing plans for a new “hyperscale” datacentre in Buckinghamshire have encounteredlocal oppositionandlegal pushback. To ensure its new “AI growth zones” are not beset by similar controversy, government will need to provide assurances that energy resources and other assets staked for private investment will produce returns for local economies – and to the public purse – rather than just powering profits abroad.Then there is the opportunity cost associated with prioritising US tech over domestic alternatives. Liz Kendall, Kyle’s successor as technology secretary, hasdescribed the new partnershipas a “vote of confidence in Britain’s booming AI sector”, although few of the companies involved are based – let alone owned – in Britain. Investment from US companies does not need to be zero-sum, but without deft management it risks crowding out any green shoots of growth in the UK’s own tech sector. Entrenching reliance on US technologies at the most lucrative parts of the AI value chain would leave UK firms to fight over the leftovers.It’s true that the UK lacks the scale and resource advantages of the US, and therefore the ability to participate in cutting-edge AI development on its own: from this perspective, US investment is essential. Yet our international peers – from the EU’s “EuroStack” movement to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s Brazil – have charted alternative paths to bolster sovereign capabilities and create the conditions for domestic tech firms, small and medium-sized enterprises andtruly public alternativesto flourish.All of this is downstream of the most important issue: what is the government’s vision for AI beyond doing it bigger and faster? There is too often an implicit assumption that AI will be socially and economically transformative,with the suggestion that“millions of patients could receive life-saving treatments faster” only the latest in a series of ill-defined and poorly evidenced claims. The subtext is that the promised land is in sight – but that only the investments and regulatory changes demanded by large technology companies will get us there. This, however, is precisely backwards: policymakers should instead consider what AI could tangibly achieve for people and society, and from there ask what technological investments are necessary.When the question is posed in this way, the answers seem less obviously congenial to the profit margins of the largest incumbent firms. There may, for instance, be substantial public value to be squeezed out ofprevious-generationfoundation models, which are far less costly to procure and run. The success ofChina’s DeepSeekdemonstrates the potential for the UK of a “fast follower” model whereby instead of begging for scraps from big tech’s table, we wait and see what innovations will yield the most value, and pursue cost-effective ways of doing it ourselves.Achieving this will involve the canny use of public resources to pluralise AI research and build independent capacity. The good news for our new secretary of state is that the seeds of this agenda already exist. The government’ssovereign AI unitcould be tasked with supporting alternative research paradigms. Public compute and data resources such as the new AI Research Resource and National Data Library could implementaccess policiesthat favour smaller organisations, public entities and nonprofits. To ensure that public subsidies are not simply hoovered up by big tech, measures could also be taken to reduce talent and intellectual property drain andpredatory corporate partnerships, with robustregulatory actionencouraged when necessary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both Labour and theConservativesare spooked by collapses in voter support and by the rise of Reform UK. Party anxiety, internal disagreements and even grassroots revolts seem possible at both of their conferences.The third-largest party, theLiberal Democrats, have no such worries at all. They start their conference in Bournemouth this weekend in resilient mood. Having won 72 Commons seats in 2024 – the best result by any third party for a century – Sir Ed Davey’s party cemented those gains in the 2025 English local elections. While Labour and the Tories lost both votes and seats to Reform UK, the Lib Dems did the reverse, gaining seats and capturing three county councils. As a result, Sir Edclaimedthe Lib Dems were now “the party of middle England”.Well, maybe. What is undoubtedly true is that the Lib Dems have grounds for future confidence as well as past satisfaction. Yet the good electoral performances should not be exaggerated – the Lib Dems are averaging only 14%in the polls. They also mask serious challenges and dilemmas that confront the party more deeply than may appear at first sight. As the polling guruSir John Curticehas recently pointed out, the Lib Dems are in fact less the party of middle England than a party of one side of the sharp divide in British politics opened up by Reform UK.This reality – that the Lib Dems now consistently do best in remain-voting areas of Britain, while struggling in leave ones – redefines a familiar dilemma. Not for the first time in their history, the Lib Dems have to decide between offering a radical alternative to Labour or a more centrist alternative to the Conservatives. The difference now is that the first-past-the-post system is rewarding the Lib Dems in remain areas where the Tory vote has collapsed. Sir Ed is therefore pragmaticallymore focusedon Lib-Con marginals, for three connected reasons: the need to defend so many formerly Tory seats captured in 2024; the fact that most post-2024 Lib Dem target seats are Tory-held; and the Tory drift to the right under Kemi Badenoch.Many MPs and activists nevertheless feel this concentration on unhappy former Tory voters is to miss the volatility of the times, when there are votes to be won on the left too.Labour’s unpopularityhas left many of its former voters looking for a new home. Sir Ed has leaned into this mood byboycottingthe Trump visit state dinner, showing sympathy to Angela Rayner, complaining about media bias in favour of Nigel Farage, and speaking out over Gaza. Yet the issue will have to be faced more substantively in the Scottish and Welsh elections next spring and in the general election beyond that. Unless the Lib Dems also make these voters a compelling and costed economic and environmental offer, they could move elsewhere.Nevertheless, the Conservative-Labour duopoly is now under greater challenge than at any time since the early 1980s. The Lib Dems are positioned to benefit. If Sir Ed reads it right, he could push his number of MPs closer to the 100 mark in 2028-29. If that happens, and there is a hung parliament, the Lib Dems may once again hold the balance of power, as they did in 2010. In that event, the decision between left and right will no longer be avoidable.Explore more on these topicsLiberal Democrat conferenceOpinionEd DaveyLiberal DemocratsReform UKConservativesLaboureditorialsShareReuse this content"

An “extra-large” guard of honour. The UK rolled out not only the red carpet, royal welcome and golden carriage but also the superlatives for Donald Trump’s visit. Sir Keir Starmer’s hyperbole on thememorandum of understanding on techmade his guest look almost understated: theprime minister boastedthat the transatlantic partnership paved the way for new technologies to “amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer”.Yet there was an inverse relationship between thepomp and ceremonyof this trip and its real import, between the grand declarations of amity and the actual state of transatlantic ties. The US president soaked up the sycophancy and was obliging enough to hymn the “priceless” relationship. But while Mr Trump grumbled that Vladimir Putin had “really let me down”, he showed no inclination for tougher action against Russia despite Sir Keir’s preposterous remark that the US president had “led the way” on Ukraine and King Charles’s pointed reference – one that his mother might not, perhaps, have made – to Europe and its allies needing to stand together against tyranny.US tariffs on British steelhave not budged. The promised $150bn of investment by US tech firms in the next decade looks less impressive in the context of their global investment in infrastructure; Microsoft alone haspledged to spend $120bnon datacentres in the next year. As Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and ex-Meta executive,accurately observed, the UK is a “vassal state technologically”. The government is relying on servicing American artificial intelligence firms rather than bolstering domestic innovation.Sir Keir has earned far better reviews for his performance on the world stage than domestically. The international arena is perhaps all the more appealing when he is so embattled at home. Yet almost half of Britonsthought it wrongfor Mr Trump to receive this second state visit, and even a former Telegraph editortook to the streetsin protest.Thearrest of four campaignersafter an image of Mr Trump and the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was beamed on to Windsor Castle – with an accompanying soundtrack questioning their relationship – was a grotesque misuse of the Malicious Communications Act to restrict protest. It was all the more galling when those around the presidentattack the UK’s supposed lack of free speechin curbing hateful disinformation and other dangerous materials. Giving Mr Trump a bespoke ministerial-style red box embossed with his initials was inconsequential, but a symbolically queasy choice given his willingness to meddle in other countries’ domestic policies. He publicly urged Sir Keir to extract more fossil fuels and suggested using the army to counter illegal migration.But in the world of President Trump, a diplomatic interaction that avoids the outright disaster of a public dressing down, or doubling of tariffs, is now regarded as a triumph by US allies. Minimising damage and buying time are the name of the game – though he described the transatlantic relationship as “unbreakable”, Mr Trump delights in fracturing the status quo, takes offence easily and likes association with winners; Sir Keir no longer looks like one. Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington, noted this week that the UKstill has leveragebeyond ego-boosting pageantry and could use it. Instead, inflating modest achievements and demonstrating an absurd deference only makes Britain look smaller.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionKeir StarmerTariffsKing Charles IIINick CleggArtificial intelligence (AI)Trump administrationeditorialsShareReuse this content"

While Reform UK and other populist movements use simple, more direct and emotionally charged messaging that thrives on social media, Labour continues to rely on complex, policy-driven narratives.The sense of hope orchangethat animated Labour’s general election campaign quickly evaporated in the face of cuts to the winter fuel allowance and disability benefits. Meanwhile, rising inequality, stagnant wages, job insecurity and the lasting effects of successive financial and public health crises have eroded trust in parties seen as failing to deliver economic stability, growth and meaningful job creation. The labour market is also shifting rapidly, leaving many workers without the upskilling needed to adapt.Reform UK has capitalised on this disillusionment by playing the underdog card, pushing a polarising “us versus them” narrative that resonates powerfully with those who feel left behind. Populists further amplify anxieties over migration, national identity and rapid social change – issues that Labour is clearly struggling to address with conviction.To win back trust,Labourmust go beyond policy detail. People want purpose, dignity and hope. That means crafting a message that inspires while still being grounded in facts and critical thinking. Britain deserves better than the populist sensationalism that is currently dominating debate. What is needed is leadership that speaks to values, restores belief in politics and offers a genuine vision of a fairer future.Cyril HaessigGodalming, SurreyKirsty Major is spot-on in her article on Knowsley. I live in the south Wales valleys and can easily see Reform UK taking valley seats should a parliamentary byelection occur. The seat neighbouring me, Caerphilly, isholding a byelectionfor the Senedd in Cardiff in October, and the feeling is that Reform will take it. If it does, it could lead to Reform being the biggest party in the Senedd after the 2026 election.Major is right about the growth of Reform in poor areas, and unless Labour does something quickly, its death knell is sounding.Adrian DumphyPontypridd, Rhondda Cynon TafSurely the way to stop Labour’s existential decline is to offer what people voted for: a Labour government with a workable vision of what it can achieve.What Labour has is a sycophantic cabinet supporting a prime minister lacking political nous, a leader who curtailed job opportunities, withdrew benefits from a section of disabled claimants, allowed Reform UK’s clamour on immigrants to colour his response and has shown a more positive attitude to Israel than to Palestine. He seems complacent with his vision, despite his gloom and doom communications.What a waste of a Labour party elected with an incredible majority, a majority that will never come again.Dr Margaret MartlewSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Donald Trump and big pharma. Just one more way he’s menacing Britain, 16 September).New drugs are never cheaper than the ones they replace, so if the NHS is going to use them, they need to be better. Most newly licensed drugs do something useful for at least some patients. While a few revolutionise treatment, most edge forward improvements in the quality and length of life, and theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence(Nice) recommends the great majority of them.Spending more money on a new drug takes cash away from elsewhere in the NHS, so Nice and the NHS use a bit of health economics to work out how to make this trade-off.Companies complainthat the formula for this hasn’t been updated for 25 years, but Nice frequently flexes its baselinevalue-for-money thresholdto facilitate access to promising new treatments.After Nice recommends new medicines, companies face a couple of other challenges. TheNHSis sometimes slow at adopting new drugs, and when it does, a separate mechanism, negotiated between the drugs industry and the government, places a limit on the amount of money companies can make out of them.Three things might help make what will always be a tricky process a little easier. First, Nice and the government should set up an independent review of the value-for-money threshold and implement its recommendations.Second, Nice should set take-up rates (numbers of patients prescribed each year) for the drugs it recommends, and the NHS should commit to achieving them. And third, in return, companies should engage early with Nice and put a realistic price forward at the beginning (they always know what it is) rather than waiting for Nice to say no and then reducing it later. Companies that do this should then get a special deal on the price cap.Andrew DillonFounding chief executive, National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence, 1999-2020Explore more on these topicsNHSDonald TrumpNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellencePharmaceuticals industryHealthlettersShareReuse this content"

Rashford had done enough to ensure that, despite Anthony Gordon’s 90th-minute consolation,Eddie Howe’s side were beaten. “It is going good. I am obviously learning a lot,” Rashford said afterwards as he praised his new manager, Hansi Flick. “It is a new way of football, but I am enjoying it all and I think it is making me a better player.Rashford’s double silences Newcastle’s party and eases Barcelona to victoryRead more“I’m 100% full of excitement and very motivated. Hansi Flick is a top coach and a top man-manager. We want to win the Champions League.“That is what I am here to do – to help the team win, but also to try to improve and be the best that I can.

The quality we have in the team excites me. It is so refreshing to play with these players. Newcastle is not an easy place to play football and the first half was very cagey. We did well and we tried to control the game in spells but it’s very difficult to play against this team and I’m really pleased we managed to win.”Flick, who regards Rashford as more of a No 9 than a left-sided forward or winger, appeared equally delighted with his loanee. “He showed us he’s a fantastic player,” he said. “We always see this from Rashford in training and we saw it on the pitch today.“I’m happy to have him and those two goals will help Marcus get to the next step.

The midfielder said: “He seems to break every record going. It’s unheard of what he’s doing. What an unbelievable player.”AfterNapolihad Giovanni Di ­Lorenzo sent off on 21 minutes it was the longest of nights for an XI containing all the returning-to-Manchester three – Scott McTominay, Rasmus Højlund and De Bruyne – before the Belgian was sacrifice when his captain saw red.“Once A Blue Always A Blue” was one banner greeting Super Kev, though Napoli’s star turn was Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, a goalkeeper defiant until the second-half intervention of Haaland and Jérémy Doku, whose solo effort had shades of Ricky Villa’s 1981 FA Cup final barnburner.On a temperate night more akin to a venue in southern Europe, a Tijjani Reijnders stinger was beaten out by Milinkovic-Savic for a first corner. Napoli’s response came via a raking 45-yard De Bruyne diagonal that dropped sweetly on to Leonardo Spinazzola’s boot: he turned Abdukodir Khusanov inside out, so the makeshift right-back did well to recover.Now, a Gianluigi Donnarumma hoof upfield reached Foden, whose early release had Haaland galloping in – Di Lorenzo scythed him down and after the pitchside review, the referee, Felix Zwayer, went from adjudging no foul to a wave of the red card.Advantage City. After Reijnders’ free-kick spun away off the wall, and a Haaland flick went close, Napoli’s regroup featured Conte bringing on Mathías Olivera for De Bruyne: his 25 minutes were greeted with an ovation and a few volleys of: “Oh Kevin De Bruyne.” The Belgian poker-faced his removal but was surely discontented. Conte explained: “It was the only option I could do.”View image in fullscreenA disappointed Kevin De Bruyne trudges past the manager who substituted him, Antonio ContePhotograph: Nigel French/Allstar Picture Library Ltd/SportsphotoThe head coach had summed the contest up as his “students” against Guardiola’s “tutors”, and with Di Lorenzo’s early shower we settled in for City’s long siege of the Neapolitan goal. Rodri rolled to Foden and he unloaded and Milinkovic-Savic saved. A loose pass aimed at Alessandro Buongiorno had blue shirts scurrying after the ball with him but the centre-back beat these – just.A rat-a-tat sequence involving Rodri-Foden-Haaland had the striker squeezed out just inside Napoli’s area. Then, Rúben Dias’s curving cross drew a flying Haaland, who marginally failed to connect close in. Rodri flitted about in prompting, metronomic mode and when stepping forward hit a 20-yard banger that had caused Milinkovic-Savic to dive low, and right, to repel.He repeated the act – twice – to tip away headers from Nico O’Reilly and Josko Gvardiol, the Serb a one-man resistance to the ever-surging blue wave. Through all this his counterpart between City’s posts, Donnarumma, was a spectator on easy street. From the Naples area, the 26-year-old had close-to-zero to do before a break the team from his childhood locality managed to reach intact.City’s last effort before the refreshments was a Reijnders’ attempt that Matteo Politano nearly turned into his own goal when sticking out a boot. But, yet again, Milinkovic-Savic was alert and he gathered and saved the stand-in skipper’s blushes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conte’s interval instruction to his men was surely simple – “suffer and defend” – while saying too, maybe, internally, “cross everything”.He certainly prayed when Doku fed Foden and he let fly. The ball bounced from the left, across goal, narrowly missing. Now, following a yellow card for Politano for grabbing Gvardiol, Conte took him off for Juan Jesus but the Brazilian defender could do nothing to stop what happened next.From the edge of the area Foden, magically, flipped a lob past the No 5 into Haaland whose run and headed finish was of the pure poacher’s school. Guardiola celebrated, then substituted Rodri, Nico González given the last half an hour. Of the Spaniard’s exit, Guardiola said: “He asked to come off but he is fine.” The request came as he continues a comeback from a latest knee problem.From here City’s mission was to keep their lead. The best method of doing this is to score again, of course. So, they did, and this came courtesy of Doku’s slaloming twinkle-toed burst that made mugs of Sam Beukema and Spinazzola, the pair cast as pub footballers before the Belgian’s razor-sharp piercing of their net.City, continuing to probe, did not add another but this was an accomplished display.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityNapolimatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The American stormed through the Tokyo rain to add a first global gold in the flat 400m to the twoOlympicand one world titles she won over the hurdles.Gout Gout misses out on 200m final but says better performances are ‘coming’Read moreNot since the Iron Curtain cast a shadow over Europe, and sport was seen as war by other means across the Eastern bloc, has a woman run a 400m as fast as McLaughlin-Levrone did on this wet and wild Tokyo night.The wind was rattling unevenly around the National Stadium. There were puddles on the track. And yet the American looked almost serene as she floated across the track to take a stunning WorldAthleticsChampionship gold medal in 47.78sec.Afterwards, when she spoke briefly to reporters, she invoked the power of prayer and the Lord. In track and field terms, this performance was certainly God-like too.“I had faith in my training,” she said. “I knew I had it in me to run that fast. It was just a matter of time.”Yet when McLaughlin-Levrone announced she was making the switch to the 400m from the hurdles, whereshe holds the world recordand two Olympic and world titles, there were plenty of doubters. They will be silent now. “My coach, Bobby Kersee, uses boxing terms all the time,” she said. “He said: ‘You got to go out there and take the belt. It’s not yours, and you got to go earn it’.”McLaughlin-Levrone’s time was so fast it took her to second on the all-time list, hopping over the Czech Jarmila Kratochvilova, who attributed her muscular physique to growing up on a farm, rigorous weight-training, and shots of vitamin B12, during her early 1980s peak.Only Marita Koch’s world record of 47.60sec, set by the East German in 1985 and questioned ever since despite the athlete’s insistence she did nothing wrong, stands above the US athlete now. But McLaughlin-Levrone knows it is within her grasp.Certainly Salwa Eid Naser, who won bronze, thinks it is possible after getting the best view in the National Stadium of the American’s performance. “I think that very soon the women’s 400m world record will be broken,” she said. “I never thought of it before, but after tonight’s race I can see it is around the corner.”View image in fullscreenBusang Collen Kebinatshipi (centre) won 400m gold ahead of Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago.Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/EPAYet, incredibly, the result was still in doubt off the final bend. As McLaughlin-Levrone looked across from lane five she could see the Olympic champion, Marileidy Paulino, alongside her, across in the outside lane.Some would have panicked. But the American’s form didn’t change and her poise didn’t alter. Slowly Paulino began to falter and settle for silver in 47.98sec, the third fastest time in history, with Eid third in 48.19sec, the ninth quickest of all time. Britain’s Amber Anning ran a season’s best of 49.36sec to finish a highly creditable fifth.“I knew the strength was there,” said McLaughlin-Levrone. “I just knew that there was more in the tank. And I knew it was going to be a battle down the full stretch.

But on Thursday the cavalry finally arrived in the form ofKeely Hodgkinson.The Olympic 800m champion has been so bored in her hotel in the 35c heat she has even taken to staging playful indoor races with her training partner, Georgia Hunter Bell. But she dusted off the cobwebs in qualifying comfortably for Friday’s semi-finals in 1min 59.79sec. “I don’t like the rounds,” she said. “They feel awful.

I know what that 1:42 low pace feels like, even if it gets pushed down to 1:41 I should be comfortable sticking with it.”He added: “I’ve been running fast-paced races in the Diamond League all year up with these lads, so there’s no reason that I shouldn’t be up with them in this final.”Two Britons made Friday’s final of the women’s 200m, with Amy Hunt running a personal best of 22.08 to finish as the third fastest qualifier. Dina Asher-Smith also made it through, but Daryll Neita is out.“I wanted this final so much, no matter what,” said Hunt. “I had to beat those girls. It’s so special to do my PB here to make it to the final.”On a better night for British athletes, Hannah Nuttall made the women’s 5,000m final after finishing seventh in 14:48.09. “I was thinking: ‘You’ve got to get on it, and if you die, you die, but you’re going to die trying,’” she said.Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsKeely HodgkinsonAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Against the Black Ferns in the last four at Ashton Gate, Canada will still be viewed as underdogs in some circles, something the team have spoken about a lot, according to the wing Alysha Corrigan.“It is something that isn’t new for us, we are usually seen as that underdog and not always getting that recognition we think we deserve,” says Corrigan. “I think that is something that fuels our fire.”The self-belief is understandable, stemming from recent results between the semi-final opponents. Canada beat New Zealand for the first time at the 2024 Pacific Four tournament and the last time the two teams met at the 2025 Pac Four they drew 27-27.“The first time we beat them that pushed us, it gave us a huge boost of confidence,” says Canada’s captain, Alex Tessier. “Drawing against them confirmed where we are at, that we have been growing. We have grown after each game.”View image in fullscreen‘The first time we beat them that pushed us, it gave us a huge boost of confidence.’ The Canada captain Alex Tessier says her side have the self-belief to beat New Zealand.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAFor their part, the champions are wary; the most-capped Black Fern in history, the former scrum-half, Kendra Cocksedge, highlighed Kévin Rouet’s team as one to cause them problems.“I believe they are our bogey team at the moment to be honest.” Cocksedge says. “As soon as you beat the black jersey your tail’s up and you give them confidence. They are playing with that, they are ones we seriously need to consider.”An element of Canada’s game which could unlock their opponent’s impressive defence is their fast ruck speed. They had the fastest average of any team throughout the pool stage, with 79% in less than three seconds against Scotland in theirfinal and most competitive pool match. They did not slow down intheir quarter-finaleither and if defences are a split second too slow to react, Canada will score – the tally is 30 tries across their four games so far this tournament.Then we come to the third reason, De Goede. One of the tournament’s best players, her performances are all the more impressive given the context that the semi-final will be only her eighth game since recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury.Rouet has described De Goede as the “cherry on the cake” for Canada, coming into her prime at the right time. The former captain’s statistics back up the hype around her all-action game – two tries, 17 conversions as the team’s goalkicker, successful completion of 47 tackles out of an attempted 50 and four turnovers won.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also have the highest World Cup try-scorer in Portia Woodman-Wickliffe on one wing and the current tournament top points and try-scorer on the other in Braxton Sorensen-McGee.

She always wants to add bits to her game.”United had come into the second leg at Leigh Sports Village trailing 1-0 on aggregate after a bizarre episode in the first leg in Bergen, when they somehowlost several of the bootsin transit and were forced to hastily purchase new ones, and succumbed to a late Brann goal against the run of play. They have still not located the missing boots but certainly rediscovered their form in front of goal as they made a quick start.The hosts capitalised on sloppy Brann defending to feed Terland and she lashed home the opening goal inside nine minutes with a ­ruthless first-time strike. She doubled the lead on the night and nudged United ahead on aggregate when she headed into the top corner from a difficult angle soon afterwards.With Jess Park in a lively mood and the full-backs Anna Sandberg and Jayde Riviere in strong form, the home side dominated the game and created plenty of first-half chances without adding further goals. Just as the visitors began to slowly get back into the contest and enjoy some territory inside the Manchester United half after the break, Terland clinched the tie on the counterattack as she combined with Melvine Malard and then slotted in a low finish.That took the confident Norway striker’s tally up to seven goals in four European games this term, and her eighth in all competitions, and it means Brann – with the former Crystal Palace manager Leif Smerud in charge – drop into the new secondary women’s European competition, the Europa Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The primary note of concern for Skinner’s team came when Riviere, one of their best performers so far this term, had to be withdrawn, the Canada right-back hobbling off with about 12 minutes remaining. By then, the English side were coasting through and their supporters were chanting “we’re all going on a European tour”.United will learn their opponents in Friday’s 11am draw ceremony and Skinner added confidently: “We’ve got to go in there and not just make up the numbers. We have to be excited by the opportunity. Whatever the draw is, I hope any teams that get us see they actually didn’t really want to play Manchester United.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champion's LeagueManchester United WomenWomen's footballBrann womennewsShareReuse this content"

Kerkez was booked for diving and was lucky to avoid a second yellow after fouling Jaidon Anthony before being substituted for Andy Robertson after 38 minutes at Turf Moor. Surely Slot will not risk a similar performance in the cauldron of the Merseyside derby, especially with such a dependable option in Robertson and the tricky Iliman Ndiaye on the right wing for Everton? “It’s a massive jump [playing for Liverpool],” said the Scot as he came to the defence of Kerkez this week. “I came from Hull City, he’s come from Bournemouth, and it’s probably quite similar. He will be the starting left-back for Liverpool in the future and it’s up to me to push him this season and help him improve.” Kerkez is lucky to have such an experienced mentor, but may face a wait to get back into Slot’s starting XI after Robertson startedagainst Atlético Madridin midweek.Michael ButlerLiverpool v Everton, 12.30pm (all timesBST)2Fresh direction for Brighton with AytoIt has been a busy week on the south coast. The former Arsenal interim sporting director Jason Ayto was confirmed as David Weir’s successor on Monday after the Scot’s surprise departure, having spent seven years at Brighton. Ayto is credited with playing a major role in bringing Martín Zubimendi to north London after stepping in to replace Edu last year, with the Brighton owner, Tony Bloom, hoping the 40-year-old’s arrival will give the club “new leadership and direction”. He is expected to attend Saturday’s meeting with Tottenham at the Amex as Fabian Hürzeler – who marked his 50th game in charge of Brighton in the2-1 defeatto Bournemouth last weekend – attempts to get their season back on track.Ed AaronsBrighton v Tottenham, Saturday 3pm3Will Postecoglou favour Wood or Jesus?Chris Wood will have surely cursed the sacking of Nuno Espírito Santo at Nottingham Forest. The New Zealander played the best football of his career under the Portuguese manager, who made the striker the focal point of his attack. It would be a brave move for Ange Postecoglou to drop Wood against Burnley, one of the 33-year-old’s former sides, but Forest’s new manager typically favours a more mobile forward, capable of an aggressive press. Wood was absent as Forestcrashed out of the Carabao Cup at Swanseabut Postecoglou will at least have taken heart from the two goals scored by the Brazilian striker Igor Jesus, a summer arrival, before Forest collapsed to defeat. Despite his excellent record for Forest, Wood is now under pressure to perform in a tactical system that might not be suited to his needs.MBBurnley vNottingham Forest, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenIgor Jesus, who played for Botafogo at the Club World Cup, bagged two goals for Forest against Swansea in midweek.Photograph: Ritchie Sumpter/Nottingham Forest FC/Getty Images4Dissent and demoralisation at West HamIt remains to be seen how many West Ham fans turn up to protest against the club’s deeply unpopular board before Saturday afternoon’s home game against Crystal Palace. However big the demonstration is, though, there is no doubt that supporters have turned. West Ham have not won at home since February and it could get ugly if Palace, who have not lost at the London Stadium since 2018, go ahead. The pressure is on. Graham Potter has to find a way to lift his side afterlast weekend’s defeat to Spurs. Unity is a long way off but the organisers of the protesters want West Ham fans to stick with the team.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham vCrystal Palace, Saturday 3pm5Patience with Amorim running outA total of 31 points from 31 league games in charge means Ruben Amorim’sManchester Unitedtenure is sinking fast. To stop floundering the head coach needs wins; executive patience will soon expire, make no mistake. Three points against a Chelsea team who arrive as Club World Cup champions and undefeated in the league is a difficult ask but if the match is lost then United will have to beat Brentford and Sunderland in the next two outings. After those two matches is the trip to Liverpool, on 19 October, which looks ominous.Jamie JacksonManchester United vChelsea, Saturday 5.30pmView image in fullscreenRuben Amorim (centre) and Manchester United face another tough fixture against Chelsea this weekend.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock6Wolves opt for stability and PereiraWolves believe this season will be different. This time last year Gary O’Neil was weeks into a new four-year contract but wassacked four months later. Now Wolves are preparing to reward Vítor Pereira with a new three-year deal despite a pointless start to the campaign. Wolves, who host Leeds on Saturday, are bottom of the table after losing their opening four league matches. Pereira transformed Wolves last season, in effect leading them to safety with a couple of months to spare, and the chairman, Jeff Shi, believes stability will help the club prosper again. “We need a coach to stay here and help us for a long time,“ Shi said in a recent interview. “Every coach needs time for the jigsaw to be made.”Ben FisherWolves v Leeds, Saturday 3pmskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few managers are more adept than Marco Silva at making decisive substitutions. Rodrigo Muniz and Emile Smith Rowe have stepped off the bench to score late equalisersagainst BrightonandManchester Unitedrespectively this season and Kevin, the new signing from Shakhtar Donetsk, impressed after coming on for his debut during last week’slate win over Leeds. Brentford, then, will be wary of Silva’s wiles when they make the short trip to Craven Cottage on Saturday evening. They will remember being stung in this fixture last season, losing a 1-0 lead after Harry Wilson came onto score twice in stoppage-time. As if that was not bad enough Fulham did it again in the reverse fixture, Tom Cairney and Wilson coming on in the second halfto turn a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 lead. Brentford will know not to take anything for granted.JSFulham vBrentford, Saturday 8pm8Handling Woltemade is a tall orderThree-quarters of Bournemouth’s first-choice defence departed the club this summer in Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi but, after three wins from four, the Cherries seem stronger than ever. The ease with which the 18-year-old centre-back Veljko Milosavljevic has slotted in alongside his partner Marcos Senesi has been striking; the new signing signed for the club on deadline day and made only 27 first-team appearances for Red Star Belgrade before his £13m move to the Premier League. Milosavljevic marshalled Danny Welbeck and Stefanos Tzimas expertly in the win against Brighton but if the Serbian retains his place ahead of another of Bournemouth’s new additions, Bafodé Diakité, he faces a different prospect altogether in Nick Woltemade. The 6ft 6in Newcastle striker showedagainst Wolveshe is both an aerial threat and a nimble forward able to link the play, somewhere between a classic No 9 and a second striker. Containing the big German will be key in deciding if Bournemouth continue their excellent start.MBBournemouth v Newcastle, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenNick Woltemade scored on his Newcastle debut against Wolves.Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock9Roefs’ excellence bars Villa’s pathWill Sunday’s trip to the Stadium of Light prove to be the start of a positive reset forAston Villa? Or might it signal the beginning of the biggest crisis of Unai Emery’s tenure at the club? Emery’s cause would be aided appreciably if his side could score a first league goal of the season. The only problem is that Sunderland have collected seven points from their opening four league games and possess the outstanding Robin Roefs in goal. They say there are no “steals” in the European transfer market any more but the 22-year-old cost a modest initial £9m, potentially rising to £11.5m, when Sunderland signed him from NEC Nijmegen this summer. On the convincing evidence of his first four games it is no surprise that a keeper who has played for the Netherlands at every junior level and starred for the under-21s in the recent European Championships has now graduated to the Dutch senior squad.Louise TaylorSunderland v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm10Arteta to stick with impressive Mosquera?The praise has been flooding in for Cristhian Mosquera after his impressive performance against Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday night. “He’s still so young,” said Jurriën Timber afterArsenal’s 2-0 win. “It looks so easy for him, winning his duels and on the ball as well. It’s great to have him next to me, and he has a bright future as well.” Signed from Valencia for an initial £13m, the Spain Under-21 international looks like one of best value summer deals having filled in admirably for the injured William Saliba. The Frenchman has been back in training this week after limping off against Liverpool with an ankle injury before the international break. The question is whether Mikel Arteta will bring Saliba back or stick with Mosquera for the meeting with Manchester City.EAArsenal vManchester City, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool45122Arsenal4893Tottenham Hotspur4794AFC Bournemouth4195Chelsea4686Everton4277Sunderland4278Man City4469Crystal Palace43610Newcastle40511Fulham4-1512Brentford4-2413Brighton4-2414Man Utd4-3415Nottm Forest4-4416Leeds4-5417Burnley4-3318West Ham4-7319Aston Villa4-4220Wolverhampton4-70Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolEvertonBrighton & Hove AlbionBurnleyTottenham HotspurNottingham ForestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But knowing Hull KR’s coach, Willie Peters, as we do, you suspect he will have already turned his attention to winning the Grand Final in a month’s time.Because what felt like a formality for most of this season ended up becoming a nerve-shredding final few weeks. The Robins have set high standards throughout 2025 but in recent weeks they have began to stutter. They needed just one point from their final two games to secure top, but a shock loss to Wakefield last week meant it went to the final round.Then, with 15 minutes remaining here, they trailed a spirited and youthfulWarringtonWolves side 20-16 and the prospect of top spot going to Wigan on Friday evening was suddenly not out of the question. But good teams find a way, and after Arthur Mourgue’s long-range try put Hull KR back in front, May sealed it.“It obviously got worrying towards the back end but I was comfortable,” Peters said. “We’ve not been shy about saying we want to go after trophies. There’s been two on offer and we’ve won two … but there’s one to go.” That is the Grand Final, with Hull KR now hosting the lowest-ranked winner from next weekend in a bid to reach Old Trafford again.They overcame a sluggish start here to lead 16-6 with a try from May and two from Noah Booth. At that stage, you felt they would close it out with minimal fuss. However, Warrington, whose season was over weeks ago, deserve immense credit for silencing a Craven Park crowd who came for a party but were left clinging to the edges of their seats.First, Sam Stone collected a Ewan Irwin kick before two tries in six minutes courtesy of Adam Holroyd and Josh Thewlis turned the game on its head. Suddenly, Warrington led 20-16 and a huge upset was possible. The loudest cheers probably came across the Pennines from Wigan, who suddenly thought they could claim top with a big win over Leeds on Friday.But ultimately, the Robins held their nerve when it mattered as Mourgue broke free to put them back ahead, before May’s second clinched victory and sparked jubilant scenes.

Max Verstappen won the race but McLaren’s decisionto have Piastri return second place to Norris, after the British driver lost the position due to a slow pit stop caused by a faulty wheel gun, was contentious.Lando Norris defends team orders after McLaren hand him Oscar Piastri’s placeRead moreWith Norris claiming second place he gained three points on his teammate in the championship standings, narrowing the gap to 31 points. Many fans were aggrieved at the perceived manipulation of the result and the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, warned that the team’s use of team orders in an effort to be as fair as possible to both drivers risked setting precedents that would become increasingly hard to manage in the title run-in.Speaking before this weekend’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Piastri was confident that ultimately it would be the drivers, not the team, that decided the title fight. “I do think we have enough freedom to control our own destiny in the championship,” Piastri said. “Naturally there have been thoughts, we have had good discussions with the team. We have clarified a lot of things, we know how we will go racing going forwards.”When asked to move over at Monza the Australian had questioned the call, noting on the team radio: “We said that a slow pit-stop was part of racing, so I don’t really get what changed here”. In Baku he said he stuck by his words but went on to explain that the slow stop had not been the sole rationale behind McLaren’s actions.“That is a decision we’ve made, that a slow pit stop is a part of racing,” he said. “In the car, the context wasn’t there about what else had happened in terms of the pit stop sequencing.“There was another factor outside of the slow pit stop, being the order we pitted in. That was a contributing factor to why we swapped. We can’t plan for every scenario but we are very aligned and I respect the team’s decisions and trust they will do their best to make the right one.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris in his McLaren during the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Norris finished second after his team ordered him and Piastri to swap places.Photograph: Jay Hirano/ShutterstockNorris said he too was confident the team would not play a significant role in the title battle. “We both agreed with it after and accepted that’s what we agree as a team,” he said. “The team try and keep things fair between us but there’s not been many things where they’ve had to actually get involved and do anything to help one or the other.”Wolff, who managed what became a bitter and acrimonious fight between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes, had said he believed McLaren were setting up a potentially incendiary situation. “You set a precedent that is very difficult to undo,” he said after Monza. “What if the team makes another mistake and it’s not a pit stop. Do you switch them around?”Many fans were equally displeased, with Norris receiving some booing on the podium at Monza, but Piastri was happy the team had made an acceptable call.“If we had done the opposite thing, then you’d have the opposite half of the fans saying that that was wrong and vice versa,” he said, “So ultimately there’s no correct decision. Am I surprised [by the backlash]? Not really. I guess it’s a big moment from the race and I feel like a lot of fans are quite quick to jump on things that are deemed controversial.”McLaren go into the race with the chance of sealing their second consecutive constructors’ championship and their 10th in total, with a record of the earliest point in a season, with seven races still remaining. They lead Ferrari in second by 337 points and will take the title if they outscore them by nine points and are not outscored by Mercedes by 12 points or Red Bull by 33 points.Explore more on these topicsOscar PiastriFormula OneLando NorrisAustralia sportMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The£25bn NICs increaseat last year’s budget prompted a furious backlash from business groups.Two members of the committee, Swati Dhingra and Prof Alan Taylor, voted for another quarter-point rate cut this month. The MPC’s decision to hold rates widens the gulf between its stance and that of the US Federal Reserve, whichreduced interest ratesby a quarter of a point on Wednesday, its first rate cut since December.Bailey also announced that the Bank would slow the pace of reductions to its balance sheet through quantitative tightening (QT), which involves selling off the government bonds the Bank accumulated through the emergency policy of quantitative easing after the 2008 financial crisis.Threadneedle Street has come under pressure to moderate QT amid volatile yields – effectively the interest rate – on government bonds, known as gilts.The Bank has acknowledged that QT has put some upward pressure on gilt yields, which affect the cost of borrowing for the Treasury, and critics have accused it of distorting fragile bond markets. Given the gilts are now being sold at a loss, the policy also has an impact on the public finances.In the past year the Bank has been aiming to reduce its stock of government bonds by £100bn. This has involved selling off gilts as well as retiring others when they reach maturity.In Thursday’s announcement, which was widely anticipated by markets, the Bank opted to cut the planned reduction in its stock for the year ahead to £70bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The new target means the MPC can continue to reduce the size of the Bank’s balance sheet in line with its monetary policy objectives while continuing to minimise the impact on gilt market conditions.”However, with fewer bonds in the Bank’s portfolio set to mature in the next 12 months, the pace of Bank bond sales will actually increase, to about £21bn, from £13bn in the current year.Pointing to recent volatility in global government bond markets, the minutes of the MPC meeting said that “although the UK gilt market had continued to function in an orderly manner, these factors could pose a risk that QT would have a greater impact on market functioning than previously”.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the Bank’s decision, adding that it should continue to liaise with the Debt Management Office, which issues government debt, “to ensure the Bank’s operations do not impact on the government’s wider gilt issuance strategy”.Rising interest costs on government debt are one of the factors likely to put her on course tobreak her fiscal rules, in forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility before the 26 November budget.As well as reducing the overall target for QT, the Bank said it would shift the balance of bond sales towards shorter-term gilts. The OBR recently warned that the decline in defined-benefit pensions had undermined demand for the longest-dated government bonds.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesBank of EnglandMonetary policy committeeEconomicsInflationEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)newsShareReuse this content"

This case has made me feel very threatened and makes me feel like I am having to look over my shoulder all the time.”Friel said she felt she and her teenage daughter were in danger. “I don’t want to feel like a victim in my own home and a neighbourhood I’ve lived in for years. I am very disappointed he was given a warning the first time around and it didn’t stop him.“He has created turmoil, anxiety, the fear of the unknown. I try to keep my personal life private and he has invaded that.”She said the case had been “incredibly time consuming at a time when I want to put my full focus in work”.Jai Patel, prosecuting, said Friel was first approached by Appleton in 2022 when she was on a walk with her daughter in Windsor, Berkshire. He claimed to have worked on television sets with her and Friel, mistakenly thinking she knew him, gave him her email.Friel began to receive regular emails from Appleton. “He said he loved Ms Friel and he missed her, he invited her to breakfast, lunch and dinner at his home,” Patel said. “He told friends he was going to marry Ms Friel.”In December 2022, Appleton attempted to join a health club Friel attended and the following month referred to her as “the perfect wife”. He said he was in bed naked thinking of her and sent a selfie showing his bare torso.She reported Appleton to the police. He was arrested and warned that his behaviour was unwanted. The court heard that Friel did not make a statement or seek a prosecution, thinking a warning would be sufficient.In December 2023, Appleton turned up at Friel’s home wearing a dinner jacket and said he was taking her to a ball. Friel’s daughter asked Appleton to leave, which he did, but came back a year later in December 2024. He looked up at Friel’s security cameras, mouthed: “I love you” and held up a ring.He returned the next morning and Friel called the police. Before they could get to him, he went back to Friel’s house for the third time in 48 hours. The actor heard knocking at her front door and opened it. She screamed, shut the door and called the police. He was arrested that evening.In August, Appleton, who now lives in Essex, admitted stalking. James Bloomer KC, for Appleton, said his client’s behaviour was troubling and he felt sorry and ashamed.As well as imposing restrictions on his movements, the judge sentenced Appleton to a 24-month community order, which included completing 10 “rehabilitation activity requirement” days.Survivors of stalking, campaigners for women’s safety and heads of law enforcement have raised concerns over continuing failings by police inEnglandand Wales to tackle perpetrators and protect victims.Theywarnthat while some forces are doing innovative work on stalking, others are not improving quickly enough, leading to a “patchwork” service and victims facing a “postcode lottery”.Friel, 49, rose to fame as Beth Jordache in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside. She has beenpraised for her performancein the dramaUnforgivable, which was released on the BBC in the summer.Explore more on these topicsSexual harassmentEnglandCrimeTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

We are steadfast in our commitment to ensure we do not repeat the inadequacies identified in the public inquiry.

In summer, hundreds of tourists flock there, hiking to the red and white lighthouse on its southern tip before diving into the clear waters. In winter, its population dwindles to 10. The island’s rocky ridges are coated with thickets of rosemary and juniper, and in warmer months the air is sweetened by flowers and the gentle hum of bees.“Residents are people who like fishing, or being alone, or who have retired.

They were seeking a unique open-air laboratory to answer a question that has long intrigued ecologists: could honeybees be causing their wild bee cousins to decline?To answer this, they carried out a radical experiment. While Giannutri is too far from the mainland for honeybees to fly to it, 18 hives were set up on the island in 2018: a relatively contained, recently established population. Researchers got permission to shut the hives down, effectively removing most honeybees from the island.View image in fullscreenPunta San Francesco, a popular spot with hikers on the island. Photograph: Alessandro CiniWhen the study began, the island’s human population temporarily doubled in size, as teams of scientists fanned out across the scrubland tracking bees. Then came the ban: they closed hives on selected days during the peak foraging period, keeping the honeybees in their hives for 11 hours a day. Local people were sceptical. “For them, we were doing silly and useless things,” says Dapporto. But the results were compelling.“‘Wow,’ was my first response,” says the lead researcher, Lorenzo Pasquali, from the University of Florence. When the data came together, “all the results were pointing in the same direction”.View image in fullscreenA wide variety of plant species thrive on Giannutri. Photograph: Giuseppe NucciThe findings,published in Current Biologyearlier this year, found that over the four years after the honeybees were introduced, populations of two vital wild pollinators – bumblebees and anthophora – fell by “an alarming” 80%. When the honeybees were locked up, there was 30% more pollen for other pollinators, and the wild bee species were sighted more frequently. Scientists observed that the wild species appeared to take their time pollinating flowers during the lockups, displaying different foraging behaviour. “The effect is visible,” says Dapporto.Global bee battleIn terms of sheer abundance, the western honeybee (Apis mellifera) is the world’smost importantsingle species of pollinator in wild ecosystems.Originally native to Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe, honeybees have been shipped around the planet by humansto every continentexcept Antarctica. The battles playing out on this small Italian island are likely to be echoed in ecosystems everywhere.While the number of honeybeesis increasing(driven by commercial beekeeping) native pollinators are declining globally due to habitat loss, climate breakdown and use of chemicals in farming. But we are only beginning to understand how the great honeybee boom could also take a toll on wild pollinators.View image in fullscreenHoneybees compete with wild pollinators for limited food sources in ecosystems around the world. Photograph: Giuseppe NucciIn southern Spain, where honeybee numbers have more than tripled since the 1960s,researchshows managed honeybees spilling into flower-rich woodlands after the orange crop has bloomed. The result: increased competition with wild pollinators.During California’s annual almond bloom, about90% of the US’s managed honeybees are recruited in to pollinate, with beekeepers trucking hives across the country to meet demand. “For this approximately month-long period, the impact of honeybees on native pollinators is likely huge,” says Dillon Travis from the University of California San Diego. During the off season – when honeybees are less in demand – beekeepers often keep them in wild ecosystems. “Native pollinators need to compete with millions of honeybees for limited food sources.”View image in fullscreenMost of the US’s managed honeybees are recruited in to pollinate during California’s almond bloom. Photograph: John Schreiber/AlamyIf conditions are right, honeybees go feral and set up colonies in the wild. A 2018 study looking at the presence of honeybees in natural ecosystems found them in89% of sites.In California, feral honeybees are increasingly turning up in vast numbers in natural ecosystems hundreds of miles away from the almond fields.Honeybee takeoversEach spring, after the winter rains, San Diego’s coastal scrub landscape bursts into life. Sagebrush, white sage and buckwheat unfurl their leaves, throwing sweet aromas into the hot air. These sights and smells greeted graduate student Keng-Lou James Hung when he started studying this area of southern California in 2011, aged 22, after a well-regarded biologist told him it was one of the richest bee habitats on Earth.View image in fullscreenKeng-Lou James Hung in southern California, where he discovered that feral honeybees removed about 80% of pollen during the first day a flower opened. Photograph: Jena DonnellThe landscape has all the hallmarks of a pristine ecosystem: no tractor has tilled the land, no cattle grazed it; few humans tread here. “You can equate it to primary growth Amazonian rainforest in terms of how intact and undisturbed the ecosystem is,” says Hung.It’s like a local grocery store trying to compete against Walmart. Once they’ve escaped there’s little we can do to stop honeybeesKeng-Lou James HungWhen Hung began his research, however, what he discovered flummoxed him. “I got to my field sites and all I was seeing were honeybees,” he remembers. “Imagine as an avid birder: you get to a pristine forest and all you are seeing are feral pigeons. That’s what was going on with me when I set foot in this habitat. It came as a shock.” Honeybees were everywhere – nesting in utility boxes, ground squirrel burrows and rock crevices.View image in fullscreenThe coastal scrub landscape of southern California, where feral honeybees thrive. Photograph: Keng-Lou James HungIn July, Hung – now an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma – published a paper finding 98% of all bee biomass (ie, the weight of all bees) in that area were feral honeybees. They removed about 80% of pollen during the first day a flower opened,according to the paper, published in the journalInsect Conservation and Diversity.Such high rates of pollen extraction leave little for the more than 700 species of native bees in the region, which need pollen to raise their offspring. Some of those species have not been seen for decades.Hung believes honeybees’ social structure gives them the edge. Using the “hive mind”, they communicate the locations of plants and remove most of the pollen early in the morning before native bees begin searching for food. Most other bees operate as single agents, making decisions in isolation.“It’s like a local grocery store trying to compete against Walmart,” says Hung. “Once they’ve escaped and established themselves there’s very little we can do to really stop honeybees. They’re very powerful and resilient creatures.”View image in fullscreenCactus bees collect pollen from the prickly pear cactus. Photograph: Keng-Lou James HungIn 1956, some experimental“Africanised” honeybeeswereaccidentally releasedfrom a research apiary in São Paulo, Brazil, spreading out across south and Central Americaand into California. Their expansion has been described as one of the “most spectacular biological invasions of all time”.Wider ecological effectsHabitat fragmentation, chemical use in farming and rising temperatures are key drivers of pollinator declines, but in areas such as in San Diego it is likely honeybees are also a significant contributing factor. “It is very difficult to imagine a scenario where a single species can remove four-fifths of all the pollen … without having too much of an impact on that ecosystem,” says Hung.Not only is it bad for native wild bees, it can have effects throughout the ecosystem.Women behind the lens: the female beekeepers who hold ‘the keys to a better world’Read moreStudies have confirmed that plants in San Diego county areless healthywhen pollinated by non-native honeybees. Potential impacts include fewer seeds germinating, and those that do may be smaller and produce fewer flowers. “This may create an ‘extinction vortex’,” says Travis, where less-healthy plants breed over generations until they can no longer survive. “I am unaware of any studies that determined that honeybees are beneficial where they are not native, excluding agricultural areas,” he says.In some parts of Australia and America – where honeybees are not native – they can reach densities of up to 100 colonies per square kilometre. In regions such asEurope, where they are native, the picture is different.View image in fullscreenWild European honeybees in Monmouthshire, Wales. About a fifth of the UK’s honeybee population is estimated to be wild. Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyThere are about75,000 free-livinghoneybee colonies across the UK, according to research last year, which was the first to quantify the density of these colonies. Based on these estimates, more than 20% of the UK’s honeybee population could be wild-living. “In Europe, the honeybee is a native species and low densities of wild-living colonies are natural components of many ecosystems,” says researcher Oliver Visick from the University of Sussex.Visick has found densities of up to four wild-living colonies per square kilometre in historic deer parks in Sussex and Kent. “At these densities, wild-living colonies are unlikely to have a negative impact on other wild pollinators,” he says.In ecosystems where honeybees are introduced, scientists say there should be more guidance on where large-scale beekeepers keep their hives after crops have bloomed to reduce their impact on native species. In other areas, such as islands, relocation or removal may be feasible.The honeybee-free islandOn Giannutri, when researchers told national park authorities their results they banned bee-keeping on the island.The island, which is part of the Tuscan Archipelago national park, has been honeybee-free for more than a year and may now serve as a cautionary tale to other protected areas planning to introduce honeybees. Since the hives were removed, at least one of the species scientists have been monitoring appears to have slightly increased.View image in fullscreenWhen the honeybees were locked up, there was 30% more pollen on Giannutri for other pollinators. Photograph: Giuseppe NucciThe story unfolding on this little Italian island and the scrublands of San Diego shows that honeybees may not be the universal environmental stewards we paint them to be, and challenges the popular view that they are the best way to save nosediving pollinator numbers. Unchecked, they can cast a long shadow over fragile ecosystems that some might believe they help preserve.When the scientists returned to Giannutri,“It was a bit weird to go back to the island this year without the honeybees around. We were used to seeing them everywhere all over the island,” says Pasquali. “I was happy to observe the island in this new condition.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionBeesItalyInsectsEuropeWildlifeBiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The area around the world affected by wildfires has actuallydecreasedin the past two decades, mainly due to changing agricultural practices, but, crucially, the number of people exposed to fires has significantly grown in this time.The climate crisis is the driving force behind the trend of larger, fiercer fires, according to Minghao Qiu, an atmospheric researcher at Stony Brook University. “More warming and higher fuel aridity means that the vegetation gets drier, therefore higher wildfire risks,” he said.Qiu led the US-focused research,published in Nature, that found that just over 71,000 people are expected to die annually in the country by 2050 due to wildfire smoke on current warming trends.California, scene of many huge firesincluding current blazesthat threaten the state’s storied sequoia trees, will bear the brunt of these deaths but the smoke will also take a major toll in states such as New York and Texas, the research found.If emissions aren’t cut, the US could suffer annual economic damages of $608bn by 2050 due to wildfire smoke, more than all other climate hazards combined, the authors estimated.“Wildfire smoke is by far the largest in terms of overall health damages and that’s a new finding,” said Marshall Burke, an environmental scientist at Stanford and study co-author. “The numbers are really striking.”Wildfires are an increasing global problem, too, with huge blazes seen in countries such as Canada, Spain and Portugal this year. Much of the harm from smoke is set to be inflicted upon Africa, however, according to another new study,also published in Nature, by an international team of scientists.The research estimates that worldwide 1.4 million people will die by the end of the century due to wildfire smoke, about six times more than the present death toll, but that this burden will fall unequally. While the US and Europe could suffer a doubling in wildfire smoke deaths, Africa is expected to be worst affected, with 11 times more fire-related deaths compared with current norms.Longterm wildfire smoke risk will be lessened if the world finally manages to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the death toll for the coming decades will be influenced more by shorter-term adaptation, Burke said.“If we want to reduce impacts in the next 30 years, mitigation is important, but it’s actually not the key lever,” he said.“The two key levers are reducing extreme wildfire activity through other approaches, so fuels management, and second, making sure we are well protected when smoke events happen. Right now we are not very well protected.”Explore more on these topicsUS wildfiresHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Stefan Uhlenbrook, the director of the hydrology, water and cryosphere division of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), said: “This is existential for some regions.”View image in fullscreenPeople walk on the dry bed of the Solimões River, in the Manacapuru region of Amazonas, Brazil, in October 2024.Photograph: Raphael Alves/EPALast year was thehottest on record, with the mean surface temperature reaching 1.55C above preindustrial levels.

This has a huge impact on the ecology – wildlife and vegetation are not getting water available when they need it.”Governments could take a variety of measures to reduce the impact of the extreme swings in the water cycle. These include reducing greenhouse gas emissions rapidly; improving water storage by building reservoirs or restoring wetlands that act as sponges to retain water for use in droughts and reduce the impact of flooding; and encouraging changes to farming techniques to make the most of the water available.Early warning systems can also save lives when severe weather hits and cooperation among governments can improve preparation. But the report’s authors warned that governments were failing to act on the issues. “This is not getting sufficient political attention. Investments in preparation pay back for society. Governments should see this as a valuable investment,” said Uhlenbrook.“If we are not taking proactive measures now, this will cost more in the future,” added Lucy Barker, a senior analyst at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisFloodingDroughtExtreme weatherUnited NationsGlaciersGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, she meets a dead end where the sea has snatched the land and is instead greeted with a big red warning sign of what is to come: Danger Coastal Erosion.“You can see gardens that were there and now they’re gone,” she says.The north-east coast ofScotlandis experiencing a rapidly worsening erosion problem that will only be exacerbated by recurrent patterns of extreme weather and rising sea levels.Johnshaven, a small village with a close-knit community of 640 people about 30 miles (48km) south ofAberdeen, is particularly exposed.The village’s paths bear the scars of coastal erosion in the form of craters in the well-trodden rock, while some, such as the one Duthie points to, have disappeared altogether. The latest was taken from the village in 2023 during one of the many extreme storms that winter.Finding a solution to the problem has taken on an urgency like never before. Three years ago came the announcement of the Platinum Jubilee Path, named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II’s 70 years on the throne. The aim is for it to start in St Cyrus, four miles south of Johnshaven, and end about 90 miles further north in Cullen, a village with close associations to Robert the Bruce.View image in fullscreenJohnshaven, on Scotland’s North Sea coast, will attract more visitors if it has a well maintained coastal pathWith the markets that have traditionally fuelled its economy – fishing and oil and gas – dwindling, Johnshaven wants to attract more visitors through the coastal path plans. The aim is to be part of Scotland’sGreat Trails, which offers a map of named, walkable trails around Scotland. Currently, there is a gap in the map along the north-east coast between Aberdeen and Dundee, and Johnshaven sits in the middle of it.For Duthie, 71, helping to fill this gap is an increasingly daunting task. She is part of a small team called theMearns Coastal Heritage Trail(Merchat) who work to restore and create coastal paths in Aberdeenshire. But as they work in one area, the sea snatches land away in another.“A lot of what we are trying to do is to prevent erosion with rock armour, which is really the only secure method,” she says.Rock armour, sometimes known as riprap, is made up of big boulders and rocks placed along the coastline to protect against the waves.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClear signs of coastal erosion in Johnshaven, top and above left. Creels in the street reflect the village’s fishing heritageTo complete areas of the trail, Merchat has had to gain funding through grant applications. The food ingredients firm Macphie has donated £30,000, and a further £40,000 has come from Aberdeenshire council’s allocation of crown estate Scotland cash from the Coastal Communities Fund, money allocated by the government to help coastal communities “flourish and strengthen their appeal as places to live, work and visit”.Caspar Lampkin, project officer for the Aberdeenshire coastal paths on Benholm and Johnshaven community council, says further help from Aberdeenshire council is likely to be minimal. “They’ve told us that they don’t have the resources to do anything,” he says.“If small villages want anything like this to happen, it has got to be locally led, because we’re not going to get much help from the government or the local council.”View image in fullscreenCaspar Lampkin, the community council’s project officer for coastal paths, is trying to secure funding to help counter erosionSince April, Duthie, Lampkin and the Merchat team have been working to establish a way to apply for designated funding. “We have now started a charity called the North East Scotland Coastal Trust [Nescat] and we are paddling very fast to get the whole thing established and get going with it,” says Duthie.Meanwhile, another issue beyond access to the beautiful scenery is becoming increasingly urgent, says Lampkin. The community council has identified 100 houses in the village at risk of flooding from the sea in the coming years if no action is taken on erosion.If it’s a high tide, it’s stormy and there’s wind, those elements blow water in the houseAngie DunsireWhile the focus of the team’s work is meant to be on restoring the paths, he says that any funding they get will probably need to be used on rock armour in areas that could protect housing along the path.Angie Dunsire, 74, walks no more than 10 steps from her doorstep before reaching the eroding coast.She has lived in Johnshaven for 32 years on the aptly named Beach Road. She says she gets a call from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency every time there is a risk of flooding.As Storm Floris approached in August, they called. “You have to be careful and listen,” she says. “We had a little bit [of water] in [the house] the other day because if it’s a high tide, it’s stormy and there’s wind, those elements blow it in.”Dunsire is scared of what the North Sea is capable of. In the distance there is a reminder. Sitting only three miles from Johnshaven is Miltonhaven – or what is left of it.It is reported by Duncan Fraser, in the book Portrait of a Parish, written in the 1970s about the parish of St Cyrus, that Miltonhaven was taken by the North Sea after Robert Scott of Dunninald arrived in the village in the 1700s.View image in fullscreenThe remains of the ‘lost’ village of Miltonhaven, once a bustling coastal community populated by smugglers, lime workers and fishers. Photograph: Andrew Diack/geograph.org.uk“What first drew his attention was the limestone rock that stretched in a reef across the bay, like a natural breakwater guarding the little village from the angry sea,” writes Fraser.Scott was from a family that built lime kilns to produce fertiliser for fields. From about 1750 Scott removed most of this limestone rock for his business, so the story goes, leaving the village exposed.Polar heritage sites are slipping into the sea – but can one island live forever online?Read moreBy the 1790s, Fraser wrote, the waves had taken the “entire village”, which now lies underwater 100 yards from the shore.In an effort to right some of those so easily visible wrongs from the past, the stretch of path along Johnshaven’s Beach Road will be the first focus for rock armour with any funding the community can muster. But rock armour is expensive – about £1,000 for a small truckload – so it’s likely there won’t be much left over for path building.“People say, well it’s just your houses why go to all this expense?” says Dunsire. “Well it’s not just our houses it’s the road that goes right through the village to the park and further on.“We’re supposed to be using the coastal path and extending that. What is the point if this [the land and road along the coast] goes?”A Scottish government spokesperson says it has provided local authorities with £11.7m to support coastal change adaptation, while Aberdeenshire council says its overall budget for coast protection is £75,000 and there are no plans for any new protection works in Johnshaven. It says support and advice has been given in the setting up of Nescat and that it is not aware of any issues with the part of Beach Road that is council owned.View image in fullscreenNorth Sea waves batter sea defences at Johnshaven.

Where they do have information, they’re not utilising that to mitigate and manage that risk. And what that means, sadly, is that women and children are at risk of violence in some way, largely perpetrated by men on probation.“The probation service is managing 160,000 offenders in the community. We have found that two-thirds of those cases – around 100,000 cases – are not being managed properly … So we are talking about tens of thousands of people who pose a risk to women and girls.”Referring to the case ofDamien Bendall, who was categorised as “low risk” by probation staff before murdering an entire family in 2021, Jones warned there would be further examples of serious failings by the Probation Service without urgent reforms.He said: “It’s inevitable that the deficit in public protection leads to increased risk to the public, and I would anticipate that unless it is properly tackled, you will see an increase in the number of serious further offences that are taking place.”Plans were outlined in the sentencing bill to increase the number of offenders monitored through electronic tagging. Last week the government announced that up to 22,000 more offenders would be tagged each year, under its“plan for change”.Jones said tagging should not be seen as easy to oversee or a way of reducing serious crime. He said: “Bendall wore a tag but it did not prevent his crimes. And with most offenders, they need help tackling addiction, getting somewhere to live and get a job. Tagging does not help them either.”He said the ability to share information was vital for improving public protection. “If probation don’t understand the risk that somebody poses – that you don’t understand who, for example, is living in a house and the risk of domestic abuse – then you will end up with more tragedies.”Jones’s team has conducted more than 40 inspections of probation offices, which assessed their duty to protect the public, and each one was rated as “inadequate” or “requires improvement”.In one case examined by Jones’s inspectors, police had been called out to the address of a domestic abuse perpetrator 11 times in five years. The probation service knew children were in the house but had not asked the police for any more detail about the incidents and did not understand enough about how the partner of this perpetrator and their children were at risk.In another, probation officers found that a man who posed a risk to his partner and children received no response when they visited his home three times. Staff should have questioned why he was avoiding visits but did not escalate their concerns with children’s services.Jones said the watchdog’s inspectors would suspend all of their usual inspections of probation offices for six months to concentrate on public protection.The MoJ has been approached for comment.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Prosecutors said the alleged cyber-attack resulted in a £39m loss for TfL as well as a “loss of livelihood” for people dependent on TfL licences. The operation of major TfL transport services was not affected.The NCA said in a statement that it believed the hack was carried out by members of an online hacking community known as Scattered Spider.Paul Foster, the head of the NCA’s national cyber crime unit, said: “Today’s charges are a key step in what has been a lengthy and complex investigation. This attack caused significant disruption and millions in losses to TfL, part of the UK’s critical national infrastructure.“Earlier this year, the NCA warned of an increase in the threat from cybercriminals based in the UK and other English-speaking countries, of which Scattered Spider is a clear example. The NCA, UK policing and our international partners, including the FBI, are collectively committed to identifying offenders within these networks and ensuring they face justice.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Scotland Yard said it would not disclose the nationalities of those involved.Last year, Ken McCallum, the head ofMI5, warned that Russia’s GRU – its intelligence agency – was engaged in a campaign to “generate mayhem on British and European streets” using proxies that “further reduces the professionalism of their operations”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

A 34% rise in consultation fees is not just a statistic. It shows how private talking therapies are moving further out of reach for many people who need them.”While many people are seeking help from a psychologist in private practice, the survey of 349 practitioners found that doing so can involve high prices, long waits and online-only care. The findings include:The average cost of a consultation in the UK has risen from £96 in 2022 to £129.20 in 2025.Psychologists in England charge the most (£131) per session and those in Scotland the least (£124).Those in Scotland have the shortest waiting times (16.9 days), and people in Wales the longest (23.8 days).Leicester-based psychologists charge an average of £164 for a session, with London second on £160. Colchester, Bath and Coventry charge £85, £99 and £100 respectively.Steele advised people seeking help to shop around and be prepared to accept online support provided far from their home in order to beat delays and pay less.The British Psychological Society, which represents 19,000 of the UK’s 27,774 psychologists, said they had increased their charges to help cover rises in the cost of living.A spokesperson said: “With the continuing postcode lottery for accessing NHS mental health support, increasing numbers are seeking out private treatment. This is causing private providers to reach capacity and [be] unable to take on new clients.

The overall UN core or regular budget would be cut from $3.7bn to about $3.2bn next year. It means reductions of 15.1% in resources and 18.8% in posts in the regular budget compared with the 2025 budget.The reductions to the UN core budget do not take account of the cuts to the UN’s peacekeeping, humanitarian and health agencies. Only last year the UN secretary general, António Guterres, set the UN on an ambitious new “pact for the future” ranging across artificial intelligence and a new push on sustainable development.A UN largely without the US is not the legacy that Guterres would want to leave his successor, due to take over in 2027 when Guterres will end his eight-year term as the world’s top diplomat. But his options are limited since the current US antagonism towards the UN is so ingrained. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, for instance, has claimed: “The postwar global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us.”View image in fullscreenUnrwa, the UN’s relief and works agency for Palestinian refugees, hands out bags of flour in Khan Younis in October 2024, prior to Israel’sban on its operation in Gaza. The US has ended funding for Unrwa and tried to close it down.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAGuterres is trying to make a virtue of necessity by using the funding crisis to review how the bureaucracy has grown, leading to overlapping mandates and duplication. It requires an organisation containing more than 140 entities that has passed 40,000 resolutions, statements and presidential statements since its inception in 1946 to revert to first principles about its purpose and effectiveness.The process, billed asUN80, is being led by Guy Ryder, the UN under-secretary general for policy. Ryder will be acutely aware that previous reviews, including one in 2005 and another during the Covid pandemic, largely ran into the ground as bureaucracies and states mounted resistance to what they saw as appeasement to the US.An interim update published in August underscored how too many UN agencies created in the years of plenty have overlapping mandates, confused lines of accountability and outdated working methods. The report said: “Geopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budgets are challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the organisation.“Increased mandates (often without clear exit strategies) and complexities have led to significant overlaps, inefficiencies, and increased costs in the UN system. The progressive proliferation of agencies, funds and programmes has led to a fragmented development system, with overlapping mandates, inefficient use of resources and inconsistent delivery of services.”View image in fullscreenA Unifil vehicle patrols in Marjayoun, southern Lebanon last October. The US was said to have contributed 25% of the UN’s peacekeeping budget, cut this year.Photograph: Karamallah Daher/ReutersThrough a programme known as Mandates UN, all of the UN agencies have been asked to justify their existence, the origin of their mandate and their relationship to other UN entities.The aim broadly is to try to streamline these agencies into three key pillars of the UN charter: peace and security, human rights and development. In the process, some agencies and staff will be blended with others and some will be shrunk.An obvious question, for example, is the relationship between the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration, or that between UNAids and theWorld Health Organization.Relatively mild solutions announced so far include creating new administrative hubs in New York and Bangkok, consolidating payroll into a single global team across New York, Entebbe and Nairobi, relocating some functions from high-cost duty stations such as New York and Geneva to lower-cost locations, or vacating some leased buildings in New York.But hard as these measures are, more is going to be required since the impact of the US withdrawal from multilateralism is only starting to be felt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UN will look at the relationship between UNHCR and IOM in a bid to streamline its operations.Photograph: Jok Solomun/ReutersAllison Lombardo, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs at the US state department, saidat a Carnegie Endowment seminar: “These cuts are more extensive and more permanent than many people thought at first glance … The US pays 22% of the regular budget, 25% of the peacekeeping budget and 40% of the humanitarian budget.”She said the in-year cuts for 2025 proposed by the Trump administration meant “the UN is going to get half of what the US committed to give this year, and likely no peacekeeping money. In 2026 the US is signalling that there will be no peacekeeping money, no voluntary money, and more than an 80% cut in dues. So that is going from $1.5bn to about $300m.”The impact on individual programmes is already apparent. The World Food Programme (WFP) relied on Washington to cover half of its $9bn budget in 2024, while the UNHCR got two-fifths of its funding from the US. The US has not onlyended its fundingfor the UN’s Palestinian welfare agency Unrwa, it has tried to close it down.At a stark briefing this week, Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN Office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (Ocha), said he feared the world had entered a new “age of indifference”.“We’ve only been funded 19% of what we need, which is a 40% drop on where we were last year,” he said, explaining that each of the UN agencies had a tale of woe. “Unicef – an extra 6 million kids are likely to be out of school. WFP are saying they can only reach 1 million of the 3 million Afghans who currently need food. UNHCR are saying that 11 million refugees may no longer get the help that they need.”Fletcher, a former No 10 foreign policy chief, argued the funding crisis was a symptom of a wider battle. He said: “We’re in a situation now where there are many who would like to see the UN being weakened, which, of course, is a reckless act of self-harm. And so we have to push back against this crisis of finance, yes, but also these challenges to our legitimacy and to our confidence.”Explore more on these topicsUnited NationsUS foreign policyAidHumanitarian responseAntónio GuterresWorld Health OrganizationnewsShareReuse this content"

All of them identified as intersex, an umbrella term referring to those with innate variations of sex characteristics and which includes people who identify as trans, non-binary and gender diverse.It found that since 2019, the rates of violence and harassment against intersex people have sharply increased – particularly among those who identify as trans, non-binary and gender diverse – far outpacingthe increases reportedby others in the LGBTQ+ community.One in three surveyed, 34%, said they had been physically or sexually assaulted in the five years prior to the survey, up from 22% in 2019. Between 2019 and 2023,the rate of reported hate-motivated harassment had almost doubled, from 42% to 74%.The survey also found that more than half, 57%, of respondents said they had been subjected “without their informed consent” to surgery or other medical treatment to modify their sex characteristics, while 39% said they were put through so-called conversion practices aimed at changing their sexual orientation or gender, compared with a rate of 25% among all LGBTQ+ groups.The Vienna-based agency linked the rise to a wider climate of “increasing or persisting intolerance and bigotry, as well as intense online hatred campaigns” that had “instrumentalised” the LGBT+ community.“Disinformation campaigns fomenting intolerance and prejudice are often waged by foreign and domestic actors acting to undermine European and western democracies and core values, such as dignity, equality and diversity,” the agency noted.The result was a “weaponising” of the fact that many people know little about those who identify as intersex, trans, non-binary and gender diverse, allowing these campaigns to spread disinformation and “fuel hatred and violence against them”, it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The figure was notably higher than the overall rate of 37% reported across all LGBTIQ groups.The EU agency called on countries to add sex characteristics to the protected grounds in anti-discrimination legislation and do more to combat hate crimes and hate speech aimed at intersex people.Their struggle requires an urgent response, said Sirpa Rautio, the director of the EU’s Agency for Fundamental Rights. “Intersex people in the EU experience alarming levels of exclusion, discrimination and violence,”she said in a statement. “They must be provided with targeted support that addresses their specific needs to ensure they can enjoy their fundamental rights and live in dignity.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderEuropeLGBTQ+ rightsInequalityOnline abuseShareReuse this content"

Honeywell, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Both companies are incorporated in Delaware.The lawsuit appears to be the first in the US over the crash. It seeks unspecified damages for the deaths of Kantaben Dhirubhai Paghadal, Naavya Chirag Paghadal, Kuberbhai Patel and Babiben Patel, who were among the 229 passengers who died.Twelve crew members and 19 people on the ground were also killed.One passenger survived. The plaintiffs are all citizens of India or the UK.Investigators from India, the UK and the US have not conclusively determined the crash’s cause. The AAIB’s preliminary report in July appeared to exonerate Boeing and the engine-maker GE Aerospace, but some family groups have criticised investigators and the press as too focused on the pilots’ actions.In July, Bryan Bedford, the FAA administrator, expressed a “high level of confidence” that a mechanical problem or inadvertent movement of fuel control components was not to blame.Although most crashes are caused by a combination of factors, legal experts say lawyers representing victims’ families tend to target manufacturers because they are not subject to the same limits on liability as airlines.Such strategies can also increase the prospect of using US courts, which are widely seen as being more generous to plaintiffs than many foreign courts.Boeing incurred more than $20bn (£14.6bn) in legal and other costs from two fatal crashes of its737 Max aircraftin 2018 and 2019. The bestselling plane was grounded for 20 months.Explore more on these topicsAirline industryBoeingAir India Ahmedabad plane crashnewsShareReuse this content"

We know who they are.”The first set of clips and photographs, from 18 August, shows men on Libyan patrol boats in balaclavas and uniforms bearing the insignia of the 80th Special Operations Battalion of the 111th Brigade – a militia led by the Libyan deputy defence minister, Abdul Salam Al-Zoubi.View image in fullscreenA photograph taken from a rescue boat showing a man on a Libyan patrol boat wearing a uniform bearing the insignia of the 80th Special Operations Battalion of the 111th Brigade.Photograph: Alessia Candito/La RepubblicaView image in fullscreenA screen grab from footage filmed from the Mediterranea Saving Humans’ boat on 18 August.Photograph: Alessia Candito, la RepubblicaA second set of clips, filmed at night two days later, shows Iraqi-Kurdish people in the water having been kicked into the sea, according to witnesses aboard the NGO boat.As the vessel they went overboard from turns away, it is illuminated by the rescuers’ flashlights and shown to have the same irregularly painted border between its black sides and white hull as the boat seen on the 18th.0:37Iraqi Kurdish refugees in the water near rubber dinghy in Mediterranean – videoKurdish people picked up by the Mediterranea told the NGO’s crew that only hours before they had been rounded up in a Libyan detention centre.

As of February 2025, about 867,055 people of 44 different nationalities were residing in Libya, according to data from the International Organization for Migration.In the latest deadly incident in the Mediterranean, the IOM said on Thursday that a boat carrying Sudanese refugees had caught fire and sunk over the weekend off the coast of the eastern Libyan city of Tobruk, killing at least 50 people as it headed towards Greece.Libya is ready to work with European governments to stem the migrant flow | LetterRead moreAccording to numerous aid agencies – including United Nations reports – government-aligned militias in Libya have been implicated in rights abuses against migrants for years, including running or partnering with detention centres where people are extorted, tortured and sexually enslaved, kidnapping people for ransom, colluding with units of the Libyan coastguard, and human trafficking.Libya’s militias have been patrolling the Mediterranean sea since the government in Tripolistruck a deal with Italyin February 2017 that empowered it to forcibly return migrants that it intercepts in the waters to the north African country.The deal, which entailed Italy providing funds and equipment, was made byMarco Minniti, the former interior minister from the centre-left Democratic party, in an attempt to stem migrant flows.On 4 September, Al-Zoubi met Italy’s interior minister Matteo Piantedosi, who in anofficial statementpraised Italy’s “fruitful cooperation” with the Libyan government.Luca Casarini, co-founder of Mediterranea, alleged to the Guardian that the footage, photographs and testimony of the rescued people “proves that the real beneficiaries of Italian funds are human traffickers”.The Guardian contacted the Italian interior ministry for comment but has not yet received a response. Libya’s defence ministry has also not replied to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsLibyaRefugeesAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaShareReuse this content"

Liam Neeson plays his second-in-command, resentful at having this cold fish imposed over his head and yet destined to respect the guy. Some slightly clunky traditional moments for our two leading males, but also a few exciting ones.10.The Weight of Water(2000)View image in fullscreenCerebral drama … Sean Penn and Elizabeth Hurley in The Weight of Water.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyAt the time, this cerebral and multilayered psychological drama was sympathetically received as Kathryn Bigelow’s (possibly permanent) pivot to arthouse-type film-making and away from the high-impact action genre. Catherine McCormack plays a journalist researching the 19th-century murders of Norwegian immigrants, who notices an eerie parallel between a witness to these slayings and herself. An interesting, worthwhile film, though maybe a bit weighty and watery. Audiences would later come to see that, for Bigelow, action was the real artistry.9.Strange Days(1995)This is a head-trippy dystopian thriller with a touch of modish millennial angst, co-written by Bigelow’s former partner James Cameron; the elements of virtual reality chime with the industry’s enduring reverence for Philip K Dick and the film arguably anticipates the debate on AI. In 1999, LA is a futuristic, lawless hellhole, and winsomely creepyRalph Fiennesplays a black-marketeer whose immersive sensory tech allows his customers to experience other people’s thrills, including those of violent crime. Bold and lively, technically sensational but maybe a bit overwrought and even clumsy.8.Blue Steel(1990)Generations of moviegoers now associate this title with fashion model Derek Zoolander and his most compellingly sexy yet complex facial expression. But Bigelow was there first with this film, co-produced by Oliver Stone, showing the steel of a courageous woman in blue: gutsy rookie cop Megan Turner, played byJamie Lee Curtis. She accidentally kills a criminal whose gun is stolen at the crime scene by a psychopath – this man then embarks on an obsessive affair with Megan, who doesn’t realise how their paths have crossed. The audacity and sheer hardboiled craziness of this movie have won it a place in the hearts of the Bigelow and Curtis fans.7.Zero Dark Thirty(2012)View image in fullscreenTension and thrills … Zero Dark Thirty.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarBigelow’s punchy war-on-terror procedural thriller took on the US special forces’ mission to apprehend, or rather assassinate, al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, who they discovered was hiding out in Abbottabad, Pakistan – with the soldiers nail-bitingly beginning their raid at half past midnight or “zero dark thirty”. Some tension and thrills, undoubtedly, although as the film was releasedmore than a decade after 9/11, critics wondered if any more perspective could have been shone on proceedings. There was also the contentious point about whether usable intel was obtained through CIA torture, a topic that elicited Amy Poehler’s classic line about the film at the Golden Globes: “When it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married toJames Cameron.”6. Near Dark (1987)In her solo directing debut, Bigelow stunned Hollywood with her appetite (and talent) for gonzo mayhem – and gave audiences a neo-vampire freakout that anticipated Abel Ferrara’s own nihilist use of that trope. It was considerably darker and less romantic than the Twilight tales that gripped the industry a generation later. A nervy young cowboy makes out with a mysterious, attractive young woman who, after a playful neck bite, introduces him to her friends – a feral group of undead outlaws who must decide if this newcomer is worthy of being inducted into the gang.5.Detroit(2017)View image in fullscreenA bold, muscular movie … Detroit.Photograph: Album/AlamyA tough, fierce, socially engaged picture on which Bigelow worked with her longtime screenwriter Mark Boal. This was about the Algiers Motel murders, a police-brutality incident that took place during Detroit’s 12th Street riot in 1967. It brought the fraught history of racism into parallel with an episode of musical history – the early career of the soul group the Dramatics.John Boyegaplays Melvin Dismukes, a black security guard who wanted to support the police on a night of disorder but became the intimate and disenchanted witness to white officers’ paranoid racism. And, alongside that, the Dramatics find that their debut concert is cancelled because of the riot, but are then called to a recording session that night. A bold, muscular movie.4.The Loveless(1981)This was Bigelow’s first directorial outing, a joint credit with producer and David Lynch associate Monty Montgomery. It’s an outlaw biker movie that has something of The Wild One or a John Ford western to it, or indeed her later vampire movie Near Dark. The intense youngWillem Dafoeplays biker bad guy Vance who has a passionate affair with a teenage girl (played by Marin Kanter). Her rage-filled dad intervenes, but it soon becomes clear that this girl has an emotional history that Vance does not appreciate and he is going to be used as a weapon in his new girlfriend’s campaign of vengeance and self-harm.3.Point Break(1991)View image in fullscreenCult masterpiece … Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break.Photograph: Album/AlamyThe generic strangeness and uniqueness of Point Break is what makes it a cult masterpiece: an action bromance that is a heist movie … but also a surf movie. (And the surfers are charismatic outlaws like the bikers in The Loveless and vampires in Near Dark.) Keanu Reeves is the dedicated young FBI man with the unimprovable name of Johnny Utah, investigating bank robberies by a gang called the Ex-Presidents (four guys wearing Reagan, Carter, Nixon and Johnson masks). From the culprits’ tan lines, visible on CCTV, and traces of surfboard wax recovered at the scene, he deduces that the robbers are surfers who steal cash to finance their addiction to surfing and other thrill-seeking activities. (Isn’t bank robbing thrilling enough?) So Keanu infiltrates a surfer gang led by the charismaticPatrick Swayzeand, in time-honoured undercover style, finds himself falling under the criminal’s spell.2.A House of Dynamite(2025)Bigelow detonates a megaton action blast with this brutal nuclear Armageddon thriller, closer in spirit to Sidney Lumet’s grim Fail Safe than the satire of Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove. The world’s final 18 minutes before a nuclear missile hits a major American city is replayed three times from the viewpoints of various high-ranking people – finally, that of the stunned and helpless president, played byIdris Elba. The disorientation and unthinkable horror are refined and amplified with each reiteration, with particular emphasis on the high-spending incompetence and mendacity of the military-industrial complex that took the US taxpayer for billions of dollars to no effect.1.The Hurt Locker(2008)View image in fullscreenSuperbly bleak … The Hurt Locker.Photograph: First Light Production/AllstarBigelow’s blazingly powerfulThe Hurt Lockerwas the nearest Hollywood came to a compelling anti-war movie about the retaliatory campaign that followed 9/11. It is about the long, painful, futile endgame in Iraq, asymmetric warfare in which the enemy cannot be engaged in any meaningful sense. Military patrols go round and round in the desert, and endure an almost existential wait to be killed by an IED. Jeremy Renner made his name playing the scary Staff Sergeant William James, a bomb disposal officer who, driven mad by the sheer fatal emptiness of what they are doing, has chosen to disable bombs himself, rather than using robots that can be remotely piloted into the danger zone, and often even refuses to use protective safety gear. Is he simply mad? Or does he want to mainline the craziness of war into his veins. Or does he, in some even more poignant sense, want to reclaim the honour of a soldier’s death in combat? A superbly bleak film that also – as ever with Bigelow – delivers A-grade action and thrills.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedThe Hurt LockerZero Dark ThirtyPoint BreakKathryn BigelowJeremy RennerPatrick SwayzefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it true you’vegot into meditation recently?SassyWrapsAbout 12 years ago I had a nervous breakdown, and in therapy I did so much meditation that everything became existential and I thought there was no point to anything. In the last few years I’ve revisited therapy for my mental health but also started to enjoy life. I realised that I hadn’t noticed a lot of my happiest – and saddest – moments until years after the fact. Last year, I looked at old family photos for the first time in 20 years, since my mum passed away. I realised that, by ignoring painful memories, I’d been denying part of myself. I found joy in understanding that everything that happens makes you who you are. It pulled me out of a fog – so the album is about embracing whatever’s happening now. Last year, Ben, James and I fell out for the first time ever, but focusing on the friendship and the positive things we’d shared brought us back together: we could have easily dropped everything and walked away.Did you really take [Slayer drummer] Dave Lombardoto Greggs inTodmorden[West Yorkshire]?gongpaulTodmorden is the UFO sightings capital of Europe! We spent eight days there [in Lapwing studio] and it was hilarious. We took Dave for a curry and a pint, and whenever anyone recognised him they were in disbelief. Below the studio, there’s a nursery. The day we left, the council wrote to the studio asking them to close, because the noise of us playing thrash metal upstairs was traumatising the children.Do you have a favourite tattoo and whatis its significance?JoddietI’ve got loads of ridiculous tattoos, but the one that means most to me is the one on my arm that I got in memory of my mother the year she passed away. It’s from a photo [of my parents] which I couldn’t look at for years, but I put it on my arm and now on the album cover [of Futique], because I’ve resolved my relationship with it. Rather than seeing my mum who isn’t here any more, I see two young people about to start their life together. Every step I’ve ever taken goes back to my parents, so now I see the picture as celebratory rather than sad. It reminds me that I’m an adult now – “He plays guitar with his shirt off … Really?!” – but that picture goes hand in hand with how I ended up where I am.View image in fullscreenL-R: Simon Neil, James Johnston and Ben Johnston of Biffy Clyro.Photograph: Warner Music GroupWhat are your thoughts onMatt Cardle’s version of Many of Horror?stephenw1979At the time [2010], an X Factor pop performer doing one of our songs was seen as blasphemous, which is probably why I liked it. We’ve got the worst name in history and were making weird music to purposely alienate people, and suddenly The X Factor came to us. We said they could cover it as long as they changed the title [to When We Collide], so if you Googled Many of Horror you didn’t get a cover version. I love the fact that [Cardle’s version of] our song became the mainstream Christmas No 1 – it’s one of the most iconoclastic things we’ve done. He did a great job, although the other day we were staying in an Airbnb near rehearsals and the owner said she wanted to show us a video of her young sons dancing to Many of Horror. It was the Matt Cardle version.As well asEmpire State Bastardyou also have alesser-known side project, Marmaduke Duke. Is a third record on the cards?AdamVallelyEvery four or five albums, I need to make music that doesn’t have the weight of expectation – my own – of Biffy songs. Marmaduke Duke are better to talk about than listen to. The first album is acoustic songs, punk songs and drone songs. For the second, Duke Pandemonium, we wore masks and tights and channelled the Bee Gees. It was quite provocative. A third album is 80% finished but I’m now in Biffy mode. Empire State Bastard is atonal noise. Dave Lombardo – the best metal drummer of all time – played with us. During Covid I needed to make something almost everyone I knew would hate. My dad said: “I’ve tried to listen to it, son. I just couldn’t.”Do you remember when you played a swimming pool in Germany?APraiseChorus30Of course we do! We ended up soaking wet on stage and the entire crowd were in the water in their swimming gear. There was some eyebrow-raising sexual stuff going on at the front. It was a memorable show, then at the end I threw my guitar down and leaped off the Olympic-size diving board. I’ve got a great photo of it: it’s the longest I’ve ever spent in the air apart from flying.I’ve watched you go fromsupporting the Cooper Temple Clause in 2002(tickets £5) to WembleyStadium. Do you miss those raw intimate venues or do you prefer arenas?KangafeetTen years ago I’d have said the magic of a small gig can’t be replicated, but you can create a different kind of magic in a big show. We’ve learned so much about the stage show from touring with Muse, Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, but when I was 18 I saw Girls Against Boys with two bass players at Glasgow’s King Tut’s and thought it was the coolest, sexiest thing I’d ever seen. Those gigs change lives. You come out of those shows physically and molecularly transformed. Although the power of a large show can elevate your spirit. I went to see Oasis recently and seeing the joy on people’s faces meant so much. You know you’re getting carried away when you’re watching the support act and going: “Richard Ashcroft’s the greatest singer this country’s ever …” Honestly, man? [laughter] God bless you, Richard. Don’t fight me.View image in fullscreenOn stage in Glasgow last summer.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/RedfernsHow did it feel to finallytop the bill at Download [in 2017]?NotDrivingAMiniMetroDownload’s a weird one for me because I came from metal. I started with Guns N’ Roses, then got into Pantera and all that. Everything I bought back in the day led to Download. It’s one of the few festivals, like Glastonbury, where there’s so much history and you feel the glorious comebacks, the tragedies, the amazing moments. I still think of it as being for legendary bands and to finally headline felt like impostor syndrome. Once we started playing, I thought, “We’re here because we deserve it!” But you never take it for granted and you want to give someone the best show they’ll see all weekend.I’m a big fan, aged 75, from Manchester and love the fact that you sound so Scottish. Was it important to retain your accents and did you encounter any resistance?teemacOn our first couple of records I’ve got an American twang which I’m kind of embarrassed about. When you start off, you impersonate your heroes, and I was inspired by American music. Gradually, I realised that the songs people remember are real, from the heart, and you can’t fake that stuff. It was a huge turning point, and I started singing in my own voice. The only resistance we’ve had is in America – “People won’t understand a Scottish accent” – but if that conversation starts now I can’t be dealing with it.Biffy Clyro: ‘In grief, you feel a dozen different things every day’Read moreWhen I was in a band in Ireland, our singer excitedly told us about your guerrilla“play anywhere” approach to gigging. Am I remembering correctly?kingofthestoneageThat makes us sound a bit more anarchic than we were, but we toured deep Ireland a few times when we were young and if anyone wanted us to play a show, we’d try to make it happen. It’s a bit romantic to call them guerrilla gigs, but we played the Half Moon in Cork to 14 people and a tiny room in Belfast to 12 people. They were some of our most exciting shows at that point, because the people coming really cared. We learned that we’d rather be 100 people’s favourite band than a million people’s 10th favourite. When I look back at our touring schedule or the fact we made three records in three years, I don’t know how we did that, but back then we had energy to burn.I first saw you at theKay Park Tavern, Kilmarnock. Did you opt for the £40 payment or the free bar?darko1979Of course we took the free bar, because we knew we’d drink more than £40 worth of booze. At those gigs there was always some old drunk guy going, “Play some fucking Motörhead!” or something, but it taught us to keep on doing what we were doing. Looking back, it was a bit arrogant at 16 years of age to turn up and play original songs, but people remember that. They don’t remember a set of Led Zeppelin or Oasis covers.Futique is released on Friday.Biffy Clyrowill perform intimate acoustic outstore shows in October beforean arena tourstarts in Belfast on 9 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsMusicFilm & Music reader interviewBiffy ClyroPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Naive and ruthlessly ambitious, they brave the skeptics, the losers, the people too good to talk to them and the people who don’t take them seriously. Eventually, inevitably, their genius – obvious, unsinkable, perhaps diabolical – collides with opportunity. Voilà! An origin story is born.Him review – Jordan Peele-produced football horror is a disappointing fumbleRead moreSwap out the date and the city, and this would describe a pivotal scene in any number of recent movies and TV shows that take cinematic interest in the self-mythology of entrepreneurs. The dramatic logic and iconography of the origin story, basically true but always highly glossed, is by now so recognizable it almost writes itself: initial rejection, dogged persistence, chance meeting, lightbulb moment, big break. We’ve seen it in a wave ofbrand backstory movies– Flamin’ Hot, Air, BlackBerry and Tetris to name a few – as well as the recentboomlet of shows depicting 2010s hustle culture. The twist with Swiped, Hulu’s new film on the founding of online dating titans Tinder and Bumble, is that this founder is a woman.And it is quite a twist – the route Whitney Wolfe Herd (Lily James) takes to becoming the youngest self-made female billionaire is much rougher than that of her male peers, consistently potholed with misogyny, from standard-grade office sexism to sexual harassment and online slander. Swiped, directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg (Unpregnant) from her script with Jennifer Gibgot and Andrew Panay, oscillates between acknowledgment of the tech world’s – and, for that matter, the internet’s – inherent misogyny, with a light, by-the-numbers portrait of a capitalist success. Characters speak in startup pablum and punchy slogans. “Bill Gates cured polio – or malaria, or something. But you know what he did first? He made $100bn,” incubator head Sean Rad (Ben Schnetzer) tells Whitney when she presents her initial idea for an app to connect volunteers with charities. She’s summarily hired as the head of marketing for one of Sean’s apps which, as multiple office characters note, needs 1 million users in the first year to stand a chance.All of this breezes by with little friction and a rose-tinted glow that feels a little odd for an app that so fundamentally changed how young people think about sex, dating and relationships writ large. In one scene that made me laugh out loud for its Big Game Energy at a conference table, Whitney scrambles out of the pocket and scores a touchdown with the nameTinder(as opposed to, say, Matchbox). In another, Whitney, a preternatural marketing genius from Salt Lake City, pits sorority girl insecurities against male lust at Southern Methodist University and kills the future of IRL dating in five movie minutes.These scenes are neither offensive nor particularly inspiring (beyond some Wikipedia searches), and proceed competently and dutifully, a smooth dose of 2010s lore with the soundtrack, highlights and leggings to match. Where Swiped grabs attention, and complicates an otherwise straightforward success narrative, is in depicting the genuinely appalling treatment of Wolfe Herd by her male co-workers. A months-long romance with Justin (Jackson White, believably sinister) quickly turns toxic; Goldenberg and James, suitably disappearing into fried blond highlights and an angular American accent, bring us into Whitney’s addled, righteous anger – the disparaging and constant text message harassment, the confusion over how to handle a fellow co-founder’s abuse as the only woman in the room, her shocked betrayal when they close ranks, fire her and lock her in with an NDA. (Their side still went public, subjecting her to a firestorm of online harassment evocatively portrayed in a swirling montage of booze and tweets.)Swiped especially shines in its willingness to challenge its protagonist, predominantly through her co-worker turned best friend Tisha, a would-be Black best friend character if not for Industry’s Myha’la landing some punches on Whitney for pulling up the ladder behind her and dismissing harassment until it came for her. Same for Whitney’s working relationship with the dubious billionaire Andrey Andreev (Dan Stevens, doing a ridiculous, but I have to imagine researched, Russian accent), who gave her carte blanche funding to start Bumble, the women-centered dating app built to correct Tinder’s bro-y mistakes, while committing his own #MeToo sins. It’s a shame, then, that the film ultimately returns to credulous adulation for succeeding in this system; I’m not sure the grace note of Wolfe Herd getting permission from the Blackstone guy who just bought her company to stay on as CEO is the victory note the film-makers think it is.Still, the history of how online dating went from deeply uncool to de rigueur is one worth telling, and Swiped’s methods, corny and contrived as they can be, are proficient enough to do it. You, as I, may have some reservations about another business movie as well as dating – but we’re here now, so swipe right.Swiped is available on Hulu in the US on 19 September and Disney+ elsewhereExplore more on these topicsFilmLily JamesTinderDan StevensDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Whose Name?, a cinéma vérité take on the tortured musical genius (who goes by just Ye now), offers fans and long-term observers a new artifact to pore over in search of answers – and reason to be disappointed all over again.That’s not a knock on the 104-minute opus, an outcropping of more than 3,000 hours of footage – some of it never before seen, some of it a reverse perspective on the viral stunts and rants that have marked Ye’s dramatic nosedive. Director Nico Ballesteros – who started filming in 2018, at age 18, with nothing to recommend him (his stint as a second assistant director on a Jesus Is King concert video came later) – had sweeping access to Ye and made the distinctive choice not to layer it with any talking-head commentary for context. Mostly, he turns on the camera, holds a tight focus on his subject and lets the rest drift in and out of frame.The laissez-faire approach, which benefits from having an artistic savant on the opposite end of the lens, would seem to owe less to Ballesteros’s relative inexperience than to the fact that Ye simply cannot suffer anything that might push back on his self-assured worldview; that’s even as Ye confirms, on camera and without hint of irony, what many have suspected for years: that he’s gone off his meds. (In fact, he regards the documentary as a kind of mental-wellness exercise that could someday be a salve to the masses or, failing that, play at his funeral.) In one ridealong scene with Ballesteros, Ye confesses to having bipolar disorder while in cat-face makeup for the Fade music video – a bewildering moment of self-awareness.Where another self-important person can’t take no for answer, Ye literally cannot hear the word without having an explosive tantrum or perceiving even the slightest differences of opinion as part of some sinister effort to control his mind. “I would rather be dead than on medication,” he rages at Kris Jenner. In the doc, we see him use his mental health as a weapon to disentangle himself from a billion-dollar business portfolio that he nonetheless views as exploitative of him.This visceral need to always be right goes a long way to explaining why the many public figures in Ye’s orbit were initially hesitant to push back against his antisemitic and white-supremacist rants. Swizz Beatz is the exceptional peer who actually confronts Ye about his controversial embrace of the Maga movement and the damage it threatens to the very communities who supported his rise to the top of the charts. (On the other hand, there’s Chris Rock likening Ye’s decision to wear a Maga hat on SNL to Sinéad O’Connor ripping up a picture of the pope. ) Ballesteros was a fly on the wall for Ye’s 2018 SNL performance, which entailed Ye going off on a curtain-dropping rant about the show using Black talent to ridicule Black luminaries; the broadside was especially personal for head writer Michael Che – whom, the doc shows, sat down with Ye before the show to establish some punchline boundaries, only for the rapper to launch into a rant about slavery. “You’re a hero to us, but what you did was fucked up,” Che says before SNL producer Lindsay Shookus shuts Ballesteros down. (“This isn’t good for us,” she says.)Him review – Jordan Peele-produced football horror is a disappointing fumbleRead moreSlavery is a stubborn theme of Ye’s rants. He sees it at the core of every corporate relationship, no matter how well the slave in question might be compensated. He tells Kim Kardashian that the E Network, the former home of her long-running reality TV show, is her “slave ship”. (It’s one of several alarming scenes between the formerly married couple that lay the groundwork for their eventual divorce.) Ye is so persistent about labeling everyone he encounters as some stripe of capitalist puppet that he can scarcely appreciate the extent to which the far right has made him into their personal mascot. “Culture will always be upstream from politics,” Candace Owens tells Ye during a visit to his Calabasas headquarters with Charlie Kirk. “Whoever can control culture can control politics.”The longer Ballesteros’s doc went on, the more I found myself harkening to the way it began: with Ye on tour with Lady Gaga as part of the rollout for Graduation, just before his Taylor Swift moment at the MTV Video Music Awards set the stage for his villain arc. It was a refreshing reminder of who Ye once was: a totally unlikely pop star whose transcendent music spoke to a generation of poor and middle-class strivers. And while In Whose Name?, the most compelling of the Ye career autopsies by far, offers a more complete picture of where and how it all went so wrong, it doesn’t leave you feeling any less frustrated with the few new answers it manages to get.In Whose Name? is out in US cinemas on 19 September and elsewhere at a later dateExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsKanye WestreviewsShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t quite lasso the bronco, but the ambitions of writer-director Tony Tost’s yarn are ambitious and interesting, and he has at least assembled a cracking cast to tell it.Audiences will probably be most excited about the presence of star-billedSydney Sweeney, here playing Penny Jo, a sweet waitress with a stammer, although Sweeney is very much part of an ensemble that distributes screen time democratically. (The film premiered in 2023 at South by Southwest, but is only coming out now, perhaps because Sweeney has now become a legit phenomenon.) At the New Mexico middle-of-nowhere diner where Penny Jo slings hash, she stumbles on a plot to steal a rare Lakota artefact from a collector (Toby Huss, making the most of a cameo role).This calfskin MacGuffin becomes of interest to a number of other parties, including: antiquities dealer Roy (Simon Rex from Red Rocket); Cal (Gavin Maddox Bergman), a little kid who thinks he is the reincarnation of Sitting Bull, and Cal’s damaged mother Mandy (Halsey), the survivor of a patriarchal cult/ family; sad but none-too-bright cowboy Lefty (Paul Walter Hauser), who grows sweet on Penny Jo; and indigenous revolutionary Ghost Eye (the always wondrous Zahn McClarnon from Reservation Dogs), who is apt to quote Frantz Fanon and Karl Marx when not committing crimes.The chronologically scrambled chapter structure, so in vogue these days (see, for instance, Weapons) sets everything up for a big showdown that is mildly anticlimactic in action movie terms, but presumably was all the budget permitted. Also, Tost’s screenplay is not afraid to deploy the odd hokey line or genre cliche, and that includes what feels like half a dozen camera setups harkening back to the last shot of The Searchers, just to drive home the point. But McClarnon’s wry reservation intellectual, and most of the other colourful turns, makes this eminently watchable.Americana is on digital platforms in the UK from 22 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersSydney SweeneyNew MexicoSXSW FilmreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tackle football, notorious for eating the young, is recast as a genuine meat grinder for Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers) – a generational college quarterback touted as an heir apparent to Marlon Wayans’s Isaiah White, the Tom Brady of this world. But when a trippy, blunt force head injury endangers Cameron’s professional aspirations and multimillion-dollar payday, he agrees to train and rehab at Isaiah’s desert-based cement compound – a haunted house of vice and duplicity that threatens to swallow Cameron whole.One Battle After Another review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caperRead moreHim is not a subtle critique of America’s pastime. It opens with Isaiah breaking his leg on a championship-winning drive, and young Cameron taking in the gruesome injury from his living room floor while his father drills the mantra “no guts, no glory” into his psyche. It reintroduces football, quite rightly, as averitable meat marketwhere players are poked, prodded and scrutinized like chattel. Director Justin Tipping even switches to X-ray vision to bring out the underlying damage that can result fromfootball’s incessant collisions, one of many stylish visual touches.But where a sports movie like F1 can get away with stretching the truth for US audiences who aren’t likely to know the difference, Him makes suspending disbelief a staggering struggle. Because of football’s seemingly intractable position at the center of American life, the viewers who come to this film are more than likely already acutely aware of thesingular privilege and leveragethat quarterbacks enjoy in the game and, thus, likely to call bullshit on the idea of a prospect of Cameron’s caliber having to jump through the same physical challenges as a middling wide receiver or defensive lineman. Another terrible stretch is Wayans playing a fading gridiron legend at the dear age of 53, much less one who can afford a desert compound – more of a luxury for Major League Baseball, where contracts arefully guaranteed.Him makes a big deal of Cameron showcasing his abilities at a scouting combine, a once-important job interview that top quarterbacks routinely blow off now. Cameron’s physical fitness becomes something to obsess over even as standout NFL QBs rockdad bods. (Brady’sshirtless combine photo, more than 25 years old now, is famously disappointing.) Cameron and Isaiah are offered up as exceptional football players without a practical demonstration for a setup or a payoff. Isaiah is established as a mentor to Cameron even though a pro QB fighting against time to keep his job wouldneverassume that role. Recall: job replacement training was a central point of conflict in Any Given Sunday, a film that manages to successfully relate the horrors of professional football without much distortion.Without firm grounding in reality, Him can only skid, hopelessly, into the realm of kabuki theater and make a muddle of its football critique. It’s too bad because the film has some interesting things to say about the game – specifically, its conflation of white Christian values and American jingoism. In the real world, players are coached to order their lives in a three-pile stack: God, family and football. But in Him, Isaiah puts football above the divine and talks quite soberly about how “He died for us so I play for Him.” The pro team in question here is called the Saviors, and Isaiah’s picture is propped up among young Cameron’s football trophies like a holy card among votive candles – a true shrine.Tipping, one of three writers on the film, uses the concept of the sports Goat, the acronym for greatest of all time, to present football as a pagan religion, complete with blood sacraments and tangible sacrifices, while cutting back and forth from Christian symbols to occult imagery. One shot in particular, of Cameron at a Last Supper-style photoshoot in the Jesus position, prompted a handful of viewers at my Atlanta screening to walk out. You can just imagine God-fearing football fans – ostensibly, Him’s target audience – taking similar offense.The most memorable performances in Him come from the supporting cast. Tim Heidecker and Jim Jefferies shine as Cameron’s agent and Isaiah’s doctor, respectively, and the model Julia Fox is a pleasant surprise as Isaiah’s wife. But it’s not enough to negate Wayans’s hammier tics or stand up a story that would have anyone believe he ishim– itself a neologism for “the man”. What could have been a truly cutting takedown of the American football meat grinder just winds up playing to the very appetite for human carnage that fans can’t get enough of. No matter your view of Him, as a slasher or a sports film, it’s a fumble.Him is out in US cinemas on 19 September, in Australia on 2 October and in the UK on 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsJordan PeeleNFLUS sportsreviewsShareReuse this content"

They end the series with a pairing of the second of the Op 12 set in A major with the last of the sonatas, in G. All of the performances use historical instruments, with Mullova playing her gut-strung 1750 Guadagnini and using a classical bow, while here Beatson plays a different keyboard for each sonata. For the rather Mozartian Op 12 no 2 he uses a copy of a Walter fortepiano made in 1805, seven years after the sonata was composed; while for the much more ambitious keyboard writing of Op 96 it’s a copy of a Graf from 1819.View image in fullscreenMullova/Beatson: Beethoven: Violin Sonatas Opp 12 & 96.Photograph: SignumWhat is common to the performances of both sonatas is the sheerjoie de vivreof the playing. Everything seems energised, and if the precision and immaculate ensemble is sometimes at the expense of obvious affection for the music and perhaps the last degree of warmth, that’s usually a small price to pay. The fine detail of both the violin and the keyboard playing is exquisite; the shape of every phrase, you feel, has been considered and weighted accordingly, without losing any sense of spontaneity, so the music never stales.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

But, to both their surprise, the affair becomes “a relationship that we longed to take to the limit, without really knowing what that meant”.The Young Man is Ernaux’s shortest memoir yet, clocking just over half an hour in audio. But brevity doesn’t impede her ability to get to the heart of the intimate dynamics or external pressures of a situation that many others view as taboo. The couple get disapproving looks in restaurants, which, rather than leaving Ernaux cowed, reinforces her “determination not to hide my affair with a man who could have been my son”.Tavia Gilbert is the narrator whose reading, though a little mannered at times, underscores the distance Ernaux puts between herself and her lover, allowing her to observe him from the vantage point of middle age and from a different economic and social strata. “He tore me away from my generation but I was not part of his,” she notes.

Now, she’s back with shimmering sounds and cleverly unsentimental lyrics, plus explosive cameos by Vince Staples and KanoAlexis PetridisThu 18 Sep 2025 07.54 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 11.47 EDTShareIn an overcrowded pop market, where artists are encouraged to maintain a constant presence and stream of what’s depressingly termed “product”, south London singer-songwriter Joy Crookes’s career has progressed in a curious series of fits and starts. After releasing a series of EPs, she ended 2019 as a hotly tipped act: appearances on Later … With Jools Holland, nominated for the Brits Rising Star award, placed high in the BBC’s Sound of 2020 poll, invited to support Harry Styles on tour. But the latter was nixed by Covid, and her real commercial breakthrough didn’t arrive for nearly two years: released at the tail-end of 2021, her debut albumSkinmade the Top 5 and, inFeet Don’t Fail Me Now, spawned one of those long-tail viral hits that achieves a weird omnipresence despite barely grazing the Top 30. She started working on a follow-up, then vanished again. The four years that separate her debut from Juniper were at least partly consumed by a period when she was “really sick” and “mentally unstable”.View image in fullscreenJoy Crookes: JuniperIt’s a period that understandably hangs over the contents of Juniper: “I’m so sick, I’m so tired, I can’t keep losing my mind,” she sings on opener Brave; “I’m pretty fucking miserable,” runs the blunt chorus ofMathematics, ostensibly a breakup song that seems underpinned by something noticeably darker than romantic woe alone. You could argue that Juniper’s introspective tone comes at a cost – there’s no room for the kind of sharp, political songs about Brexit, gentrification and immigration that peppered Skin – but Crookes is an impressively snappy lyricist who comes across as smart, streetwise and gobby regardless of the personal trauma she’s describing.Moreover, she rigorously swerves the usual self-help platitudes about the kind of topics Juniper addresses, from co-dependency to intergenerational trauma. House With a Pool, about abusive relationships, andCarmen, about unattainable beauty standards, are all the more powerful for their light approach and avoidance of sentimentality in favour of wit. The latter dispenses with pat conclusions about the need to love yourself for who you are or how everyone is beautiful in their own way, and instead concludes unreconciled, with Crookes still glowering resentfully at its “peng” titular character: “Why am I working double for just half of what you got?”The music is similarly an impressively fresh and individual take on the familiar. The songs have big choruses and strong melodies – strong enough, in the case of Carmen, that it isn’t overshadowed by its backing track borrowing something as immediately recognisable as the staccato piano line from Elton John’s Bennie and the Jets. You could broadly categorise their style as post-Amy Winehouse retro-soul: electric pianos and Philadelphia International strings; warm, live-sounding bass and drums; the odd dusting of distortion on Crookes’s vocals, which slip from smokily powerful and lightly jazz-inflected to more conversational, rap-informed cadences.Joy Crookes: Perfect Crime – videoIt could easily seem run of the mill, but it doesn’t, because it’s filtered through an appealingly gauzy lens. Synths, harps and organ shimmer and flutter abstractly around the sound, the aural equivalent of catching something in the corner of your eye. There are liberal applications of dub reggae-esque echo; everything has a slightly woozy, late-night quality. Listening to the thick bassline ofPerfect Crime, orPass the Salt, driven by a fantastic drum loop sampled from Serge Gainsbourg’s 1968 single Requiem pour un Con and featuring a brief but explosive guest verse from Vince Staples, you get the feeling that Crookes has an abiding love for trip-hop in its original, experimental mid-90s form, before it sank into the realm of blandly inoffensive dinner party soundtrack. It joins Crookes’s admirably eclectic roll call of influences: you really don’t get a lot of singer-songwriters in 2025 name-checking Black Uhuru, the PoguesandNusrat Fateh Ali Khan in interviews.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

First Last Dance feels jarringly perky given the atmospheric company it’s keeping, a state of affairs not much helped by its tune, which has a peculiar 80s Euro-pop quality. But one distracting stumble doesn’t matter much given how strong the rest of Juniper is, how clearly it asserts Crookes’s talent as a vocalist and songwriter. There are some big names here – as well as Staples, Kano turns up on Mathematics, while Sam Fender adds vocals toSomebody to You– but the main attraction never feels overshadowed or crowded out.

There’s something of the knockabout quality of a soft-play centre in Mick Herron’s fictional world: all fun and games until someone loses an eye.That said, as far as I know, none of the injuries in the real-world Clown Town will have been occasioned by the victim being held down so the front wheel of a Land Rover Defender can be driven over their head – which is the attention-grabbing scene with which Herron opens this latest instalment. As often, Herron’s plot takes off from real-world events: the Stakeknife scandal – in which it turned out that MI5 had been protecting a murderously vicious IRA enforcer as an intelligence asset – appears here in the story of Pitchfork, whose signature “nutting” technique of killing during the Troubles was running over people’s heads.Pitchfork’s story was covered up – until it wasn’t. His old handlers have come out of the woodwork and, to mix metaphors, the sky soon grows dark with chickens coming home to roost. Herron’s hero River Cartwright (whose late grandfather’s archive, we discover, contained crucial material about Pitchfork) starts pulling on a thread. The Service’s First Desk, the machiavellian Diana Taverner, launches another of her fiendish schemes and is soon once again sparring with the Slow Horses’ profane ringmaster Jackson Lamb.Is the formula showing signs of fatigue? Not by my lightsOver the last decade this series of novels about a community of cashiered spies has made the transition from “well-kept secret” to “household name”. Herron is now an authentic megastar of the genre, and since the Apple TV+ series Slow Horses every reader (and I expect the author) will have recalibrated their mental image of Jackson Lamb from Timothy Spall to Gary Oldman (early novels likened Lamb to Spall “gone to seed”). But the books are still the main event – because it’s Herron’s line-by-line writing that really makes them stand out. Has there been a more magnificently bossy narrative voice since Dickens? Or one more in love with the baroque flourish? Here, for instance, is the first sentence in Herron’s now-traditional slow-burn walking-tour introduction to Slough House:What you see when you see a blank page is much what you hear when you hear white noise; it’s the early shifting into gear of something not ready to happen – an echo of what you feel when you walk past sights the eyes are blind to; bus queues, whitewashed shopfronts, adverts pasted to lamp-posts, or a four-storey block on Aldersgate Street in the London borough of Finsbury, where the premises gracing the pavement include a Chinese restaurant with ever-lowered shutters and a faded menu taped to its window; a down-at-heel newsagent’s where pallets of off-brand cola cans block the aisle; and, between the two, a weathered black door with a dusty milk bottle welded to its step, and an air of neglect suggesting that it never opens, never closes.The “blank page” reference – along with a missing book from an old spy’s library being a MacGuffin, and a handful of other references to writing – hints at Herron’s lightly metafictional bent. These books are a strange and addictive hybrid. The bones of any Slough House novel are those of a classic spy story: there will be bad actors, buried secrets, hidden agendas, opaque and shifting stratagems and, sooner or later, gunplay or chases or kidnappings or eruptions of semi-competent violence. But the self-seriousness of most spy fiction is not present. The surface fizz is more like a sitcom: the back-and-forth of witty insults and off-colour jokes, sight gags and character work – Herron’s oddball cast chafing against each other while they sit in their shabby office opposite the Barbican, suffering through their make-work day jobs.River is recovering from a brush with a Russian nerve agent. Sid is recovering from getting shot in the head. Shirley Dander is still pushing people who annoy her through windows. The reliably awful computer whiz Roddy Ho has acquired a tattoo. Lamb is continuing to produce cigarettes from unlikely places (inside his shirt while scratching himself, mostly). Catherine Standish, sober alcoholic, is still playing the long-suffering grownup, the straight woman to Lamb’s sour comedy.It’s not quite a sitcom in structure, though. In a sitcom, the cast remains more or less stable and each episode stands alone. But over the course of these books, characters age and die, governments change (tracking, roughly, the government of the day; an unnamed Keir Starmer has an unflattering walk-on) and longer story arcs develop. The new reader would do best to start with the first one, Slow Horses, and read in sequence.Is the formula showing signs of fatigue? Not by my lights. If it has a weakness – and it’s not much of a weakness, because Herron is a deft enough writer for the most part to get away with it – it’s a tonal limitation. The tug towards flippancy makes it tricky, sometimes, to shift gear into real pathos or real peril. Lamb is comical, but the stories insist that he’s also dangerous. He is callous, but the stories insist he is also, in his way, conscientious. There’s a question mark over how much the reader is asked to mind when characters die, grieve and mourn, since there’s always a one-liner around the corner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The host was Elisabeth von Thadden and the nominal reason for the get-together was her younger sister’s 50th birthday. Really, though, this was a cover story for nine influential people meeting to discuss what should happen now that it was clear that Hitler was losing the war.Otto Kiep, a former diplomat, talked hopefully about how Mussolini’s recent toppling meant that Italy was ready to make peace with the allies, while political hostess Hanna Solf gleefully anticipated the moment when Hitler fell: “We’ll put him against a wall.” Meanwhile, Von Thadden herself, a devout Protestant and former headteacher of an elite girls’ school, warned of the humanitarian crisis that would follow the end of hostilities. For those who gathered on that late summer’s day for tea, sandwiches and a particularly unappetising food item called “war cake”, Germany’s rebirth as a democratic nation state felt so near that they could almost touch it.None of these people were natural rebels, and Jonathan Freedland does an excellent job of reaching inside their heads to reveal a slow-growing and late-flowering disillusionment with the Nazis. Many were from distinguished military families who had been burned by the defeat of the first world war and the subsequent humiliation of the treaty of Versailles. To these quintessential patriots, the national socialists’ promise to restore Germany’s military pride, not to mention economic stability, had been initially appealing. A return to the enduring values of Goethe and Beethoven could surely not be far behind.This naivety didn’t last long. As the full horror of the Nazis’ programme for racial cleansing became clear, it was impossible to stand by. In 1933, Kiep, then consul general to the US, risked everything to publicly honour Albert Einstein, the best-known Jewish refugee from nazism. It earned him an immediate recall to the fatherland. For Von Thadden, the moment of reckoning had come when she saw what the Third Reich had planned for Christianity – a new “German church” in which Hitler outranked Jesus Christ. For Countess Lagi von Ballestrem, the challenge was helping hundreds of “submarines” – Jews in hiding – survive the terrible Berlin winters, before pointing them to freedom via a network of tunnels and false papers. The countess had perfected the art of the silent insult: everywhere she went, she made sure to carry a bag of heavy laundry in each hand – it was the perfect excuse for failing to give the obligatory “Heil Hitler” salute.What no one realised until it was too late was that there was an informant in their midst. He arrived at the tea party with excellent references, but in retrospect, there was something fishy about him. He hung on to everyone’s words as if taking mental notes and tried to pump people for further revelations. That was because he was typing it all up and presenting it to his Gestapo boss, the notoriously ruthless Herbert Lange. Within 18 months, nearly everyone who had attended the gathering would be either dead or imprisoned.In 74 short, punchy chapters, each ending on a cliffhanger, Freedland tracks the twists and turns by which these reluctant heroes sought to evade and then face their fate. At first there was an unnerving silence, but then came a knock at the door, or a tap on the shoulder. Given that these were prestige prisoners with names or fortunes associated with Germany’s prewar elite, it was inevitable that they would be exploited for propaganda purposes. There were show trials, complete with expensive barristers and witnesses and family pleas for mercy. It didn’t do any good. Kiep was hanged, Von Thadden beheaded. Arthur Zarden, a mandarin at the German ministry of finance, managed to break away from his captors and jump to his death, while the rest got long prison sentences.Freedland has produced that elusive thing – an impeccably sourced history book that reads as propulsively as an airport thriller. Yet this is also a profoundly serious work, posing an uncomfortable question. How many of us, given the chance to sit out an unpalatable political present without too much discomfort, would find the courage to step up, speak out and face the inevitably terrible consequences?The Traitors Circle: The Rebels Against the Nazis and the Spy Who Betrayed Them by Jonathan Freedland is published by John Murray (£25).

Scientists now have answers, but they’re not what you thinkThe phenomenal response to an article we published on this question led to detailed cognitive research – and the findings have implications that go way beyond gamersKeith StuartThu 18 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 10.23 EDTShareFive years ago, on the verge of the first Covid lockdown, I wrote an article asking what seemed to be an extremely niche question:why do some people invert their controls when playing 3D games? A majority of players push down on the controller to make their onscreen character look down, and up to make them look up. But there is a sizeable minority who do the opposite, controlling their avatars like a pilot controls a plane, pulling back to go up. For most modern games, this requires going into the settings and reconfiguring the default controls. Why do they still persist?I thought a few hardcore gamers would be interested in the question. Instead, more than one million people read the article, and the ensuing debate caught the attention of Dr Jennifer Corbett (quoted in the original piece) and Dr Jaap Munneke, then based at the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London.At the time, the two were conducting research into vision science and cognitive neuroscience, but when the country locked down, they were no longer able to test volunteers in their laboratory. The question of controller inversion provided the perfect opportunity to study the neuroscience of human-computer interactions using remote subjects. Theyput out a call for gamerswilling to help research the reasons behind controller inversion and receivedmany hundreds of replies.View image in fullscreenMicrosoft Flight Simulator … many thought what they first played affected the way they configured their controls.Photograph: MicrosoftAnd it wasn’t just gamers who were interested. “Machinists, equipment operators, pilots, designers, surgeons – people from so many different backgrounds reached out,” says Corbett. “Because there were so many different answers, we realised we had a lot of scientific literature to review to design the best possible study. Readers’ responses turned this study into the first of its kind to try to figure out what actually are those factors that shape how users configure their controllers. Personal experiences, favourite games, different genres, age, consoles, which way you scroll with a mouse … all of these things could potentially be involved.”This month the duo published their findings in a paper entitled “Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments”. And the reason why some people invert their controls? It’s complicated.The process started with participants completing a survey about their backgrounds and gaming experiences. “Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not,” says Corbett. “Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback.”View image in fullscreenMental rotation … a subject being tested as part of controller inversion research.Photograph: Jen CorbettBut Corbett and Munneke,now based at MITand Northeastern University respectively, were certain that there would also be important cognitive components to the inversion question that could be measured only through behavioural responses. So they devised a questionnaire and a series of four experiments that participants would take part in while being instructed and observed via Zoom. As Corbett explains: “They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an ‘avatar’ object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical ‘Simon effect’ where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button. Then we used some machine-learning algorithms to help us sort through all this survey and experiment data and pick out what combination of all of these things best explained whether someone inverted.”What they discovered through the cognitive testing was that a lot of assumptions being made around controller preferences were wrong. “None of the reasons people gave us [for inverting controls] had anything to do with whether they actually inverted,” says Corbett. “It turns out the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and ​​overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks.” So does this mean non-inverters are better gamers? No, says Corbett. “Though they tended to be faster, they didn’t get the correct answer more than inverters who were actually slightly more accurate.”In short, gamersthinkthey are an inverter or a non-inverter because of how they were first exposed to game controls. Someone who played a lot of flight sims in the 1980s may have unconsciously taught themselves to invert and now they consider that their innate preference; alternatively a gamer who grew up in the 2000s, when non-inverted controls became prevalent may think they are naturally a non-inverter. However, cognitive tests suggest otherwise. It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space.Consequently, Corbett says that it may improve you as a gamer to try the controller setup you are currently not using. “Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot,” she says. “You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better. A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back.”Through this research, Corbett and Munneke have established that there are complex and often unconscious cognitive processes involved in how individuals use controllers, and that these may have important ramifications for not just game hardware but for any human-computer interfaces, from aircraft controls to surgical devices. They were able to design a framework for assessing how to best configure controls for any given individual and have now made that available via their research paper.View image in fullscreenLearning curve … Corbett and Munneke’s research could even have ramifications for surgeons.Photograph: Oksana Krasiuk/Alamy“This work opened our eyes to the huge potential that optimising inversion settings has for advancing human-machine teaming,” says Corbett. “So many technologies are pairing humans with AI and other machines to augment what we can do alone. Understanding how a given individual best performs with a certain setup (controller configuration, screen placement, whether they are trying to hit a target or avoid an obstacle) can allow for much smoother interactions between humans and machines in lots of scenarios from partnering with an AI player to defeat a boss, to preventing damage to delicate internal tissue while performing a complicated laparoscopic surgery.”So what started as an idle, slightly nerdy question has now become a published cognitive research paper. One scientific publication has already cited it and interview requests are pouring in from podcasts and Youtubers. As for my takeaway? “The most surprising finding for gamers [who don’t invert] is that they might perform better if they practised with an inverted control scheme,” says Corbett. “Maybe not, but given our findings, it’s definitely worth a shot because it could dramatically improve competitive game play!”Explore more on these topicsGamesNeurosciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

What can it tell us about America today?Jonathan JonesThu 18 Sep 2025 11.16 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 11.17 EDTShareAmerica is descending into violence. The president blames the radical left. Soldiers are sent in to curb supposedly violent protests. The death toll mounts.This is May 1970 and a single month of war, civil war and music has been anatomised by Naeem Mohaiemen in his three-channel film Through a Mirror, Darkly. Mohaiemen had no way of knowing it would open as the US entered a frightening new phase of the second Trump presidency, with the shot that struck down rightwing activist Charlie Kirk echoing through sinister attempts to suppress dissent. Where will it end?Where did it end? You could make the case that this documentary artwork has an optimistic message about America today. Fifty-five years ago, in May 1970, six college students were shot dead – four by the National Guard at Kent State, Ohio, two by local police in Jackson, Mississippi. Then, as now, this seemed a country so divided and angry the result could only be civil war or dictatorship. But that did not happen. US democracy did not collapse, there was no civil war and a free press helped ensure that Nixon’s presidency ended in disgrace.Now that era is bathed in a kind of nostalgia – after all, the music was great. Bob Dylan’s Forever Young and Jimmy Cliff’s Vietnam are on Mohaiemen’s soundtrack while a student choir performs the Neil Young classic Ohio about the Kent State shooting. (“This summer I hear the drumming / Four dead in Ohio”). It was also a virulently cinematic moment. The students were protesting a war not only seen on TV screens every night, but one that would soon become the subject of iconic movies.View image in fullscreenA discussion across three channels … Through a Mirror, Darkly.Photograph: PR IMAGEIn a section on Michael Cimino’s The Deer Hunter, a Vietnamese-American film critic explains that early viewers from the Vietnamese community complained it was inaccurate: American vets were not really lured into backstreet games of Russian roulette in Saigon. But Cimino’s film is of course “metaphorical” rather than literal, she says in its defence, creating poetic images of war’s madness and despair. It is fascinating to watch this discussion across three channels with a talking head interview juxtaposed with clips of Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken playing blue-collar Americans sucked into a meaningless conflict that destroys them all in different ways.This is typical of the work’s openness and complexity. Mohaiemen forgoes a narrator or dogmatic agenda for multiple colliding images that leave you always feeling you are missing something, sowing doubt and ambiguity. One thread concerns the nature of public memory. Who gets memorialised and why? What makes one victim of violence a “martyr” while others are forgotten?He wonders why the white students killed at Kent State were mourned more widely and are remembered more vividly than a Black student and school pupil killed by police at Jackson College in the same bloody month. And why are the 58,220 US soldiers who died in Vietnam remembered with a monument in Washington DC while up to three million Vietnamese deaths are treated as less significant? Such inequalities of grief give this film a restless edge you don’t get in a standard TV documentary.The artist’s passion for archival research and respect for his interviewees leads him, however, to beautifully undermine and complicate his own argument. The very details of what happened at Jackson remain opaque. The police claimed they were fired on by a sniper, but no evidence of this was ever found. One reason, by contrast, that Kent State is so “iconic” is that the National Guard opened fire in broad daylight, surrounded by cameras, with hundreds of witnesses.View image in fullscreenOpenness and complexity … Naeem MohaiemenIn spite of his scepticism about white martyrs, Mohaiemen ends up showing with great power why Kent State haunts modern memory – in a more intimate way than Ken Burns did in his Vietnam documentary. We see it up close here, in enlarged photographs, as eyewitnesses tell the story one more time. After ordering protesters to disperse, National Guard officers huddle to discuss strategy. They then order their men to walk away from the students and, as they seem to retreat, a body of soldiers all turn at the same time, take aim and let loose hundreds of bullets. Students lie dead and dying on the grass. We no longer see it through a glass darkly. We see it face to face.Mohaiemen’s film blows away nostalgia for the era of protest and classic rock. The setting helps.Artangelhas taken over Albany House, a bleak office block that was once home to London Transport Police and has since housed various government agencies. Its sterile aesthetic reminds me of US government building from All the President’s Men.There is no reassurance here about the present. On screen, Tricky Dicky worms his way out of responsibility for the killings by pointing out that the National Guard is under state, not federal, control. But Nixon was just a crook. Trump by contrast uses the National Guard for his own ends. Worse things are just a shot away.AtAlbany House, London, from 21 September until 9 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtArtangelInstallationVideo artVietnam warreviewsShareReuse this content"

Born Welsh and Creole into largely black Dominican society in 1890, she was out of place everywhere – too foreign for Europe, too Caribbean for Britain, too white forDominica, and much too female to be taken seriously as a writer for most of her lifetime.But her literary influence continues to grow and resonate, especially with American critic and curatorHilton Als. His group show is a heady, passionate, experimental love letter to Jean Rhys – to her literature, her in-betweenness, her life of unbound creativity in a postcolonial world – in the vein of his previous exhibitions-as-portraits ofJoan DidionandJames Baldwin.View image in fullscreenBodies writhing … Untitled by Florian Krewer.Photograph: © Florian Krewer. Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery.It starts with Dominica, evoked through a blood redKara Walkerwatercolour of palms and ships, and a lush, jungly-green painting of fires and figures on horseback byHurvin Anderson, two contemporary black painters exploring the Caribbean as a place so laden with historical violence it obscures its beauty. Dominica was Rhys’s early home, and the inspiration for her most important (and final) novel,Wide Sargasso Sea, a prequel to Jane Eyre that gave voice to the Creole “madwoman in the attic” of Charlotte Brontë’s novel.Celia Paul’s wide-eyed, manic portrait of Brontë stares wildly out of a tiny canvas,Gwen John’s gorgeous, ghostly painting of a girl in a shawl stares back. Als is combining directly related work with images that invoke a wider sense of Rhys and her world, and it’s totally transportive – it immerses you in Rhys’s humid, alienating universe.Rhys left Dominica as a teen and headed for Europe, where she travelled, worked, married and remarried. Two intensely neon paintings by the young German artistFlorian Krewershow bodies twisting and writhing together, vintageHans Bellmerphotos are filled with kinky titillation, there are snapshots of Parisian streets, paintings of grubby rooms, a contorted Sarah Lucas sculpture, a grubby, textural Eugène Leroy abstract. Interwar Europe, at least for Rhys, was all sex, squalor, love and art.Downstairs, we’re taken back to Dominica, and then back again to England, as Rhys moves between the two. A hugeReggie Burrows Hodgeslandscape drenches you in jungle sweat, a dress that belonged to Rhys stands before it on a pale mannequin – small, but not dwarfed by what surrounds it.It’s hard to tell when any of the works are from. Modern Celia Paul landscapes aren’t a million miles away from an 1800 etching of a Dominican bay, history seems to be collapsing in on itself all over the show. Sex appears again in an incredible, vast, swirling, thickLeon Kossoffnude, and a wall of Walker watercolours, before the final room looks at Caribbean writers who were inspired and influenced by Rhys.Not everything here is great – twoGeorg Baselitzscribbles look tossed off and add nothing, and the Walker charcoal sex scene looks like a naff newspaper cartoon – but the show is still a highly successful exercise in exhibition making.View image in fullscreenUnbound creativity … Jean Rhys by Paul Joyce, 1977.Photograph: National Portrait Gallery LondonAls has painted a portrait of Rhys through ephemera, archive material and art. It’s not proscriptive, it doesn’t particularly have a narrative – it relies instead on vibe, on creating an atmosphere of Caribbean heat, throbbing desire, racial tension and emotional isolation. It’s like walking through memories, snapshots of a past life. It lets the idea of Rhys, her life and her world, unfold in your head.Do you have to have read Wide Sargasso Sea and Jane Eyre to get it?

But it’s also when the UK,and much of Europe, opens doors usually closed to the public, with various organisations offering rare and free access to architectural gems, cultural institutions, science hubs, courts, palaces, medieval castles, embassies – and houses that you could never afford to own.TheOpen House festival(London),Heritage Open Days(England),Doors Open Days(Scotland),Cadw’s Open Doors(Wales) andEuropean Heritage Open Days(Northern Ireland) have created programmes that celebrate the culture, history and contemporary life of the UK.Here is a selection of participating venues.Abbot House, DunfermlineView image in fullscreenThe ‘pink hoose’ of Dunfermline.Photograph: Abbot HouseThe oldest secular building in Scotland’s ancient capital, dating back to at least the 16th century and known to local people as “the pink hoose”, Abbot House is a glorious melange of architectural styles: gothic tracery windows; a fresco dated to 1571; a 1990s mural by the celebrated writer and artist Alasdair Gray. The house survived thegreat fire of Dunfermlinein 1624 – and has a lot to show for it.Awarded more than £600,000 in various grants, the house is reaching the end of a mammoth five-year restoration effort. The building is not generally open to the public yet (and the top floor is reserved for local artists’ studio space), but will be welcoming visitors this weekend. There’s a coffee shop to have a brew in before exploring the inside or taking a stroll around a beautiful walled garden. There will also be activities for the bairns.20 September, 10am-4pm, no booking required.

This cinema (now, alas, the Buzz bingo hall) from the 1930s is the only Grade I-listed cinema in the UK, and the tenor of its magic is disparate inside and out.The stunning exterior of the building was designed by Cecil Masey in the art deco style, complete with handsome Corinthian columns. But the vast and splendorous gothic-inspired interior is the work of Russian émigré Theodore Komisarjevsky, a stage and theatre director who had also trained as an architect in St Petersburg. Komisarjevsky whipped up a 150ft-long hall of mirrors, an ornate chandelier hanging from a high, coffered ceiling, and a 58ft-wide proscenium. Frank Sinatra and the Beatles have performed on its stage (sadly not together).21 September, 10am-12pm, no booking required.

Square-eyed guests will be able to explore the vaults and take a peek at restoration techniques; the process of digital preservation; iconic film posters; and the thinking that goes into collection development. The archive consists mostly of British material, but international work that has contributed significantly to British cultural life is also stored and preserved. A rare opportunity to go behind-the-scenes of the scenes.For those unable to visit in-person, check out the archive’s meticulous and frequently updatedblog(sample entry:securing Tom Cruise’s legacy).

Lasdun was awarded a Trustees’ Medal by Riba for his gorgeous design, with the citation that the poured concrete and clean lines of the RCP represented “the best architecture of its time anywhere in the world”.For those more interested in medicine than architecture, it is hosting an exhibition,A Body of Knowledge, dedicated to 500 years’ worth of medical texts and books charting the history and innovation of the discipline. Visitors are welcome on a drop-in basis, but there will also be guided tours, and activities for kids on a ticketed basis.20 September, 10am-4pm, drop-in slots or booked tours. For more details, clickhere.Laugharne Castle, LaugharneView image in fullscreenLaugharne Castle, beloved by Dylan Thomas.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyFans of Welsh literature might recognise the Carmarthenshire town of Laugharne by one of its most famous residents, the poet Dylan Thomas. The town almost certainly provided the inspiration for the fictional Llareggub inUnder Milk Wood. Its eponymous castle, originally built in 1116 as a Norman stronghold, overlooks the estuary of the River Taf. The handsome fortress has been much fought over – literally; it changed hands twice during the English civil war.In 1730, an adjacent guesthouse was built on the grounds (called, rather unimaginatively,Castle House– not everybody can have Thomas’s way with words). It was here that Thomas wrote his short story collectionPortrait of the Artist as a Young Dog, and author Richard Hughes completed his 1938 novelIn Hazard. Thomas once described it as “the best of houses in the best of places”. Unfortunately Castle House itself is now privately owned and the interior is not accessible, but the neighbouring ornamental gardens and the castle which inspired him are.20 and 21 September, 11am-4pm. No booking required.

A construction blend of concrete and timber,Edgley’s designpreserved the ancient remnant of a Victorian fruit orchard; the tree is now a central feature of a pretty internal courtyard. Floor-to-ceiling windows flood the interior spaces with light, and the house is environmentally friendly and sustainable, built with zero formaldehyde materials and thermodynamic roof panels. Edgley himself will be on hand to show guests around.20 September, 10am-4.30pm. No booking required.

Only one of the few remaining structures,the Control Tower, is usually open to the public, but this weekend the reinforced, blast-proof doors of the decontamination suite are being thrown open. (Well, maybe not thrown.)The decontamination suite was designed to cleanse personnel exposed to nerve agents in the event of a chemical attack. The suite is apparently not suitable for babies, young children and “people who suffer from claustrophobia”. The nearby control tower itself has a cafe and visitors’ centre.20 and 21 September, 11am-3pm. No booking required.

The Australian flag might give away its purpose as the home of the country’s high commission – but it was also once theGringotts Wizarding Bankin the Harry Potter films, thanks to its breathtaking beaux-arts inspired interiors (grandiose staircase, opulent patterned-marble finishes, classical pillars).Designed by a pair offather and son architects, construction began on the building in 1913, but the small matter of the first world war delayed completion, and it was eventually opened by King George V in 1918. Australia House also serves as the largest polling station in Australia’s federal elections – more votes are cast here than any station in Australian states or territories.For obvious reasons the building isn’t usually open to the public, and visitors will have to bring a government-issued form of ID to enter.20 September, 10am-3pm.

In Alice Birch’s epic about the mess of modern masculinity, they are three brothers born into privilege. “My father wanted only sons,” says Jack Roman (Kyle Soller), kicking off the narrative. Birch plays boldly with time and form, so the boys – questing Jack, voracious Marlow and troubled Edmund – are children in the late Victorian era and emerge into manhood through the succeeding 150 years.The play is subtitled “a novel” and Soller gives a pointed opening narration of familial decline and an icily abusive boarding school. For the Roman brothers, to become a man is an education in cruelty and a prompt to adventure. Each goes their own way: Jack explores the world, Marlow (Oliver Johnstone) exploits it and Edmund (beautifully played by Stuart Thompson) seeks to escape it entirely. It is only Edmund who tries to retain contact in a unreciprocated tumble of lonely words. All men, we hear, are self-made – though he laments: “I do not know that I have the pieces.”View image in fullscreenGoing their own way … Kyle Soller, Stuart Thompson and Oliver Johnstone in The Romans.Photograph: Marc BrennerBirch follows their various models of self-making through a brilliant modernist sequence, shards of experience darting between each other on Merle Hensel’s spinning platform stage. Refusing to look inward is dramatically testing. As Marlow marches inexorably from imperialist to edgelord, Johnstone can’t make him other than monumentally uninteresting.‘I had to think about Andrew Tate. That was miserable’: 150 years of masculinity, all in one playRead moreIt is a relief when women insert their voices, revising a romantic origin story (“it is essentially kidnap”) or failed marriage. Things turn postmodern as we approach the present: after the interval, Birch mediates male experience through film, cancel culture and podcasts. Masculinity becomes less an essence than a position – seductive to whooping bros and the women they grind down.Romans is a fascinating, upsetting project, and Sam Pritchard’s alert production quivers with tension under Lee Curran’s sculptural lighting. Ultimately, patriarchy seems a legacy of damage, its ravening adventures dwindling unhappily into domestic life. These Romans may have set out to take the world, but they are fundamentally lost boys, hurting themselves and perhaps all of us.AtAlmeida theatre, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlice BirchAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Stars of the synth-pop wave of the 1980s, alongside contemporaries such as Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys and Soft Cell, Blancmange made their first big impact with their UK Top 10 hitLiving on the Ceiling(1982), while its parent album, Happy Families, reached the UK Top 30.Luscombe’s keyboard skills, Arthur’s idiosyncratic vocals and the duo’s studio wizardry and knack for melodic hooks would prove a potent combination. Luscombe would later recall how the best concert he had ever seen was by electronic pioneers Kraftwerk at London’s Roundhouse in 1976. “I haven’t seen anything since that was anywhere near as good,” he declared. “Them all in suits with short hair and their computers and all these hippies sitting watching.”Blancmange enjoyed a further streak of hit singles taken from the follow-up Mange Tout (1984), a Number 8 hit on the album chart. The singles Blind Vision and Don’t Tell Me both reached the Top 10, That’s Love, That It Is made it to No 33, while their version of Abba’s The Day Before You Came went to No 22. Luscombe would recall how the latter song prompted a generous response from the Swedish superstars. “Agnetha and Anni-Frid wrote us a letter and said they really liked our version as it gave them special memories and made them laugh,” he told Classic Pop magazine. “But then we left the bloody letter in the pub and never saw it again.” He added that: “We had no idea that it was the very last song that Abba recorded together, that’s why it sounds so melancholic.”Blancmange’s commercial profile declined subsequently, with What’s Your Problem their last Top 40 hit single and the third album, Believe You Me, reaching only No 54. In June 1986, following a Greenpeace concert at the Royal Albert Hall, Blancmange announced they were splitting up. Arthur told Classic Pop: “Me and Stephen, we’re like chalk and cheese. When that’s constructive it’s really good, but when it’s destructive you haven’t got a chance.”In 1989, Luscombe released the album New Demons, under the name of West India Company. This was in the wake of a visit he had made to India with Boy George, where George recorded with a 100-piece Indian orchestra and the singerAsha Bhosle. The album was a collection of Indian-inspired pieces (echoing the use of tabla and sitar on Living on the Ceiling), where Luscombe collaborated with Bhosle and the singer Priya Khajuria, the tabla player Pandit Dinesh and Peter Culshaw.View image in fullscreenLuscombe with bandmate Neil Arthur at the Westbury hotel, London, 1985.Photograph: Andre Csillag/ShutterstockLuscombe was born in Hillingdon, north-west London. Before he met Arthur, he had gained considerable experience in experimental music, not least through playing the violin with the Portsmouth Sinfonia. This had been founded at the Portsmouth School of Art, and the composer Gavin Bryars, who taught there, encouraged anyone to join, regardless of their musical ability, or lack of it (Brian Eno played the clarinet). In May 1974, the Portsmouth Sinfonia (billed as “the World’s Worst Orchestra”) played to a sell-out crowd at the Royal Albert Hall. Luscombe commented that “The whole point was it didn’t matter, you just had to try your best.”Subsequently, Luscombe had assembled his own experimental music workshop called MIRU, or Music Improvisation Research Unit, which would play versions of pop standards such as These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ as well as their own compositions and bursts of improvised noise. One night they were performing in the college bar at the Harrow School of Art, and Neil Arthur was among the bemused listeners.Luscombe recalled how “the night that Neil saw us we had five percussionists and the bar was full of lawnmowers and washing machines. We’d find washing machines on the way to gigs and then plug them in and see what happened. The barman absolutely loathed us. We just thought it was funny.”Arthur had his own band, The Viewfinders, while pursuing his college studies. Luscombe also had a full-time job in graphics and printing, but the pair ended up getting together to make their own recordings at Luscombe’s home in Hayes, west London. At first these were instrumentals, until Arthur belatedly revealed that he had a rather impressive singing voice.They added Laurence Stevens on drums, but he left shortly after the group’s formation. In April 1980 the duo released a limited-edition debut EP, Irene & Mavis. This went broadly unnoticed, but that changed when Blancmange’s song Sad Day was included on the compilation Some Bizzare Album (1981), a showcase for as-yet-unknown synth-pop groups including the The, Depeche Mode and Soft Cell. This prompted London Records to offer them a deal, and in 1982 they had minor hit singles with God’s Kitchen/I’ve Seen the Word and Feel Me. Then came Living on the Ceiling, a hit in the UK and on several international charts, and the success of Happy Families.In 2011, Luscombe and Arthur combined for a belated fourth Blancmange album, Blanc Burn, but Luscombe subsequently had to step away from the band because of his aneurysm, which he learned was a hereditary condition. In 2013 the duo’s rerecorded version of Blancmange’s debut album, named Happy Families Too…, was released, but Luscombe was unable to participate in the subsequent concert tour for health reasons.Stephen Luscombe, musician and songwriter, born 29 October 1954; died 13 September 2025Explore more on these topicsPop and rockobituariesShareReuse this content"

They’re all Picassos. Not one is Dora Maar.”The couple met at the end of 1935 when she was taking photographs to promote Jean Renoir’s film The Crime of Monsieur Lange. At the time, Picasso was in a relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter, with whom he had a daughter Maya, that continued during his years with Maar.He frequently represented Maar, whose masochistic tendencies fascinated him, as a tortured figure often in tears as in La Femme qui pleure (Weeping Woman), which experts say he intended to represent the suffering of the Spanish civil war but was also indicative of his allegedabuse of Maarand the couple’s many physical fights.In the rediscovered work, Maar’s face, fragmented but painted in bright colour without perspective, appears anguished and on the point of weeping. At the time Maar had learned that Picasso, then 61, intended to leave her for the artist Françoise Gilot, 21.The portrait was completed in July 1943 and was only displayed a handful of times outside hisParisatelier in the Rue des Grands Augustins. It has been in a private collection since it was bought in August 1944 – the month of the liberation of Paris.Its existence was known from a black and white photograph taken shortly before it was sold that featured in an art catalogue. The seller, who inherited the painting from a grandparent, an unnamed French collector, has asked to remain anonymous.The Nazis occupying Paris during the second world war considered Picasso’s work “degenerate”, which led to raids on his atelier and threats of a ban on exhibiting his paintings.Maar, who died in Paris in 1997 aged 89, is credited with being Picasso’s muse as well as his subject and lover,but she was a surrealist photographer in her own rightand her style had a major influence on his work during their relationship.The auction house Lucien Paris, which has conservatively estimated the oil painting measuring 80cm x 60cm at about €8m (£6.9m) but expects it to fetch far more, had kept the painting’s existence a secret before unveiling it to the press on Thursday.Auctioneer Christophe Lucien said it was a significant discovery and described the work as a masterpiece and a rare example of how Picasso’s output was a much needed light during the dark days of the occupation. He said experts knew it existed from the photographs but it was the first time the true colours of the work could be seen.“It is not only a milestone in the history of art but also in the private life of Picasso,” Lucien said.“It is a refreshing portrait of Dora Maar; exceptional and full of emotion. Discovering it is a big moment in our lives as experts.”The painting will be sold at auction by Lucien Paris on 24 October and will be on display for three days before the sale.Explore more on these topicsPablo PicassoParisFranceEuropePaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

Then, one random Wednesday, came a terrible, wrenching phone callThu 18 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 10.09 EDTShareMany lifelong alliances begin with a period of mild intimidation, and so it was with my friendship with Nichola. We were 18, in the first year at university, and shared a few French classes. I didn’t know her name, had never heard her speak in English but, with her voluminous curls and friendly, curious stare, she stood out. I assumed she would be too cool to hang around with someone like me.One weekend, at a student social in the grotty union bar, booze acted as an icebreaker and the guardrails dropped. Nods of recognition in the corridor became cheery hellos, then toasties in the cafe, followed by nights out and nursing hangovers in front of the TV in our dilapidated student houses.She was from Derry, I am from Yorkshire, and we bonded over being far from home, not quite slotting into the rapidly forming cliques, and, like most students in the 90s, never having any money. If one of us happened to get hold of some – from a part-time job, a birthday or a compassionate bank manager – then it meant webothhad money. Before our autumn term grant cheques had even cleared, we would race off to buy something new to wear to cheer ourselves up, living off tea and toast and £1 pints until the next windfall.View image in fullscreen‘My favourite photo of her, taken by me, on the phone to her family in Derry, in our shared student house in 1998.’Photograph: Courtesy of Justin MyersAfter a couple of years, we befriended Emma (not her real name), and the three of us weathered life’s milestones together. Nichola had her first baby the same year I came out as gay, and we survived relationship changes, career shifts, house moves and family dramas. Her successes, of which there were many, were ours; we felt each other’s tragedies as if they were our own.Once we were “proper grownups”, Emma and I would spend Sundays at Nichola’s house with her, her husband, and two children, doing “Sunday club”: cooking a roast together, gossiping, cracking jokes and dancing in the kitchen to songs from our youth. I had a piece of heaven and didn’t realise until it was taken away.The call came from Emma, one hot summer afternoon. Glancing at my phone screen, I assumed it was a last-minute catch up about the Sunday club holiday to Spain we were booked to go on in two weeks’ time. Nichola had died suddenly and unexpectedly; there was nothing anyone could have done.Hearing the news was the strangest, most terrifying experience of my life. I felt something primal, almost, in the shock and panic of my immediate grief. I’d been devastated to lose my grandmothers years earlier, but I understood that was the order of things; dying in old age. Nichola’s death was extraordinary, alien. It didn’t make sense, it couldn’t be true – we had been texting the day before, we had plans that weekend, holiday shopping to do. It was a random Wednesday; how could this nothing of a day become so significant in a flash? The day of her death is a dark, misshapen jigsaw piece that doesn’t fit the blue-skied, happy and silly puzzle of a life we had shared. I remember it with photographic horror.In the following days and weeks, Emma and I parked our grief, prioritising Nichola’s family. They would be hit hardest by her death, after all – especially her young sons. Along with other relatives, we kept things ticking over, and tackled agonising admin duties. I wrote and read a tribute at her funeral on behalf of her friends, and assigned myself the task of cancelling the holiday. The travel company were monsters and treated me as if I was attempting fraud. They demanded to speak to Nichola’s devastated husband and requested details locked away in her work email. I remember taking scans of her passport and death certificate to secure a potential refund – nothing hits you with the truth harder than plain English, in ink, on official paper. Her home felt so different, the rooms larger and starker, echoey. It was like a bad dream, really, except I’ve never woken up from it.Busying yourself with practicalities is a survival technique but, if anything, it delayed processing Nichola’s death. Leaving the immediate bubble of mourners was difficult. The world looked exactly the same, but my heart felt cratered, the intensity of my grief impossible to convey to outsiders.View image in fullscreenProper grownups … pictured in Southampton, 10 years after graduation.Photograph: Courtesy of Justin MyersWhen we consider others’ grief, we default to relationships’ natural hierarchies as a benchmark. As a society, we recognise the scope of devastation of losing a family member; it needs little context, even for those harbouring resentments. Her children would never have another mother, her husband had lost the love of his life and, as a daughter and sister, she was irreplaceable. Such losses are devastating and transformative. A friendship is harder to quantify. What right did I have to grieve for her so powerfully when I had other friends?The depth of my grief seemed to confuse people who didn’t know her. They would ask how close we were, how long I’d known her, how often we saw each other. I felt I somehow had to justify it, and stress how much she meant to me. I began to feel guilty, as if I didn’t have a right to be so utterly lost when the lives of those closer to her had been torn apart.Friendships are ongoing conversations … they predate and outlast romancesAfter losing a family member, nobody expects much from you for months, but Emma and I had to get back to work. I was given one week off from my freelance role; Emma spent days at her desk, fighting back tears, barely concentrating. We weren’t ready, but grief is inconvenient for others and has a time limit; your sadness makes them uncomfortable.The gaps in my life crept up on me. One fewer birthday text comes through, a new juicy piece of gossip goes untold, your calendar has more blank spaces, once-shared activities become less fun. One of the first things Nichola and I would do on meeting up was appraise each other’s outfits. All these years later, when I buy something, I try to picture her reaction. Emma does the same.Maybe we overlook the grief of friends because “friend” is a cover-all label, applied to workmates and acquaintances as well as bosom buddies, offering no clue to the importance you have in each other’s lives. Friends perform different functions: the oracle, the confidant, the party animal, the organiser, to name a few. Some do it simultaneously, while others are specialists. I miss Nichola’s level-headedness and knack for empathy; she talked us all off so many ledges. I miss being her sounding board and my opinion being trusted so implicitly. There is no greater honour than being someone’s go-to. I miss Sunday club.View image in fullscreen‘Hearing the news was the strangest, most terrifying experience of my life’ … Justin Myers.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianGrieving a friend is more than simply mourning their death. Friendships are ongoing conversations, evolving shared histories. They predate and outlast romances, endure through births, deaths, and divorces; our friends witness every version of ourselves, treasure secrets, corroborate testimonies. Now, some of my most formative years are tagged with “citation needed” – but it will never come.As a friend, you may question your credentials. Nichola’s bond with her family was in their DNA, unspoken, a love that shone for all to see, but I began to wonder; was I a good enough friend? Did she know how much she meant to us, that Emma and I considered her a sister?My best friend of 50 years knew me better than anyone. But when she died, no one seemed to take my grief seriouslyRead moreNichola and I argued only twice during our 25-year friendship (both rows were my fault) but decades of guilt, unspent, rushed back: messages I forgot to answer, catch-ups I missed, the times I’d been a dick and wasn’t taken to task. I had run out of time to make amends; proof of my affection came too late, in a eulogy she would never hear, and sleepless nights trying to remember her voice, or looking at the few photos of us together. We were too busy living life to document it; I wish we’d paused more to recognise what we had. The future looked so exciting until we ran out of it.Anyone I speak to who has also lost a close friend talks of the strange emptiness that comes from being a dotted line in someone’s life, about the aimlessness of their grief. There is no manual, and the much-quoted (sometimes to my face) seven stages of grief oversimplify it. Friendships are as precious as familial bonds, shaped by the times you share. “Nichola wasn’t just some two-dimensional sort of friend who could be replaced,” Emma told me. If someone has lost a friend, a piece of them is missing; we should perhaps remember that.So how do you get through it? It’s that old cliche: one day at a time. Emma and I keep Nichola’s memory alive by talking about her constantly, and applying her positivity and zest for life to who we are now. We act as conduit for the pride and love she would feel for her sons as they grow into remarkable young men. Everything I do has one eye on making her proud. Nothing feels as good as it used to, but I know Nichola would be devastated to think of us in pain. It’s the best tribute, really, to live as fully and happily as you can. Her life has ended, but her influence endures, and our friendship burns brighter than ever.The Glorious Dead by Justin Myers is published on 18 September, by Renegade Books (£18.99).

I have a visceral reaction to itI’ve lived with Gina for two years, after we both went through breakups and needed a new place to live. She’s fun and kind, but what annoys me at home is her tendency to brush her teeth around the house. She’ll do it in the kitchen sink sometimes, if she’s running out the door.Gina has ADHD and is always doing three tasks at once. She will leave her keys in the door, which I worry about, or forget where she put her toothbrush in the morning. I’ll come home and see that she has left it on the side of the kitchen counter after using it, which I find gross, because the kitchen is for cooking, not for spitting. It’s where vegetables get washed and cups are rinsed. It should not be where I look down and see a foam trail of toothpaste sliding towards the plughole.In the bathroom, Gina has another bad habit – she drinks straight from the tap while brushing her teethIn the bathroom, Gina has another bad habit – she drinks straight from the tap while brushing her teeth. Not once, not twice, but four or five times a session to rinse out her mouth. She leans over, sucks water directly from the faucet, swishes it around her mouth and spits. I can hear the whole symphony from my room, and I have a visceral reaction to it. I lie there and recoil. Why not just use a cup?I don’t know if her mouth is touching the tap, but I don’t want to know. That’s the same tap I use when I wash my face and when I fill up my water bottle.I don’t think this is me being precious. It’s about hygiene, and recognising that shared spaces require shared standards. Brushing your teeth should be confined to the bathroom sink, and done without turning the tap into a communal drinking fountain.Gina has said she will try to stop, but every time I ask, she pauses for about a week and then carries on again. Living with someone with ADHD is challenging at the best of times, but sometimes I feel she uses it as an excuse. I’m not perfect, but if someone asks me to change something about myself, I do try to take that on board. Gina could try a bit harder.The defence: GinaLiving with ADHD is difficult,and anyway, the kitchen is not some sacred food-only zoneRaquel is exaggerating and missing the context. I sometimes brush my teeth in the kitchen sink, drink from the bathroom tap and leave my stuff lying around, but that’s just a part of having a brain like mine. I live with ADHD, and that means getting distracted easily.In the morning before heading out, I will brush my teeth at the same time as putting on my shoes, or making my lunch in the kitchen because I’m multitasking. The kitchen sink has running water and drains just like the bathroom sink, and it all ends up in the same pipes. It’s not, as Raquel thinks, some sacred food-only zone.You be the judge – send us your domestic disputesRead moreI rinse the sink afterwards – I’m not leaving spit floating around. And, if anything, the kitchen sink probably gets cleaned more often than the bathroom. I also don’t do this every day. There’s only evidence if I leave my toothbrush on the side, which I shouldn’t do but my brain forgets to put it back sometimes.Bathrooms are not sterile laboratories. Unless Raquel is bleaching the tap daily, we’re both coming into contact with germsWith the taps, lots of people drink from them. I grew up doing it. My brother and I would always brush our teeth like this. To me, it’s normal to rinse your mouth out by drinking from the tap. Filling up a cup every time feels like unnecessary admin. I don’t put my whole mouth around the tap, I just sort of hover, or tilt the stream towards me and catch it. The way Raquel imagines it, it’s like I’m a cat with a saucer, licking it clean. I like to rinse properly, so I do take around five chugs, which might sound excessive, but it means my teeth feel clean.Bathrooms are not sterile laboratories, and germs are everywhere. Unless Raquel is bleaching the tap daily, we’re both coming into contact with germs in the bathroom.Living with ADHD is hard. Plus, I could list things Raquel does that annoy me: everyone has bad habits, but I accept them because we share a home. I can’t promise that I will change. I have tried not to walk around brushing my teeth, but I keep forgetting.The jury of Guardian readersShould Gina stop brushing Raquel’s complaints aside?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Drinking from the tap isn’t unhygienic – even if Gina sucked on it – because the water is on the inside of the pipe. But it sounds as if Gina thinks her ADHD gives her a free pass. She should respect Raquel’s discomfort and try to change her behaviour. Also, rinsing after brushing your teeth washes away the fluoride – you should just spit.Mark, 64It seems as if Raquel’s distaste at what Gina sees as her harmless quirks is about more than toothbrushing. If Gina changes her ways, Raquel will soon find fault with something else. It sounds as if this house-share has run its course.Caroline, 60Gina is right that in shared spaces we must make accommodations, but she is refusing to accommodate a reasonable preference from her flatmate. This is less about hygiene than about mutual respect of boundaries.Molly, 26Drinking from the tap is fine, if there’s no direct mouth contact. But leaving a toothbrush on the kitchen sink is gross – end of. I don’t have ADHD, but I feel that Gina is using it as an excuse.Thomas, 30If Raquel can learn to work with Gina’s ADHD, Gina can show willingness to adapt. Also, not rinsing after brushing her teeth means Gina will keep the benefits of her toothpaste and solve two problems in one.Marianne, 36Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us if you think Gina needs to clean up her actThe poll closes on Wednesday 24 September at 9am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked if Abi should stop picking up other people’s litter.11%of you said yes –Abi is guilty89%of you said no –Abi is innocentThis article was updated on 18 September 2025.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I joke, of course. But there’s no denying cycling safety is a complex and divisive topic. Personally? I enjoy my rides more when I feel visible and protected. Thanks to a disappointing absence of thoughtfully executed cycling infrastructure in much of the UK, this often means leaning on gadgets and gizmos to offer something resembling peace of mind.I’ve tested a lot of cycling safety kit over the years, and I’ll be the first to admit that plenty of it is gimmicky at best. But every now and then, something genuinely useful comes along – something I’d never ride without again.I’m not alone in this. From semi-professional road racers to office commuters, lots of cyclists own safety products they swear by. Below are some top recommendations from them and from me.Cycling safety essentialsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: EyeEm Mobile GmbH/Getty ImagesRadarWhen I first heard about this thing, I scoffed. What’s wrong with just looking over your shoulder? It mounts to the seat post of your bike and alerts you to objects approaching from behind, giving you a rough idea of speed and proximity via a pairedbike computeror smartphone.I first tried it five years ago, and I haven’t ridden without it since. It’s no substitute for having your wits about you, but it gives you time to react to potential close passes and stops you from being startled when cars seem to appear out of nowhere. It’s not much use in the city, but for those who ride on fast, rural roads, it’s invaluable.View image in fullscreenGarmin Varia RVR315£129.99 at Garmin£119.99 at AmazonCameraYou don’tneedone … until you do. If you’re involved in an incident, it’s your word against theirs. Having footage of the event can help with legal proceedings and insurance. It also means you can report instances of dangerous driving and, in theory, be taken seriously.I find drivers give me a wider berth and pass more carefully when I’m using mine.

Many modern bike computers and fitness wearables have this technology built in, but it’s also available via standalone devices that can be clipped on to a helmet or slipped into a pocket while riding.They can be configured to notify a contact of choice when an impact is detected. I had a bad crash last year that left me dazed at the side of the road, and my wife was calling before I’d even had time to process what just happened. This makes it very useful for long-distance rides in rural locations.Specialized’s ANGi Crash Sensor is a relatively affordable option for those who don’t have this feature already on a bike computer or smartwatch. Connect it to the Specialized app and you’re good to go. If there’s no signal, it can be set to alert your nearest and dearest if you don’t make it back from a ride in a set time, sending them your last known GPS location.View image in fullscreenSpecialized ANGi Crash Sensor£38.99 at Cyclestore£45 at TredzCompact bellI might have overthought this, but the tone of my Knog Oi bell feels slightly less abrasive than other bells, so I’m more inclined to use it, and I find pedestrians are less startled by it.

When wearing them, all I have to do is glance to the side and I can see what’s behind me. And they’re sunglasses too.

Some of them spray out light in all directions, which can dazzle oncoming cars.In Germany, there’s a ‘Straßenverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung’ or road traffic licensing regulation relating to this, which says that front bike lights must have a cut-off, so that the beam pattern stays below a certain level. This helps you to see and be seen, without dazzling other road users.

Since buying a helmet with an integrated rear light, it’s no longer a concern. I always wear a helmet, which means I always have my light. In some cases, they’re more expensive than a regular helmet, but when you take into consideration what you’d be likely to spend on both items individually, it makes sense to combine the two.NQView image in fullscreenHalfords commuter helmet£30 at HalfordsThe best bike lights to see and be seen when cycling in the dark, tried and testedRead moreWearable lockIt’s more for security than safety, but the locks that wrap around your waist are great.

That is, first work out the size of the dish in relation to the size of the pasta sheets (this applies to both fresh and dried), then decide how many layers you want, not only to establish how many sheets you need, but also to proportion the various fillings accordingly. We also decided that the construction of a lasagne should be like that of a bricklayer combined with a Jackson Pollock approach to the sauces.My ceramic lasagne dish is 30cm x 20cm, and three 10cm x 25cm dried lasagne sheets make a single layer in it, so a five-layer lasagne requires 15 sheets. Most dried lasagne sold today doesn’t require pre-cooking or soaking, but those sheets depend on the sauce being liquid enough to provide enough moisture to hydrate and cook them. Dry sheets also require a relatively long cooking time, so, in the case of today’s lasagne, which involves a dense and creamy, rather than a liquid sauce, I dip the sheets into boiling water for 30 seconds, then in cold water and then lay them on a tea towel to dry, which gives them a head start. It also reduces the total cooking time, which suits the delicate texture of the courgette and ricotta in the sauce.Aware of the price of cheese (and also of what you might have in your fridge), I have given a range of quantities for the ricotta, parmesan and either taleggio or asiago. You can also substitute cheeses, using whatever you have to hand and to your taste, and compensate with generous seasoning and the addition of herbs. What is key for flavour, however, is the initial frying of the courgettes in olive oil and with salt, but this is intended only to get them started, because they will continue cooking in the oven, as well as fusing with the cheese and bechamel, which also functions as lasagne binding.I think that lasagne is invariably better when it is allowed to sit for at least 20 minutes before serving (and up to an hour in a warm spot), which gives the flavours time to settle and the whole thing – and in particular the cheese – time to firm up, so it cuts more easily into squares. The last slice, reheated the next day, is, of course, the best slice of all.Lasagne with courgette and three cheesesServes4-615dried lasagne sheets, or enough to make 5 layers3 tbsp olive oil,plus extra for greasing3 large or 4 medium courgettes, cut into small cubesSalt and black pepper400g ricotta1 heaped tbspfreshlyminced marjoram80g butter,plus extra for dotting on top70g plain flour800ml whole milkNutmeg60-80g parmesan, grated100-200g taleggio or asiago, cut into cubes2 tbsp dried breadcrumbsPrepare the lasagne sheets according to the packet instructions; if you are blanching them, lay them on tea towels until you are ready.Warm the olive oil in a frying pan on a medium flame, then cook the cubed courgettes with a pinch of salt, moving the cubes around until they are just starting to soften and turns translucent. Remember they will continue cooking in oven, so pull off the heat and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the ricotta, marjoram and a pinch of salt.Melt the butter in a pan, then add the flour and stir to make a thick paste. Slowly whisk in the milk and continue cooking, whisking continuously, until the bechamel thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a tablespoon of the grated parmesan.Smear the base of a suitable oven dish with olive oil, spread over spoonful of the bechamel, then make a base layer of dried lasagne sheets. Make another layer using a fifth of the bechamel topped with a quarter of the courgette and ricotta mixture, a quarter of the cubed cheese and a sprinkling of parmesan. Make another layer of pasta, then repeat the process three more times, ending with a layer of pasta. Cover that with the remaining bechamel, the breadcrumbs and dots of butter, then bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20-30 minutes, or until the edges are bubbling and the top golden.Explore more on these topicsPastaA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkCheeseVegetablesMain courseStarterrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Greek wines get a lot of praise from me, and I’m not going to stop any time soon. This week, the particular drum I’m beating has “moschofilero” written all over it. Yes, mos-ko-FIL-ero, because this is a grape variety to explore if you’re after a new wine that can be had for very competitive prices.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s an ancient grape that’s grown predominantly in the Peloponnese and onthe Mantinia plateau, where the cool climate and average elevation help this delicate grape ripen. While the wines it makes are united by a steady acid, they can also range from the intensely aromatic to the clean and zesty.So, what’s it like? I can compare it to a few things, which I always find helpful to my understanding of any grape. First, much like pinot grigio/pinot gris, moschofilero has a gorgeous, sunset-pink skin, despite it being a white grape. This means that, when the wine is left in contact with those skins, it turns a gorgeous blush pink. While such wines are marketed as rosés, technically they’re actually orange wines, because they’re produced with white grapes.The other grape I’d compare it to is gewürztraminer, which is to say, moschofilero is also used to make intensely aromatic whites: think rose petals, blossoms, jasmine, stone fruit, et cetera, et cetera. That’s why it’s known as a chameleon grape, a description that hints at its versatility and the many styles it can be used to produce, which is just one reason modern sommeliers love it so.Emily Acha Derrington, who helped develop the wine list for London’s smash hit GreekOma(she’s now wine buyer atManteca), attests to its shapeshifting qualities: “It can sit in more than one category on a restaurant list, so it’s ideal for playing around with different styles to find what works with the food you cook at home.”As a white wine, it has an acidity that works well with herby starters and Greek-style flaky filo pastries, but when it’s pink, it goes with lighter meat dishes, such as lamby salads. Emily’s favourite, however, is when it’s turned into an orange wine with more skin contact than conventional pale rosés: “They can be quite powerful, both in terms of colour and in tannin texture, but the pithy orange aromatics balance so well with the savoury, tea-like hints and dry finish.” These are wines that work especially well with chargrilled skewers, zesty salads and dips with bread for mopping them up.Those who buy their wine at the supermarket will be pleased to learn that a few of the big boys have at last embraced moschofilero as part of their own-label ranges (I suggest a couple below), but if you’re keen to shop independent, then may I recommend specialist retailerMaltby & Greek, which doesn’t have just moschofilero or even just Greek wines, but also olive oil, cheese, meat and breads.Four faces of moschofileroLoved & Found Moschofilero Rosé£9.25 Waitrose, 12.5%.

A hit of vitamin D before the summer wardrobe is put away for another year, and I am ready to fully embrace autumn and winter hermit mode. I’ve always felt that September is the perfect time to escape to the Mediterranean for a last-minute injection of sun and, in this instance, to indulge in pasta, gelato and a healthy side of aperitivo. I cannot wait.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Because I have to cook a million meals before I go, I have prepared the family Rachel Roddy’schicken thighs with cherry tomatoes and a green bean, lettuce and parmesan saladfor a meal I know they all will devour. I’ve also made Felicity Cloake’sraspberry panna cottawith the haul we harvested from our local pick-your-own farm, a recipe she confirms also works with overripe or crushed berries that aren’t quite in top shape. There is also a tub of Rachel’scourgette, goat’s cheese and lemon risottoin the fridge, because we nabbed a couple of courgettes at the farm, too. That should keep my household going for a bit.When I get back, I know I’ll be on my Italian-inspired cloud, so it’ll be more pasta than normal (is that possible?) and miniature cannoli with an espresso in the afternoon for a pick-me-up.

And, while I hate to admit it, I know I’ll be coming back to a change of season and all that autumn brings. Perhaps an autumn feast from Ben Tish’sSicilian spreadwill help soften the blow – panelle, sea salt and salsa verde being one of my favourite snacks. Or maybe I will follow Ben’s recipes forgranita, and serve trays of it in the morning, alongside a stack of brioche buns. It is a traditional Sicilian breakfast, after all, so it would be rude not to.

It’s a sparkling prosecco-like aperitif, but made from apples instead of grapes. I eat a few cinnamon apple chips, then move on to the hard stuff: brandy made from heritage apple varieties.If you hadn’t guessed, apples are big business around here. I’m on a walking trip along the shores of Lake Constance, on Germany’s southern border. About 250,000 tonnes of apples are harvested in this region each year. Our trip has coincided with theannual gourmet event, when local producers set up stalls and sell their wares along 9 miles (15km) of theSeeGang hiking trailbetween Überlingen, Sipplingen and Bodman-Ludwigshafen (this year it takes place on 12 October). If apples aren’t your jam, there’s also pear-secco and spirits made from everything from plums, cherries and blackcurrants to jerusalem artichokes. Hikers can also sample food such as smoked sausages, cheeses, onion tarts, and homemade cakes and pies.Lake Constance mapLake Constance’s tourism tagline is: “Four countries – one lake”. Germany, Austria and Switzerland all meet at the lake, while Lichtenstein is just a half-hour drive away. On our short break, my boyfriend and I stick to the German section, but those with more time could easily visit three or four countries. There is a160-mile cycling circuitaround the lake, which can be divided into four to eight stages; and week-longfoodie,activeandhighlightsitineraries, all doable using public transport. TheBodensee ticketgives unlimited travel on trains, buses and ferries (from €48 for three days), while theBodensee Card Plusalso includes entry to 160 attractions (from €78 for three days; €124 for seven).View image in fullscreenHearty meat dishes and their vegan equivalents are on the menu at Constanzer Wirtshaus, on Lake Constance.Photograph: Image Broker/AlamyWe started our trip in Konstanz (anglicised as Constance), the biggest city on the lake. We took aguided tourto learn about the city’s long history – most notably the Council of Constance of 1414-1418, a series of meetings to resolve years of schism within the Catholic church – and visit its landmarks: the council building itself; Imperia, a controversial 9-metre (30ft) rotating waterfront statue of a voluptuous woman, believed to be a courtesan, holding a king and a pope in her hands, created in 1993 by Peter Lenk; themünster(cathedral) and its 78-metre tower with views over the city, lake and mountains; and the charming Niederburg district, with its cobbled alleyways and houses from the late Middle Ages.While the sun was shining, we ate outside by the water atConstanzer Wirtshaus, an inn in a former officers’ mess, built for Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1899. As well as hearty meat dishes such as knuckle of pork, shredded ox and beef roulade, I was delighted to find delicious vegan versions of regional dishes.Maultaschen, usually meat-filled dumplings, were made with plant-based mince and served with a potato and cucumber salad and vegetable gravy.We were starting to tire when we heard the rousing sound of an oompah band. Heading towards the music, we emerged at a picture-perfect mountain innWhen it rained, we took refuge inBrauhaus Joh Albrecht, a brewery and restaurant in a medieval building. Alongside its core menu of sausages, schnitzels and Swabian (southwest German) specialities such askäsespätzle(pasta with cheese and roasted onions), it serves seasonal dishes. The pumpkin soup with giant pretzels was proving popular; this autumn there is a chanterelle mushroom menu, pleasingly called apfifferlingskartein German. We tried the malty Copper beer; later in the year, the dark, strong Xmas Bock will go on sale.View image in fullscreenFruit liqueurs and spirits for sale on the shores of Lake Constance.Photograph: Neil Clive FowlerAfter all this indulgence, it was time to walk to our campsite, nearly 19km (12 miles) around the lake. Just outside the city, we reached the invitingBodensee-Thermebaths, with indoor and outdoor pools, saunas and steam rooms. We pressed on and passedMainau, known as the flower island. In September, the dahlias are in full bloom and the katsura trees give off scents of gingerbread and caramel; the arboretum is at its leaf-peeping peak in October; and the illuminatedChristmas gardenopens on 18 November.We left the lake and headed a little way into the countryside, walking through meadows and climbing a couple of hills, before strolling through the lakeside village of Dingelsdorf to theCampingplatz Klausenhornjust beyond. The nights were getting chilly, so we were glad to be staying in a cosy sleeping barrel rather than a tent. These wooden structures are supposedly based on the accommodation at the Council of Constance – but presumably a lot warmer and cleaner. The campsite has a cafe, sells fresh bread in the mornings and hosts a market on Fridays.Ufer 39, a restaurant a short walk away, serves local dishes plus pizza and pasta, in a modern space with a vaulted ceiling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was the start of our gourmet walk – shorter (at about 7 miles) than the previous day’s route but more challenging – traversing ravines, forests and, of course, orchards. A particularly memorable stop was at the Torkelbühl viewpoint, where the Kress Winery was serving wine and snacks to accompany the incredible lake panorama.Beyond Sipplingen, we were starting to tire when we heard the rousing sound of an oompah band. We headed towards the music and emerged at theHöhengasthaus Haldenhof, a picture-perfect mountain inn whose sun terrace has views all the way to the Alps. Fortified by more excellent German beer, it was a short hop to our journey’s end, theSeehotel Adlerin Bodman-Ludwigshafen. With a heated outdoor pool and three saunas, it was certainly a good place to relax after a hike. The restaurant serves pike and char fish alongside pork cheeks and steaks, and more excellent vegetarian options such aspanzerotti(mini calzones) stuffed with porcini and truffles, with thyme butter.We’d packed a lot in, but there was so much left to see: the island old town ofLindau; the Middle Agescastle at Meersburg; the Zeppelin city ofFriedrichshafen.

Terrified, I rushed inside and locked the door. Clearly, fear is not rational, or I would have understood that serpents don’t have arms.I adore lizards. I’ve visited Indonesia’s komodo dragons and cuddled shinglebacks in Australia’s red centre but I have always been more scared than seduced by snakes.When I was growing up in country Queensland in the 1970s, we often encountered venomous snakes – our tiny town even had a Black Snake Creek. Running around our back yard it was common to almost trip over a deadly king brown. Parental advice: “Just freeze. Keep an eye on it. And sing out to Mum.”Mum would shout to Dad, who was a bit of a Steve Irwin-type, and he’d grab a hessian bag, casually toss the reptile in, then escort it up to the farm shed to eat the rats.View image in fullscreen‘Carpet pythons … are great for the environment, as they eat bush rats, and keep noisier neighbours like possums from moving into roofs.’Photograph: Christine Retschlag/The GuardianBefore living in Brisbane, I’d never encountered a python, only venomous snakes. My anxious mother understandably did a hard sell on the horrors of snake bites, lest one of her four children succumb to their fangs. This gave me the same kind of fear you’d get playing hide and seek as a kid. You love the game but there’s an element of adrenaline when found. Should I fight or flee?Fast forward several decades and I’m living 4km from Brisbane’s city centre, with a bushy back yard which I have deliberately grown wild to encourage possums, kookaburras, water dragons and sulphur-crested cockatoos. And, it turned out, 10 years into living on the property, non-venomous eastern carpet pythons.View image in fullscreenA snake skin left ‘hanging over the deck like stockings’.Photograph: Christine Retschlag/The GuardianOvercoming my terror of these new housemates was gradual. Critics say it’s wrong to anthropomorphise an animal but watching the serene Sylvia slither from my ceiling into the cypress pine which overhangs my back deck was the first step. By naming her – I assumed it was a she from her gentle energy – and observing her I quickly learned what a beautiful and clever creature she was.I loved how she would dislocate her jaw to yawn or when hungry. How she used her forked tongue to smell. I was fascinated when her eyes would go milky in the days before she shed her skin, a gift she would leave hanging over the deck like stockings. On hot days she would stretch her ever increasing girth along the back deck and allow me to run my hands along the curves of her spine.Sylvia eventually grew too curvy to squeeze back into the ceiling cavity. Carpet pythons are territorial and, soon after, another arrived, then another.When a sick possum showed up in my garden my heart overtook my head. Is it ever OK to feed urban wildlife?Read moreStraight after Sylvia came Son of Satan, or Shitty for short. Sadly Shitty thought he was a taipan, one of the few Australian snakes which are actually aggressive, had remarkable eyesight and hearing, and would strike at my back-door glass whenever he glimpsed me inside the house.For a brief moment my fear returned and the back deck became off limits, until I reminded myself that snakes, like humans, all have different personalities. And that this was still a wild animal. From Shitty, I learned respect.There are snake catchers galore in south-east Queensland but many of us choose to live with our carpet pythons – even the grumpy ones. They are great for the environment as they eat bush rats, and keep noisier neighbours like possums from moving into roofs.Shitty has now moved on and I’m left with Slinky, a scrawny juvenile who is, at this stage, a hopeless hunter. This will change and eventually Slinky will leave my ceiling too. While I’m not sure who’s lurking to move in next, I’m learning more about these incredible, quiet creatures (you should see them climb) and I look forward to the day another sanguine serpent like my beloved Sylvia graces my back deck.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Reuters published a Guatemalan government report saying that most parents of the roughly 600 Guatemalan children in US custody could not be contacted and of those who could, many did not want their children forced back to the country.Kelly said the justice department’s explanation “crumbled like a house of cards” in light of that report.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the justice department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Kelly said some children were unexpectedly taken from their shelter beds in the middle of the night, driven to the airport and, in some cases, put on planes, leaving them worried and confused. At one shelter in McAllen, Texas, a young girl was so scared that she vomited, Kelly wrote, citing evidence submitted in the case.Immigrant children who arrive at US borders without a parent or guardian are classified as unaccompanied and sent to federal government-run shelters until they can be placed with a family member or foster home, a process outlined in federal law.Meanwhile, late on Wednesday, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt by the Trump administration to set asidea judge’s orderholding that it unlawfully rolled back temporary protections from deportation granted to 600,000 Venezuelans living in the US.A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals declined to pause a judge’s 5 September ruling holding that the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, lacked the authority to end the program, known as temporary protected status or TPS.“Vacating and terminatingVenezuela’s TPS status threw the future of these Venezuelan citizens into disarray, and exposed them to a substantial risk of wrongful removal, separation from their families, and loss of employment,” the panel said.The justice department has said that if a stay were denied, it might take the case to theUS supreme court, which in May put on hold an earlier injunction Chen issued and cleared the way for the administration to end temporary protections for about 348,000 of the Venezuelans at issue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The administration had contended the supreme court’s May decision meant Chen’s latest ruling had to be similarly paused.Thousands face deportation to danger as Trump targets temporary protectionsRead more“Luckily for us, and for all Americans, the Ninth Circuit is not the last stop,” McLaughlin said.TPS is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation. The program was created in 1991 and extended underJoe Bidento cover about 600,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians. Noemreversed the extensions, saying they were no longer justified, prompting legal challenges.Chen’s decision had also applied to 521,000 Haitians. The administration did not ask the ninth circuit to put that part of Chen’s ruling on hold as a second judge in New York had already blocked the revocation of the Haitians’ status.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationGuatemalaVenezuelaUS politicsChildrenAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We are going to implement electronic warfare actions,” he said on Wednesday, citing the “threatening, vulgar voice” of the US.Public television showed images of amphibious vessels and warships deployed off La Orchila, where Venezuela has a military base.The armed forces said the exercises would involve 12 ships, 22 aircraft and 20 small boats from the “special naval militia”.La Orchila island is close to the area where the US intercepted and held a Venezuelan fishing vessel for eight hours over the weekend.Maduro, whose last two elections were not recognised by the US and many other countries, has vowed that Caracas will defend itself against what he labelled US “aggression” against his country.Washington is offering a $50m bounty for the arrest of Maduro, who faces drug trafficking charges.Venezuela has urged an investigation of aUS strike on an alleged drug boatearly this month that killed 11 people.It was one of three Venezuelan vessels the US president,Donald Trump, said his country had “knocked off” without providing details.“One doesn’t know, because they say it carried drugs but who saw the drugs?”, the interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, said earlier on Wednesday as he claimed Venezuela was cracking down on narcotics.Cabello told reporters that officials had seized more than 60 tonnes of drugs so far this year.“It is the largest amount that has been seized since 2010,” said Cabello, who – like Maduro and other senior officials – is under US sanctions.Trump has justified taking military action by posting on social media that “violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to US National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital US Interests”.The US government has released videos of two of the boat strikes and claims it has irrefutable evidence the people killed were US-bound traffickers, without providing details to back up the claims.Caracas has consistently denied being a trafficking hub.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

If average living standards rise so does the poverty line,” Wilkins said.“But average living standards haven’t been rising in recent years, so we can’t really claim that as a defence on why we are not making progress.”Wilkins said that despite evidence of a long-term policy failure, the issue of climbing poverty among single parent households seemed to “have real trouble getting any traction in the public consciousness”.“It’s like this silent crisis in the community. It’s not some statistical anomaly, it’s translating to real suffering experienced by a lot of people.”“It’s a demographic group we should be concerned about.2:26What does it mean to be poor?

This means young people from these backgrounds are more likely to be miscategorised as over the age limit, or older people categorised as underaged when they’re not.People from these backgrounds also had to wait significantly longer for a result when using age-estimation software, which relies on face scanning to estimate age.The data also shows that age-verification software, which relies on scanning documents such as a driver’s licence or passport, was also unreliable for Indigenous people, though the number of people tested was below that required for statistical significance.Bias downplayedThe report summary downplays differences in accuracy, saying “systems performed broadly consistently across demographic groups, including Indigenous populations”, and “… despite an acknowledged deficit in training age analysis systems with data about Indigenous populations, we found no substantial difference in the outcomes for First Nations and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and other multi-cultural communities using the age assurance systems”.Later sections of the report are, however, more equivocal about differences in accuracy across demographic groups, saying there were “some known challenges in accuracy for underrepresented skin tones or facial features”.The $6.5m age assurance technology trial, run by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), tested various types of technology that could be used by social media platforms and adult websites to keep out under-16s or under-18s, respectively, whenAustralia’s under-16s social media ban comes into force in December.The three main technologies tested were age inference, age estimation and age verification. Age estimation and verification were tested by ACCS in real-world scenarios with school students around Australia, and “mystery shopper” testing. The ACCS also conducted automated testing using an image dataset.The ACCS published some of the data behind the report, and the report itself shows results that combine both the public and non-public data. The Guardian’s analysis is limited to the public data.The figures show the accuracy rate for Indigenous people was seven percentage points lower than for people categorised as having an “Oceania and Antarctica” background, which includes people who simply answered “Australian” in the trial:Graph showing age estimation software accuracy by demographic background of the test subjectThe accuracy rate for people who had a south-east Asian background was five percentage points lower.The report from the ACCS only looked at performance of age estimation software by skin tone using automated testing, and did not publish accuracy rates by demographic background, despite including the raw information in the public files.How will Australia’s under-16s social media ban be enforced, and which platforms will be exempt?Read moreThe trial’s analysis of skin tone showed that age estimation systems had a higher error rate on average for people with darker skin. However, because no group had 20% more errors than the average, the report concluded: “This indicates no significant evidence of adverse impact or systemic disparity in error rates across skin tone groups enabling us to state that they are broadly consistent across demographic groups.”Recent studies, includingone by the US governmentandone from one of the leading age estimation companies, have shown higher age estimation error rates for women and people with darker skin tones.The age assurance technology trial did not publish a detailed analysis of age estimation accuracy by gender. There are, however, two references in the report, with one section saying “fairness testing showed acceptable parity across age and gender”, and another saying “demographic performance disparities were still observed … [including] variability in model output by gender presentation”.The ACCS said such an analysis was not included in the report based on guidance from the independent ethics committee, saying: “The committee advised that publishing detailed gender-based analyses could risk misinterpretation and would not directly serve the trial’s primary evaluation objectives.”Questions raised about methodsWhen examining the report, the Guardian raised numerous questions about the trial methodology with the organisation that conducted the trial, Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS).The age verification tests conducted were on a smaller scale with the public data showing results for just 328 people. The report does not look at the accuracy for age verification software by skin tone or demographic background because the sample sizes would be far too small to be statistically valid.However, the data shows that six of the 328 people had an Indigenous background, and the age verification software failed for three of these people. While this number is too small for meaningful statistical analysis, it is still a 50% error rate for Indigenous people.The age assurance trial did not test age inference systems in the same way, but noted that age inference would be difficult in some situations as “some groups (e.g. new migrants, remote First Nations communities) may not have consistent participation in certain systems”.The report also identified that “[digital] gaps persist in remote and very remote communities where digital exclusion and lack of foundational credentials continue to limit access”.When the Guardian asked the ACCS why the report summary said “systems performed broadly consistently across demographic groups” when the public data for the age estimation tests shows the opposite, the ACCS said the basis of these claims is “an aggregation of multiple strands of evidence (school trial, mystery shoppers, lab observations, and vendor documentation)”.The Guardian raised questions about the overall accuracy of the age verification software tested. The age verification report says the accuracy of the software when tested by the 328 “mystery shopper” trial was 97% overall.However, the Guardian’s analysis of the public data puts the overall accuracy at 92%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe CrunchFree fortnightly newsletterOur data journalists showcase the most important charts and dataviz from the Guardian and around the web, free every fortnightEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe ACCS initially said in an email to the Guardian that the 97% figure in the report was based on the same 328 sample as in the public data, but when questioned again on the accuracy of the results the ACCS said in a subsequent email that the report instead included unpublished “repeated lab tests in addition to the mystery shopper trials”.When asked why some results have not been included in the public dataset, the ACCS said this was due to “lab tests” which were “recorded in KJR’s internal assurance system and remain outside the scope of the anonymised dataset release”. KJR is a consultancy contracted to conduct some of the age assurance testing.In the report’s analysis of how accurate age estimation providers were for distinguishing people above or below the age of 16, the report notes that two underperforming providers were excluded from the results “due to consistent poor performance at this age gate unfairly skewing the results”. ACCS did not say why these results were removed.Most adults will be fineDespite the issues raised with the report, the results show that most older people are unlikely to be inconvenienced by age assurance technology.Toby Walsh is a professor of AI at the University of New South Wales who provided independent advice on the report methodology, but was not otherwise involved in the trial or the presentation of the results.He says that adults will be the least affected by the new requirements, because the report recommends a “cascade” of technological solutions for determining someone’s age, from age inference, which is the least invasive technique, through to age verification, which requires uploading official documents.“One of the concerns people have is that all of us are now going to be inconvenienced by having to assure our age. But the results of the trial are that if you’re well away from the age threshold, you won’t be inconvenienced.”Walsh says this is because many adults will be able to rely on age inference for existing social media services, where, for example, a company like Meta already has a good idea of their age. And if that doesn’t work then age estimation via face scanning will work for the vast majority of adults, as these are quite accurate for older people.Kids unlikely to be able to rely on face-scanningThe report shows there is a lot of uncertainty in the age estimation tools. On average the difference between a person’s actual and predicted ages can be a couple of years. Age estimation is particularly hard for teenagers, experts say, as they can be in the “throes of puberty” and are “changing on a day-to-day basis”.“[The tools] might be good enough to distinguish between a 16-year-old and a 30-year-old, but they certainly are not good enough to distinguish between a 16-year-old and a 15, 14, or indeed 17-year-old,” says Prof Tama Leaver from Curtin University.The trial data shows false positive rates (where a person has falsely been predicted to exceed the age requirement) of between 25% and 73% for kids under 16. It is only when someone’s actual age is 18 or higher that the error rate generally falls below 5%.Graph showing the error (false positive and false negative) rates for each age groupDue to the difficulty estimating exact ages, the report notes that a “buffer” will probably need to be applied – requiring further verification for anyone predicted to be two to three years younger or older than 16.This means that more than1.3 millionAustralians aged 16 to 19 who are eligible for social media will likely be required to provide some other information that can prove their age if they want to create an account.Guardian Australia contacted the minister for communications, Anika Wells, with the results of the analysis. Wells referred Guardian Australia’s questions to the eSafety Commissioner. A spokesperson for the commission said: “The Department’s independent trial run by the Age Check Certification Scheme conducted some important testing producing independent evaluation results for a range of technologies.“Improvement of all age assurance tools, including classifiers and facial age estimation require consistent training and retraining to ensure improvement and accuracy.“This is important when it comes to homing in on the 13-15 age range and when it comes to better identifying the broad range of ethnicities reflected in Australia.”Thanks to Prof Falk Scholer at RMIT for providing feedback on our analysis.

But it also shows high vulnerability in colder climates like Hobart, Launceston and Albury.You can explore heat vulnerability across Australia in the map below:Map showing the most heat-vulnerable suburbs of Australia“When we generally think about climate change, and we think about heat, we think about land surface temperature. But [there are] other factors that mean you may be more or less sensitive to heat,” Dr Melanie Davern, the director of the Australian Urban Observatory, said.Davern noted factors such as the actual built environment and access to services, but also things like age, pre-existing conditions and income. Some of these may also be correlated and compound one another – many older Australians also have other pre-existing conditions, for instance.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter“We know that you sweat less as you get older, so it’s harder to cool. We know up to the ages of 4, you also find it harder to thermoregulate,” Davern said.“One in 6 Australianshas cardiovascular disease. We know that with cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, mental illness, neurological conditions, those people are also going to be more susceptible to heat. So you’ve got multiple layers of complexity that contribute to heat vulnerability.”A separate study recently published by researchers at Monash University foundheatwaves caused 1,009 deaths in Australiabetween 2016 and 2019. The study found that communities with greater shares of elderly residents, those needing assistance and lower income or education experienced higher mortality.Unpacking the heat index we can see how widespread these vulnerabilities are, and that they cut across our cities. The next map shows “heat sensitivity”, which includes data on the built environment, vegetation, vulnerable groups (the very young, elderly and those who need care) and population density.Map showing heat vulnerability for communities and individualsIt also shows “adaptive capability”, which are socioeconomic factors like income and education. The RMIT Associate Prof Qian (Chayn) Sun developed the indexes and said heat sensitivity was more of a measure of the community’s susceptibility to heat, while adaptive capability showed the individual’s and group’s ability to mitigate heat, such as being able to afford to run an air conditioner.While vulnerability is correlated with socioeconomic factors, the maps show clear exceptions – Carlton and Fitzroy in Melbourne and Woolloomooloo and Rushcutters Bay in Sydney are all 5/5 on the Heat Vulnerability Index. All do poorly on heat sensitivity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is not a simple story that only applies to one group. It actually applies across the country,” Davern said.“When you look at the maps, you do see less heat vulnerability in particular areas of greater socioeconomic advantage. But it doesn’t exclude them because there are areas where you might have a very high proportion of older people, and they may be wealthy, but they’re still going to be vulnerable because of the environment and pre-existing conditions.”The final map shows the heat data captured by satellites across the same suburbs as the maps above. Many of the places that are particularly vulnerable to heat stand out here – Sun said that Brimbank in Melbourne’s west was the most vulnerable area in the index and had a “very clear urban heat island [effect]”. But you can see similar patterns across most cities in the data.Map showing heat exposure across suburbsBoth Davern and Sun said the data showed the need to improve planning processes to take into account the interplay of all these factors.“Planning is the major challenge. We don’t think about the connectivity across different aspects. Governments are divided into portfolios, but we [need] an integrated approach to thinking about planning a livable place.”Explore more on these topicsExtreme heatClimate crisisHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re all Picassos. Not one is Dora Maar.”The couple met at the end of 1935 when she was taking photographs to promote Jean Renoir’s film The Crime of Monsieur Lange. At the time, Picasso was in a relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter, with whom he had a daughter Maya, that continued during his years with Maar.He frequently represented Maar, whose masochistic tendencies fascinated him, as a tortured figure often in tears as in La Femme qui pleure (Weeping Woman), which experts say he intended to represent the suffering of the Spanish civil war but was also indicative of his allegedabuse of Maarand the couple’s many physical fights.In the rediscovered work, Maar’s face, fragmented but painted in bright colour without perspective, appears anguished and on the point of weeping. At the time Maar had learned that Picasso, then 61, intended to leave her for the artist Françoise Gilot, 21.The portrait was completed in July 1943 and was only displayed a handful of times outside hisParisatelier in the Rue des Grands Augustins. It has been in a private collection since it was bought in August 1944 – the month of the liberation of Paris.Its existence was known from a black and white photograph taken shortly before it was sold that featured in an art catalogue. The seller, who inherited the painting from a grandparent, an unnamed French collector, has asked to remain anonymous.The Nazis occupying Paris during the second world war considered Picasso’s work “degenerate”, which led to raids on his atelier and threats of a ban on exhibiting his paintings.Maar, who died in Paris in 1997 aged 89, is credited with being Picasso’s muse as well as his subject and lover,but she was a surrealist photographer in her own rightand her style had a major influence on his work during their relationship.The auction house Lucien Paris, which has conservatively estimated the oil painting measuring 80cm x 60cm at about €8m (£6.9m) but expects it to fetch far more, had kept the painting’s existence a secret before unveiling it to the press on Thursday.Auctioneer Christophe Lucien said it was a significant discovery and described the work as a masterpiece and a rare example of how Picasso’s output was a much needed light during the dark days of the occupation. He said experts knew it existed from the photographs but it was the first time the true colours of the work could be seen.“It is not only a milestone in the history of art but also in the private life of Picasso,” Lucien said.“It is a refreshing portrait of Dora Maar; exceptional and full of emotion. Discovering it is a big moment in our lives as experts.”The painting will be sold at auction by Lucien Paris on 24 October and will be on display for three days before the sale.Explore more on these topicsPablo PicassoParisFranceEuropePaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

He attended Emmanuel Macron’s presidential inaugurations in 2017 and 2022.Brigitte Macron, 72, is 24 years older than her husband, whom she met at a theatre workshop that she was running at his high school. She has three children from her previous marriage, born in 1975, 1977 and 1984, and seven grandchildren.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you.“I will continue to challenge any last-minute, vexatious attempts to frustrate a removal in the courts. The UK will always play its part in helping those genuinely fleeing persecution, but this must be done through safe, legal and managed routes, not dangerous crossings.”The UK-France treaty, which came into force on 6 August, allows the UK to detain and rapidly remove people who enter via small boats. In return, the UK will accept an equal number of people through a newly established safe and legal route, subject to security checks.The Home Office said: “Today we will lodge an appeal to the court of appeal to limit the time the person has to provide evidence for reconsideration.”It follows three days of cancellations of tickets of asylum seekers due to fly, in many cases due to legal challenges.On Tuesday, a high court challenge halted the imminent removal of a 25-year-old Eritrean man to France. He was granted more time to gather evidence relating to his claim that he is a victim of trafficking.In another high court hearing on Thursday evening, a second Eritrean man lost his attempt to halt his removal on a 6.15am flight to France on Friday morning.The judge, Mr Justice Sheldon, said that the man would have an opportunity to put forward his trafficking case in France.“It seems there are significant public interest in favour of the claimant’s removal, the balance of convenience clearly favours removal,” the judge said.At least one removal to France was halted on Thursday after an asylum seeker had been taken to Heathrow airport in preparation for a 3pm flight.He told the Home Office he was 17 but officials insisted he was over 18 and could be safely removed to France. Under the terms of the treaty between UK and France to prevent dangerous small boat crossings, lone children cannot be removed.At the 11th hour his flight was halted after he received a decision from trafficking authorities suggesting there was evidence to suggest he was a potential victim.Maddie Harris, of the organisation Humans for Rights Network, is supporting some of an estimated 12 age-disputed people who were detained for the “one in, one out” scheme. Many have now been released.“All the children we have spoken to are acutely distressed. They have not received good information as to why they were detained and were very concerned to find out they were being considered for removal for France. They are absolutely terrified,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is reported that he had threatened a legal challenge to his removal but this did not halt the removal.While countries such as Eritrea, Sudan and Syria, where many people arriving on small boats come from, have high asylum grant rates, asylum claims by Indians have a much lower grant rate.chartThe man is the first to be sent back out of about 100 Channel migrants detained by Border Force at the start of last month.It is understood, according to the Telegraph, that the French requested an Indian migrant as it means they will offer him voluntary return to his homeland, where the government pays the air fare and offers €2,500. If the man does not accept voluntary return, he will face forced removal from France.According to a leaflet given to detainees for France by the Home Office, accommodation in France will be offered “for the first days of your arrival.

He said he did not disagree with his host about much, save Starmer’s planto recognise a Palestinian state. And he teetered on the edge of being diplomatic, at least until he advised Starmerto use the militaryto stop small boats crossing the Channel.But the hour the two men spent away from the cameras will be the true test of whether Starmer was able to use this second state visit, withall its pomp, to change any of the US president’s thinking.Starmer – whose technique in public is to alight on whatever small patch of common ground he can find with Trump – will have used that precious private time to try to persuade him to think again about the trustworthiness ofVladimir Putinand the judgment of Benjamin Netanyahu.2:25'Putin has let me down': key takeaways from Trump and Starmer's press conference – videoOnGaza, judging by the press conference, Starmer failed. Trump nodded when he was told by an ITV reporter that he was “the only man on the planet capable of stopping the demolition of Gaza City, to stop the starvation of Palestine and stop the killing of civilians”.Trump replied that he could not forget 7 October, and said his demand was forHamasto hand over all the hostages in one go.Starmer and Trump are not that far apart, however, since the entire Arab world now backs plans for a government for Gaza in which Hamas plays no role. That will be underscored again at a UN conference next week.Trump is also privately supportive of the joint plan from Jared Kushnerand Tony BlairforGaza’s reconstruction, in which Palestinians would not be displaced from the territory. Displacement, with its echoes of the Nakba of 1948, would make it a non-starter with Gulf states, and in any case would run counter to the ideas generated by Egypt, France and the UK.Starmer’s difficulty lies in persuading Trump to weigh in behind specific plans in public, and convincing him that Gulf states will start to make their own plans for future security if he appears to subcontract his Middle East policy to Netanyahu.OnUkrainethere may have been something closer to a meeting of minds. Trump, sounding hurt, said he felt really let down by Putin, and acknowledged that the war had been more difficult to solve than he forecast.Starmer held back from saying Trump’s optimism had been misplaced. But he said Putin’s latest targets showed a new “recklessness” that demanded a stronger response.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So he and Europe now have little choice but to move faster on closing down the flow of oil to Europe. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has already promised to speed up its plan to stop buying Russian oil and gas, moving the deadline earlier than 2028.Starmer has something to work with in that Trump agreed that the lower the price of oil, the quicker Putin would settle.After the past two days, King Charles and Starmer can only hope Trump is closer to being convinced that if he stops talking about sanctions, and instead implements them, he can persuade Putin that his options are finally closed.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpForeign policyUS foreign policyKeir StarmerGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza waranalysisShareReuse this content"

The estimate was based on multiple sources, including drone surveillance, an official told the Guardian.Israeli forces now control Gaza City’s eastern suburbs and in recent days have moved into theSheikh Radwanand Tel al-Hawa areas, from where they would be positioned to advance on the central and western districts where most of the remaining population is sheltering.Swathes of Gaza City, once a busy commercial and cultural hub, have been reduced to uninhabitable ruins. Until weeks ago, more than a million people were living there, many already displaced numerous times.On Wednesday Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister,described Gazaas a “real-estate bonanza”, according to local Hebrew media reports. Speaking to a property development conference in Tel Aviv, Smotrich said “the demolition, the first stage in [Gaza City’s] renewal, we have already done. Now we just need to build.”satellite mapThe same day, the Israeli military announced the opening of a second route out of Gaza City – through the middle of the Gaza Strip – for two days to try to encourage the exodus. Its Arabic-language spokesperson, Col Avichay Adraee, said the corridor would remain open for just 48 hours.Shadi Jawad, 47, who fled Gaza City via the route, said: “The situation is indescribable – crowds everywhere, the sound of explosions, women and men crying and screaming as they walked while carrying their belongings.”The Israeli military has been dropping leaflets urging people to flee towards a designated “humanitarian zone” in the south of the territory, but aid agencies say conditions there are dire, with insufficient food, medicine and space, and inadequate shelter.‘We pray a visa comes before death’: Gaza’s injured children left in limboRead moreRosalia Bollen of Unicef said: “The area in southern Gaza that people are ordered to go to is a largely overcrowded stretch of dunes. It is inappropriate, unprepared and unsafe to host displaced families with immense humanitarian needs there. And for the hundreds of thousands of people still left in Gaza City – half of them children – we are deeply worried, as airstrikes have been pounding Gaza City.”Much of northern Gaza is gripped by famine, according to internationally respected experts.Hamas’s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned the Israeli military to expect fierce fighting.“We are ready to send the lives of your soldiers to hell, and we have prepared for you an army of martyrs,” the group said in a statement.Late on Thursday the Israeli military said four of its soldiers had been killed by a roadside bomb in Rafah in southern Gaza. Elsewhere, debris from the interception of an explosive drone fired from Yemen struck the port city of Eilat, in the far south of Israel, and an attacker killed two men at the main border crossing between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jordan.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, rejected the advice of Israel’s most senior generals and intelligence officials not to launch the new offensive. Many Israeli observers and commentators accuse Netanyahu, who is facing corruption charges and iswanted for war crimes by the international criminal court, of seeking to fend off early elections, which could force his hard-right coalition from power, by prolonging the war.Earlier this week, a UN commission of inquiryaccused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip, saying Netanyahu and other senior officials had incited the crime. Israel rejected the findings as “distorted and false”.At least 79 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across Gaza in the past 24 hours, mostly in Gaza City, the territory’s health ministry said on Thursday.The war was triggered by an attack by Hamas into Israel in October 2023 in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Of the 251 people taken hostage, 47 remain in Gaza, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,000 people, also mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelUnited NationsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But it was still full of news, telling details, and startling information and opinions.Here are some of the most important, and some you might have missed.Trump turns fire on Putin and lauds UK in press conference with StarmerRead more1.Trump blames Putin for the war in Ukraine – todayThe US presidentswitches betweenblaming Russia and Ukraine for the war between the two countries, but 90 minutes with Starmer appeared to have focused the president’s attention on the role of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.“I spoke to President Putin about Ukraine, it was the apple of his eye,” Trump said. “He would have never done what he did, except that he didn’t respect the leadership of the United States.”The president does not appear to want to increase sanctions on Russia however, seeking instead to criticise other countries for buying Russian oil.2.Starmer is worried about provoking Trump on GazaDowning Street’s worries that the UK’simpending recognitionof Palestinian statehood would cause a divide between the two leaders proved unfounded. Trump admitted the two leaders disagreed over the issue, but added it was “one of our few disagreements”.In his efforts to placate the president however, Starmer entirely avoided talking about the bloodshed and starvation that Israel is causing in Gaza.“Hamas … don’t want two-state solution,” the prime minister said. “They don’t want peace, they don’t want the ceasefire.” His comments earned a pat on the back from Trump.3.Starmer will defend the Online Safety ActAllies of Trumphave criticisedEuropean online safety rules, saying they unfairly target American technology companies. Starmer however believes he has found an argument that will resonate with the president.“Free speech is one of the founding values of the United Kingdom … [but] I draw a limit between free speech and the speech of those that want to peddle paedophilia and suicide social media to children,” he said.4.Trump has noticed Starmer’s defence spending commitmentsDays before Starmer travelled to Washington DC earlier this year, the prime ministerannounced a huge cutin international aid to pay for an increase in defence spending.The decision prompted outrage from international aid agencies andthe resignationof one of his cabinet ministers. But it does appear to have bought him some favour in the White House.“I want to congratulate the United Kingdom on making the vital commitment to spend 5% of GDP on defence at the Nato summit this year,” Trump said.5.There has been no progress on tariffs“He’s a tough negotiator,” Trump said about Starmer when talking about the trade deal, before turning to the prime minister to add: “I think it was a better deal for you than us, but these are minor details.”But there was no mention on Thursday of reducing tariffs on British steel exports, something which the deal promised but now appears tohave been abandoned. Trump’s commitment to tariffs in general remains strong.“The United States, as you probably have heard, is doing better than it has ever done in terms of business and investment,” he said. “A lot of it’s because of tariffs.”6.The US is trying to retake control of BagramBagram was the US’s largest military base in Afghanistan until it left the country in 2021. Now Trump appears to want it back thanks to its proximity to China, though his comments suggest he is trying to negotiate over its control rather than contemplating a reinvasion.“We’re going to keep Bagram – one of the biggest airbases in the world,” the president said. “We’re trying to get it back, by the way. OK, that could be a little breaking news. We’re trying to get it back, because they need things from us.“One of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”7.Keir Starmer was christenedThe prime minister is an atheist who observes some Jewish traditions because of his wife.But asked by GB News whether Britain was still a Christian country, he said on Thursday: “I was christened. So that is my church – has been all my life.”8.Donald Trump appears to have forgotten who Peter Mandelson isIn May Peter Mandelson stood over Trump’s left shoulder as the president signed the UK-US trade agreement. He leftwith a souvenirfrom the president himself. “Peter,” it read. “Great job!”Some British officials were worried therefore thatStarmer’s decision to sack Mandelsonover his friendship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein could cause a rift with the president, not least because Trump had his own well-publicised friendship with Epstein.Asked about Mandelson on Thursday however, the president suffered an apparent attack of amnesia. “I don’t know him,” Trump replied, before handing over to the prime minister.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsKeir StarmerTrump tariffsTrump administrationUkraineRussiakey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

How can western governments still refuse to act? | Steve CrawshawRead moreRecognition will bring a wave of criticism from Israel, including claims that it is a reward for Hamas and terrorism, a charge the UK rejects by saying it envisages only a Palestinian state in which Hamas is disarmed, plays no part in the future government, and the leadership of the Palestinian Authority is subject to elections within a year.Starmer emphasised there would be no place for Hamas, insisting the group were terrorists, and adding he agreed with Trump on the need for a roadmap.The UK prime minister said recognition was “part of that overall package which hopefully takes us from the appalling situation we’re in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state”.Graph showing international recognition of the Palestinian stateThe US, now in effect opposed to a two-state solution as unobtainable and undesirable, has rejected the UK move as unhelpful, but Trump has decided not to make the matter a point of division with Starmer given Washington sees it as a largely symbolic act that will not weaken Israel. The president has his own private frustrations with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to agree a ceasefire, as well as hisbombing of Qatarlast week.The UK Foreign Office had long parried calls for recognition, saying the step should only be taken when it had maximum impact on the peace process. Following intense consultations with French diplomats, the UK shifted to backing recognition four days after Emmanuel Macron made his announcement on 25 July.The delay gave Starmer time to talk privately to Trump on his visit to Scotland, and to set conditions that if fulfilled would delay UK recognition of Palestine. These included a resumption of humanitarian aid, a ceasefire, Israeli engagement in a sustained peace process, and no further Israeli land annexations in theWest Bank. Israel was never likely to meet these preconditions, making UK recognition largely an issue of timing rather than content.Britain’s choice has been whether to wait for a UN conference on Monday on a two-state solution or go earlier. Prompting the decision is anger at Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and a sense that if Britain does not act now Israel will, through annexation, have destroyed the last hope of Palestinian self-determination.The head of the Palestinian mission in the UK, Husam Zomlot, is due to unveil the Palestinian flag on Monday at what will become the Palestinian embassy.The act of recognition would make UK relations with Palestine as those between two states, but government legal advice is that that would not place any additional legal obligations on the UK to punish Israel for what Britain already regards as the unlawful occupation of Palestine.Critics in the UK claim recognition breaches the Montevideo effectiveness criteria that a state should only be recognised if it has clearly defined borders, a stable population and a single functioning government.The difficulty for ministers is that as claims that Israel is committing genocide start to become more frequent inside the Labour party, the demand to take further action will intensify, including cutting off trade links with Israel.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesForeign policyGazaWest BankMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Gulf monarchies – allies of Washington – have sought to stabilise ties with both Iran andIsraelto resolve longstanding security concerns.But theGaza warhas upended the region and Gulf state Qatar has been subjected to direct hits twice in a year, once by Iran and once by Israel.The senior Saudi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the need to balance relations with Pakistan’s rival, India, also a nuclear power.“Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can.”Asked whether Pakistan would be obliged to provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella under the pact, the official said: “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.”Pakistani state television showed prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, embracing after signing the agreement. In attendance was Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, regarded as the country’s most powerful person.A statement from the Pakistani prime minister’s office said: “This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieving security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.“The agreement states that any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both.”Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaPakistanIsraelHamasGazaMiddle East and north AfricaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

This is despite the regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC), recommending they be struck off the medical register.The GMC investigates complaints against doctors and refers the most serious cases to the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) to adjudicate on whether they remain fit to practice.Doctor who left patient during operation to have sex with nurse allowed to practiseRead moreThe study analysed 222 new MPTS tribunal cases between August 2023 and August 2024 and found that out of the 46 proven cases of sexual misconduct identified, the MPTS imposed the same disciplinary sanction as the GMC recommended in 35. In 11 cases, the MPTS decided to only suspend the doctor rather than erase them from the medical register, and in no case did the MPTS impose a tougher sanction.Mei Nortley, a consultant vascular surgeon and lead author of the research, said: “We hope this study aids the MPTS to reflect on whether it delivers its aims of protecting the public, ensuring doctors meet professional standards and promoting public confidence in the medical profession. Allowing rapists, sexual predators and those who use manipulation and coercion to return as practising doctors brings this into question.”The research, published in the Bulletin of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, found that all perpetrators were male doctors, with more than 80% holding positions of authority. Several cases involved multiple targets, showing repeated and systemic abuse.In arelated paperin the British Medical Journal, the authors cited several recent high-profile cases that had “fuelled concerns about the consistency and adequacy” of sanctions. This included an MPTS tribunal earlier this year that found an acute medical consultant guilty of rape but handed him a 12-month suspension rather than striking him off, because it was deemed to be a “one-off event”.Another doctor was found to have “pursued and groomed” a vulnerable patient from the age of 14 but was only suspended from the register for 12 months, with the tribunal panel citing evidence of “insight, remediation and remorse” as the reason he was not struck off.The RCS said the findings of both papers showed that the system of medical regulation was “failing targets of misconduct”. Its vice-president Prof Vivien Lees said the research highlighted “deeply concerning inconsistencies”, which risked “leaving perpetrators in power and eroding trust in the profession”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said: “In cases of sexual misconduct, we will often ask for the doctor to be struck off the medical register. Where we feel the sanctions applied by the independent tribunal are too lenient, we can and do appeal. A significant proportion of our appeals are successful and result in stronger sanctions.”A spokesperson for the MPTS said: “We recognise the impact of our work and tribunal decisions on the lives of all those involved in our hearings. It is important that doctors have a fair hearing that thoroughly assesses all the evidence presented by both the GMC and the doctor and that the tribunal comes to an impartial decision.”The spokesperson said the MPTS was due to publish new guidance for tribunals on 30 September.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Sexual abuse or harassment in any healthcare setting is completely unacceptable, and this report is extremely concerning. We expect employers and regulators to properly investigate and take action against perpetrators of sexual misconduct.“This government is determined to create a culture where staff feel safe and supported. We have already taken decisive action and introduced the healthcare system’s first organisational sexual safety charter along with strengthened guidance for medical professions on reporting misconduct. We are also ensuring whistleblowers are free to speak up, knowing that they will be supported and their concerns listened to and acted upon.”Explore more on these topicsDoctorsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Starmer insisted the timing had nothing to do with Trump’s visit.Trump’s visit, which was officially hosted by King Charles, came at the end of a turbulent few weeks for Starmer in which helost his deputy, Angela Rayner, and wasattacked for his handling of the Peter Mandelson row, with his position as leader coming under question by his own MPs.However, Downing Street sources said that his efforts in building a close relationship with Trump, despite criticism at home for doing so, had reaped rewards, with the pageantry of the state visit apparentlyhelping to secure £150bn of promised investment in the UKby US companies.At a closely managed press conference at Chequers, his official country residence, that prevented Trump taking many questions from journalists, Starmer avoided major potential bear traps, including coming under pressure over Mandelson’s links with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The president dismissed a question about the former US ambassador. “I don’t know him,” he said, even thoughthe pair have met previously, including for talks on whisky tariffs in the Oval Office this month. Trump has previously praised Mandelson’s “beautiful accent”.Trump ended the state visit by warning that illegal migration could destroy the UK, telling Starmer that he should follow the US in taking tough action to stop migrants unlawfully crossing its southern border.“I think your situation is very similar. You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn’t matter if you call out the military, it doesn’t matter what means you use,” Trump said.“It destroys countries from within and we’re actually now removing a lot of the people that came into our country.”Thefirst deportation of a Channel migrantto France took place on Thursday under Starmer’s “one in, one out” deal, with further flights due to take place in coming days.With public concern rising over the UK’s borders, and Nigel Farage’s Reform exploiting tensions over the issue, Downing Street believes it has to stop the highly visible crossings. The UK will accept an equal number of people through a newly established safe and legal route.Some Labour MPs have already suggested the government should send the Royal Navy into the Channel to prevent small boat crossings, an approach tried and failed under Boris Johnson in 2022 and 2023.Starmer has also come under pressure from his own party over the situation in Gaza, and the UK is preparing to recognise the state of Palestine even though the US opposes the move.While Starmer spoke of the “humanitarian catastrophe” unfolding in the devastated territory at Chequers, neither man condemned Israel’s actions in the strip, which has seen IDF troops pressing ahead with a ground offensive into Gaza City, forcing more people to flee their homes.Trump, asked when he would put more pressure on Israel to halt its military offensive, focused almost exclusively on the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas. He patted the prime minister on the back when he said the group would play no part in any future government.The US, now in effect opposed to a two-state solution as unobtainable and undesirable, has rejected the UK move as unhelpful, but Trump has decided not to make the matter a point of division with Starmer on the basis that Washington sees it as a largely symbolic act.In a significant change of tone on the Ukraine conflict, Trump said thatVladimir Putin had “really let me down”, to the delight of British officials who had hoped to use the unprecedented second state visit to isolate the Russian president on the world stage.“He’s killing many people, and he’s losing more people than he’s killing. The Russian soldiers are being killed at a higher rate than the Ukrainian soldiers,” Trump said.Just a month after the US president held talks in Alaska with Putin, he admitted he had thought it would be easier to negotiate a truce between the two countries. He did not say how he would put pressure on the Kremlin to end the war but urged Nato countries to stop buying Russian oil.In the biggest surprise of the press conference, Trump revealed the US isseeking to retake control of Bagram airbase from the Talibanafter it was surrendered during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.The US views it as an important strategic foothold in the region, which could help counter the threat of growing Chinese military might. “One of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,” he said.In another point of difference, Trump praised North Sea oil as a “phenomenal asset” and urged the UK to use more of it, while he dismissed wind power as a “very expensive joke”. Starmer, meanwhile, defended the importance of an energy mix, including renewables.After Trump was shown around Chequers, he was overheard telling his hosts that he had seen every memorial on this trip and that while they were beautiful, he had had enough. The US president said he had told the king that he was welcome to the US for dinner, but that he would not expect to show him around the Lincoln memorial.Later, on his flight back to the US onboard Air Force One, Trump claimed that Sadiq Khan had wanted to attend the state visit’s events but he had blocked it.“I asked that he not be there,” Trump told reporters. “I didn’t want him there, I asked that he not be there.“I think the mayor of London, Khan, is among the worst mayors in the world, and we have some bad ones.”Khan is understood to have made it clear weeks ago that he did not seek or expect an invitation to events held for the contentious state visit.At an event earlier on Thursday evening, Starmer said the UK-US technology pact agreed to mark Trump’s visit “put tech up there as a special feature of the special relationship”.“It’s a special day,” he said, as he joined Jensen Huang, chief executive of the $4tn chip manufacturer Nvidia at a tech industry event in London. “AI and tech are going to be absolutely transformative,” Starmer said, as Huang announced a £2bn in investment in UK tech companies.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerUkraineIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

He confirmed the party had referred the matter to the ICO and urged supporters to ignore an earlier email requesting funds and cancel any payments.Responding to claims from Sultana that she had been frozen out by a “sexist boys’ club” inside the party, Corbyn said late on Thursday that she had not been “excluded from any discussions” and remained part of a process “rooted in inclusivity and mutual respect”.Sultana rejected those claims, saying she acted because she was sidelined and frozen out of official accounts. She said her only aim was to “safeguard grassroots involvement”, as she accused Corbyn’s allies of trying to concentrate power over members’ money and the party’s conference.Allies of Sultana went further, suggesting a “paranoid anti-democratic faction” inside the project worked to exclude her from decision-making and was more concerned about preserving its own status than building the movement.They claimed this group had been developing a rival membership system that would divert money to its own company, giving it “complete control” over the party.Sultana’s allies claim there had been an internal agreement that one faction would hold mailing list data, while a different more pro-democratic group controlled donor information, in an attempt to split power.They allege she had exhausted every avenue to resolve the dispute privately before being “stonewalled”.The split emerged on Thursday when Sultana revealed a new membership portal on X, urging supporters to “be a part of history”.Within half an hour she celebrated “10,000 paid-up members” in a separate post and reassured her followers that the membership site was “safe and secure”, encouraging them to keep trying to sign up despite “issues due to such high traffic”.By early afternoon, Sultana said numbers had hit 20,000, dismissing suggestions from those she classed as “rightwing bad faith actors” who were claiming “this link is fake”.Sultana had posted about the new portal three times before Corbyn issued an “urgent message” telling his followers on X to ignore the site and indicated “legal advice is being taken”.“This morning, an unauthorised email was sent to allyourparty.uksupporters with details of a supposed membership portal hosted in a new domain name,” Corbyn said.“Legal advice is being taken. That email should be ignored by all supporters. If direct debits have been set up, they should immediately be cancelled.”Apparent Your party implosion leaves big political vacancy on the leftRead moreThe clash is the most dramatic in a series of tensions that have plagued the project since its staggered launch in July.Sultana, 31, who had been suspended fromLaboursince a rebellion over the two-child benefit cap, announced unilaterally she was co-leader of a new party along with Corbyn, 76.But some within the group felt the move was premature and potentially counterproductive, while others disagreed – saying the alliance would have never been launched if Corbyn was allowed to remain indecisive.Several hours later, the former Labour leader confirmed he was in discussions about creating the new party but avoided confirming any formal structure or leadership arrangement, giving his preference for collective decision-making.By late July the pair had formallyagreed to launch a partytogether, with a pledge to hold mass gatherings and a founding conference in the autumn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Insiders disagreed over whether the party should operate as a member-driven organisation – with a space for grassroots debate and policy setting – or take on a tighter model built around a small group of MPs and organisers.There have also been divisions over control of membership data and finances. It was those that burst into the open on Thursday, with Corbyn’s statement co-signed by all of the Independent Alliance MPs bar Sultana: Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed and Shockat Adam.Despite the chaos of its launch, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve | Andy BeckettRead moreThat joint statement from all of the other MPs in the alliance prompted Sultana to claim she had been sidelined and excluded from key decisions.“Neither of this week’s emails had the dual authorisation of both myself and Jeremy – which was the agreement made at the start of this process,” she said in a statement posted on X on Thursday.“After being sidelined by the MPs in today’s statement and effectively frozen out of the official accounts, I took the step of launching a membership portal so that the supporters could continue to engage and organise.”She added: “My sole motivation has been to safeguard the grassroots involvement that is essential to building this party. Unfortunately, I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys’ club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely.“They have refused to allow any other women with voting rights on the working group, blocking the gender-balanced committee that both Jeremy and I signed up to.”Sultana also warned about power being concentrated in too few hands, intimating she was uncomfortable with the control being exerted by former Corbyn staffers from when he was leader of the opposition.“I do not believe members will accept Karie Murphy [Corbyn’s former chief of staff] and her associates having sole financial control of members’ money and sole constitutional control of our conference. This undermines the democratic principles we agreed to uphold.”She called on Corbyn to meet her and “make public all agreed structures, processes and decision-making protocols”, adding: “This party is more important than any one person, and we all owe it to the movement to deliver a truly democratic and socialist party. No stitch-ups, no coronations: the members must decide.”Insiders have told the Guardian that allies of Corbyn have been asserting increasing control of the working group over financial and constitutional decisions, leaving Sultana pushing for a member-led structure. But others said Sultana had been on “wrecking manoeuvres” and “sought after nothing but power”.An ally of the project said the row risked sending a “terrible signal to supporters still deciding if this project is serious”. It remains unclear whether the project will survive in the same form until its own founding conference in the autumn.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaLabourInformation commissionernewsShareReuse this content"

A 34% rise in consultation fees is not just a statistic. It shows how private talking therapies are moving further out of reach for many people who need them.”While many people are seeking help from a psychologist in private practice, the survey of 349 practitioners found that doing so can involve high prices, long waits and online-only care. The findings include:The average cost of a consultation in the UK has risen from £96 in 2022 to £129.20 in 2025.Psychologists in England charge the most (£131) per session and those in Scotland the least (£124).Those in Scotland have the shortest waiting times (16.9 days), and people in Wales the longest (23.8 days).Leicester-based psychologists charge an average of £164 for a session, with London second on £160. Colchester, Bath and Coventry charge £85, £99 and £100 respectively.Steele advised people seeking help to shop around and be prepared to accept online support provided far from their home in order to beat delays and pay less.The British Psychological Society, which represents 19,000 of the UK’s 27,774 psychologists, said they had increased their charges to help cover rises in the cost of living.A spokesperson said: “With the continuing postcode lottery for accessing NHS mental health support, increasing numbers are seeking out private treatment. This is causing private providers to reach capacity and [be] unable to take on new clients. Demand is outstripping supply on all fronts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rising cost of private psychology is “troubling”, and the trend towards private care could lead to a “two-tier system”, it said.Jeremy Bernhaut, the charity’s head of policy and influencing, said: “There are an estimated 1.8 million people waiting for [NHS] mental health care [in England] and the consequences are severe: suicide attempts, lost jobs and hospitalisation, which puts strain on the wider NHS.”The number of people on the waiting list for support from NHS community-based mental health and learning disability services in England has risenfrom 1.56 million last year to 1.79 miillion.NHS England said more than a million people a year received help from its talking therapies services.

This case has made me feel very threatened and makes me feel like I am having to look over my shoulder all the time.”Friel said she felt she and her teenage daughter were in danger. “I don’t want to feel like a victim in my own home and a neighbourhood I’ve lived in for years. I am very disappointed he was given a warning the first time around and it didn’t stop him.“He has created turmoil, anxiety, the fear of the unknown. I try to keep my personal life private and he has invaded that.”She said the case had been “incredibly time consuming at a time when I want to put my full focus in work”.Jai Patel, prosecuting, said Friel was first approached by Appleton in 2022 when she was on a walk with her daughter in Windsor, Berkshire. He claimed to have worked on television sets with her and Friel, mistakenly thinking she knew him, gave him her email.Friel began to receive regular emails from Appleton. “He said he loved Ms Friel and he missed her, he invited her to breakfast, lunch and dinner at his home,” Patel said. “He told friends he was going to marry Ms Friel.”In December 2022, Appleton attempted to join a health club Friel attended and the following month referred to her as “the perfect wife”. He said he was in bed naked thinking of her and sent a selfie showing his bare torso.She reported Appleton to the police. He was arrested and warned that his behaviour was unwanted. The court heard that Friel did not make a statement or seek a prosecution, thinking a warning would be sufficient.In December 2023, Appleton turned up at Friel’s home wearing a dinner jacket and said he was taking her to a ball. Friel’s daughter asked Appleton to leave, which he did, but came back a year later in December 2024. He looked up at Friel’s security cameras, mouthed: “I love you” and held up a ring.He returned the next morning and Friel called the police. Before they could get to him, he went back to Friel’s house for the third time in 48 hours. The actor heard knocking at her front door and opened it. She screamed, shut the door and called the police. He was arrested that evening.In August, Appleton, who now lives in Essex, admitted stalking. James Bloomer KC, for Appleton, said his client’s behaviour was troubling and he felt sorry and ashamed.As well as imposing restrictions on his movements, the judge sentenced Appleton to a 24-month community order, which included completing 10 “rehabilitation activity requirement” days.Survivors of stalking, campaigners for women’s safety and heads of law enforcement have raised concerns over continuing failings by police inEnglandand Wales to tackle perpetrators and protect victims.Theywarnthat while some forces are doing innovative work on stalking, others are not improving quickly enough, leading to a “patchwork” service and victims facing a “postcode lottery”.Friel, 49, rose to fame as Beth Jordache in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside. She has beenpraised for her performancein the dramaUnforgivable, which was released on the BBC in the summer.Explore more on these topicsSexual harassmentEnglandCrimeTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

In addition to the three officers killed, two were injured while trying to execute a warrant related to domestic violence charges.The gunman, according to York county district attorney Timothy Barker, fired an AR-15-style rifle from inside the home of his ex-girlfriend, killing the three detectives as they attempted to enter the unlocked front door of the residence.The officers were identified as Det Sgt Cody Becker, Det Mark Baker, and Det Isaiah Emenheiser. They were leaders in theNorthern York County Regional Police Department, according to police chief David Lash.“Each of these men represented the very best of policing – they served with professionalism, dedication, and courage,” Lash said at a news conference.The two injured officers were in stable condition in the hospital.The chain of events that led up to the shootings appears to have begun late on Tuesday when the suspected gunman was spotted loitering in the driveway of a former girlfriend, according to an affidavit of probable cause.Police arrived at the home at about 11.30pm after the owner spotted a man wearing camouflage with binoculars looking through the window, according to the court documents.Officers said they saw an AR-15 style rifle slung across the man’s chest in photos obtained from a trail camera. The homeowner’s daughter told police it was Ruth, a former boyfriend she “only dated for a short period of time” and who had never visited their house.“Over the next several hours, officers attempted to locate Ruth in the area, but were unsuccessful,” the officers said in the affidavit.The daughter told police she suspected Ruth set her pickup truck on fire while it sat in her driveway in August. On Monday, a fire investigator determined the fire was set intentionally.As a result, Ruth was charged with misdemeanor stalking, misdemeanor prowling at nighttime, and summary criminal trespass. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and officers were visiting the home when they were ambushed by a gunman believed to be Ruth.“We need to do better as a society,” the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, said. “We need to help the people who think that picking up a gun, picking up a weapon, is the answer to resolving disputes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came after one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, Nexstar, had said it would replace Kimmel’s show for the foreseeable future.Nexstar’s rapid decision to announce it would replace Kimmel’s show came as it attempts to get clearance from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), run by a Trump appointee, to buy a rival, Tegna, in a $6.2bn deal.A second operator, Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns moreABCstations than any other conglomerate, took the same stance as Nexstar and also said it would run a Kirk tribute in Kimmel’s timeslot on Friday.Graph showing press freedom in different countriesSinclair is also urging the FCC to deregulate, which it emphasised on Thursday, saying action needed to be taken to “address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks”.Brendan Carr, chair of the FCC and known for his goldlapel-pin bust of the president, had alreadywarned of fines or the loss of broadcast licencesif the show remained on air.Trump posted on social media that the suspension was “great news for America” and that ABC had shown “courage” by cancelling Kimmel.The suspension marked thelatest backdown for Disneyafter the media conglomerate struck a $16m (£11.8m) deal in December to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump over comments made by the ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. The New York Times reported that the decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live! was taken by Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, and the company’s television chief, Dana Walden.Disney could also do with being looked on favourably by the Trump administration as it seeks a green light for its sports network ESPN to get clearanceto buy the NFL Network.Two months ago CBS Newscancelled The Late Showwith Stephen Colbert days after the host said its parent company, Paramount, had paid a“big fat bribe” forsettling a lawsuit with Trump for $16mover the US president’s claim the news outlet deceptively edited a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, then the Democrat presidential candidate.Days later the FCC agreed thecontroversial $8.4bn merger of Paramount, which owns assets including the eponymous Hollywood film studio and Nickelodeon cable channel, with Skydance Media.“It is the court of King Trump,” said Alice Enders, a media analyst. “The crucial lever is the FCC, with its control over deals and licences. Any company that wants to do a deal, protect or expand its commercial business, it has to toe the line. There are no criteria other than to support the official line.”Earlier this month Paramount appointed Kenneth Weinstein, who has close ties to Trump, as an ombudsman to root out “complaints of bias” at CBS News.Skydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of a close Trump ally, the tech billionaire andsecond richest man in the world, Larry Ellison.Ellison’s increasing control of the US media landscape extends to the potential purchase of theAmerican-facing operation of TikTok.Trump said this week that a deal was close to being announced – he has repeatedly extended a deadline enforcing a ban on TikTok in the US under a law signed by his predecessor, Joe Biden – with reports saying the buyer would be a consortium that would include Ellison’s Oracle.And last week it emerged that the newly merged Paramount Skydance is looking at atakeover of Warner Bros Discovery,the media company behind CNN.Trump has repeatedly attacked CNN, which is run by the former BBC director general Mark Thompson, and the Comcast-owned MSNBC over their critical coverage, calling them“illegal” and “corrupt”.Following the removal of Kimmel’s show Trump said in a post: “That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC” – a threat to the shows of late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.“Trump sees CNN as left wing and now it appears that if you do your job you are putting your company at risk, your own salary,” said one media executive. “You would be worried if you were at CNN about what might be promised to get a deal through Trump’s people.”Trump has also successfully exerted pressure on major print and digital media outlets.Before last year’s US presidential election, the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,broke a 30-year tradition of backing a candidate. Staff claimed that the position would have been to support Democratic candidate Harris.Earlier this week, Trumpfiled a $15bn lawsuit against the New York Timesaccusing it of being a “mouthpiece” for the Democratic party and of “spreading false and defamatory content” about him.And Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journalis also subject to a Trump lawsuitfollowing the publication of allegations that the president composeda crude poem and doodleas part of a collection compiled for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday.The ownership structure and power of the New York Times, and huge influence of the Murdoch’s Fox News in rightwing politics, means their proprietors are unlikely to be cowed.However, Trump’s marrying of political allegiance with commercial success is continuing to affect media plurality in the US.“Free speech no longer means free speech,” said Enders. “Business has become political.”Explore more on these topicsUS television industryJimmy KimmelMedia businessABCTelevision industryDonald TrumpCharlie Kirk shootinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Trump has sought to fire Cook – citingunconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud– while he pursues greater control of the Fed, which has for decades operated without political interference.But lawyers for Cook, who has denied wrongdoing, have argued that the US president has no authority to fire her.‘Pattern of lawfare’: Trump is targeting opponents with mortgage fraud claimsRead moreThe administration failed to dismiss Cook in time for this week’s latest Fed policy meeting, where the central bank decided to cut interest rates by 25 basis points.But the White House didsuccessfully install Stephen Miran, a top White House economic official, as a Fed governor just in time for the meeting. He dissented from the rest of the committee, and voted for a deeper rate cut.Earlier this month, US district judge Jia Cobb ruled Trump’s allegations that Cook committed mortgage fraud before taking office were probably not sufficient grounds for removal under the law that created the Fed.The justice department is now turning to the supreme court to request that Cobb’s order, which temporarily blocked Trump from removing Cook, be lifted.“This application involves yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President’s removal authority – here, interference with the president’s authority to remove members of the Federal Reserve board of governors for cause,” the department argued in its filing.Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.He has repeatedly broken with precedent to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair,Jerome Powell, when they repeatedly defied these calls.Cook, an appointee of Joe Biden, is a respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, and the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. Her term is not due to expire until 2038.Concerning economic signs, including data indicating thatthe labor market has stalledandinflation has picked up, have prompted most officials at the Fed to tread carefully.The administration has played down these official reports – andfired one of the officialsresponding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is anardent supporter of his agenda, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.Ahead of this week’s Fed policy meeting, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform.At the meeting, Cook voted with the majority, in favor of cutting rates by 25 basis points. Powell, whose term as Fed chair will expire next year, stressed afterwards: “We’re strongly committed to maintaining our independence.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He claimed the August ruling, the result of a challenge by a group of small businesses, “would literally destroy the United States of America” if allowed to stand.Most of Trump’s tariffs are illegal, federal court rulesRead moreThe November hearing sets up a major test of the president’s use of executive power to drive through his economic and trade agenda.The case wasplacedon a fast track by the supreme court, which begins its nine-month term next month. The court had also agreed to hear a separate challenge to Trump’s tariffs brought by a family-owned toy company, Learning Resources.Trump invoked a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the tariffs, which are typically approved by Congress. The word “tariff” is not included in the law.The US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax”, the federal appeals court in Washington DCsaidin a 7-4 ruling last month.The tariffs have remained in effect during the appeal to the supreme court. A defeat would at least halve the current average US effective tariff rate of 16.3%, and could force the US to pay back tens of billions of dollars it has collected from the tariffs, according to Chris Kennedy, an analyst at BloombergEconomics.The supreme court has already granted the Trump administration approval for18 consecutive requestsfor emergency relief.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS supreme courtDonald TrumpEconomic policyUS politicsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nvidia rose more than 3%, bolstering its $4tn market value.Nvidia said it would spend $5bn to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment is subject to regulatory approvals.“This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem – a fusion of two world-class platforms,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. “Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”The two companies said they would work on “seamlessly connecting” their architectures.For datacenters, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. while for PCs products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.Intel fell even further behind in recent years amid the AI boom that has propelled Nvidia to become the world’s most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19bn last year and another $3.7bn in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.Nvidia is the second firm investing billions of dollars into the flailing chipmaker. In August, Japan’s major tech investment firmSoftbankannounced it was investing $2bn in Intel in exchange for a 2% stake in the company’s business. Softbank’s investment came after initial reports the US government planned to take a stake in Intel first surfaced. The Intel investment would give the Japanese firm an expanded presence in the US.Donald Trump has worked to shore up the US semiconductor industry, previously threatening to impose 100% tariffs on any imported chips. Trump has also negotiated export deals with Nvidia and its competitor AMD that allowed the companies to sell certain AI chips with lower processing power to China –in exchange for a 15% cut of any sales of those chips.Experts say Nvidia’s latest investment in Intel is just validation of the leading chipmaker’s position – and it may provide the needed boost to finally get Intel in the AI race.Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush, said: “With AI infrastructure investments continuing to grow with the company expecting between $3tn to $4tn in total AI infrastructure spend by the end of the decade, the chip landscape remains [Nvidia’s] world, with everybody else paying rent, as more sovereigns and enterprises wait in line for the most advanced chips in the world.”Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBusinessDonald TrumpTrump administrationArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Shares in Novo Nordisk climbed by more than 6% on hopes that it can claw back market share lost to Eli Lilly and cheaper generic versions of GLP-1 drugs.The shares had fallen by nearly 60% in the past year as sales slowed and Novo issued several profit warnings, prompting its new chief executive, Mike Doustdar, toplan 9,000 layoffs.Novosaid on Thursdaythat a once-daily pill version of Wegovy helped people achieve “significant weight” loss in a clinical trial, with close to one in three participants losing 20% or more weight. Side-effects were similar to the injectable version.It is the first oral GLP-1 drug submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US regulator, and the company expects a decision on whether the FDA will approve it for use by the end of the year. Production has already begun at Novo’s US sites.The Thin Duck: Heston Blumenthal’s new menu for diners on weight-loss jabsRead moreIn a 64-week late-stage trial involving 307 obese or overweight adults, patients on average lost 16.6% of their body weight.The Danish company is going head to head with Lilly’s daily weight loss pill, called orforglipron. On Tuesday, the US drugmaker said one in five peoplelost 20% or moreof their weight over 72 weeks, in a trial of 3,127 adults. Patients lost 12.4% of their body weight on average at the highest dose.Lilly developed orforglipron with a compound it acquired from Japan’s Chugai Pharmaceutical in 2018. Eli Lilly plans to submit the pill to the regulator for approval later this year and some analysts say it could be fast-tracked by the FDA. Analysts estimate peak sales of $10bn a year for the drug, with the investment bank Jefferies seeing potential for up to $25bn.Matthew Weston, a UBS analyst, said he saw “clear leadership” for Novo’s oral obesity pill, forecasting peak annual sales of $5bn, including $4bn in the US, where 40% of people are obese. He added: “Orforglipron still presents a threat on being a more scalable product, and therefore potentially discounted price. It also doesn’t require the 30 minutes fasting, so could be seen as a more convenient option.”While anti-obesity jabs, which mimic a gut hormone called GLP-1, have been immensely popular, they are very expensive, especially afterLilly’s recent price increaseof up to 170% in the UK. The NHS has limited their availability to people with high clinical need.Pill versions are easier to store, distribute and administer and are expected to be cheaper, paving the way for millions more people to lose weight at a time when obesity is increasing around the world.The main problem with developing a tablet version was that the peptide in semaglutide, Wegovy’s main ingredient, breaks down immediately in the acidic environment of the stomach, but Novo has added an absorption enhancer to speed its passage into the bloodstream.The shares of GLP-1 drugmakers have vastly outperformed pharmaceutical companies that do not make those weight loss drugs.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

He is a three-time Cy Young winner and was named National League MVP in 2014. He is also an 11-time All-Star – he made the cut again this season – and won the World Series with the Dodgers in 2020. He has an ERA of 2.54 across his career and maintained a respectable 3.53 ERA in 20 starts this season, even as his fastball started to slow.If there was a knock on Kershaw’s career, it was a lack of postseason success. The Dodger owns a 13-13 record with a 4.49 ERA in the postseason, a stark contrast from his 2.54 career ERA in the regular season, to go with a 222-96 record. The 2020 World Series win calmed those criticisms somewhat, though (Kershaw did not pitch in the Dodgers’ 2024 World Series championship due to injury).The Dodgers have a six-man rotation heading into this coming postseason – although they have not clinched their spot yet, it would require a spectacular meltdown for them to miss out – which may mean Kershaw does not start.“I feel that there’s a place for him on our postseason roster,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told ESPN this week. “I don’t know what role, but I think that the bottom line is, I trust him. And so, for me, the postseason is about players you trust.”Kershaw always looked destined for an excellent career and was highly touted coming out of high school. The Dodgers picked him No 7 overall in the 2006 draft, a selection they have never regretted.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles DodgersMLBBaseballUS sportsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The American stormed through the Tokyo rain to add a first global gold in the flat 400m to the twoOlympicand one world titles she won over the hurdles.Gout Gout misses out on 200m final but says better performances are ‘coming’Read moreNot since the Iron Curtain cast a shadow over Europe, and sport was seen as war by other means across the Eastern bloc, has a woman run a 400m as fast as McLaughlin-Levrone did on this wet and wild Tokyo night.The wind was rattling unevenly around the National Stadium. There were puddles on the track. And yet the American looked almost serene as she floated across the track to take a stunning WorldAthleticsChampionship gold medal in 47.78sec.Afterwards, when she spoke briefly to reporters, she invoked the power of prayer and the Lord. In track and field terms, this performance was certainly God-like too.“I had faith in my training,” she said. “I knew I had it in me to run that fast. It was just a matter of time.”Yet when McLaughlin-Levrone announced she was making the switch to the 400m from the hurdles, whereshe holds the world recordand two Olympic and world titles, there were plenty of doubters. They will be silent now. “My coach, Bobby Kersee, uses boxing terms all the time,” she said. “He said: ‘You got to go out there and take the belt. It’s not yours, and you got to go earn it’.”McLaughlin-Levrone’s time was so fast it took her to second on the all-time list, hopping over the Czech Jarmila Kratochvilova, who attributed her muscular physique to growing up on a farm, rigorous weight-training, and shots of vitamin B12, during her early 1980s peak.Only Marita Koch’s world record of 47.60sec, set by the East German in 1985 and questioned ever since despite the athlete’s insistence she did nothing wrong, stands above the US athlete now. But McLaughlin-Levrone knows it is within her grasp.Certainly Salwa Eid Naser, who won bronze, thinks it is possible after getting the best view in the National Stadium of the American’s performance. “I think that very soon the women’s 400m world record will be broken,” she said. “I never thought of it before, but after tonight’s race I can see it is around the corner.”View image in fullscreenBusang Collen Kebinatshipi (centre) won 400m gold ahead of Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago.Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/EPAYet, incredibly, the result was still in doubt off the final bend. As McLaughlin-Levrone looked across from lane five she could see the Olympic champion, Marileidy Paulino, alongside her, across in the outside lane.Some would have panicked. But the American’s form didn’t change and her poise didn’t alter. Slowly Paulino began to falter and settle for silver in 47.98sec, the third fastest time in history, with Eid third in 48.19sec, the ninth quickest of all time. Britain’s Amber Anning ran a season’s best of 49.36sec to finish a highly creditable fifth.“I knew the strength was there,” said McLaughlin-Levrone. “I just knew that there was more in the tank. And I knew it was going to be a battle down the full stretch. It was a lot of hard work, a lot of prayer, a lot of trust in the process.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which may be the understatement of the century. Borg, the greatest tennis player of his day, has spent 42 years saying nothing since he announced his retirement at the age of 26.When he broke that news in 1983, it was one of the biggest shocks in the history of sport. Not simply because he was at his peak, but also because he wastherock star tennis player – beautiful, mysterious and followed by a flock of teenybopper fans. When Spain’sCarlos Alcaraz triumphedin the US Open earlier this month, aged 22, he became the second youngest player to have won six major tournaments. Borg beat him by four months.View image in fullscreenBjörn Borg in Stockholm last month.Photograph: Rebecka Uhlin/The GuardianBorg was actually only 25 when he stopped playing major tournaments in 1981. That season, he had appeared in three of the four grand slam finals, winning the French Open and losing at Wimbledon and the US Open. In total he won Wimbledon men’s singles five times in a row (a record matched only by Roger Federer) and six French opens.And then he was gone, without a word. Borg devotees were traumatised. But perhaps they shouldn’t have been surprised at the lack of an explanation. The Swede was the samurai of tennis – immensely strong, disciplined and virtually silent. The “Ice Borg” never showed emotion on court, but many of us assumed there was a tumult roaring inside. And so it proved.At the age of 69 he has finally written his memoir, Heartbeats, and it answersevery question we’ve been askingfor the best part of half a century. It contains revelation after revelation, and is all the more shocking for the understated style in which it is written. Drugs, alcohol, despair, near-fatal overdoses, failed relationships, shame and self-imposed exile: for any Borg fan – and I was a huge one, growing up – it’s a painful read.We’re talking via video link. He’s in Stockholm at his publisher’s offices. His hair is now grey, but still luxuriant. He looks super-fit, partly because of an exercise regime so batty that only Borg could come up with it. From the off, he tells me how much he disliked talking in the old days. This accounts for the fact that so few TV interviews exist of him (you won’t have to look hard to find footage of rivals such asJimmy ConnorsorJohn McEnroe,or, from the women’s game,Martina NavratilovaandBillie Jean King). Borg tried his hand at commentary, but that proved a short-lived career when he just sat there in silence.“I’m a very secret person,” he says. “And I’m a very stubborn person.” That stubbornness, or discipline, was at the heart of his success – never giving up, never giving in to emotion, never giving into temptation. It was also at the heart of his failings – refusing to mix with his old tennis friends after he quit, refusing to use the new turbocharged rackets when he briefly returned in 1991 (which meant he had zero chance of winning) and refusing to explain why he retired in the first place.So why has he decided to tell his story now? “It’s been bothering me for many years. People know me as a tennis player, but not what I went through. The decisions I took in my life were stupid, so I wanted to tell that story.” It’s so Borg-like that he feels the need to own his stupidity rather than his success. But, he says, he knew he couldn’t tell his story to a stranger, and he didn’t feel capable of telling it himself.View image in fullscreenBorg and his wife, Patricia Östfeld, watch their son Leo Borg playing against Australia’s Aleksandar Vukic in Stockholm earlier this year.Photograph: Jonas Ekstromer/TT News Agency/AFP/Getty ImagesA few years ago he asked his third wife, Patricia Östfeld, whom he has been with for 23 years, if she would help him write the book. “I was very happy she said yes because if she hadn’t this book would never have come out. I would have taken my story to the grave. She said, ‘What d’you want to put in it?’ and I said, ‘Everything. I want to be open.’”Borg adored tennis in the early days – not just the success, but the game itself. But by 25 he was burnt out. “Up to that point I was entirely focused on my tennis. I was eating, sleeping, practising, playing matches. And I loved it. I had a great time.” So what happened? “I lost my motivation.”View image in fullscreenBorg with his first wife, the Romanian tennis player Mariana Simionescu, in 1983.Photograph: Express/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesBy the end, his desire had gone, he was depressed and had become divorced from his roots. He moved away fromSwedenand was living as a tax exile in Monte Carlo. Borg was a hero to some in Sweden, and a tax-dodging traitor to others. He and his first wife, the Romanian tennis player Mariana Simionescu, were catnip for the world’s media – young, gorgeous and clearly in love. But their relationship changed. She gave up the sport to look after Borg’s career and ended up more of a mother figure to him than a partner. At the 1981 US Open, the last major he competed in, he received death threats before and during the final. After losing the match, he was escorted off court by security before the awards ceremony.Did the death threats contribute to his decision to quit? “No, they had nothing to do with it,” he insists. The real reason, he says, is that he felt he no longer had a life. “In hotels when I checked in there were at least 100 people in reception wanting autographs. If I went to a restaurant there would be 15 photographers outside waiting and following me. In the end, when I was playing I just stayed in my room. I ate in my room. I didn’t go out. This is why I stepped away from tennis. I thought: ‘Is this going to be my life in the future?’ That was the reason I said enough is enough.”Sports people today prepare themselves for life after sport. They have agents, they have people who guide them. I had no one. I did everything by myselfThe first year of freedom was great, he says. He did exactly what he wanted, and loved it. He moved to America, lived on Long Island, New York, and partied. And then he partied some more. But he realised something was lacking – the buzz that tennis had given him. In the summer of 1982, he was introduced to cocaine. “I said to myself, ‘Oh, this is a different feeling. This is a different thing.’” In Heartbeats (so called because Borg has an exceptionally low resting heart rate of 32-34 beats per minute, and also a reference to a time he nearly died after overdosing), he writes: “I got the same kind of rush I got from tennis. The feeling itself was new, and it made me feel incredibly energised. I was hooked immediately.”The trouble was, Borg says now, he had nothing to fill his life with. “I was happy to step away from tennis, I could do anything, but I didn’t have a plan.” He was still struggling with depression. “It comes to a point where you ask yourself, ‘OK, what do I do now to be happy? To have joy, to feel good about myself, to feel good about life? I want to have the same satisfaction I had when I played tennis.’ I was lost. That’s why sports people today prepare themselves for life after sport. They have agents, they have people who guide them in the right way. I had no one, and I did everything by myself.”View image in fullscreenWith his son Robin in Monaco in 1988.Photograph: Patrick Siccoli/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesAnd he did it the wrong way. He started taking more cocaine, mixing it with uppers and downers and booze. He and Simionescu divorced in 1984, and in 1985 he fathered a son, Robin, with the Swedish model Jannike Björling. He says Robin was the only good thing that happened to him in the 1980s. But he was in no state to be a good father, and was lurching from relationship to relationship, usually before the previous one had finished. He continued to party hard. But the way he tells it, it sounds like the most miserable party on Earth. “When you feel bad you try to escape. I tried to escape with drugs, pills and a lot of alcohol. I was looking for something; I didn’t know what, though. So using these things, you don’t have to think about your problems.”When did he realise it was harming him? “In 1989, when I took the decision to start to play tennis again. I knew I couldn’t continue to live a life like this. I needed to find something else.”Was he an addict? “Put it this way: I wasn’t doing drugs, pills and alcohol every night. So not in that way.” But it was still enough to devastate his life. This was the year he married the Italian singer Loredana Bertè, moved to Milan and “life turned into a chaotic mess” – more drugs, a dysfunctional marriage, a young son based overseas in Sweden, and the bankruptcy of his fashion business, the BjörnBorg design group. Despite keeping physically fit through running and the gym (he was obsessive about maintaining his matchplay weight), he was destroying himself.I wondered, ‘Did I really play this sport before?’ I played so bad, it was ridiculousIn 1989, unsubstantiated stories emerged that he had tried to kill himself. Borg says this was untrue. Although he was in despair and no longer saw the point in living (in the book he writes: “I just thought: I can’t take this any more. I’m done”), he never actively tried to end his life. But that February an accidental overdose almost did for him. When Bertè couldn’t wake him, she called an ambulance. It saved his life.But he hadn’t learned his lesson. Once he recovered, it was back to the drugs, pills and alcohol. Eventually, he realised that he had to make a complete break – from Bertè, Milan and a lifestyle that was devouring him. In 1990, for the first time in eight years, he picked up a racket. “I wondered, ‘Did I really play this sport before?’ I played so bad, it was ridiculous. Then I told myself, ‘I’m not doing this to be a tennis player, I’m not doing this to win tournaments – I’m doing this for a different reason.’” He moved to London, went into rehab and began practising at Queen’s Club. Amazingly, this never made it into the newspapers.Then, in 1991, at the age of 34 and almost a decade after quitting, he announced he was coming out of retirement. That was when he returned with his tiny relic of a wooden racket. His professional comeback was as ludicrous as it was poignant. In April, he played at the Monte Carlo ATP tournament. Friends told him he should choose a smaller, less glitzy event. But this was Borg. Of course he ignored them. He played Jordi Arrese, a Spaniard ranked 52nd in the world, and lost 6-2, 6-3.View image in fullscreenBorg celebrates defeating Jan Kodes of Czechoslovakia during their men’s singles match to win the Davis Cup for Sweden in December 1975.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesHe says the Monte Carlo match was one of his happiest days on a tennis court, ranking it alongside his fifth successive Wimbledon triumph when he beat McEnroe after the famous tie-break (which he lost 18-16) and the defeat of Jan Kodes in 1975 to win the Davis Cup for Sweden when he was 19. “Afterwards, I’m sitting in the back seat of the car and my parents are in the front, and they see me and they say, ‘You look so happy.’ Yes, I was so happy and satisfied. It was a wonderful moment coming after all the things I had been through. Sitting in the car, I was so satisfied that I’d done this thing. I felt, ‘I’m back in life.FinallyI’m back in life.’ Only my parents knew the real reason why I came back to tennis. No one else.”What was that reason? He takes me back to his final days in Milan. “I told myself if I continued with this sort of life I’m not going to survive. If I had continued, you and me, we would not be talking to each other today. So I said, ‘I need to do something that makes me happy, something that makes me feel comfortable with myself. I need to wake up in the morning to do something and have a schedule. I need to do something in life to survive.’ So I said to myself, ‘Yes, I’m going to start to play tennis again.’”So you didn’t come back to win – you came back to stay alive? “Yes,” he says quietly. “To stay alive, exactly.” Between 1991 and 1993, he played 12 professional matches and lost every one. But it didn’t matter to him. He was surviving.The one guy who called me all the time and said, ‘You cannot quit, you cannot retire from tennis,’ was John McEnroe.I ask him what he said to his fellow players after he retired initially. “I didn’t keep in touch with the players,” he says. “When I left tennis, I left all my friends. I left everything.Everything. And that was a huge mistake. I went into a different crowd, people who weren’t interested in sport. That’s why I started with drugs and pills and drinking.”You had so many friends, I say. He nods. “Yes,somany.” Did they try to stop you? “The one guy who called me all the time and said, ‘You cannot quit, you cannot retire from tennis,’ was John McEnroe. He called me so many times. ‘What are you doing? I want to play you so many times. Björn. How can you leave tennis? You’re not even 26 years old,’ John said to me. ‘I’m sorry, John, I’ve taken this decision.’ He was very disappointed. Very sad.”View image in fullscreenJohn McEnroe and Borg before their finals match at the 1981 US Open tennis championships, which McEnroe won.Photograph: PCN Photography/AlamyIt makes sense. McEnroe was his greatest rival. They were opposites in style and temperament – Borg Zen and patiently overpowering his opponent; McEnroe feral and predatory on court. Tennis starArthur Ashesaid Borg was a sledgehammer of a player while McEnroe was a stiletto. The 2017 biopicBorg vs McEnroeis about their rivalry, and culminates in the Wimbledon final of 1980, regarded as one of the finest matches in tennis history. The film depicts Borg in his relentless intensity – travelling with 50 rackets, testing their tension by listening to the notes produced by the strings, never shaving and always wearing the identical Fila Settanta polo shirt at Wimbledon. The schoolboy Borg was played by his younger son Leo, from his marriage with Östfeld, today a 22-year-old tennis professional. Borg says Sverrir Guðnason’s depiction of his older self was a little too dour, even for him.Borg vs McEnroe recreates the scene in which they earned each other’s respect (albeit in a different match from the one where it actually happened). In 1979, Borg had just beaten McEnroe in Richmond, Virginia, and a week later was beating him again in New Orleans. “He was going completely crazy on the court. You would think this guy is coming out of the mental hospital,” he says. “So I said to John, ‘Can you come to the net?’ and he looked at me as if I was crazy. He came slowly to the net and said, ‘What d’you want?’ and I said, ‘It’s only a game, John,’ and again he looked at me like I’m crazy. So we went on playing. I had match point, and he won the match. After that everything changed. I respected him so much. And then all the matches we played after that he never said a word. But then when he played other players he could be a littlecomplicatedon the court, if you put it that way.”They renewed their friendship when Borg returned to tennis, and McEnroe was best man at his wedding in 1997. I say I think the two of them got on so well because they were opposites. “Yes, exactly.” You reminded me of a Bergman character when you played, I say – impassive on the outside, with a torrent of emotions raging internally. He laughs. “Yeah, you’re right, absolutely.” But he says it used to be different. As a boy, the rage was there for everybody to see. “When I was 12 they suspended me for six months in my home town. My parents’ tennis club had a meeting because I was behaving so badly on court, swearing, throwing rackets, cheating. Very, very bad. They said, ‘It’s embarrassing for this guy to walk on the court; it’s embarrassing for us.’ When they suspended me I was destroyed.”View image in fullscreenBorg on his way to defeating McEnroe in the men’s final of the Wimbledon Championships with a score of 1–6, 7–5, 6–3, 6–7 (16–18), 8–6 on 5 July 1980.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockThe young Borg was almost as good at ice hockey as tennis. “I played ice hockey in that time, but I couldn’t play tennis. When I came back I didn’t say a word because I was scared that if I showed my feelings again they might suspend me again. That was my first step in my behaving on the court. I was boiling inside, but I didn’t say anything. Then I told myself I had to learn to behave in a good professional way on the tennis court. It took a couple of years for me to understand what to do and not to do. After two or three years I was no longer boiling inside – I knew exactly how to behave. I was thinking, ‘Focus on the next point and then the next point’ until one day I was perfect. I knew exactly how to behave on the tennis court.”That’s when he became the samurai? “In a way, yes.” The closest he got to showing emotion mid-game was blowing on his knuckles while waiting to receive serve. When he won major titles, all that pent-up feeling would pour out as he fell to his knees at the moment of victory.After he lost in the 1981 Wimbledon final to McEnroe, he didn’t return until the centenary tournament of 2000. Every year, we would see former winners take their seat of honour on finals day, but Borg was always conspicuous by his absence. The commentators never mentioned his non-attendance, as if it was too painful to acknowledge. At times, it felt as if the spectre of Borg hovered over Wimbledon.View image in fullscreenAs a businessman in Monaco, March 1983.Photograph: Alain Mingam/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesThe real turning point in his recovery came not when he returned to the professional circuit but whenJimmy Connorslaunched the senior Champions tour in 1993. Borg knew it was pointless trying to beat the new generation, even with a modern racket. But he believed he could hold his own against his former peers. “The first year we had three or four tournaments and then it grew more and more. It was perfect for me to play in the senior tournaments, and people were really interested in seeing our generation – me, John, Jimmy, [Guillermo] Vilas, Vitas [Gerulaitis, who had been his best friend on the circuit and died from carbon monoxide poisoning owing to an improperly installed propane heater aged 40 in 1994]. I started to slowly get back into the tennis.” He even won five of the tournaments.But most importantly, returning to the fold was part of his recuperation. “I started to talk a lot to the other players, even if I had some relapses in the 90s. They knew what I’d been through because I spoke a little bit to them about that too.” He had now moved to Los Angeles and was spending time at thePlayboy founder Hugh Hefner’s mansion. “The place was full of temptations of every kind, and it was hard to say no,” Borg writes in the book.I fell down, and the next thing I knew I was was waking up in hospital with tubes in meDespite this, the media still never really got hold of his story. (The closest he came to being exposed was in 1990 when a Swedish magazine quoted Jannike Björling saying he used cocaine. He sued and won about £6,700 in damages.) That’s surely a sign of how loyal your fellow players were to you, I say. Yes, partly, he says, but it’s also because it was a different age. These days, if he was seen drunk or stoned, he thinks it would probably be on social media within hours.View image in fullscreenFan favourite … Borg at Wimbledon in 1973.Photograph: Harry Dempster/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesBjörn Borg takes life ‘day by day’ after ‘aggressive’ prostate cancer diagnosisRead moreHis worst relapse occurred in 1993 and resulted in another near-fatal overdose. He struggles to talk about it because he is so ashamed of what happened. Borg was with his father in Holland for an exhibition tournament. The previous night he had been at a party, drugs were there for the taking, and he weakened. “My father and I were walking to the club to play the final of this exhibition tournament. And I said to him, ‘I don’t feel too good. I don’t think I can make this.’ My father said, ‘Just take it easy.’ Then I fell down on the ground, and the next thing I knew I was was waking up in hospital with tubes in me. My father told me the ambulance came very quickly, and the doctor said, ‘You were very close to dying.’ That was probably the worst thing I ever did. It was terrible. When I woke up in the hospital I saw my father in front of me, and I was so embarrassed. When we flew home to Stockholm we didn’t say a word to each other. He was disappointed, sad, and I’m sure he was angry too.”The relapses became less frequent, and were never again as extreme. In 1999, he met Patricia, an estate agent. He got clean that year and has remained so ever since. In 2000, he returned to Wimbledon for a special parade at the Millennium Championships. The former champions were introduced to the crowd one by one. Nobody got a roar like Borg did.View image in fullscreen‘It was such a relief when I came back to Wimbledon. I feel at home there. I feel comfortable’ … Borg, right, with Boris Becker, left, and McEnroe marking Wimbledon’s Millenium Championships in 2000.Photograph: Gerry Penny/AFP/Getty ImagesPerhaps the saddest thing in the book, I say, is when you write that you stayed away from Wimbledon for so long because you were ashamed of what had become of you. “It’s true. They invited me all the time, but I didn’t feel comfortable. The way I’d been living, what had happened, all these things. But then one day soon after I met Patricia, I said, ‘Now I feel ready to go back to my favourite tournament.’ And I’ve been back almost every year since then. It was such a relief when I came back to Wimbledon. I feel at home there. I feel comfortable.”View image in fullscreenA 90s magazine advert for Borg’s underwear brand.Photograph: Retro AdArchives/AlamyThere are still testing times. He struggles withseasonal affective disorder, and knows that every autumn a mild depression will creep in. So now he spends these months in Ibiza where old tennis friends visit (includingBoris Becker, who was jailedfor financial misconduct related to bankruptcy fraud, with whom he bonds over the bad choices they’ve made).But over the past 20 years, he has enjoyed a new stability as a husband, father, now grandfather, entrepreneur (part of his business was bought out of bankruptcy by another company, rebranded as the Björn Borg Collection, and has made him wealthy once again from the royalties), captain of Sweden’s Davis Cup team and ageing former tennis giant. In 2014, he was voted Sweden’s top sportsman of all time by the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, which meant a huge amount to him.View image in fullscreen‘I’m so much lighter now’ … Borg in Stockholm.Photograph: Rebecka Uhlin/The GuardianAt the end of the book, just as we’re anticipating the perfect happy ending, he reveals that he was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer a couple of years ago. It comes as a shock, like so much in Heartbeats. In 2024, he was operated on. “A few days after the operation the surgeon said, ‘This was really, really bad. But you’re OK.’” He is dealing with it as calmly as you’d imagine the samurai of the 70s would have. “I have these sleeping cancer cells in my body. They could be sleeping for many years, but they could come out and give me problems. I just have to wait and see. I have to go back for six-monthly checks. Right now I feel good, no problem.”The greatest: Bjorn Borg – enigma with a bomb-proof winning mentality | Tim LewisRead moreThe cancer has done nothing to dampen his extreme fitness regime. Of all his revelations, perhaps the most astonishing is that he walks 12 miles (20km) a day around the TV couch in his Stockholm apartment. He can’t be serious? “Yep. I can think in that time.” He writes that Patricia can get “really annoyed” when she’s trying to relax with him and he suddenly gets up and starts walking.You’re bonkers, I say. He nods happily. Then I confess that I run around my living room (not 20km, I hasten to add). He laughs. “You do that? You’re like me! We’re the same! Haha! That’s good to hear.” What’s more, I say, when I played tennis as a teenager, I used to wear a headband like yours and blow on my knuckles when waiting to receive serve. “Oh, you did that with the hand, like I used to do?” Again, he laughs. It’s so lovely to see – the one thing we never saw in his playing years.Rarely has an interview left me so emotional. Partly it’s my age and what Borg means to me. But you’d need a heart of stone not to be moved by somebody who’s been through so much and has finally made peace with himself. Being able to talk about everything seems to have liberated you, I say. “Yes,” he says. And now his smile verges on the ecstatic. “Yes, I’ve got my backpack off my back. Liberated, exactly, that’s the word.” He exhales loudly. “I’m so much lighter now.”Heartbeats: A Memoir by Björn Borg is published by Sphere (£25).

Rashford, he said, was a player he had long admired and could help improve.Newcastle United v Barcelona: Champions League – liveRead moreIn the 82nd minute, Rashford walked off wreathed in smiles before being wrapped in Flick’s heartfelt embrace. Ruben Amorim’s bete noire had just scored two splendid goals that not merely rendered Eddie Howe’s rather effective gameplan academic but silenced St James’ Park.With Faustino Asprilla – the scorer of a famous hat-trick for Newcastle as Barcelona succumbed 3-2 on Tyneside in 1997 – having flown in from Colombia to help cheer on his old team, it was not supposed to be like this. Not even Anthony Gordon’s 90th-minute consolation could upstage Rashford as Flick’s players expertly managed seven minutes of stoppage time.Until then it was no night for slow coaches. Not with so many explosions of pace all over the pitch and on the respective right wings in particular. If Raphinha’s rapid acceleration down that flank for Barcelona sometimes stretched Tino Livramento to the limit, the sprinting powers of Newcastle’s Anthony Elanga often seemed utterly irresistible.From one such advance Elanga scorched past Gerard Martín before crossing for Gordon but Newcastle’s out-of-position centre-forward failed to make contact. Might Nick Woltemade have done better? Quite possibly, but Newcastle’s £70m Germany striker began on the bench after Howe sensibly decided three games in a week might be beyond the 6ft 6in new boy at this stage.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford hits a stunning shot past Nick Pope to put Barcelona 2-0 in front.Photograph: Daniel Chesterton/Offside/Getty ImagesNonetheless, Newcastle’s manager could certainly have done with Woltemade’s sureness of touch as Harvey Barnes dinked the ball over Joan García only to direct it wide of a post. On that occasion Barnes’s blushes were spared by a linesman’s offside flag but he would later be denied by the goalkeeper when clean through on the counterattack.Yet, if their finishing was found wanting, Newcastle initially pressed so hard and high they refused to allow the La Liga champions to assert any sustained midfield control.The danger was that if Newcastle even momentarily lost concentration, Raphinha or Rashford would race away from them. Rashford looked razor sharp and had home hearts in mouths after tricking Kieran Trippier before leaving the former England full-back trailing in his wake. He ultimately shot wide but Howe knew it represented a reprieve.With Flick’s brightest talent, Lamine Yamal, back in Barcelona nursing his injured groin, opportunity beckoned for a Newcastle side cleverly mixing long balls with slick, short passing. Yet as well as they did to keep the match evenly balanced, García was hardly troubled.Although Sandro Tonali, once again tremendous in midfield, prompted a series of promising moves and cross after cross flew into Barcelona’s box, the lack of specialist striker ensured they came to nothing.Tonali’s presence as a disruptor also dictated that Nick Pope remained generally well protected as Barcelona struggled to join their attacking dots and a frustrated Robert Lewandowski implored the referee to book his assiduous minder, Fabian Schär.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The scene was set for Rashford to jog a few memories by connecting with the excellent Koundé’s left-footed cross and flashing an unstoppable glancing header past Pope. A perfect fusion of power and accuracy, it was his first goal for Barcelona and arrived after he cleverly manoeuvred himself clear of Schär.It served as the signal for Howe to finally introduce Woltemade as part of a quadruple substitution but, before the newcomers could make a difference, Rashford struck again.If his opener was good, his second was sublime. Having dodged Tonali, he unleashed a 20-yard shot that pinged the crossbar en route to the back of the net. Rashford always tended to do well against Newcastle for Manchester United and it seems switching shirts has not lessened that appetite.Although Gordon finally proved he can score after all by sliding home Murphy’s cross at the far post, the first Englishman to score for Barcelona since Gary Lineker had already done enough.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedBarcelonamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Now they are doing it again with one of the best young players in the leagueThu 18 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 15.33 EDTShareWhen theChicago Skyselected Angel Reese, one of the most celebrated college players in years, with the No 7 overall pick last year, many believed she could be a turning point for the franchise. Yes, the Sky had won the WNBA finals in 2021 but they have been a losing team for most of their history and Reese, in addition to her celebrity, would bring explosive athleticism and superb rebounding to the franchise. As a player, those lofty hopes have panned out: she is already a two-time All-Star and has led the league in rebounds in both her WNBA seasons.As a teammate, things aren’t so smooth. The Sky missed out on the playoffs last season. This time around they finished with the joint-worst record in the entireWNBA, alongside the Dallas Wings.Caitlin Clark’s season is over, but the mob’s anger isn’t about her healthRead moreReese, it is fair to say, has not been shy about showing her feelings. After saying the Sky “have to get good players … have to get great players” and implying she’d seek a trade if that didn’t happen,Reese apologized. “I really didn’t intentionally mean to put down my teammates,” she said. The Sky promptly suspended her for half a game for “statements detrimental to the team.”As a former NBA player myself, I can testify that criticizing your teammates – in public at least – is a no-no. But is a suspension and a statement to the media the way it should have been handled? It seemed as though the Sky were attempting to embarrass Reese. She has been the target of abuse on social media ever since she entered the league, partlydue to her so-called rivalrywith Caitlin Clark (a rivalry both women play down). By reprimanding her, the Sky opened the way for her online critics to feast and slander Reese.The punishment looked petty, and quickly backfired. Sky fans flooded social media with support for Reese, and at Chicago’s final home game, signs appeared in the crowd reading “Free Angel Reese”, while others called for the firing of general manager Jeff Pagliocca.The suspension didn’t just seem heavy-handed, it was out of step with the rest of the league. Other WNBA stars have voiced frustrations with their teams without being punished. Pagliocca himself later echoed Reese’s sentiment about the need for better roster construction – the very thing she was suspended for. The message was unmistakable: when Reese says it, it’s insubordination; when the general manager says it, it’s a plan. That message is even worse when you consider how often Black women like Reese are attacked for speaking their minds.The irony is that Reese’s clash with the front office is only the latest chapter in a much longer, shambolic narrative for the Sky. This is a franchise with a history of running off talent. WNBA journalist Trysta Krickrecently told me on my podcast, The Collision, about problems at the Sky. Sylvia Fowles, Elena Delle Donne, Candace Parker, Courtney Vandersloot – all left Chicago frustrated (the latter returned this season to find things aren’t much better than when she left). Marina Mabrey spoke about racial tensions. Candace Parker, a Chicago native who helped Sky to the WNBA title in 2021, chose to leave. Time and again, the Sky have wasted the chance to construct a lasting championship roster.“There are so many players that could be on the team right now but elected to leave the Chicago Sky due to their issues with the organization,” Krick told me. “Could you imagine a Chicago team with Kahleah Copper, Angel Reese, Marina Mabrey, Kamilla Cardoso? That’s a championship caliber roster. But they have a history of squandering away talent.”Firing coach Teresa Weatherspoon only compounded matters. Reese said the decision left her “heartbroken” andadded that Weatherspoon was the only personwho “truly believed in me” as a Black woman in sports. It is difficult to imagine a more tone-deaf move if the goal is to keep your franchise player happy.Perhaps this would be more palatable if the Sky were competing for titles. But the last two seasons have been, bluntly, abysmal. In 2024 they won 13 of their 30 regular-season games. In 2025, they won 10, finishing joint-last despite having two 2024 All-Star rookies, Reese and center Kamilla Cardoso. In addition this year’s rookies – point guard Hailey Van Lith and forward Maddy Westbeld – have had difficult seasons, despite being exceptional talents.Even the draft has become a symbol of mismanagement. This year, Chicago passed on Sonia Citron, who blossomed into a rookie All-Star elsewhere, instead trading her rights – along with a future first-round pick – for Ariel Atkins, a veteran likely to leave in free agency. The Sky mortgaged their future for nothing, while their young stars struggled through another losing season.It is little wonder that fans are already debating where Reese might play next year. Pairing with the Wings’ Paige Bueckers or even Clark at the Indiana Fever – a move that would send the internet into meltdown – are fantasy scenarios, but the point is simple: Reese has options. She is a proven star, still only at the beginning of her career, and she deserves an organization that treats her with the respect she has earned.If Reese decides she’s had enough of the Chicago Sky, no one should be surprised. The blame won’t fall on her. It will be squarely on an organization that seems intent on driving its best players away.Explore more on these topicsChicago SkyWNBABasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

The midfielder said: “He seems to break every record going. It’s unheard of what he’s doing. What an unbelievable player.”AfterNapolihad Giovanni Di ­Lorenzo sent off on 21 minutes it was the longest of nights for an XI containing all the returning-to-Manchester three – Scott McTominay, Rasmus Højlund and De Bruyne – before the Belgian was sacrifice when his captain saw red.“Once A Blue Always A Blue” was one banner greeting Super Kev, though Napoli’s star turn was Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, a goalkeeper defiant until the second-half intervention of Haaland and Jérémy Doku, whose solo effort had shades of Ricky Villa’s 1981 FA Cup final barnburner.On a temperate night more akin to a venue in southern Europe, a Tijjani Reijnders stinger was beaten out by Milinkovic-Savic for a first corner. Napoli’s response came via a raking 45-yard De Bruyne diagonal that dropped sweetly on to Leonardo Spinazzola’s boot: he turned Abdukodir Khusanov inside out, so the makeshift right-back did well to recover.Now, a Gianluigi Donnarumma hoof upfield reached Foden, whose early release had Haaland galloping in – Di Lorenzo scythed him down and after the pitchside review, the referee, Felix Zwayer, went from adjudging no foul to a wave of the red card.Advantage City. After Reijnders’ free-kick spun away off the wall, and a Haaland flick went close, Napoli’s regroup featured Conte bringing on Mathías Olivera for De Bruyne: his 25 minutes were greeted with an ovation and a few volleys of: “Oh Kevin De Bruyne.” The Belgian poker-faced his removal but was surely discontented. Conte explained: “It was the only option I could do.”View image in fullscreenA disappointed Kevin De Bruyne trudges past the manager who substituted him, Antonio ContePhotograph: Nigel French/Allstar Picture Library Ltd/SportsphotoThe head coach had summed the contest up as his “students” against Guardiola’s “tutors”, and with Di Lorenzo’s early shower we settled in for City’s long siege of the Neapolitan goal. Rodri rolled to Foden and he unloaded and Milinkovic-Savic saved. A loose pass aimed at Alessandro Buongiorno had blue shirts scurrying after the ball with him but the centre-back beat these – just.A rat-a-tat sequence involving Rodri-Foden-Haaland had the striker squeezed out just inside Napoli’s area. Then, Rúben Dias’s curving cross drew a flying Haaland, who marginally failed to connect close in. Rodri flitted about in prompting, metronomic mode and when stepping forward hit a 20-yard banger that had caused Milinkovic-Savic to dive low, and right, to repel.He repeated the act – twice – to tip away headers from Nico O’Reilly and Josko Gvardiol, the Serb a one-man resistance to the ever-surging blue wave. Through all this his counterpart between City’s posts, Donnarumma, was a spectator on easy street. From the Naples area, the 26-year-old had close-to-zero to do before a break the team from his childhood locality managed to reach intact.City’s last effort before the refreshments was a Reijnders’ attempt that Matteo Politano nearly turned into his own goal when sticking out a boot. But, yet again, Milinkovic-Savic was alert and he gathered and saved the stand-in skipper’s blushes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conte’s interval instruction to his men was surely simple – “suffer and defend” – while saying too, maybe, internally, “cross everything”.He certainly prayed when Doku fed Foden and he let fly. The ball bounced from the left, across goal, narrowly missing. Now, following a yellow card for Politano for grabbing Gvardiol, Conte took him off for Juan Jesus but the Brazilian defender could do nothing to stop what happened next.From the edge of the area Foden, magically, flipped a lob past the No 5 into Haaland whose run and headed finish was of the pure poacher’s school. Guardiola celebrated, then substituted Rodri, Nico González given the last half an hour. Of the Spaniard’s exit, Guardiola said: “He asked to come off but he is fine.” The request came as he continues a comeback from a latest knee problem.From here City’s mission was to keep their lead. The best method of doing this is to score again, of course. So, they did, and this came courtesy of Doku’s slaloming twinkle-toed burst that made mugs of Sam Beukema and Spinazzola, the pair cast as pub footballers before the Belgian’s razor-sharp piercing of their net.City, continuing to probe, did not add another but this was an accomplished display.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityNapolimatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It’s getting harder for those two things to exist togetherOliver ConnollyThu 18 Sep 2025 08.06 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 08.07 EDTShareIt’s time forTom Bradyto pick. Or better yet, for the NFL to makehim choose.Brady’s twin roles as a minority owner of theLas Vegas Raidersand the lead voice for the NFL on Fox can no longer coexist. The lines are too muddled, the potential for scandal unnecessary.After a painful rookie season in the broadcast booth, Brady has had a promising start to his second year. In week one, on the Giants-Commanders call, he put together the best performance of his fledgling career. He sounded relaxed – confident, even. The whisper-shout that he revealed last year, an attempt to rebrand himself as Broadcaster Brady, was dropped. In its place came a more natural delivery and cadence. He was sharp. He seemed to be having fun. Rather than try to cram five thoughts into one sentence, he hit his landmarks with clarity. Now and then, he was even insightful, dropping nuggets that offered insight into how thegreatest to ever do itvisualizes the game.Eight days later, Brady wandered into his other chair as a team owner. He was in Vegas to watch the Raiders play the Chargers on Monday Night Football. ESPN showed Brady wearing a headset while sitting in the Raiders’ coaching booth. During the broadcast, sideline reporter Peter Schrager said: “[Raiders offensive coordinator] Chip Kelly told us he talks to Brady two to three times per week. They go through film. They go through the gameplan. Brady is a luxury for the coaches. Who else has an owner who has actually been there, done that?”From the NFL on Tom Brady: “There are no policies that prohibit an owner from sitting in the coaches’ booth or wearing a headset during a game. Brady was sitting in the booth in his capacity as a limited partner.”pic.twitter.com/dmebVaOBYg— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero)September 16, 2025TheNFLposted the clip of Brady sitting next to Vegas’ coaching staff, then promptly deleted it.In a flash, you can see the problem. Even Brady seemed to recognize it, slinking lower and lower in his chair as if he was about to hide under the desk. There you have the highest-paid analyst in the sport listening in ashiscoaching staff make decisions and call plays.Sports media is littered with conflicts of interest. Insiders are represented by the same agencies as the players and executives they cover. Talking heads are friends with coaches and GMs. Every announcer has relationships, dating back to their playing days or built throughout their broadcasting career. Heck, ESPN recently acquired NFL Network and other league properties, with the NFL taking an equity stake in the World Wide Leader as part of the deal. Wrap your head around that: the media company that reports on the league now has the NFL’s 32 owners among its shareholders – including, funnily enough, Brady.Tom Brady draws online ire as he appears in Las Vegas Raiders coaching boothRead moreThe lines between the broadcast partners and the league aren’t blurred; they no longer exist.Brady’s case is just the most brazen, the one with a public face. You almost have to admire the transparency. Brady is not feigning independence. He’s a part-owner and key decision maker for one franchise, and then he covers the other 31 teams on Sundays.But everything about it feelsoff.And that’s not on Brady. He hasn’tbroken any rules. It would be foolish of the Raiders to have the greatest quarterback of all time in their organization and not have him involved in gameplanning. The fault lies with the NFL. How does the league allow the most visible show in its portfolio, America’s Game of the Week, to employ someone who sits in production meetings with opposing coaches and players, who strolls the sideline before kickoff, and then, a week later, sits in a booth with a coach’s headset on?A year ago, the NFL tied itself in knots to keep Brady’s analyst role and his Raiders ownership separate. The firewall has since collapsed. This offseason, the league relaxed its rules: Brady cannot physically enter another team’s facility until gameday, which mean he can’t attend team practices, but he can attend virtual production calls, asking coaches and players questions in the run-up to broadcasts.The goal was for Fox to tighten up Brady’s broadcasting chops – and stop the league frombeing embarrassedduring one of its most-watched games of the week. But when Brady asks questions in those meetings, who is listening to the reply? Brady the broadcaster or Brady the Raiders owner? Can he separate the two?Brady has already called the Commanders and Giants game, and both of those teams are on the Raiders’ schedule. Ditto for the Chiefs and Eagles, the game Brady called in week two. This week, he will be on the call for Bears-Cowboys. Brady’s Raiders will play the Bears a week later.Production meetings are largely a nothing burger. Coaches do not reveal their gameplan. They guard any strategic insight or injury update like a state secret. There is probably nothing Brady can take from those meetings that he cannot figure out from publicly available data or from studying the two teams on his own.But having Brady toggle between roles still leaves doubt about which hat he’s wearing at any given time. Is the Fox audience receiving his authentic views, or a sanitized version from an owner who has his eye on a future signing or hiring? Last year, Brady was unable to criticize officials while working for Fox due to theleague’s policy for team owners.This wouldn’t be a big deal if Tom Brady were not Tom Brady.But he is. There is an idolatry around Brady within the NFL that doesn’t exist for his co-workers. Peoplewantto speak to Brady, to tap into his fountain of knowledge and connect with the sport’s most relentless champion. Maybe a sideline chat is a player’s one chance to talk to the man who has won seven Super Bowls.Brady isn’t able to attend Friday practices, where broadcasters see the real inner workings of a team. But he can build connections in the week leading up to a game and chop it up with players or coaches on the field before he steps into the announcer’s booth. He is also in charge of hiring and firing for one of the 32 teams. Last season, he called a playoff game featuring the Lions while interviewing both Detroit coordinators for his own vacant head coaching job. If Brady is talking to a player or coach under his guise as aFoxbroadcaster, those people are aware he could one day offer them a job.View image in fullscreenTom Brady has remained omnipresent after his playing retirement.Photograph: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for REFORM AlliancePerhaps nothing comes from those meetings except filler to help pad out a three-hour blowout. But, surely, Brady, an uber-competitor and football savant, can gathersomedetail. Maybe it’s the body language of a coach or an impending free agent. Maybe there’s an injury insight that’s not yet available to the public.And here’s the kicker: if Bradydidn’tnotice anything, didn’t file it away to use later, he wouldn’t be doing his job. Not as a Fox analyst, taking the audience inside the game; not as a Raiders owner, trying to build a champion. Those two incentives clash in a way no league should tolerate.Sure, if you’re telling Brady details about your team, that’s on you. But what if you’re a soon-to-be free agent who sees the Raiders oozing with cap space? What if you’re a young coach who likes the idea of being Vegas’ defensive coordinator? Maybe the halo effect of Brady gets you to reveal something in a five-minute conversation you wouldn’t with, say, Cris Collinsworth. It’s a tightrope that teams and players shouldn’t have to walk.Collinsworth, the lead analyst for NBC, also has a business relationship with all 32 franchises as the owner ofPro Football Focus. But there are no competing interests between his off-camera and on-camera work. He doesn’t have a stake in a franchise, sit on a team’s headset, or make personnel decisions. He owns a data and software company that sells licenses to any organization that is happy to buy. The boundaries – and any perceived conflicts – are clear. His work with PFF amplifieshis work for NBC.With Brady, it’s murkier. It would be one thing if Brady were a silent shareholder, a passive partner that the Raiders rolled out to seal commercial deals. But his fingerprints are all over the franchise.“Tom is the one now to take this organization into the future, on the football side, and maybe get my failures into successes,” Mark Davissaid in September.Brady led the committee that hired new general manager John Spytek, a former college teammate who also worked with Brady in Tampa when the pair won a Super Bowl. Brady also interviewed head coaching candidates for the Raiders opening, ultimately settling on Pete Carroll. That’s not absentee ownership. So when Brady slips on the headset in the Raiders’ booth, he is not an angel investor. He is, in the clearest possible sense, part of the football operation. Pretending otherwise requires the kind of willful ignorance only Roger Goodell can muster.Even if nothing comes from Brady’s side-hustle with Fox that helps the Raiders, the perception matters as much as the substance. It is Brady seeming like he is above the rules, and the fracturing of fan trust at a time when trust is the league’s chief commodity.That truest has eroded as gambling has become the NFL’s central nervous system. Betting isn’t just an addendum to the action any more; it sometimes appears it has become the sole function of games. It’s everywhere: pre-game, mid-game, in your face, on your feed, on the broadcast ticker, blasted through RedZone, radiating through every commercial break. The league has recognized that the embrace of gambling requires a level of trust from fans, which is why suspensions for players or coaches caught gambling onothersportshave been so severe.Thinking the NFL is scripted is something only your wacky cousin brings up at Thanksgiving. But there is a reason thememe has come to life, why officiating decisions are scrutinized and why Brady’s firewall matters. Once trust cracks – when fans begin to suspect that insider access might tilt competition – the whole edifice wobbles.Allowing Brady to take on both roles is about short-term convenience. The NFL wants to stay in the Brady business, to leverage his cachet and the attention he draws into dollars. When he talks, people listen. Where he goes, others follow. It’s why Fox ispaying him $325mand Saudi Arabia is paying him a reported $75mto play flag football.Being the Goat has its privileges. But calling games while running a franchise shouldn’t be one of them.Explore more on these topicsTom BradyNFLLas Vegas RaidersUS sportsFoxUS television industryTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their bail has been set at €20,000 each (£17,400). The fourth, who is understood to be Asencio, is accused of two offences against privacy and has had his bail set at €15,000.The decision to proceed to trial was announced by the judicial authorities on Thursday. It follows a police and judicial investigation into the case, which is alleged to have involved two women, aged 18 and 16, and to have happened in a private area of a beach club on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria on 15 June 2023.Prosecutors are reported to be seeking a sentence of two years and six months for Asencio, and sentences of four years and seven months for the other three, who have been named in the media as Asencio’s former colleagues Andrés García, Ferran Ruiz and Juan Rodríguez. One of the alleged victims has included all four of the defendants in her accusations, while the other has excluded Asencio from her complaint.In September 2023,three unnamed Real Madrid reserve players were arrestedin connection with the alleged incident and were released after the data on their mobile phones was seized.In comments released after the judge concluded a pre-trial investigation, Asencio said he had “never taken part in any behaviour that has threatened any woman’s sexual freedom, much less that of a minor”. He said he had not been involved in recording or distributing the videos, and had only “briefly seen the content”. The player, who is alleged to have shown one of the videos to a friend, also stressed the importance of the presumption of innocence.Police said the case had followed a complaint filed by the mother of a 16-year-old girl in the Canary islands regarding an alleged recording of sexual relations. They added that while the girl maintained the relations were consensual, the recording had been made without her consent and that she had recently become aware of it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Max Verstappen won the race but McLaren’s decisionto have Piastri return second place to Norris, after the British driver lost the position due to a slow pit stop caused by a faulty wheel gun, was contentious.Lando Norris defends team orders after McLaren hand him Oscar Piastri’s placeRead moreWith Norris claiming second place he gained three points on his teammate in the championship standings, narrowing the gap to 31 points. Many fans were aggrieved at the perceived manipulation of the result and the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, warned that the team’s use of team orders in an effort to be as fair as possible to both drivers risked setting precedents that would become increasingly hard to manage in the title run-in.Speaking before this weekend’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Piastri was confident that ultimately it would be the drivers, not the team, that decided the title fight. “I do think we have enough freedom to control our own destiny in the championship,” Piastri said. “Naturally there have been thoughts, we have had good discussions with the team. We have clarified a lot of things, we know how we will go racing going forwards.”When asked to move over at Monza the Australian had questioned the call, noting on the team radio: “We said that a slow pit-stop was part of racing, so I don’t really get what changed here”. In Baku he said he stuck by his words but went on to explain that the slow stop had not been the sole rationale behind McLaren’s actions.“That is a decision we’ve made, that a slow pit stop is a part of racing,” he said. “In the car, the context wasn’t there about what else had happened in terms of the pit stop sequencing.“There was another factor outside of the slow pit stop, being the order we pitted in. That was a contributing factor to why we swapped. We can’t plan for every scenario but we are very aligned and I respect the team’s decisions and trust they will do their best to make the right one.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris in his McLaren during the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Norris finished second after his team ordered him and Piastri to swap places.Photograph: Jay Hirano/ShutterstockNorris said he too was confident the team would not play a significant role in the title battle. “We both agreed with it after and accepted that’s what we agree as a team,” he said. “The team try and keep things fair between us but there’s not been many things where they’ve had to actually get involved and do anything to help one or the other.”Wolff, who managed what became a bitter and acrimonious fight between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes, had said he believed McLaren were setting up a potentially incendiary situation. “You set a precedent that is very difficult to undo,” he said after Monza. “What if the team makes another mistake and it’s not a pit stop. Do you switch them around?”Many fans were equally displeased, with Norris receiving some booing on the podium at Monza, but Piastri was happy the team had made an acceptable call.“If we had done the opposite thing, then you’d have the opposite half of the fans saying that that was wrong and vice versa,” he said, “So ultimately there’s no correct decision. Am I surprised [by the backlash]? Not really. I guess it’s a big moment from the race and I feel like a lot of fans are quite quick to jump on things that are deemed controversial.”McLaren go into the race with the chance of sealing their second consecutive constructors’ championship and their 10th in total, with a record of the earliest point in a season, with seven races still remaining. They lead Ferrari in second by 337 points and will take the title if they outscore them by nine points and are not outscored by Mercedes by 12 points or Red Bull by 33 points.Explore more on these topicsOscar PiastriFormula OneLando NorrisAustralia sportMcLarenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

She always wants to add bits to her game.”United had come into the second leg at Leigh Sports Village trailing 1-0 on aggregate after a bizarre episode in the first leg in Bergen, when they somehowlost several of the bootsin transit and were forced to hastily purchase new ones, and succumbed to a late Brann goal against the run of play. They have still not located the missing boots but certainly rediscovered their form in front of goal as they made a quick start.The hosts capitalised on sloppy Brann defending to feed Terland and she lashed home the opening goal inside nine minutes with a ­ruthless first-time strike. She doubled the lead on the night and nudged United ahead on aggregate when she headed into the top corner from a difficult angle soon afterwards.With Jess Park in a lively mood and the full-backs Anna Sandberg and Jayde Riviere in strong form, the home side dominated the game and created plenty of first-half chances without adding further goals. Just as the visitors began to slowly get back into the contest and enjoy some territory inside the Manchester United half after the break, Terland clinched the tie on the counterattack as she combined with Melvine Malard and then slotted in a low finish.That took the confident Norway striker’s tally up to seven goals in four European games this term, and her eighth in all competitions, and it means Brann – with the former Crystal Palace manager Leif Smerud in charge – drop into the new secondary women’s European competition, the Europa Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The primary note of concern for Skinner’s team came when Riviere, one of their best performers so far this term, had to be withdrawn, the Canada right-back hobbling off with about 12 minutes remaining. By then, the English side were coasting through and their supporters were chanting “we’re all going on a European tour”.United will learn their opponents in Friday’s 11am draw ceremony and Skinner added confidently: “We’ve got to go in there and not just make up the numbers. We have to be excited by the opportunity. Whatever the draw is, I hope any teams that get us see they actually didn’t really want to play Manchester United.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champion's LeagueManchester United WomenWomen's footballBrann womennewsShareReuse this content"

Kerkez was booked for diving and was lucky to avoid a second yellow after fouling Jaidon Anthony before being substituted for Andy Robertson after 38 minutes at Turf Moor. Surely Slot will not risk a similar performance in the cauldron of the Merseyside derby, especially with such a dependable option in Robertson and the tricky Iliman Ndiaye on the right wing for Everton? “It’s a massive jump [playing for Liverpool],” said the Scot as he came to the defence of Kerkez this week. “I came from Hull City, he’s come from Bournemouth, and it’s probably quite similar. He will be the starting left-back for Liverpool in the future and it’s up to me to push him this season and help him improve.” Kerkez is lucky to have such an experienced mentor, but may face a wait to get back into Slot’s starting XI after Robertson startedagainst Atlético Madridin midweek.Michael ButlerLiverpool v Everton, 12.30pm (all timesBST)2Fresh direction for Brighton with AytoIt has been a busy week on the south coast. The former Arsenal interim sporting director Jason Ayto was confirmed as David Weir’s successor on Monday after the Scot’s surprise departure, having spent seven years at Brighton. Ayto is credited with playing a major role in bringing Martín Zubimendi to north London after stepping in to replace Edu last year, with the Brighton owner, Tony Bloom, hoping the 40-year-old’s arrival will give the club “new leadership and direction”. He is expected to attend Saturday’s meeting with Tottenham at the Amex as Fabian Hürzeler – who marked his 50th game in charge of Brighton in the2-1 defeatto Bournemouth last weekend – attempts to get their season back on track.Ed AaronsBrighton v Tottenham, Saturday 3pm3Will Postecoglou favour Wood or Jesus?Chris Wood will have surely cursed the sacking of Nuno Espírito Santo at Nottingham Forest. The New Zealander played the best football of his career under the Portuguese manager, who made the striker the focal point of his attack. It would be a brave move for Ange Postecoglou to drop Wood against Burnley, one of the 33-year-old’s former sides, but Forest’s new manager typically favours a more mobile forward, capable of an aggressive press. Wood was absent as Forestcrashed out of the Carabao Cup at Swanseabut Postecoglou will at least have taken heart from the two goals scored by the Brazilian striker Igor Jesus, a summer arrival, before Forest collapsed to defeat. Despite his excellent record for Forest, Wood is now under pressure to perform in a tactical system that might not be suited to his needs.MBBurnley vNottingham Forest, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenIgor Jesus, who played for Botafogo at the Club World Cup, bagged two goals for Forest against Swansea in midweek.Photograph: Ritchie Sumpter/Nottingham Forest FC/Getty Images4Dissent and demoralisation at West HamIt remains to be seen how many West Ham fans turn up to protest against the club’s deeply unpopular board before Saturday afternoon’s home game against Crystal Palace. However big the demonstration is, though, there is no doubt that supporters have turned. West Ham have not won at home since February and it could get ugly if Palace, who have not lost at the London Stadium since 2018, go ahead. The pressure is on. Graham Potter has to find a way to lift his side afterlast weekend’s defeat to Spurs. Unity is a long way off but the organisers of the protesters want West Ham fans to stick with the team.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham vCrystal Palace, Saturday 3pm5Patience with Amorim running outA total of 31 points from 31 league games in charge means Ruben Amorim’sManchester Unitedtenure is sinking fast. To stop floundering the head coach needs wins; executive patience will soon expire, make no mistake. Three points against a Chelsea team who arrive as Club World Cup champions and undefeated in the league is a difficult ask but if the match is lost then United will have to beat Brentford and Sunderland in the next two outings. After those two matches is the trip to Liverpool, on 19 October, which looks ominous.Jamie JacksonManchester United vChelsea, Saturday 5.30pmView image in fullscreenRuben Amorim (centre) and Manchester United face another tough fixture against Chelsea this weekend.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock6Wolves opt for stability and PereiraWolves believe this season will be different. This time last year Gary O’Neil was weeks into a new four-year contract but wassacked four months later. Now Wolves are preparing to reward Vítor Pereira with a new three-year deal despite a pointless start to the campaign. Wolves, who host Leeds on Saturday, are bottom of the table after losing their opening four league matches. Pereira transformed Wolves last season, in effect leading them to safety with a couple of months to spare, and the chairman, Jeff Shi, believes stability will help the club prosper again. “We need a coach to stay here and help us for a long time,“ Shi said in a recent interview. “Every coach needs time for the jigsaw to be made.”Ben FisherWolves v Leeds, Saturday 3pmskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few managers are more adept than Marco Silva at making decisive substitutions. Rodrigo Muniz and Emile Smith Rowe have stepped off the bench to score late equalisersagainst BrightonandManchester Unitedrespectively this season and Kevin, the new signing from Shakhtar Donetsk, impressed after coming on for his debut during last week’slate win over Leeds. Brentford, then, will be wary of Silva’s wiles when they make the short trip to Craven Cottage on Saturday evening. They will remember being stung in this fixture last season, losing a 1-0 lead after Harry Wilson came onto score twice in stoppage-time. As if that was not bad enough Fulham did it again in the reverse fixture, Tom Cairney and Wilson coming on in the second halfto turn a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 lead. Brentford will know not to take anything for granted.JSFulham vBrentford, Saturday 8pm8Handling Woltemade is a tall orderThree-quarters of Bournemouth’s first-choice defence departed the club this summer in Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi but, after three wins from four, the Cherries seem stronger than ever. The ease with which the 18-year-old centre-back Veljko Milosavljevic has slotted in alongside his partner Marcos Senesi has been striking; the new signing signed for the club on deadline day and made only 27 first-team appearances for Red Star Belgrade before his £13m move to the Premier League. Milosavljevic marshalled Danny Welbeck and Stefanos Tzimas expertly in the win against Brighton but if the Serbian retains his place ahead of another of Bournemouth’s new additions, Bafodé Diakité, he faces a different prospect altogether in Nick Woltemade. The 6ft 6in Newcastle striker showedagainst Wolveshe is both an aerial threat and a nimble forward able to link the play, somewhere between a classic No 9 and a second striker. Containing the big German will be key in deciding if Bournemouth continue their excellent start.MBBournemouth v Newcastle, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenNick Woltemade scored on his Newcastle debut against Wolves.Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock9Roefs’ excellence bars Villa’s pathWill Sunday’s trip to the Stadium of Light prove to be the start of a positive reset forAston Villa? Or might it signal the beginning of the biggest crisis of Unai Emery’s tenure at the club? Emery’s cause would be aided appreciably if his side could score a first league goal of the season. The only problem is that Sunderland have collected seven points from their opening four league games and possess the outstanding Robin Roefs in goal. They say there are no “steals” in the European transfer market any more but the 22-year-old cost a modest initial £9m, potentially rising to £11.5m, when Sunderland signed him from NEC Nijmegen this summer. On the convincing evidence of his first four games it is no surprise that a keeper who has played for the Netherlands at every junior level and starred for the under-21s in the recent European Championships has now graduated to the Dutch senior squad.Louise TaylorSunderland v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm10Arteta to stick with impressive Mosquera?The praise has been flooding in for Cristhian Mosquera after his impressive performance against Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday night. “He’s still so young,” said Jurriën Timber afterArsenal’s 2-0 win. “It looks so easy for him, winning his duels and on the ball as well. It’s great to have him next to me, and he has a bright future as well.” Signed from Valencia for an initial £13m, the Spain Under-21 international looks like one of best value summer deals having filled in admirably for the injured William Saliba. The Frenchman has been back in training this week after limping off against Liverpool with an ankle injury before the international break. The question is whether Mikel Arteta will bring Saliba back or stick with Mosquera for the meeting with Manchester City.EAArsenal vManchester City, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool45122Arsenal4893Tottenham Hotspur4794AFC Bournemouth4195Chelsea4686Everton4277Sunderland4278Man City4469Crystal Palace43610Newcastle40511Fulham4-1512Brentford4-2413Brighton4-2414Man Utd4-3415Nottm Forest4-4416Leeds4-5417Burnley4-3318West Ham4-7319Aston Villa4-4220Wolverhampton4-70Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolEvertonBrighton & Hove AlbionBurnleyTottenham HotspurNottingham ForestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In other words, he has seen Bob Mortimer’s slew of social media posts. “YOU BEAUTY!!” the Middlesbrough-born comedian posted to his millions of followers in the minutes after the transfer deadline passed this month, accompanied by a picture of Hackney, who rejected a move to Championship rivals Ipswich earlier in the window. “One of my family told me so I looked at his profile and it was just a photo of me,” the 23-year-old says, laughing. “‘Oh my God. No way.’ It was funny.”That came a few days after Mortimer, part of Boro’s under-16s in the 70s, stressed he could not contemplate a Boro team without Hackney. The midfielder, who joined Middlesbrough at eight years old after being spotted playing for his home town team Redcar Town, is central to the club’s hopes of returning to the Premier League after nine seasons away. He has racked up more minutes than any other Boro player last campaign and played all but seven minutes of this one. He is living his dream. “Everyone in my family supports Middlesbrough,” Hackney says. “My dad used to go to all the games when he was younger and I think back then his excuse to go to the games was to take me as well. I loved it.”The first Boro game Hackney remembers attending was Manchester United’s visit in 2008, when Cristiano Ronaldo converted the former Boro manager Michael Carrick’s cross to open the scoring, and Wayne Rooney equalised after an Afonso Alves double. A 13-year-old Hackney was in the stands in 2015-16, the season Boro last celebrated promotion to the Premier League. “I really liked Gastón Ramírez. He was probably my favourite player at the time, because of the way he carried the ball. It was always [Adam] Clayton and [Grant] Leadbitter and then him in front.”View image in fullscreen‘My dad used to go to all the games when he was younger and I think back then his excuse to go to the games was to take me.’ Hayden Hackney has become a mainstay at the club he grew up supporting.Photograph: Tom Banks/Tom Banks/MiddlesbroughHackney has heard the success stories of yesteryear and wants to experience his own. After an unbeaten start, Boro are top before hosting West Brom on Friday. “Promotion has always been the aim ever since I broke into the team,” he says. That was 2022-23, when Carrick’s Boro came unstuck against Coventry in the playoff semi-finals. “That year we were pretty close and ever since then it has been the focus to try and get back up.”Things have snowballed since Hackney made his league debut at the start of that season, when the academy manager, Craig Liddle, and the then interim manager, Leo Percovich, who remains a coach, parachuted him into the team with the club in the relegation zone. “I was like: ‘Right, I need to make sure I impress because this isthechance. I was trying to contain my nerves and at the same time show what I can do. Sometimes I thought: ‘Is it going to happen? Will I have to go somewhere else and maybe go from there?’ I was really grateful to be given the opportunity and managed to take it.”For the English Football League’s youth development week, he is a shining example, at a club where the captain, Dael Fry, and goalkeeper Sol Brynn also progressed via the academy. It has been a fruitful few months for Hackney given he was part of the England squad that retained the Under-21 European Championship in Slovakia in June; 19 of the 23 had experience of playing in the EFL, with nine representing clubs in the league last season. His winner’s medal, he says, has pride of place in his living room.Six games across three weeks meant plenty of downtime. “We had a games room and everyone was always together in there. There was a golf simulator … we couldn’t use it too close to matches, but we had a good group: Charlie Cresswell, Archie Gray, Elliot Anderson. Cresswell thought he was Tiger Woods … he had a glove on and everything.”It suddenly feels like a long time since a 19-year-old Hackney joined Scunthorpe on loan for 2021-22, where he tasted victory twice in 31 matches as they were relegated to non-league. Scunthorpe won four of 51 matches that season. What was the hardest thing about that period? “Well, apart from trying to get a result … I like to get the ball on the floor and make things happen and a lot of the time the ball was in the air so that side of my game really improved. I had to get on the second balls, because that, really, was the only time I had the ball at my feet. So if I could try and get on the second balls and create something from there, that was my chance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you lose in the under-21s, it doesn’t mean that much, but winning and losing there meant something to everyone. It showed me that you don’t get anything given, you’ve got to work. I’m so glad that I did go on loan and that season was probably the most I’ve learned in my career.”Aside from a new head coach in the former Luton manager Rob Edwards, plus a sprinkling of new faces, including the Manchester City loanee Sverre Nypan, what is different about this Boro incarnation? “We’re playing with five at the back, wing-backs, so we’ve got an extra body in defence. When we lose the ball, I think we’re a bit more secure on transitions. The manager’s main focus when he came in was getting things right off the ball. He constantly says: ‘When you get the ball, it’s your time to show what you can do.’”Does their north-east rivals Sunderland and Newcastle, as well as Leeds, being in the Premier League drive him to return Boro to the top flight? Hackney pauses but cannot conceal his feelings. “Yeah, I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t; it does give you that extra motivation,” he says. Mortimer was not the only one delighted Hackney stayed put. “I’m here and I want to win,” he says. “We’ll see where that takes us and, hopefully, this is our year.”Explore more on these topicsMiddlesbroughChampionshipinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Although there is a belief that Potter’s immediate future does not hinge on the outcome of Saturday’s home game against Crystal Palace, the wider picture is less than encouraging for the former Chelsea manager.Pain for Postecoglou as Swansea stun Nottingham Forest with late turnaroundRead moreWest Ham are 18th in the Premier League after losing four of their first five games and there is growing alarm at board level. David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, is not ready to make a change yet but contingency plans are being put in place.Bilic, who managed West Ham between 2015 and 2017, will have a chance of returning if Potter departs. The former Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espírito Santo is also under consideration. Sean Dyche, the former Everton manager, has been linked, too.It remains to be seen whether Nuno is open to taking on a new role so soon after beingsacked by Forest. The former Wolves manager left the City Ground last week after a breakdown in his relationship with the owner, Evangelos Marinakis. Forest qualified for Europe under Nuno last season.An issue for West Ham as they ponder how long to give Potter is whether there are enough suitable managers on the market. Sullivan has always preferred to hire unemployed coaches. One solution could be to turn to Bilic and ask the Croat to step in on a short-term deal.Bilic’s connection to West Ham goes back to his days as a player. The former defender’s first season as the manager was the club’s last at Upton Park, and he led them to seventh, with Dimitri Payet excelling, and qualified for the Europa League playoffs.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The job became more challenging after West Ham moved to the London Stadium. They struggled in their new home and Bilic’s second season turned into a fight against relegation. He held on to his job before being fired and replaced by David Moyes at the start of his third season. Bilic does not hold a grudge towards West Ham about being sacked and would be open to returning.Bilic, whose most recent role was in Saudi Arabia, almost joined West Ham on an interim basis during the 2022-23 season. Moyes retained his job, though, and won the Conference League. Bilic guided Croatia to the quarter-finals of Euro 2008 and secured promotion to the Premier League with West Brom in 2020.West Ham have struggled since parting company with Moyes and replacing the Scot with Julen Lopetegui last year. Potter came in for the Spaniard last January but has lost 13 of his 24 games. West Ham fear they are headed for a relegation battle and are facing anti-board protests from unhappy supporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Someone has been shouting at Diego Simeone! Famously thin-skinned and a bastion of all that is right and pure in this world, the Atlético Madrid manager was sent off on Wednesday night at Anfield after reacting to a fan’s jibes from behind the dugout, followingLiverpool’s latest Slottage-time winnerin their Bigger Cup tie.It is important to clarify that Football Daily does not endorse shouting in the workplace – not now,recent UK employment tribunal ruling!– and that the red card given to him does seem a little harsh considering the manager didn’t appear to do much wrong other than approach the Liverpool fan who was aiming verbal missives in his general direction. We can’t be sure about exactly what was said – and TNT Sport pundit Steve McManaman did point out afterwards that Simeone “doesn’t speak English anyway, so he’s done well to understand scouse” – but the idea of the Argentinian being offended by a bit of effing and jeffing does seem mildly amusing, akin to a pantomime villain being upset at “all the booing”, or Anne Robinson complaining to producers that the Weakest Link contestants had been talking behind her back. Oh, Anne!“We are in a place where we don’t have a right to reply or react and it is never good when we react as managers,”sighed the famously passive Simeone, who famously cupped his genitals in celebrating an Atléti goal against Juventus in 2020. “When we are getting insulted all the game, when they scored the third goal, he turned round and insulted me. I am a person, I am human. I am not going to get into the exact nature of the insults. I don’t want to get involved in that discussion. I have got to stay in my place. I know what went on behind the manager’s bench. I can’t solve society’s problems in one press conference. I have to live with it.”Simeone is also going to have to live with a one-match ban after his red card, which means he is poised to miss Atlético’s next Bigger Cup match, against Eintracht Frankfurt, but back on the touchline for another English adventure, to Arsenal on 21 October. Thank goodness Gunnersaurus isn’t much of a talker, or we might have another incident on our hands.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Barry Glendenning from 8pm BST for hot Bigger Cup minute-by-minute coverage of Newcastle 1-2 Barcelona, while Simon Burnton will be on deck for Manchester City 2-1 Napoli.QUOTE OF THE DAY13 September:“It won’t be months, it won’t be weeks … it will be Wednesday” – new Nottingham Forest boss Ange Postecoglou expects things to turn around swiftly in the wake of an opening 3-0 defeat at Arsenal.17 September:“I sensed the players thought it was going to happen automatically. We should have been a lot more prepared for what was going to come and handled it a lot better” – Wednesday comes too soon as Forest concede twice in added time, throwing away a 2-0 lead at Swansea andslumping out of the Milk Cup.View image in fullscreenSwansea get their shocked celebrations on.Photograph: David Davies/PAFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSWhile admiring John Waugh’s ‘more is more’ celebration of the extended Bigger Cup format (yesterday’s Football Daily letters), he evoked Albert Camus as justification for his case. As we all know, Camus owed everything he knew about morality and the obligations of men to football, but, whereas life may be meaningless, his love of his team RUA was so deep that when he went to Paris he went to watch Racing Club, because they wore the same kit as RUA, so he could pretend to still be watching his favourite team. ‘After all,’ he wrote (in French), ‘that’s why I loved my team so much – for the joy of victories, so wonderful when paired with the fatigue that follows effort, but also for that stupid urge to cry on nights of defeat.’ Were Algeria still French and RUA playing in Bigger Cup, and that Camus had been wearing a seatbelt on that fateful drive, and reached the ripe old age of 112 he would be have been ecstatic to watch them play against any old chaff they were drawn against” – Guy Cooper.Has it occurred to our learned friend that Football Daily might be looking at the bigger picture (doubtful, I know)? Qarabag may be minnows in Bigger Cup, but they’ve won 11 of their past 12 domestic league titles because of the money they make in European competitions. I wonder how many fans find it fun watching non-Qarabag teams compete in the Azerbaijan Premier League? Contrary to John’s argument, I believe clubs having a chance of actually winning a competition would increase fan engagement and make the whole sport more appealing. Maybe a better idea than just cramming more teams into European competitions is to actually have fewer teams competing in them, but have Uefa distribute more money across those weaker leagues so teams are better able to compete?” – Thabo Caves.What pleasure to read a reference to Larkin (yesterday’s letters) on a day when I myself had spent a little while reading part of an anthology of the great poet’s works. Noble Francis, and others, who may have found Larkin’s sometimes fruity language a little coarse for their sensibilities might have enjoyed attempts to sanitise literature that included: ‘They tuck you up your mum and dad’” – Michael Lloyd.Send letters tothe.boss@theguardian.com.

We did well and we tried to control the game in spells but it’s very difficult to play against this team and I’m really pleased we managed to win.”Flick, who regards Rashford as more of a No 9 than a left-sided forward or winger, appeared equally delighted with his loanee. “He showed us he’s a fantastic player,” he said. “We always see this from Rashford in training and we saw it on the pitch today.“I’m happy to have him and those two goals will help Marcus get to the next step.

But good teams find a way, and after Arthur Mourgue’s long-range try put Hull KR back in front, May sealed it.“It obviously got worrying towards the back end but I was comfortable,” Peters said. “We’ve not been shy about saying we want to go after trophies. There’s been two on offer and we’ve won two … but there’s one to go.” That is the Grand Final, with Hull KR now hosting the lowest-ranked winner from next weekend in a bid to reach Old Trafford again.They overcame a sluggish start here to lead 16-6 with a try from May and two from Noah Booth. At that stage, you felt they would close it out with minimal fuss. However, Warrington, whose season was over weeks ago, deserve immense credit for silencing a Craven Park crowd who came for a party but were left clinging to the edges of their seats.First, Sam Stone collected a Ewan Irwin kick before two tries in six minutes courtesy of Adam Holroyd and Josh Thewlis turned the game on its head. Suddenly, Warrington led 20-16 and a huge upset was possible. The loudest cheers probably came across the Pennines from Wigan, who suddenly thought they could claim top with a big win over Leeds on Friday.But ultimately, the Robins held their nerve when it mattered as Mourgue broke free to put them back ahead, before May’s second clinched victory and sparked jubilant scenes.

But she dusted off the cobwebs in qualifying comfortably for Friday’s semi-finals in 1min 59.79sec. “I don’t like the rounds,” she said. “They feel awful.

I know what that 1:42 low pace feels like, even if it gets pushed down to 1:41 I should be comfortable sticking with it.”He added: “I’ve been running fast-paced races in the Diamond League all year up with these lads, so there’s no reason that I shouldn’t be up with them in this final.”Two Britons made Friday’s final of the women’s 200m, with Amy Hunt running a personal best of 22.08 to finish as the third fastest qualifier.

Tackle football, notorious for eating the young, is recast as a genuine meat grinder for Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers) – a generational college quarterback touted as an heir apparent to Marlon Wayans’s Isaiah White, the Tom Brady of this world. But when a trippy, blunt force head injury endangers Cameron’s professional aspirations and multimillion-dollar payday, he agrees to train and rehab at Isaiah’s desert-based cement compound – a haunted house of vice and duplicity that threatens to swallow Cameron whole.One Battle After Another review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caperRead moreHim is not a subtle critique of America’s pastime. It opens with Isaiah breaking his leg on a championship-winning drive, and young Cameron taking in the gruesome injury from his living room floor while his father drills the mantra “no guts, no glory” into his psyche. It reintroduces football, quite rightly, as averitable meat marketwhere players are poked, prodded and scrutinized like chattel. Director Justin Tipping even switches to X-ray vision to bring out the underlying damage that can result fromfootball’s incessant collisions, one of many stylish visual touches.But where a sports movie like F1 can get away with stretching the truth for US audiences who aren’t likely to know the difference, Him makes suspending disbelief a staggering struggle. Because of football’s seemingly intractable position at the center of American life, the viewers who come to this film are more than likely already acutely aware of thesingular privilege and leveragethat quarterbacks enjoy in the game and, thus, likely to call bullshit on the idea of a prospect of Cameron’s caliber having to jump through the same physical challenges as a middling wide receiver or defensive lineman. Another terrible stretch is Wayans playing a fading gridiron legend at the dear age of 53, much less one who can afford a desert compound – more of a luxury for Major League Baseball, where contracts arefully guaranteed.Him makes a big deal of Cameron showcasing his abilities at a scouting combine, a once-important job interview that top quarterbacks routinely blow off now. Cameron’s physical fitness becomes something to obsess over even as standout NFL QBs rockdad bods. (Brady’sshirtless combine photo, more than 25 years old now, is famously disappointing.) Cameron and Isaiah are offered up as exceptional football players without a practical demonstration for a setup or a payoff. Isaiah is established as a mentor to Cameron even though a pro QB fighting against time to keep his job wouldneverassume that role. Recall: job replacement training was a central point of conflict in Any Given Sunday, a film that manages to successfully relate the horrors of professional football without much distortion.Without firm grounding in reality, Him can only skid, hopelessly, into the realm of kabuki theater and make a muddle of its football critique. It’s too bad because the film has some interesting things to say about the game – specifically, its conflation of white Christian values and American jingoism. In the real world, players are coached to order their lives in a three-pile stack: God, family and football. But in Him, Isaiah puts football above the divine and talks quite soberly about how “He died for us so I play for Him.” The pro team in question here is called the Saviors, and Isaiah’s picture is propped up among young Cameron’s football trophies like a holy card among votive candles – a true shrine.Tipping, one of three writers on the film, uses the concept of the sports Goat, the acronym for greatest of all time, to present football as a pagan religion, complete with blood sacraments and tangible sacrifices, while cutting back and forth from Christian symbols to occult imagery. One shot in particular, of Cameron at a Last Supper-style photoshoot in the Jesus position, prompted a handful of viewers at my Atlanta screening to walk out. You can just imagine God-fearing football fans – ostensibly, Him’s target audience – taking similar offense.The most memorable performances in Him come from the supporting cast. Tim Heidecker and Jim Jefferies shine as Cameron’s agent and Isaiah’s doctor, respectively, and the model Julia Fox is a pleasant surprise as Isaiah’s wife. But it’s not enough to negate Wayans’s hammier tics or stand up a story that would have anyone believe he ishim– itself a neologism for “the man”. What could have been a truly cutting takedown of the American football meat grinder just winds up playing to the very appetite for human carnage that fans can’t get enough of. No matter your view of Him, as a slasher or a sports film, it’s a fumble.Him is out in US cinemas on 19 September, in Australia on 2 October and in the UK on 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsJordan PeeleNFLUS sportsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Ricky Simms, the head of Pace Sports, said: “We did not negotiate this deal and no longer represent Fred Kerley.”The American sprinter, who won Olympic silver over 100m in Tokyo and bronze in Paris last year, has been provisionally suspended by theAthleticsIntegrity Unit for whereabouts failures. If found to have committed an anti-doping violation, Kerley will be given a minimum two-year ban from track and field. However, David Howman, the chairman of the AIU, suggested there could be further sanctions.“He is currently suspended so he is not a member of World Athletics,” said Howman. “We can’t say anything further about him until that case is concluded. But because he is suspended, he has no rights at all in relation to athletics.View image in fullscreenGreat Britain’s Ben Proud won silver in the men’s 50m freestyle at Paris 2024 but turned his back on mainstream swimming to join the Enhanced Games.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“What might happen in the future is for the future. That could include a future suspension process, for example.”Howman also questioned why anyone would want to watch the event, which is due to take place in Las Vegas next May. “I go back to when the Romans used to watch the Christians fighting the lions, and you’re always going to get an audience for something out of the ordinary,” he said. “So there may be an audience that would watch it, but I would like to ask each one of them as they went in: ‘Are you sure you would want to watch your kid doing this?’”Brett Clothier, the head of the AIU, also described the Enhanced Games as “grotesque” but insisted the organisation was more focused on policing legitimate sport than worrying about it. “I don’t want to give the Enhanced Games too much oxygen, quite frankly,” he said. “Our biggest concern is probably about the health of Fred Kerley and other athletes who sign up to it. It’s clearly sort of grotesque, and I think athletes are being used.”Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said he did not want to talk about Kerley but that the sport had significantly increased its prize money in recent years. “I’m not discussing the Enhanced Games,” Lord Coe said. “We’re in the championships here. We’re certainly not going down that rabbit hole.“But we’ve increased our revenues by about 38% in the last four years. And in the next four years we’re going to spend about $50m on prize money. I don’t want to sound like Gordon Brown, but I do want the athletes to benefit from the proceeds of growth.”Kerley, who has a personal 100m best of 9.76sec, said he was joining the games to try to become the fastest man who ever lived. As well as appearance fees, he will win a million US dollars if he surpasses Bolt’s time of 9.58.“The world record has always been the ultimate goal of my career,” Kerley said. “This now gives me the opportunity to dedicate all my energy to pushing my limits and becoming the fastest human to ever live.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Just for a minute or two, quickly enough to miss it, he broke free from the unrelenting positivity he appears to have shackled himself to in his year-long spell in charge of the United States men’s national team. For only a few moments, the Argentinian was clearly …como se dice… cranky.“People sometimes create debate and talk with no sense,” he said on the eve of the USA’s friendly against Japan. “If people want to talk about bullshit, they can talk about bullshit.“Sometimes people want to talk only to analyze the result and want to be negative,” Pochettino continued, responding to the swelling criticism of his call-ups and a slew of losses to the stronger opponents he faced when he had his much of his A-team available. “I think it’s a shame. We need to be positive because we need to be all together. Because the country deserves that we are all on one side trying to help to arrive to theWorld Cupin the best condition.”And then Pochettino caught himself and flashed his winsome smile.“Look, we started in October,” he said. “We needed not too much time. Normally, the process [of building a national team] starts to work after three, three-and-a-half years. In less than one year, the process is starting to work. Maybe not in results, but maybe tomorrow it starts to work in results. No worries, we have a plan. We have no worries. We have no worries about nothing.”Steely and strangely divisive, Michael Bradley’s playing career cut to the id of US soccer fandomRead moreThe comments rankled that day for their gaslight-y optimism, coming as they did in the wake of asloppy 2-0 loss to South Koreain which the Americans had looked badly disjointed again. But sure enough, the next day, the US finally got the longed-for result. They lookedconvincing and coherent at last, defeating Japan 2-0 when the final score could have fairly well been double that.Rather than gloat, Pochettino elaborated on his argument after the victory. There had been, he argued, a lot to do when he and his staff took over from Gregg Berhalter almost exactly a year earlier. “We didn’t arrive in a team that was performing,” Pochettino said. “We [didn’t] arrive and damage a team that was doing really well. I think that wasn’t the case.”Pochettino also pointed out that when he’d called in the longtime USMNT regulars for the Concacaf Nations League in March, as fans and pundits expected him to, it hadturned into a disaster. The Americans lost both their matches – to Panama and Canada – and looked entirely unbothered about the entire thing.The national team needed a reset. And that required new faces and fresh energy and tactical experiments. This, inevitably, invited criticism when winning games became subservient to trying things. And Pochettino expected a certain latitude to do as he saw fit.“Look, with all the information that we have … we take decisions … If all the people agreed with me in all the decisions, why I am here?” Pochettino said. He laughed, then repeated himself: “If I am doing all that you want and the people talk [about], what I am doing here?”With a week’s hindsight, and just under nine months until the USA’s World Cup opener in Inglewood, it’s clear Pochettino had a point.If the job was to call up the same old players, curate the same complacent culture, and play in the very same way, what did US Soccer need him for? Why hire one of the world’s most seasoned and admired coaches? Why not just hire some Berhalter-type from the American coaching ranks? There are plenty of them, after all. Hell, why not just retain Berhalter himself?There is a clear-eyed case to be made that, actually, despite the hand-wringing, everything is fine and dandy for the US. Pochettino has been without key players for every single international window of his tenure. And he has leveraged those absences into assets, room to build depth and internal competition, both things that were lacking under Berhalter. He handed opportunities and then offered experience to MLS players, at least a half dozen of whom – Diego Luna, Max Arfsten, Alex Freeman, Matt Freese, Jack McGlynn, Cristian Roldan – have emerged, or been rediscovered, as handy pieces for the World Cup roster.In the 3-4-2-1 system the US started against Japan, Pochettino found a formation that highlights his players’ best qualities and covers for deficiencies – against an opponent arrayed in similar fashion (albeit one that rested most of their first-choice players). During the run to the final of the summer’s Gold Cup, and in three of four halves in the September window, the Americans played with a hunger and tenacity that had been misplaced somewhere after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.If you care to look past results, lots has been achieved in the past year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Landon Donovan once made the point that the team’s success, or failure, at all three of the World Cups he played in came down to just a few bounces. That was also true of the fourth World Cup, in 2014, that heshouldhave been a part of.This was evident once again this past window, when Folarin Balogun, the Monaco striker beset by injuries for months, was finally back and flashed his class. Days later, Ricardo Pepi, the player pool’s other leading striker, scored a pair of goals for PSV in his first league start since December, owing to his own injury. Conversely, Daryl Dike, who might be somewhere on a crowded striker depth chart otherwise, is hurt yet again. Who will be healthy, and also happen to be in scoring form, come June? Will anyone?Will Weston McKennie be in one of his annual periods at Juventus where the club decides it has no more use for him? Or will it be one of those times when the club decides that, no, wait, actually, he’s totally essential and deserves a new contract? Will Gio Reynabe on his 101st or 102nd manager by then, and will it be one of the ones who plays him regularly?Pochettino has made the point several times that the Argentina team he started for at the 2002 World Cup hadn’t lost in more than 10 months before that tournament, winning 11 of 17 matches. And then they were knocked out in the group stage in Japan. South Korea, the other co-hosts of that tournamenthad won just three of 14 tune-up games, before going on perhapsthe most stunning run in modern World Cup history, reaching the semi-finals.World Cup 2026: how worried should the USMNT be as the tournament looms?Read moreAnd what about the US when they last hosted in 1994? The Americans had a three-month winless drought at the start of that year, including an alarming loss to Iceland. They won just a quarter of their games in the year before the World Cup started, and real doubts lingered about US head coach Bora Milutinović and his inscrutable methods.“Has he panned out? If you look at the win-loss record, the answer has to be no,” US Soccer general secretary Hank Steinbrecher said of Milutinović just days before the tournament kicked off. “If you look at where we were three years ago – stylistically, lack of competition, credibility – the answer has to be yes.” The Americans survived the group stage at that World Cup, far exceeding global expectations of them.While it’s hard to avoid measuring and comparing every step taken to the World Cup, when you’re automatically qualified, your buildup to the tournament doesn’t actually much matter. All that really counts, as Pochettino put it, is that you start winning “When the World Cup starts.”Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

Scientists now have answers, but they’re not what you thinkThe phenomenal response to an article we published on this question led to detailed cognitive research – and the findings have implications that go way beyond gamersKeith StuartThu 18 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 10.23 EDTShareFive years ago, on the verge of the first Covid lockdown, I wrote an article asking what seemed to be an extremely niche question:why do some people invert their controls when playing 3D games? A majority of players push down on the controller to make their onscreen character look down, and up to make them look up. But there is a sizeable minority who do the opposite, controlling their avatars like a pilot controls a plane, pulling back to go up. For most modern games, this requires going into the settings and reconfiguring the default controls. Why do they still persist?I thought a few hardcore gamers would be interested in the question. Instead, more than one million people read the article, and the ensuing debate caught the attention of Dr Jennifer Corbett (quoted in the original piece) and Dr Jaap Munneke, then based at the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London.At the time, the two were conducting research into vision science and cognitive neuroscience, but when the country locked down, they were no longer able to test volunteers in their laboratory. The question of controller inversion provided the perfect opportunity to study the neuroscience of human-computer interactions using remote subjects. Theyput out a call for gamerswilling to help research the reasons behind controller inversion and receivedmany hundreds of replies.View image in fullscreenMicrosoft Flight Simulator … many thought what they first played affected the way they configured their controls.Photograph: MicrosoftAnd it wasn’t just gamers who were interested. “Machinists, equipment operators, pilots, designers, surgeons – people from so many different backgrounds reached out,” says Corbett. “Because there were so many different answers, we realised we had a lot of scientific literature to review to design the best possible study. Readers’ responses turned this study into the first of its kind to try to figure out what actually are those factors that shape how users configure their controllers. Personal experiences, favourite games, different genres, age, consoles, which way you scroll with a mouse … all of these things could potentially be involved.”This month the duo published their findings in a paper entitled “Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments”. And the reason why some people invert their controls? It’s complicated.The process started with participants completing a survey about their backgrounds and gaming experiences. “Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not,” says Corbett. “Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback.”View image in fullscreenMental rotation … a subject being tested as part of controller inversion research.Photograph: Jen CorbettBut Corbett and Munneke,now based at MITand Northeastern University respectively, were certain that there would also be important cognitive components to the inversion question that could be measured only through behavioural responses. So they devised a questionnaire and a series of four experiments that participants would take part in while being instructed and observed via Zoom. As Corbett explains: “They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an ‘avatar’ object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical ‘Simon effect’ where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button. Then we used some machine-learning algorithms to help us sort through all this survey and experiment data and pick out what combination of all of these things best explained whether someone inverted.”What they discovered through the cognitive testing was that a lot of assumptions being made around controller preferences were wrong. “None of the reasons people gave us [for inverting controls] had anything to do with whether they actually inverted,” says Corbett. “It turns out the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and ​​overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks.” So does this mean non-inverters are better gamers? No, says Corbett. “Though they tended to be faster, they didn’t get the correct answer more than inverters who were actually slightly more accurate.”In short, gamersthinkthey are an inverter or a non-inverter because of how they were first exposed to game controls. Someone who played a lot of flight sims in the 1980s may have unconsciously taught themselves to invert and now they consider that their innate preference; alternatively a gamer who grew up in the 2000s, when non-inverted controls became prevalent may think they are naturally a non-inverter. However, cognitive tests suggest otherwise. It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space.Consequently, Corbett says that it may improve you as a gamer to try the controller setup you are currently not using. “Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot,” she says. “You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better. A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back.”Through this research, Corbett and Munneke have established that there are complex and often unconscious cognitive processes involved in how individuals use controllers, and that these may have important ramifications for not just game hardware but for any human-computer interfaces, from aircraft controls to surgical devices. They were able to design a framework for assessing how to best configure controls for any given individual and have now made that available via their research paper.View image in fullscreenLearning curve … Corbett and Munneke’s research could even have ramifications for surgeons.Photograph: Oksana Krasiuk/Alamy“This work opened our eyes to the huge potential that optimising inversion settings has for advancing human-machine teaming,” says Corbett. “So many technologies are pairing humans with AI and other machines to augment what we can do alone. Understanding how a given individual best performs with a certain setup (controller configuration, screen placement, whether they are trying to hit a target or avoid an obstacle) can allow for much smoother interactions between humans and machines in lots of scenarios from partnering with an AI player to defeat a boss, to preventing damage to delicate internal tissue while performing a complicated laparoscopic surgery.”So what started as an idle, slightly nerdy question has now become a published cognitive research paper. One scientific publication has already cited it and interview requests are pouring in from podcasts and Youtubers. As for my takeaway? “The most surprising finding for gamers [who don’t invert] is that they might perform better if they practised with an inverted control scheme,” says Corbett. “Maybe not, but given our findings, it’s definitely worth a shot because it could dramatically improve competitive game play!”Explore more on these topicsGamesNeurosciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Standing around under gun-metal skies watching soldiers isn’t many people’s idea of fun but world leaders are a different breed. No bit of pageantry and flattery goes unnoticed. So why not giveDonald Trumpthe full Disney treatment he craves? After all, it wasn’t as if he was going to be allowed to stray outside the Windsor Castle compound and it was better than making the king sit indoors and watch Fox News.But if Wednesday was the softening up – “You’re great, you’re the best, the world would stop without you. We’ve never done anything like this for anyone else” Thursday was very much the business end of the state visit. And the one moment of real danger for the US president andKeir Starmer. The Chequers press conference at which everything could go tits up. The one bit of the trip that wasn’t entirely scripted.You could see the anxiety in Starmer’s eyes as he and the Sunbed King entered the Great Hall in Chequers. A room of wood panels and countless mediocre portraits. The US press corps all stood and applauded. Seriously? The UK pack remained seated. Keir gave an anxious glance towards the phalanx of journalists. “Please don’t screw this up for me, guys. Just give me this one win.” The Donald looked unmoved. As so often, lost in his own world. His own Truman show. The centre of the universe. Everyone else mere satellites to his ego. Even Keir. Especially Keir. Just another beta male.Starmer kicked things off with a run-of-the-mill speech designed not to rock the boat. Everything was fantastic. This had been the best state visit ever and no one could tell him differently. Britain and the US had always loved each other and always would. No more so than now. And all thanks to the US president. Perhaps Keir hadn’t bothered to check that The Donald isn’t that popular this side of the Atlantic. But back to Trump. He was the best. The bringer of tech trade deals. The architect of world peace. Better even than Bono.All the while, The Donald looked bored out of his mind. As if he would rather be anywhere other than answering questions from the media. As if he was tired of schmoozing the UK prime minister and couldn’t wait to get back to DC. Or maybe he was just reminiscing about Wednesday night’s farmhouse chicken at the state banquet. That’s what he had really come to the UK for. All this was just routine. No glitz. No glory.Eventually Keir wound up and handed over to Agent Orange. The Donald looked down at his notes. BE GRATEFUL. DON’T ROCK THE BOAT. TRY NOT TO HUMILIATE STARMER IN HIS OWN BACK YARD. Sure. He could just about manage that. He was thankful for the rightful honours that had been bestowed on him. The king – “a fantastic person” – would never have done this for Joe Biden. Biden was a loser. The worst.He, The Great Donald, had personally resolved seven of the most intractable wars around the world. He came in peace. Just a shame he hadn’t been able to make progress on Ukraine or Gaza. But he would get around to it sooner or later. Just don’t mention the recentAlaska summitin which he had been made to look a fool by Vladimir Putin.Then came the questions. The first from the BBC on Palestine and Israel. Trump was the only man with influence over Israel. Why wasn’t he using it? Starmer assured us they had talked a great deal about this. They both wanted the war to end and for the hostages to be released. Trump just mumbled. It seemed like the great peacemaker was as clueless on how to resolve the situation as the rest of us. The people of Gaza can expect to be bombed for a while yet.On the question of illegal immigration, The Donald had some kind words of advice. Send in the military. Crack a few skulls. Get some target practice in. That’s what he’d done and it had worked a treat. Keir looked twitchy at this. He hadreturned one Indianto France overnight. That was a start. Luckily, we quickly moved on to global politics again. In breaking news, The Donald declared that he had now ended one of the world’s worst conflicts. Between Albania and Azerbaijan. A war the world didn’t even know was taking place. For the simple reason that it wasn’t. Perhaps I have inadvertently stopped a war between Australia and Turkmenistan.Trump turns fire on Putin and lauds UK in press conference with StarmerRead moreThe Donald answered his three questions from the US media with ease. Largely because he had picked three stooges from rightwing organisations who were never going to ask anything difficult. Keir could only applaud. There are times when he must wish he was an American. Though we did get to find out that Keir – at least for the duration of the state visit – was now a devout Christian. Expect to see a pile of ashes.And that was about it. Starmer breathed a huge sigh of relief. He had survived the experience without anyone asking the killer question. Feeling demob happy, he invited a couple more questions from the UK pool. Big mistake. Sure enough, it was Sky’s Beth Rigby who asked the Mandelson/Epstein question. Really? REALLY? Did you have to ask that?Starmer crumpled. The Donald stepped in. He had never heard of Mandy. Never met him. Nothing to see here. This was one for Keir. It’s normally Peter who does the denying three times. This was a lie of epic proportions. Trump had loved Mandy. His lordship was almost ever present at the White House. A ghost of a smile crossed Starmer’s face. Perhaps he should try this bullshit.Time up. Keir had had enough. He had escaped from this more or less alive. It could have gone so much worse. He had known Trump was a rogue operator but he could live with this. Thank fuck the state visit was finally over. Time to focus on surviving his party conference. “That’s all,” said Starmer. The US press corps stood up again to applaud.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

An “extra-large” guard of honour. The UK rolled out not only the red carpet, royal welcome and golden carriage but also the superlatives for Donald Trump’s visit. Sir Keir Starmer’s hyperbole on thememorandum of understanding on techmade his guest look almost understated: theprime minister boastedthat the transatlantic partnership paved the way for new technologies to “amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer”.Yet there was an inverse relationship between thepomp and ceremonyof this trip and its real import, between the grand declarations of amity and the actual state of transatlantic ties. The US president soaked up the sycophancy and was obliging enough to hymn the “priceless” relationship. But while Mr Trump grumbled that Vladimir Putin had “really let me down”, he showed no inclination for tougher action against Russia despite Sir Keir’s preposterous remark that the US president had “led the way” on Ukraine and King Charles’s pointed reference – one that his mother might not, perhaps, have made – to Europe and its allies needing to stand together against tyranny.US tariffs on British steelhave not budged. The promised $150bn of investment by US tech firms in the next decade looks less impressive in the context of their global investment in infrastructure; Microsoft alone haspledged to spend $120bnon datacentres in the next year. As Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and ex-Meta executive,accurately observed, the UK is a “vassal state technologically”. The government is relying on servicing American artificial intelligence firms rather than bolstering domestic innovation.Sir Keir has earned far better reviews for his performance on the world stage than domestically. The international arena is perhaps all the more appealing when he is so embattled at home. Yet almost half of Britonsthought it wrongfor Mr Trump to receive this second state visit, and even a former Telegraph editortook to the streetsin protest.Thearrest of four campaignersafter an image of Mr Trump and the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was beamed on to Windsor Castle – with an accompanying soundtrack questioning their relationship – was a grotesque misuse of the Malicious Communications Act to restrict protest. It was all the more galling when those around the presidentattack the UK’s supposed lack of free speechin curbing hateful disinformation and other dangerous materials. Giving Mr Trump a bespoke ministerial-style red box embossed with his initials was inconsequential, but a symbolically queasy choice given his willingness to meddle in other countries’ domestic policies. He publicly urged Sir Keir to extract more fossil fuels and suggested using the army to counter illegal migration.But in the world of President Trump, a diplomatic interaction that avoids the outright disaster of a public dressing down, or doubling of tariffs, is now regarded as a triumph by US allies. Minimising damage and buying time are the name of the game – though he described the transatlantic relationship as “unbreakable”, Mr Trump delights in fracturing the status quo, takes offence easily and likes association with winners; Sir Keir no longer looks like one. Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to Washington, noted this week that the UKstill has leveragebeyond ego-boosting pageantry and could use it. Instead, inflating modest achievements and demonstrating an absurd deference only makes Britain look smaller.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionKeir StarmerTariffsKing Charles IIINick CleggArtificial intelligence (AI)Trump administrationeditorialsShareReuse this content"

When one journalist asked Trump how he was holding up after the death of his friend, the president responded: “I think very good. And by the way, right there, you see all the trucks? They just started construction for the new ballroom of the White House, which is something that they’ve been trying to get, as you know, for about 150 years. And it’s gonna be a beauty.”“This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend,” Kimmel said. “This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.”Explainer: What did Jimmy Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk’s killing?Read moreOn arightwing podcaston Wednesday, theFCC commissioner, Brendan Carr, an avowed Trump ally who wrote the FCC chapter ofProject 2025,said that Kimmel’s monologue – delivered before much about Kirk’s alleged attacker’s motivations was known – was “sick” for suggesting that the shooter may have been affiliated with the Maga movement. He said: “In what appears to be an action by Jimmy Kimmel to play into that narrative that this was somehow a Maga or Republican-motivated person. If that’s what happened here with his conduct, that is really really sick.” Carr went on to effusively praise Kirk. “He was an amazing man.”Turning to Kimmel and his broadcaster, Carr said: “We’re going to have remedies that we can look at.” “Frankly,” he said later, “when you see stuff like this – I mean, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.”Apparently, ABC, and its parent company, Disney, decided to do it the easy way: the suspension of Kimmel’s show was announced just hours after Carr’s comments. Reporting fromtrade publicationshas suggested that Nexstar, a broadcasting company that owns many of the ABC-affiliated stations that air Kimmel’s show, may have prompted the move from ABC after they pre-emptively said that they would not air Kimmel’s show in response to the comments. Nexstar is in the midst of a $6.2bn merger with the media company Tegna, a deal which Carr, in his capacity as FCC commissioner, would have the power to block.After ABC’s announcement, when Carr was asked by the CNN media analyst Brian Stelter if he had any new comment on Kimmel’s suspension, Carr repliedwith a giffrom the television series The Office, in which the show’s two exasperating idiot foils, Michael and Dwight, dance triumphantly.What appears to have happened is this: an executive agency with the power to regulate private actors threatened to take action to punish speech and to prevent more such speech from being made public in the future. And a corporation jumped to carry out this censorship in response to those threats. There is a word for this: jawboning. It is when the government pressures a third party to silence speech it does not like, and the US supreme courthas ruled unanimouslythat it is an illegal first amendment violation – that is, state censorship.TheTrump administrationhas advanced a sporadic crackdown on anti-regime speech since the president’s return to power in January. Kimmel is not even the first late-night host to be dismissed under agency pressure: Stephen Colbert, the host of The Late Show, had his program cancelled by CBS just two weeks after the network paid Trump a large settlement to end a frivolous defamation lawsuit against him. But the crackdown on anti-Trump speech has accelerated in the days since Kirk’s murder. On Monday,JD Vancehosted an episode of Kirk’s podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show, and told listeners that if they see someone criticizing Kirk, they should “call their employer”.Media has long been a precarious industry, one where employers and workers alike face slim margins and maximum scrutiny. And Trump has long used the media’s combination of public visibility and business vulnerability to his own advantage, casting coverage of his own misdeeds, malfeasance and malice as lies and encouraging his followers in their reflexive anti-elite sentiment about the generally well-educated cadre of New York and DC-based writers and editors, whom he has long referred to as “the enemy of the people”.More and more of the largest media companies in the American market are now controlled by billionaires who are Trump’s ideological allies: Elon Musk owns X; the rightwing Ellison family is set to acquire Paramount/Skydance; just this week, Trump announced a deal to sell TikTok to his rightwing billionaire supporters Marc Andreessen and Larry Ellison.With some noble exceptions, those large media companies that are still independent have generally responded to Trump’s pressure poorly, making what seem like ad-hoc and arbitrary choices to either resist or capitulate depending on the whims of management. One thinks of the Los Angeles Times, which pulled its endorsement of Kamala Harris from in the 2024 presidential election at the direction of Patrick Soon-Shiong, the paper’s billionaire owner. One thinks, too, of the Washington Post, where purges of newsroom and opinion desk writers and an editorial pivot towards the promotion of “free markets and individual liberties” have now replaced the slogan that the paper adopted during the first Trump administration: “Democracy Dies in Darkness.” It is getting very dark indeed.When a regime can use the power of the law to punish speech because it does not like that speech’s content, then speech is not free.When media companies change their editorial strategies not in service to their readers, but out of fear of the repercussions from the government and its allies, then the press is not free. When an honest accounting of Kirk’s life leads to comedians, journalists, opinion columnists, political commentators and sports writers losing their jobs at the behest of state actors and in the service of regime interests, then the truth is not free.It is becoming dangerous – life-alteringly so – to tell the truth about the Trump regime, or even just to tell truths that the regime finds unflattering. Theirs is the dream of an insecure child: one of absolute power. They want to rule over us with malignant pettiness, to dispense favors and mercy to their allies and sycophants, and to dispense and encourage punishments to those who displease them. They want to control what we’re allowed to say, what we’re allowed to know. And they want to control what we are allowed to laugh at – certainly, never them.In the era of absolute monarchy, European countries often had laws on the books banning the mockery of the king. So-calledlèse-majestélaws made it treason to insult the “dignity” of the sovereign. The Trump administration seems to have taken this principle – that to mock is serious and punishable – and expanded it, extending the protective circle of the king’s authority outward until it encompasses all of his allies, too.Under Trump, it is not just Trump himself who must not be mocked, but also anyone Trump approves of, or finds useful, or needs to pretend to love. It is a sign of the regime’s profound insecurity and sense of their own weakness that they think they require this power, that they think they cannot withstand the laughter of their people. But even if Trump succeeds in his crackdown on speech, he seems unlikely to effectively silence the public’s mockery of himself and his allies. It would be impossible to ban jokes about these people; they are simply too ridiculous.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpStephen ColbertJimmy KimmelcommentShareReuse this content"

David Letterman jumped to CBS. Conan O’Brien was plucked from obscurity, eventually handed The Tonight Show, and then had it essentially clawed back by Jay Leno for a few more years of appalling hackwork. But in retrospect, maybe the most prescient moments were two that seemed decidedly minor at the time: Bill Maher’s Politically Incorrect was yanked off the air by ABC because Maher expressed an unpopular 9/11-related opinion in a highly understandable context, and Jimmy Fallon playfully tousledDonald Trump’s hair.‘Censoring you in real time’: suspension of Jimmy Kimmel show sparks shock and fears for free speechRead moreThose events don’t do everything to explain the current barren late-night landscape, but it does feel like the so-called late night wars have started to resemble a genuine battlefield – not in the sense that lives hang in the balance, but in the sense that after major skirmishes, there tend not to be much of anyone left. (And the appeasers benefit, at least in the short term.) Just a few months after Stephen Colbert’s Late Show – the one created for a ship-jumping Letterman, no less – wascanceled by CBS, ostensibly for budget reasons but very likely to help smooth the prospects of a big Paramount merger, ABC has taken Jimmy Kimmel Live!off the air indefinitely.The ostensible reason is that Kimmelexpressed disrespect to the late Charlie Kirk, a professional bigot who wassenselessly gunned downat a public speaking engagement. This has been chosen by station owners because it sounds vaguely plausible, if still enormously stupid. Kirk was a public figure, and questioning his legacy (which is very different from questioning the horrifying violence of his death) is not out of bounds by any reasonable American standard. Even stupider: Kimmel didn’t actually do this! After Kirk’s death, he expressed sincere condolences on-air to the man’s family and described the murder as “senseless”. On the subsequent episode in question, Kimmel said this:“We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anyone other than one of them, doing everything they can to score political points from it. In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving – on Friday, the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this.”He then threw to an already-famous clip ofDonald Trumpreacting to a question about his grief over Kirk by cheerfully discussing his plans to build a White House ballroom. As has happened repeatedly with Kirk’s own words (which Kimmel didn’t get into at all), describing something Trump and others did got Kimmel accused of cruel insensitivity. Trump’s FCC chair, Brendan Carr, focused on Kimmel’s introductory remarks, which he willfully interpreted as an implication of the shooter’s political affiliation.Never mind that nearly the entirety of the news media was making similar speculations in every direction; that Kimmel is not a newsman; and that Kimmel was describing the Maga version of this far more than he was making a statement of his own. The point is, he said something that not every single person watching would agree with, and it tangentially involved Charlie Kirk. Clearly, he had to go. Sinclair Broadcast Group, a corporation that owns hundreds of individual TV stations and has their own mergers and acquisitions to think about, announced they would pull Kimmel from their ABC affiliates, and soon the network at large followed suit, despite reports that many of their executives failed to see anything line-crossing about what Kimmel said.Which brings us to those quaint late-night skirmishes of yesteryear. Maher was canceled – literally canceled, not social-media canceled – for arguing that the 9/11 hijackers, reprehensible as their actions were, weren’t necessarily cowards. In retrospect, this has to be in the bottom quartile of stupidity so far as Maher ideas go. But ABC, perhaps wanting to clarify what cowardice looked like, simply decided it wasn’t worth the trouble to keep their fighting-for-third-place political chatshow around. And in the long run, they were absolutely right – not to cancel a TV show over an off-the-cuff opinion, not even to punish Bill Maher (an understandable instinct), but that capitulation was the way of the future. Kimmel, a middle-of-the-road and decidedly non-incendiary liberal, has been all-but-canceled for suggesting rightwingers were scoring points off of a man’s death.The real problem is that Kimmel and Colbert didn’t get the message sent up by Jimmy Fallon’s white flag in 2016, when he treated Trump, campaigning for the office of president on a platform that included inciting fear and hatred of immigrants, as a fun, good-humored guy, lightly messing with him by asking to touch his famously dodgy-looking hair. It was cringe-inducing at the time, grosser after a normalized Trump won the presidency, and now seems like the standard Trump’s regime expects going forward: sure, you can pretend to make fun a tiny bit, but we’re gonna need you to capitulate. Colbert and Kimmel – and I can’t believe I’m saying this about two relatively milquetoast, middle-of-the-road network-TV late-night hosts – didn’t capitulate, and they paid the price. If Kimmel’s indefinite suspension sticks, Fallon will soon be the only one left standing in the networks’ 11.30pm programming slot.Though there’s little indication that the public at large agrees with this turn of events (are there Fallonheads who feel unbelievably psyched that he may have the field to himself, at least until Trump and FCC sets their sights on him?), that it was even considered a plausible course of action indicates a major shift in the parasocial dynamics of entertainment. Part of the reason late-night dominance was so desirable was because it was habit-forming; networks knew that viewers with an affinity for a particular comedian/host indicated a long-term loyalty to a figure they would, in old-timey TV parlance, invite into their homes on a nightly basis.Charlie Kirk in his own words: ‘prowling Blacks’ and ‘the great replacement strategy’Read morePart of that unofficial late-night-host contract was a tacit agreement allowing for relatively toothless jokes whose basic premises that individual viewers might not necessarily agree with politically, like “Bill Clinton is a horndog” or “George W Bush is kind of dumb,” under the auspices of superficially harmless (or sometimes just superficial) both-sides fun. As that position has been largely usurped by podcasters like Joe Rogan, the lack of desire to nitpick these entertainment friends remains, even as the jokes disappear; Rogan can say the most ill-informed or flat-out incorrect stuff in all sincerity, and have it somehow fall under the broad heading of “just talk”. Under this new social contract, Charlie Kirk has mystifyingly achieved barely secular sainthood despite (or, for some people, because of) sayingsome of the most vile things imaginable about large swaths of the American public. The perception, however incorrect, that Kimmel said something against Kirk (which would be very much in-bounds for a public figure, deceased or not) presents an easy opportunity for one form of parasocial relationship, and free speech, to overtake another.Of course, there are more important norms being eroded or flat-out destroyed by Trump and his corporate cheerleaders than just “there used to be a bunch of late-night network talkshows”. There’s nothing particularly sacred about Kimmel’s job unto itself, though the hundreds of people who work for his show might reasonably disagree. What’s sacred is the idea that citizens of the United States aren’t watching state TV, their leisure time remade in the image of The Apprentice himself. It didn’t stop at Colbert, and it won’t stop at Kimmel. With late-night network shows decimated by Trump lackeys, maybe viewers can look forward to FCC-mandated hair tousling in prime time next.Explore more on these topicsJimmy KimmelUS televisionTelevisionDonald TrumpCharlie Kirk shootingTV comedyComedycommentShareReuse this content"

The PM must summon the courage to actThu 18 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 13.05 EDTShareAs Donald Trump met with a grinning Keir Starmer and senior royals on his UK state visit this week, I found myself needing aDaily Mail body language expert.Did Starmer’s hand wave suggest he wanted to ask about the migrantscurrently being jailedsurrounded by alligators in Florida? Did King Charles’s lip shape mean he was wondering about the women who’ve accused Trump of sexual assault?Still, best not to think about it. That seemed to be the mantra of the visit. As protesters lined the street, the British delegation stuck its fingers in its ears andpulled out the stops: a gilded carriage, a military ceremony and the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, doing the sort of enthused head tilt that looked as if she was trying to communicate she was being held hostage.It has felt at times as if we are all extras in an even worse version of Love Actually, in which liberal wet dream Hugh Grant does not in fact stand up to the villainous US president (but at least no one keeps banging on about the size of Martine McCutcheon’s thighs).There is, of course, a practical reason for wooing Trump. Continuing the special relationship has been credited with protecting the UK from sky-high tariffs, while the latest visit has reportedlybeen timed to coincide witha £150bn investment from US firms. And yet the fact that Trump’s itinerary has steered him away from London – avoiding the larger protestsbeing staged there– and has conveniently occurred when parliament is in recess does betray the sense that (whisper it) none of this is actually OK.Whether it is the horror in Gaza or the rise of inhumane anti-migrant policies, it is the pretence that the timeline we are living through is normal that is truly insanity-inducing. Or to put it another way: you know there is something wrong with a diplomatic trip when it begins with a photo of the guest of honour stood next to a child sex trafficker beingprojected on to Windsor Castle.Trump’s unprecedented second state visit to the UK is in essence realpolitik gaslighting, in which we are told a man who is threatening totake over the police forceof the US capital should be gifted the literal red carpet treatment (and the Red Arrows).That Trump is in the country only days after what is thought to have been the largest nationalist event in Britain in decades makes this unease all the more palpable. It is hard not to feel that a disease is being allowed to spread, as the far right bleed over Westminster Bridge and a US president who this week celebrated the removal of a late-night TV host formaking a critical jokeenjoys thelargest-ever guard of honourat a state visit.View image in fullscreenKing Charles and Donald Trump sit in a carriage during a procession through Windsor Castle.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe pomp and ceremony bestowed to Trump is a particularly blatant example of what is, on both sides of the Atlantic, a widespread acceptance of the unacceptable. While in the US the late Christian nationalist Charlie Kirk is sanctified, here an MP calls “the vast majority” of a crowdlistening to great replacement theory“good, ordinary, decent people”. (Spoiler: it was Nigel Farage.)The crisis we are facing is only worsened by the sense our elected officials are so staggeringly unequipped to deal with the scale of the challenge (or indeed, are busy stoking it themselves). There was a remarkable period over the weekend when it was unclear whether the prime minister would even respond to the march, as if Starmer had gone to the football and just forgotten to put his phone back on. In the end, it took 24 hours for Downing Street torelease a statementsaying the government would not tolerate people being “intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin”. As context, that response rate was slowerthan the band James’.Five days after Elon Musk called for thedissolution of parliament, the government is still using X for official purposes. “We are a fair, tolerant and decent country. But we are in the fight of our times,” Starmertweeted on Tuesday, notably falling short of referring to the far right. I imagine this is what it felt like to see the gunpowder plot foiled, if James I kept posting on Guy Fawkes’s social media platform.At the time of writing, the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, has not tweeted anything about 110,000 people attending a march organised by Tommy Robinson and has not wanted to talk about it when asked by the media. She has, however, found time to promote her new LBC show.I can’t help but think back fondly to the 2010 general election, when Gordon Brown said a voter was a “bigot” for lamenting “all these eastern European what are coming in”. I’m not suggesting Starmer starts insulting the public or presidents – at least not on mic! – or that Brown handled the encounter well but I find myself wondering: when will our leaders call a racist a racist? And what does it say about the current political culture that makes them so afraid to?That this week it was largely left to Sadiq Khan, one of Britain’s few senior Muslim figures and a keytarget for Islamophobic threats, tocall out Trumpfor fanning the “flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world” is a stark lesson in dereliction of duty versus bravery.By Friday morning, Trump will be off British soil. But the crisis he represents will remain. Hate and division cannot be sent away with a flight on Air Force One. It takes long, hard conversations and courageous action. Whether Starmer and co are up to the task is the question. One thing’s for sure: if you are ever to solve a threat, you must first name it.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionKeir StarmerFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

Trump is taking the path of Johnson and not LincolnThu 18 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 11.08 EDTShareOver the course of American history, presidents have not been judged by whether violence occurred on their watch but by how they responded to it. Each crisis poses the same test: will the person who holds the office use it to steady the republic, or to further polarize it?The oath of office exists for precisely this moment. It binds the president to something larger than self-interest and party, the constitution and the rule of law. In the wake of rightwing political activist Charlie Kirk’s death,Donald Trumphas forsaken this oath, instead choosing to wield his immense power to further divide an already polarized nation, not unite it. History will not soon forget this grave act of political opportunism.One can look to the historical record to see this dilemma is not new.On the brink of civil war, Abraham Lincoln appealed to the “better angels of our nature” and reminded the country that the presidency carries a constitutional duty to “preserve, protect and defend the constitution”.In this case, national leadership meant taking a moment of profound shock and transforming it into a reaffirmation of civic equality and lawful process. But not all presidents have taken this path. Andrew Johnson, who took office after Lincoln’s murder, used his bully pulpit to vilify members of Congress, even threatening one sitting congressman. He even took a shot at his predecessor’s legacy by delaying a protection Lincoln promised to formerly enslaved people. He refused to condemn the violence that terrorized both Black citizens and those who supported Reconstruction. His war with Congress and his abdication of constitutional responsibility culminated in impeachment and left a legacy marked by division and societal backsliding.The lesson is not just academic. It is urgent. When violence shocks the nation, the president’s job is to tell the truth about the law, to call for calm and to make clear that guilt is individual, not collective. Fault lies with one singular culprit, not an entire wing of the American electorate. The oath presidents swear is a promise to all Americans. It obliges them to speak for the whole country and to equally apply the law without fear or favor. That obligation rules out scapegoating entire communities for the act of a lone offender, and it rules out turning grief into a pretext for settling political scores.Yet in this moment, rather than discharge that duty, this president has chosen to weaponize tragedy. By blaming the so-called “radical left” for the act of a single individual, he has not merely ducked responsibility; he has mocked the oath itself. A pledge that should bind him to all Americans is being repurposed as a tool of division. The message to political opponents and vulnerable communities is unmistakable: you are targets first and citizens second.In an interview with NBC News, Trump claimed he was hoping to heal the nation. But in the same breath, he pinned the blame on a sweeping and ill-defined “radical left group of lunatics”.“They don’t play fair and they never did,” he said. On Friday, he threatened to launch an investigation into the Democratic mega-donor George Soros. This president is following his same divisive playbook, blaming national tragedies on political opponents and desecrating the oath of office in the process.There is another path, and we have seen it in much more recent history. After the attacks of September 11, George W Bush visited a mosque and insisted that American Muslims were not the enemy. He rejected collective blame. After the Oklahoma City bombing, Bill Clinton urged the country to lower its rhetoric and to reject the conspiracism that can legitimize violence.After Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination in 1968, Lyndon B Johnson addressed a grieving nation and urged Americans to recommit to democracy and justice. He spoke plainly about the danger that violence posed to democratic life and about the responsibility of the government to secure citizens’ civil rights rather than foment fear.What would following the oath look like now? It would begin with an unambiguous condemnation of political violence and of vigilantism. It would affirm the independence of investigators and courts and would promise that the law will be enforced fairly. It would reject collective guilt and refuse any attempt to turn grief into a cudgel against political enemies. It would summon Americans to constitutional solidarity: to the idea that we settle our fiercest disagreements through law, argument and elections, not through intimidation.Today’s choice is stark. A president can meet the moment by defending the constitution and uniting the nation. But this president has chosen another way. He has appealed to our worst demons, not our better angels. He has blamed an entire segment of the population, the so-called “radical left”, for the actions of one person whose motives for his act of murder are still not settled. And he has chosen to target enemies and vilify his opponents, rather than to answer the call of the constitution. History will remember him like Johnson, who made a mockery of the oath, not Lincoln, who sought to honor it.Corey Brettschneider is a professor of political science at Brown University.

A group of kids is talking casually about something. Seemingly out of the blue, one of the boys makes an off-handed joke. Maybe it’s racist or sexist or homophobic, but whatever the poison, they inject it and the group dynamic shifts ever so slightly. As a general rule, the boys continue as usual while the girls – who tend to be more politically progressive – face a choice: they can speak up, which usually results in them getting the reputation as annoying and unable to take a joke, or they can let it pass and be regarded as a chill girl who isn’t angry or woke. Since November 2024, the latter reaction has become far more common.No one wants to hang out with the stickler, so no one wants to become her. And therefore, juvenile illiberalism lives onThis kind of fearful silence is becoming more common outside of high schools, too. In December 2024,Disneyremoved a transgender character from a new series. This April, the New York Times reported that a newTrump administrationregulationbars government employeesfrom adding pronouns to their email bios. Two days after that, Gannet, one of the US’s largest newspaper chains, cited Trump’s opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion whenannouncingthat it would no longer publish statistics on employee diversity.This cultural shift promotes nostalgia for an earlier time, before the birth of DEI, when women wore aprons and let their husbands earn the money. As of August, the “trad wife” influencer Hannah Neeleman, better known as Ballerina Farm, has amassed 10 million followers on Instagram alone. Her videos of kneading sourdough and raising her eight kids mark a return to the ideal of women as homemakers. Last November, sheappearedon the cover of Evie, a conservative magazine that openlypraisesTrump.This trickles down to us. In the Trump era, left-leaning teenage girls feel less comfortable expressing political views that could be derided as “woke”. This isn’t because most of them are becoming rightwing: last November,58% of women ages 18-30 voted forKamala Harris. It’s because the political atmosphere has changed and progressive-minded girls now feel more afraid of the consequences of speaking their minds.The girls I talked to say it’s riskier to be outspokenly blue. A high school girl reported that boys “are becoming more emboldened, more confident to make these [bigoted] jokes”. Another said that since Trump took office, casual racism and sexism have become common: “We see [the behavior] more and it’s happening to us.” Young women feel social pressure to remain passive in the face of offensive remarks. Your guy friends “will think you’re attacking them”, one girl said, adding that “it’s not worth it” to speak out against every incident. You need to “pick your battles”.What Sabrina Carpenter gets right about gen Z’s gender divide | Caroline Hayes, Carolina Hidalgo-McCabe and Alice LassmanRead moreA third girl added that the desire to not be known as one of those “super woke” girls is enough to make someone clamp their lips, knowing that if the girl objects, “there is no chance [boys] will ever take you seriously again.” These opinions are harsh, but they’re true. Pew Research Center reports that as of March,45% of girls ages 13-17feel “a great deal” of pressure to fit in socially, and as cultural conservatism grows, that changes what fitting in means. Even in comparatively liberal spaces, like my high school, girls who wince at locker room talk risk exclusion. No one wants to hang out with the stickler, so no one wants to become her. And therefore, juvenile illiberalism lives on.Trump has damaged our country in many blatant ways, but what I’m seeing is more subtle. Tectonic shifts don’t always make it to CNN. The cultural effects of this openly racist and sexist government on young people may skew gender relations as we enter the workforce, enabling sexual assault and discrimination and keeping women from positions of power. Thedividebetween young women and young men is growing massively, with no end in sight. Trump is distorting American society, and I fear distorting us.Naomi Beinart is a high school studentExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionGenderUS politicsRepublicansDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

And so on.At least he sued theWall Street Journal’s parent company for something specific: reporting Trump’s birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein (which Trump continues to deny is his, even though itshowed up in the Epstein filesreleased by a US House committee).Last year, Trump sued ABC and its host George Stephanopoulos for having said that Trump was found liable for rape rather than “sexual abuse” in the civil suit brought by E Jean Carroll. The network settled for $16m.Trump sued CBS for allegedly editing an interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes to make her sound more coherent. CBS also agreed to pay $16m.Defamation lawsuits are a longstanding part of Trump’s repertoire, which he first learned at the feet of Roy Cohn, one of America’s most notorious legal bullies.In the 1980s, Trump sued the Pulitzer-winning Chicago Tribune architecture critic Paul Gapp for $500m,for criticizingTrump’s plan to build the world’s tallest building in Manhattan, a 150-story tower that Gapp called “one of the silliest things anyone could inflict on New York or any other city”.Trump charged that Gapp had “virtually torpedoed” the project and subjected Trump to “public ridicule and contempt”. A judge dismissed the suit as involving protected opinion.But such lawsuits are far worse when a president sues. He’s no longer just an individual whose reputation can be harmed. He’s the head of the government of the United States. One of the cardinal responsibilities of the media in our democracy is to report on a president – and often criticize him.The legal standard for defamation of a public figure, established in the 1964 supreme court caseNew York TimesCo v Sullivan, requires that public officials who bring such suits prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.That case arose from a libel suit filed by LB Sullivan, the police commissioner of Montgomery, Alabama, against the New York Times for an advertisement in the paper that, despite being mostly true, contained factual errors concerning the mistreatment of civil rights demonstrators.The supreme court ruled in favor of the Times, finding that the ad was protected speech under the first amendment and that the higher standard of proof was necessary to protect robust debate on public affairs.Under this standard, there’s no chance Trump will prevail in his latest lawsuits against the Times or Wall Street Journal. Nor would he have won his lawsuits against ABC and CBS, had they gone to trial.But Trump hasn’t filed these lawsuits to win in court. He has sought wins in the court of public opinion. These lawsuits are aspects of his performative presidency.ABC’s and CBS’s settlements are viewed by Trump as vindications of his gripes with the networks.He’s likewise using his lawsuit against the New York Times to advertise his longstanding grievances with the paper.His lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal is probably intended to send a message to the Journal’s publisher, Rupert Murdoch, that Trump doesn’t want Murdoch to muck around in the Jeffrey Epstein case.These lawsuits also put the media on notice that Trump could mess up their businesses.Not only is it expensive to defend against them, requiring attorneys’ fees, inordinate time from senior executives, and efforts to defend the media’s brand and reputation. When a lawsuit comes from the president of the United States, who also has the power to damage a business by imposing regulations and prosecuting the corporation for any alleged wrongdoings, the potential costs can be even bigger.Which presumably is why CBS caved rather than litigated. Its parent company, Paramount, wanted to be able to sell it for some $8bn to Skydance, whose CEO is David Ellison (scion of the second-richest person in America, Oracle’s Larry Ellison). But Paramount first needed the approval of Trump’s Federal Communications Commission – which held up the sale until the defamation lawsuit was settled.Here we come to the central danger of Trump’s wanton use of personal defamation law. The mere possibility of its use – coupled with Trump’s other powers of retribution – have a potential chilling effect on media criticism of Trump.We don’t know how much criticism has been stifled to date, but it’s suggestive that a CBS News president and the executive producer of 60 Minutes resigned over CBS’s handling of the lawsuit and settlement, presumably because they felt that management was limiting their ability to fairly and freely cover Trump.Among the capitulations CBS’s owners made to the Trump administration was to hire an “ombudsman” to police the network against so-called bias – and the person they hired was Kenneth R Weinstein, the former president and chief executive of the conservative-leaning Hudson Institute thinktank.It’s also suggestive that CBS ended Stephen Colbert’s contract, despite the fact that Colbert’s show is the highest-rated late-night comedy show on television. He’s also one of the most trenchant critics of Trump.If we need any more evidence, on Wednesday ABCpulled off the airanother popular late-night critic of Trump – Jimmy Kimmel – because Kimmel in a monologue earlier this week said “[w]e hit some new lows over the weekend with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.ABC announced the moveafter Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC, appeared to threaten ABC, and its parent company Disney, for airing Kimmel’s monologue — ominously saying: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”Jeff Bezos, executive chair of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post, has muzzled the paper’s editorial page,prohibiting it from endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and imposing a stringent set of criteria on all editorials and opinion columns, which has led to the resignations of its opinion page editor and a slew of its opinion writers.Trump hasn’t sued the Washington Post for defamation, but Bezos presumably understands Trump’s potential for harming his range of businesses and wants to avoid Trump’s wrath.Make no mistake. Trump’s efforts to silence media criticism of him and his administration constitute another of his attacks on democracy.What can be done? Two important steps are warranted.First, the New York Times v Sullivan standard should be far stricter when a president of the United States seeks to use defamation law against a newspaper or media platform that criticizes him.Instead of requiring that he prove that a false statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth, he should have to prove that the false statement materially impaired his ability to perform his official duties.Better yet, a president should have no standing to bring defamation suits. He has no need to bring them. Through his office he already possesses sufficient – if not too much – power to suppress criticism.Second, antitrust authorities should not allow large corporations or ultra-wealthy individuals with many other business interests to buy major newspapers or media platforms. They cannot be trusted to prioritize the public’s right to know over their financial interests in their range of businesses.The richest person in the world was allowed to buy X, one of the most influential news platforms on earth, and has turned it into a cesspool of rightwing lies and conspiracy theories.The son of the second-richest person in the world now oversees CBS.The fourth-richest person now owns the Washington Post.The Disney corporation, with its wide range of business enterprises, owns ABC.The problem isn’t concentrated wealth per se.It’s that these business empires are potentially more important to their owners than is the public’s right to know.If Democrats win back control of Congress next year, they should encode these two initiatives in legislation.Democracy depends on a fearless press. Trump and the media that have caved in to him are jeopardizing it and thereby undermining our democracy.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Now they are doing it again with one of the best young players in the leagueThu 18 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 15.33 EDTShareWhen theChicago Skyselected Angel Reese, one of the most celebrated college players in years, with the No 7 overall pick last year, many believed she could be a turning point for the franchise. Yes, the Sky had won the WNBA finals in 2021 but they have been a losing team for most of their history and Reese, in addition to her celebrity, would bring explosive athleticism and superb rebounding to the franchise. As a player, those lofty hopes have panned out: she is already a two-time All-Star and has led the league in rebounds in both her WNBA seasons.As a teammate, things aren’t so smooth. The Sky missed out on the playoffs last season. This time around they finished with the joint-worst record in the entireWNBA, alongside the Dallas Wings.Caitlin Clark’s season is over, but the mob’s anger isn’t about her healthRead moreReese, it is fair to say, has not been shy about showing her feelings. After saying the Sky “have to get good players … have to get great players” and implying she’d seek a trade if that didn’t happen,Reese apologized. “I really didn’t intentionally mean to put down my teammates,” she said. The Sky promptly suspended her for half a game for “statements detrimental to the team.”As a former NBA player myself, I can testify that criticizing your teammates – in public at least – is a no-no. But is a suspension and a statement to the media the way it should have been handled? It seemed as though the Sky were attempting to embarrass Reese. She has been the target of abuse on social media ever since she entered the league, partlydue to her so-called rivalrywith Caitlin Clark (a rivalry both women play down). By reprimanding her, the Sky opened the way for her online critics to feast and slander Reese.The punishment looked petty, and quickly backfired. Sky fans flooded social media with support for Reese, and at Chicago’s final home game, signs appeared in the crowd reading “Free Angel Reese”, while others called for the firing of general manager Jeff Pagliocca.The suspension didn’t just seem heavy-handed, it was out of step with the rest of the league. Other WNBA stars have voiced frustrations with their teams without being punished. Pagliocca himself later echoed Reese’s sentiment about the need for better roster construction – the very thing she was suspended for. The message was unmistakable: when Reese says it, it’s insubordination; when the general manager says it, it’s a plan. That message is even worse when you consider how often Black women like Reese are attacked for speaking their minds.The irony is that Reese’s clash with the front office is only the latest chapter in a much longer, shambolic narrative for the Sky. This is a franchise with a history of running off talent. WNBA journalist Trysta Krickrecently told me on my podcast, The Collision, about problems at the Sky. Sylvia Fowles, Elena Delle Donne, Candace Parker, Courtney Vandersloot – all left Chicago frustrated (the latter returned this season to find things aren’t much better than when she left). Marina Mabrey spoke about racial tensions. Candace Parker, a Chicago native who helped Sky to the WNBA title in 2021, chose to leave. Time and again, the Sky have wasted the chance to construct a lasting championship roster.“There are so many players that could be on the team right now but elected to leave the Chicago Sky due to their issues with the organization,” Krick told me. “Could you imagine a Chicago team with Kahleah Copper, Angel Reese, Marina Mabrey, Kamilla Cardoso? That’s a championship caliber roster. But they have a history of squandering away talent.”Firing coach Teresa Weatherspoon only compounded matters. Reese said the decision left her “heartbroken” andadded that Weatherspoon was the only personwho “truly believed in me” as a Black woman in sports. It is difficult to imagine a more tone-deaf move if the goal is to keep your franchise player happy.Perhaps this would be more palatable if the Sky were competing for titles. But the last two seasons have been, bluntly, abysmal. In 2024 they won 13 of their 30 regular-season games. In 2025, they won 10, finishing joint-last despite having two 2024 All-Star rookies, Reese and center Kamilla Cardoso. In addition this year’s rookies – point guard Hailey Van Lith and forward Maddy Westbeld – have had difficult seasons, despite being exceptional talents.Even the draft has become a symbol of mismanagement. This year, Chicago passed on Sonia Citron, who blossomed into a rookie All-Star elsewhere, instead trading her rights – along with a future first-round pick – for Ariel Atkins, a veteran likely to leave in free agency. The Sky mortgaged their future for nothing, while their young stars struggled through another losing season.It is little wonder that fans are already debating where Reese might play next year. Pairing with the Wings’ Paige Bueckers or even Clark at the Indiana Fever – a move that would send the internet into meltdown – are fantasy scenarios, but the point is simple: Reese has options. She is a proven star, still only at the beginning of her career, and she deserves an organization that treats her with the respect she has earned.If Reese decides she’s had enough of the Chicago Sky, no one should be surprised. The blame won’t fall on her. It will be squarely on an organization that seems intent on driving its best players away.Explore more on these topicsChicago SkyWNBABasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

He had won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Joel on thebeautiful and underrated TV showSomebody Somewhere.Partly, the squeals were from pure shock. I don’t think anyone on god’s green earth considered that he might win, least of all Hiller, who on the red carpet before the announcementmutteredto an interviewer: “We both know I’m not going to win.” He was up against big-name actors, including Harrison Ford, and Somebody Somewhere was tiny compared to the juggernaut shows his competitors starred in.Hiller was asked beforehand what it would be like for him to win. It was not the usual false modesty from actors about the honour just to be nominatedwhen he said: “For me, getting nominated is the prize – I was playing people without names before this.”When his name was read out, my squeals were mirrored around the globe, including by the three other gay men in his category, who alllooked first shockedand then genuinely delighted for him.Bowen Yang, Michael Urie and Colman Domingo react to losing the Emmy to Jeff Hillerpic.twitter.com/7zVJwybXL7— Principe (@Pri_Letterman)September 15, 2025Part of that response is because of how great he is on the show, playing the pure-hearted Joel. He is so gangly and giggly and full of love, a perfect foil to Bridget Everett’s more dry and down vibe. Joel is a big change from Hiller’s previous roles, which he described as “mean waiters and flight attendants that took away your bag”, but turns out he’s brilliant at both. He is finally getting the moment he deserves.It’s been a long, long, long time coming, almost as long as he is (nearly 2 metres). Jeff is 49 and has been a working actor for decades, churning out a career piece by piece. As he said inhis speech:“I feel like I’m going to cry, because for the past 25 years, I have been like, ‘world, I want to be an actor!’ And the world was like, ‘maybe computers?’”We were treated to two incredible moments in one night: 58-year-old Katherine LaNasa won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her excellent performance as nurse Dana in The Pitt. Similar to Hiller, she has been steadily working away as an actor for decades, all to appear “out of nowhere” and win the Emmy. Now her career is set up, or at the very least, she has a few years of security and well-paying work ahead. The dream.Ben Affleck has dated more Jennifers than there are famous Rebeccas. It’s time for us to rise up | Rebecca ShawRead moreFor me, a 42-year-old comedy writer who aims high and continues to hobble and cobble pieces of a career together, these moments are priceless to witness. It sometimes feels like if you haven’t gained huge success by 30, you should think about walking into the sea. Seeing Jeff and Katherine up there will keep me on the shore for a while. Sorry to my enemies, but little boosts like this help stop me from abandoning my dreams (along with my girlfriend threatening to break up with me if I do) and moving to the woods to fulfil my destiny of becoming a scary hag woman.It’s not that I then assume I’ll “make it”, whatever that even means in the dwindling landscape of television and art and needing 2m TikTok followers to get jobs. But it is a helpful reminder that there are still people out there getting their just rewards for The Slog. The people who don’t fit a template, who struggle to find their place, but who keep showing up,dogetrewarded occasionally. The rest of us who also exist outside a mould feel it too.It’s the dream not just because these two actors have been working hard, chipping away at the industry and have now gained success, but also because they achieved this success with work that is meaningful. LaNasa’s win comes after she underwent treatment for breast cancer in 2023, which gave a special tinge to her role in medical drama The Pitt. To see her have this moment, and to see a lanky 49-year-old gay man rewarded for a show like Somebody Somewhere is heartwarming.There’s something deeply affirming, borderline medicinal, about seeing these wins. Like countless others trying to “make it”, I have worked hard and will keep working hard. When Hiller and LaNasa won, it wasn’t just a victory for them. It was a victory for all of us on the grind – and I will be there squealing next time too.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsEmmys 2025OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

We know there will be a quid pro quo; we just don’t know what it is yetThu 18 Sep 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 15.01 EDTSharePeter Kyle, until two weeks ago the technology secretary, once warned that tech companies such as Meta, Google and Microsoft were so powerful that the UK needed to approach them with“a sense of statecraft” and “humility”, and treat negotiations with them similarly to diplomacy between nations. That vision endures in the form of theUK-US tech prosperity agreementstruckthis week. While officially a new bilateral partnership, this seems to be a deal aimed at facilitating investment from US technology companies rather than advancing collaboration on goals such as AI safety, copyright protections for British rights holders or a digital services tax.The rationale is clear: US firmsstand aloneatop the global AI value chain, making the country an obvious partner for a UK government seeking to“turbocharge” its AI sector. Against a challenging economic backdrop, the promise of “a combined £31bn”in support for UK AI infrastructuresuch as datacentres offers welcome headlines.The potential challenges are nonetheless also pronounced. We know that the publicharbours concernsabout the motivation of these companies and theirincreasing entanglementwith the British state. And they may reasonably have questions about this deal, too: in particular the quid pro quo that comes with investment from big tech. The firms making these pledges are not charities, and it remains unclear what local communities inareas such as Blyth, in Northumberland, will see in exchange for offering up their land and grid capacity.AI will make the rich unfathomably richer. Is this really what we want? | Dustin GuastellaRead moreIn the US itself, datacentre developments have led torising energy billsanddisrupted water supplieswhile supportingremarkably few jobs. It is unsurprising, then, that existing plans for a new “hyperscale” datacentre in Buckinghamshire have encounteredlocal oppositionandlegal pushback. To ensure its new “AI growth zones” are not beset by similar controversy, government will need to provide assurances that energy resources and other assets staked for private investment will produce returns for local economies – and to the public purse – rather than just powering profits abroad.Then there is the opportunity cost associated with prioritising US tech over domestic alternatives. Liz Kendall, Kyle’s successor as technology secretary, hasdescribed the new partnershipas a “vote of confidence in Britain’s booming AI sector”, although few of the companies involved are based – let alone owned – in Britain. Investment from US companies does not need to be zero-sum, but without deft management it risks crowding out any green shoots of growth in the UK’s own tech sector. Entrenching reliance on US technologies at the most lucrative parts of the AI value chain would leave UK firms to fight over the leftovers.It’s true that the UK lacks the scale and resource advantages of the US, and therefore the ability to participate in cutting-edge AI development on its own: from this perspective, US investment is essential. Yet our international peers – from the EU’s “EuroStack” movement to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s Brazil – have charted alternative paths to bolster sovereign capabilities and create the conditions for domestic tech firms, small and medium-sized enterprises andtruly public alternativesto flourish.All of this is downstream of the most important issue: what is the government’s vision for AI beyond doing it bigger and faster? There is too often an implicit assumption that AI will be socially and economically transformative,with the suggestion that“millions of patients could receive life-saving treatments faster” only the latest in a series of ill-defined and poorly evidenced claims. The subtext is that the promised land is in sight – but that only the investments and regulatory changes demanded by large technology companies will get us there. This, however, is precisely backwards: policymakers should instead consider what AI could tangibly achieve for people and society, and from there ask what technological investments are necessary.When the question is posed in this way, the answers seem less obviously congenial to the profit margins of the largest incumbent firms. There may, for instance, be substantial public value to be squeezed out ofprevious-generationfoundation models, which are far less costly to procure and run. The success ofChina’s DeepSeekdemonstrates the potential for the UK of a “fast follower” model whereby instead of begging for scraps from big tech’s table, we wait and see what innovations will yield the most value, and pursue cost-effective ways of doing it ourselves.Achieving this will involve the canny use of public resources to pluralise AI research and build independent capacity. The good news for our new secretary of state is that the seeds of this agenda already exist. The government’ssovereign AI unitcould be tasked with supporting alternative research paradigms. Public compute and data resources such as the new AI Research Resource and National Data Library could implementaccess policiesthat favour smaller organisations, public entities and nonprofits. To ensure that public subsidies are not simply hoovered up by big tech, measures could also be taken to reduce talent and intellectual property drain andpredatory corporate partnerships, with robustregulatory actionencouraged when necessary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is nothing short of betrayal to farmers around the country and the generations who come after us. The climate chaos described in Australia’s first Climate Risk Assessment is not inevitable, but with a weak target like this it pushes us towards a future no one wants or deserves.The climate crisis is already devastating Australian agriculture. Farmers are facing hotter summers, longer droughts, devastating floods and increasingly unpredictable seasons. These shocks are not just hitting the farm gate; they’re flowing through to supermarket shelves, pushing food prices higher for every Australian family.The Climate Risk Assessment lays out the risks in stark detail: heat stress in livestock slashing productivity and animal welfare; horticulture yields dropping as fruit literally burns on the tree; cropping regions in Western Australia and south-east Australia facing declining rainfall; irrigation systems struggling under dwindling water supplies. Biosecurity threats are set to rise, and dangerous heat is already cutting into agricultural jobs and output. Farmers see the realities of climate change playing out in real time.2:23Australian government announces 2035 emissions reduction target – videoFarmers and rural communities are on the frontlines of climate change, and that’s why we need every sector playing its part, especially the heavy polluting energy sector. Every new coalmine and gas project adds pollution that heats our atmosphere, and these emissions make it harder for farmers to keep producing the food we all rely on. A weak emissions target suggests that the government has more interest in protecting profits from coal and gas corporations and exports than in the safety of Australians.A stronger target means more jobs and investment in rural Australia, it means fewer disasters and a more productive food system. Farmers are already leading with renewable energy, soil carbon projects, and regenerative practices. They’re showing what a low-pollution future can look like. To keep Australians safe from worsening climate harm and unlock opportunities in rural communities, the government needs to strengthen its policies and deal with the polluting fossil fuel industry. We need to move quickly, sensibly, and together. Australia can cut pollution, safeguard our farmers, stabilise food prices, and seize the enormous opportunities of a clean economy. That’s a future worth fighting for.Dr Anika Molesworth, a farmer and agricultural environmental scientist, is a founding director of Farmers for Climate ActionResources: if we are to reduce emissions we must measure them effectivelyTheresources sector planfocuses on decarbonising existing emissions through electrification, using low carbon fuels, and reducing fugitive emissions. While it outlines the technical mechanisms to do this, the policies to actually make this happen are limited. They often rely on government outlays and direction rather than the market incentives that would come with pricing carbon.For example, it is cheaper to use diesel in mining site equipment and vehicles, and this diesel does not pay excise because diesel excise is seen as a road user charge and the resources sector use is off-road. Those seeking to use clean rather than diesel fuel are at a competitive disadvantage without a mechanism to charge for the damage to the environment caused by diesel.Albanese’s Oprah-style emissions target aims to please almost everyone but risks falling short on climate actionRead moreThere are widespread concerns with the current approach to the measurement of fugitive emissions. We often rely on outdated benchmarks rather than actual measurement at site verified by satellite technology. If we are to reduce our emissions we need to measure them effectively.The resources sector currently often relies on land use offsets to meet its emission reduction obligations under the safeguard mechanism. We need to take further steps to ensure their integrity, yet the sector plan does not seem to focus on this.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterOf further concern is the heavy reliance on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which are unlikely to occur as this technology is high-cost and unproven in many applications. The examples given of where it is successful are where it is used to extract more gas from an existing reservoir.Finally, the plan doesn’t appear to connect with the other sector plans and the Treasury modelling which show large declines in coal-fired electricity generation beyond 2030, which is an important way we can reduce emissions.Rod Sims is the chair of theSuperpower Instituteand enterprise professor at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, faculty of business and economics, University of Melbourne.

Such a “renovation wave” would have the double benefit of reducing emissions andsaving householdsthousands of dollars from their energy bills every year.The energy performance of our 11m homes can be measured on the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS). This spans from “zero stars” for the worst possible performance to 10 stars for a super “eco-home”. In 2022, the minimum performance required for a new home increased from six stars to seven stars, which should reduce heating and cooling energy needs in a new house by11-27%. However, while new homes have improved, ourexistinghomes remain leaky,uninsulated and energy-intensive.Over halfof all existing Australian homes have a NatHERS rating below two stars, meaning there’s an urgent need for improvement – for our health and the environment.We also need to reduce the emissions from the materials we use to build, and the construction process itself. This is called “embodied carbon” and is responsible for about10% of all Australian greenhouse gas emissions. Embodied carbon is rarely measured and entirely unregulated in Australia – except recently in New South Wales. What’s more, the emissions from many of the building materials we commonly use, such as cement, steel, glass and plasterboard, don’t come from electricity, but from chemical and heat-related manufacturing processes, making them difficult to decarbonise. The sector plan calls for the use of lower carbon materials – but other strategies such asbuilding smaller homes, and adaptively reusing existing buildingswill also be necessary. In 2024 building ministers agreed on a voluntary pathway for commercial buildings to report their embodied carbon. However, if we have any hope of reducing built environment emissions by 70% by 2035, regulating and capping embodied carbon emissions (like France, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands have already done) will be a much-needed next step.Philip Oldfield is the head of UNSW’s school of the built environment and a researcher in sustainable and low-carbon architectureIndustry: big progress is possible – with smart supportIndustry will need to contribute to the 2035 targets, but “industry” is a complex, diverse category and one size won’t fit all. There are big cross-cutting challenges like process heat and heavy vehicles – both eventually solvable with a mix of electrification and renewable fuels, though neither replacing major capital equipment nor paying higher fuel costs is easy. But a lot of challenges are very specific to industry subsectors: dealing with eroding carbon anodes in aluminium smelting, how to cleanly reduce iron ore for steel, shifting the mix of inputs and storing or using the carbon output in cement-making, and many more. Technical solutions are visible but often not yet tangible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Policy will have to help in many ways beyond the useful but limited funds announced today. The safeguard mechanism gives a growing carbon value signal, and it will get deeper and likely broader. But business will need a level playing field, so they don’t lose ground just because they face a carbon constraint while their competitors ride free. “Border carbon adjustment” is being rolled out in Europe to ensure equal treatment in critical sectors like cement, and Australia should develop its own approach while respecting our trade commitments.While the safeguard covers most industrial emissions, most individual facilities are too small to be part of it and will never be a good fit. They’ll need different kinds of help to transition: for example, policies more like the “white certificate” schemes to credit energy efficiency and fuel switching that New South Wales and Victoria operate today.Some of industry’s diverse transitions will stretch well beyond 2035. But big progress is possible – with smart support and a focus on building competitiveness.Innes Willox is chief executive of the Australian Industry GroupTransport: we have technological solutions but not the policies to get us thereThetransport sector planreleased on Thursday doesn’t have a target for emissions reduction for the sector. That’s a shame – it’s difficult to design policy well without understanding what we’re aiming at.Transport emissions have grown by 14m tonnes or 18% since 2005. The biggest increases have been in aviation (up 68% since 2005) and light commercial vehicles (up 62% since 2005).This happened because we are flying more often, and increasingly buying personal cars that count as “light commercial” – think big 4WD utes.The CSIRO’s work for the Climate Change Authority estimates that transport emissions could be reduced by 20% by 2035, with most of this coming from road transport.Three policies act on transport emissions at the moment: the fringe benefits tax exemption for electric cars, the safeguard mechanism, and the new vehicle efficiency standard.What is a climate target, and how does Australia’s new one for 2035 stack up against other countries?Read moreBut between these three policies, only 11% of transport emissions are subject to a constraint.The holes in policy are for heavy vehicles – we need incentives for truck owners to switch to cleaner sources, but also more attention on the logistics of providing them with alternative fuel sources. We need charging infrastructure for electric trucks, both at depots and along highways; and we need upgrades to electricity infrastructure to support that. There’s almost no supply chain at the moment for alternative fuels such as biodiesel, and there is no incentive to use alternative fuels. Meanwhile, fuel tax credits provide a disincentive to switch and there’s uncertainty over road user charging. The government announced a $1bn package for low-emissions fuels on Wednesday but we’re yet to see the detailed policy design.Bottom line: the destination is clear, the technological solutions are clear, but it’s a long journey, and we don’t have the right policies yet to get us there.Alison Reeve is the energy and climate change program director at the Grattan InstituteElectricity and energy: there is no excuse for a lack of ambitionDramatically expanding the share of renewables in our electricity system is fundamental to achieving our emission targets. If we can’t decarbonise electricity then we’ll struggle to also reduce emissions from transport and heating of buildings and manufacturing processes, which both hinge on a switch to electric power.Unfortunately, the Albanese government is encountering significant difficulty delivering on its target to grow renewable energy to 82% of power supply by 2030. We’re doing reasonably OK on rooftop solar, extremely well in expanding battery capacity, but falling abysmally short on wind and solar farms due to inadequate transmission links. Yet while we might fall short on targets for 2030, this is no excuse for a lack of ambition on 2035 targets. It is extremely hard to transform the electricity sector within five years because it takes at least five years to plan and build new transmission lines. A 10-year timeframe, however, dramatically expands the scope for change. In addition, rooftop solar drives change by steadily accumulating in small increments, rooftop by rooftop. Over the space of 10 years that can add up to a very large amount of power.But there is also no time to waste. To speed things up the Albanese government must expand its policy suite to options that don’t rely on new transmission lines. This means instituting new policy measures to help households and businesses become more energy efficient and install more rooftop solar. In particular, it has to find a way to push (not just encourage) landlords to upgrade rental properties.We still need to push on with the rollout of wind and solar farms as well. For a small proportion of the population this will mean their rural view will be obscured by transmission lines and wind turbines. That’s unfortunate, but what’s the alternative?Tristan Edis is the director of analysis and advisory at GreenEnergyMarketsExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionRural AustraliaMiningBusinessTransportEnergyAgriculturecommentShareReuse this content"

It is AI.The UK publishing industry – worthmore than £11bn, part of the £126bn that our creative industries generate for the British economy – has sat by while big tech has “swept” copyrighted material from the internet in order to train their models. Recently, the AI startup Anthropicsettled a $1.5bn copyright caseover this issue, but the ship has undeniably left the harbour and big tech is sailing off with the goods.As a literary agent and CEO of one of the largest agencies in Europe, I think this is something everyone should care about – not because we fear progress, but because we want to protect it. If you take away the one thing that makes us truly human – our ability to think like humans, create stories and imagine new worlds – we will live in a diminished world.Many great writers have written about why stories are the lifeblood of humanity and how an artist’s job is to tell us truths we may not want to hear. Having worked with writers such as John le Carré, Elif Shafak, William Boyd and David Nicholls, I know first-hand where great storytelling comes from.Le Carré was born in 1931 and survived a childhood with a conman father and a mother who abandoned him when he was five years old. He came of age as the cold war began. Treachery and betrayal was his childhood and proved – to paraphrase Graham Greene – to be the bank balance of his writing life. During his time with the secret services, it was through writing reports – and getting feedback from senior officers – that he learned to write. His skill was derived from the personal, his upbringing and his craft.View image in fullscreenAuthor John le Carré, real name David Cornwell, at his home in London in 2008.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APGood writing is not a regeneration of other people’s material. It is a recipe made up of having lived a life, experienced trauma and grasped one’s historical context; it is the product ofartistry, craft and passion. The need to write is not something that can be encouraged – it is an illness that descends on the writer. Great writers cannot not write. They may use spellcheck and ChatGPT, but nothing would be more abhorrent to the writer than an idea being served up to them on their computer that they were then invited to “humanise”.AI that doesn’t replace the artist, or that will work with them transparently, is not all bad. An actor who is needed for reshoots on a movie may authorise use of the footage they have to complete a picture. This will save on costs, the environmental impact and time. A writer may wish to speed up their research and enhance their work by training their own models to ask the questions that a researcher would. The translation models available may enhance the range of offering of foreign books, adding to our culture.All of this is worth discussing. But it has to be a discussion and be transparent to the end user. Up to now, work has simply been stolen and there are insufficient guardrails on the distributors, studios, publishers. As a literary agent, I have a more prosaic reason to get involved – I don’t think it is fair for someone’s work to be taken without their permission to create an inferior competitor.What can we do? We could start with some basic principles for all to sign up to. An artists’ rights charter for AI that protects two basic principles: permission and attribution.For instance, no AI system should be trained on an author’s work without their explicit, informed permission. Developers should be required to publish the data sources they have used to train their systems, and be transparent so that copyright holders know when their works have been used. An artist should also be allowedto opt out(and not have to discover the option hidden beneath thousands of pages of terms and conditions).If an artist/writer finds the technology is significantly distorting the meaning of their work, image or creation so that it is unrecognisable from the original, they should be entitled to withdraw permission of its use.We should also introduce a label system – akin to the GM food labels – that prohibit retailers selling AI-generated stories without clear attribution. Equally, copyright must be reinforced and this can only be done at government level and even international one – a G7 of copyright.Finally, tech companies should not be allowed to appeal to “fair use” tojustify their scanning of other people’s work. This presents a real danger to the sanctity of copyright. It distorts the original intention of the “fair use” defence, which was for academics to be able to quote without fees a certain limited amount from copyrighted material.A few simple rules such as these may not seem that important, but they may affect how your children will be educated, how our national stories are told, and how we understand who we are.Jonny Geller is CEO of The Curtis Brown GroupExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionPublishingcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s too narrow a segment of societyThu 18 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 10.27 EDTShareThe Sutton Trust has researchedthe educational backgrounds of Britain’s most influential people – and in one sector in particular, that should ring alarm bells. It seems clear that the British media has a social mobility problem. And despite some recent efforts, it’s not a problem that is going away anytime soon.A high proportion of leading figures in the British media are from private school backgrounds. While only 7% of people attend private school nationwide, our report found half of newspaper columnists are privately educated, along with 47% of political commentators, 45% of leading podcasters and 38% ofBBCexecutives.What’s more, the proportion of privately educated newspaper columnists has actually increased sinceour last report in 2019. In the case of BBC executives, it has jumped by 10 percentage points.It’s striking and somewhat depressing that so many of those providing commentary on the issues affecting British people’s lives – columnists, talking heads and podcasters – are from a private school background, much more so than those whose role is to report news. Furthermore, more than 40% of columnists and political commentators attended Oxbridge, a significantly higher proportion than the rest of the media. Even amid a rapidly changing media environment, these roles have great influence over the perspectives that are shared daily and help to shape the national conversation. They also play a crucial role in holding the government and others to account. But they continue to come from a very narrow segment of society.I had to fight my way through class barriers into my job. Why has so little changed? | Jamie FaheyRead moreEven the emergence of podcasting as a new medium does not appear to be translating to an increased diversity of voices. Many of the most popular podcasts are owned by the big media players and populated with familiar voices from the existing media and political firmament.This report should also raise serious questions for the BBC, at a time when it is under frequent political attack and trying to justify its licence fee. To see those at the highest levels becoming less representative of ordinary Britons is of significant concern. To its credit, the corporation is recognising the issue and has in the pastpublished socioeconomic data for its staff. But it must go further and faster in bringing class into the diversity conversation. Ofcom research found that people from lower socioeconomic groupsare less satisfied with the BBC, with some blaming a lack of representation of normal working-class lives and the prevalence of stereotypes.Of course, editors in all media will be acutely aware of the need to reflect the audiences they serve. Encouragingly, many media organisations – the Guardian included – are now trying to address these structural inequalities and to introduce schemesto encourage greater diversity, including class diversity.However, there are serious headwinds against wider change. The industry is rapidly changing, and aslocal media has collapsedand specialist titles have dwindled, so have many of the entry-level positions that traditionally served as a springboard. It is harder than ever to break into media for those without connections, for example, or opportunities to complete unpaid work experience.Even once in the door, it is a precarious industry, which may put off many of those without a financial safety net. Long-term contracts are becoming rarer, and it is increasingly difficult to make freelancing pay. Addressing these issues will be extremely challenging, but crucial if the industry is to develop a more representative pipeline of talent for the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have included them in our report for the first time this year, and the differences with more established media are stark. Only 18% of this group attended private schools (although still above the national average). And a far greater proportion, 68%, attended state comprehensives, no doubt due to the relative ease of creating content from home and sharing through platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.But it is also likely that talented young people with media aspirations are choosing these routes as more accessible and viable options, as they find traditional doors closed to them.

Now it seems prudent to assess how much that nativism will truly take root hereThu 18 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 11.21 EDTShareThis time last year, I had just moved back to Britain from the US and was enjoying the almost universal envy of American friends. While they were looking down the barrel of a second Trump presidency with its guarantee of chaos and division, we hadelected Keir Starmerby a landslide and were feeling pretty pleased with ourselves. I remember people congratulating me on the prescience of my move, which I absolutely took even though politics hadn’t been part of my decision (not least because, for most of 2024, I had assumed Trump would lose). Anyway, here we are a year later and who’s laughing now?I guess the answer to that is Nigel Farage and his Reform UK party, which has somehow managed to harness the anger, disappointment and shame felt by large numbers of people who voted for and were then let down by Brexit, and are now in search of another fire to light. To this extent, the roots of the rightwing march last weekend and therise of Reformgenerally feel broadly of a piece with their US antecedents: a case, at least in part, of people clutching at anything that promises to rip up a system that has serially failed to reward them. What has felt shocking to many of us this year, however, is how quickly the political landscape seems to have changed in this country, and how a leader as frivolous as Farage could get anyone to follow him anywhere, let alone in the direction of No 10.And by frivolous, I don’t mean in the Trump/Boris Johnson style. You can despise those men while recognising their talent as mass communicators. Farage by contrast is a jackass, a grinning fool roundly mocked to his face by Democrats in Congressearlier this monthwhen he showed up, at the invitation of Republicans, to give evidence before a House judiciary committee on free speech. (Smirking in a way that seemed to poke fun at lingering American assumptions that a British accent makes you cleverer, Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, prefaced his remarks to Farage with a sardonic hat tip to the MP’s “erudition”.)Farage didn’t organise the ‘unite the kingdom’ rally on Saturday, of course; that was Tommy Robinson, the former BNP member with convictions for violence, drug possession and fraud – facts that, British broadcasters were at pains to point out on Monday morning, shouldn’t tar all those who showed up at his march with the same brush. Americans will recognise this as a pivot-point: a parallel moment to that period of Trump’s rise in popularity during which his supporters were given endless sympathetic profiles in the US national press, and invited to explain why following a man who said monstrous things didn’t make them in the least bit venal or monstrous.Meanwhile, the whiplash speed of Reform and Robinson’s rise means that the country Trump is visiting this week is seemingly very different to the one he went into business with in January. There may be a moment when the US president pauses to admire his own work, and he will surely be gratified to see British white nationalists gaining ground. But he is also a man who abhors and is quick to distance himself from “losers” – a category into which, arguably, his pal the prime minister currently falls, and who we can assume he will drop as quickly as he embraced him.For the rest of us, it is a question of waiting to see how much traction our own version of the Maga movement will have. There are crucial differences between the two countries that leave certain large constituencies who came out in the US for Trump without direct British equivalents. British white nationalism nods to the Christian church as an influence, but evangelical Christianity has no purchase in a country where, historically, foxhunting is a bigger wedge issue than abortion. And I can’t see JD Vance’s pronatalist leanings, rooted in his fanatical Catholicism, being much of a goer here, either. In fact – and this may be pure jingoism on my part – Vance strikes me as the type of American who even Britons on the far right might regard instinctively as a creepy little piece. On the other hand, if enough people are willing to pledge allegiance to a thug or an ambitious pub bore, these are differences that may hardly matter.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionKeir StarmerFar rightFar right (US)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But in my experience, one particular issue really does sit at the heart of the UK’s sense of bitter disaffection: social housing, and ourdire lack of it.With good reason, Keir Starmer often rhapsodises about the wonders of home ownership. But putting down a deposit and getting a mortgage remains way beyond many people’s reach, not least at the younger end of the age range. Average rents for new private tenancies, meanwhile, are about 20% more expensive than three years ago. And one stark insistence continues to haunt our politics: the housing charity Shelter’s spot-onclaimthat we need to build 90,000 new social homes a year to convincingly tackle a crisis that will not go away.Whenever I am out reporting, all this is self-evident. In most cities and towns (and, it has to be said, the kind of former Labour heartlands where people are now supporting Reform), a couple of hours of street-level conversations will always bring out people’s desperate yearning for the kind of secure, dependable living arrangements that define happy lives – not least, where relevant, for their children and grandchildren. So why does it still feel like this Labour government is so painfully dragging its feet?As the early Starmer promise of building 1.5 million new homes by the time of the next election starts to look depressingly fragile, there are rays of light: one of the legacies of Angela Rayner’s time in the cabinet is a £39bn social and affordable housingprogrammethat ministers say will deliver at least 180,000 homes for social rentby 2035. That is progress, undoubtedly: it represents a six-fold increase on the number built in the decade to 2024. But note the inescapable meaning of those numbers: notwithstanding this country’s miserable recent policy record, the target amounts to 18,000 a year, which falls far short of the scale of the problem and the speed at which it ought to be tackled.Given the political emergency it faces, is quicker and more thoroughgoing building really beyond the government’s reach? Given the number of Labour local authorities, could it not use the party’s on-the-ground expertise to spark a council housing revival? And if “delivery” is how Starmer and his colleagues intend to tackle Nigel Farage, isn’t this by far the best example?A more ambitious, smarter government would already have started to set aside hundreds of local sites, trumpeted the fact that change was on its way, and contrasted such a clear promise with the empty bluster we tend to hear from the new right. Who knows: it might even have draped the relevant plots with union jacks, and hailed what was afoot as a genuine example of progressive patriotism. Instead, it is still leaving space for the most cynical and opportunistic politicians to tell people that nothing is going to get better, and be believed. Returning to one of Labour’s proudest traditions is surely the best way out of that impasse, but time is fast running out.Control inflation!Ann PettiforAuthor of The Global Casino: How Wall St Gambles with People and PlanetRachel Reeves has my sympathy. The government confronts a national political revolt and a climate crisis while big institutions of the state – the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) – work against her and the interests of the British people. All of this contributes to the rise of Reform UK. My advice is to restore the government as a transformative, democratic “big green state”, rather than a technocratic managerial one serving private wealth. To “kickstart” the economy and restore ecological stability, use the power of Labour’s majority to rewire and restructure powerful institutions.One problem is that the Treasury is wedded to market fundamentalism and austerity, its staff incapable of understanding government debt will only fall when investment and economic activity recover from recent crises. It needs a national economic and environmental strategy, such as those that guide China and Singapore. In fact, Reeves should create a Department for National Strategy to lead public green infrastructure investment that will revive private investment in a weakened, risk-averse economy.The Bank uses its “independence” to protect and bail out private global financial markets. Its current policy ofquantitative tighteningundermines the government’s fiscal policy. High interest rates at a time of economic weakness serve the interests of wealth, increasing the cost of private and public borrowing while failing to quell inflation.The Bank lacks tools and legitimacy to tackle inflation. Labour should transfer that role to a new Inflation Control Office, which could use taxes, price controls and even rationing to lower inflation. Then Reeves should change the Bank’s mandate, radically: to support the economic policy of the government, not the City.The OBR reflects George Osborne’s attack on the democratic legitimacy of the state. Today, this one institution in effect determines fiscal policy. With a new remit the OBR must become the Office of Fiscal Transparency, subordinated to the new Department of National Strategy.Elected successors must alone be its mouthpiece.With the right institutional framework, Labour could begin to right the wrongs of its first year in power.The PM must summon the activist lawyer withinSimon WoolleyPrincipal of Homerton College, CambridgeLabour must reclaim the political and moral high ground on immigration. The stakes could not be higher: this is not only about the shape of our politics, but the soul of the nation.Immigration can and should be debated – there are conversations to be had about gangs who exploit vulnerable people and the minority who commit crime. But that debate must never collapse into hatred of those whose only “crime” is seeking refuge from war-torn countries such as Afghanistan.We are overdue a speech from the prime minister that speaks to the silent majority who reject division. Those words must carry a message of hope: that diversity is Britain’s greatest strength. He should remind us that at our most vulnerable, we are cared for by people from every background – many migrants, many poorly paid – whose compassion, not skin colour, defines them.Yet these truths will ring hollow unless Labour also invests in the communities – often white and working-class – abandoned after the collapse of industry. Into that vacuum step the snake-oil salesmen of nationalism, peddling false solutions. Starmer must summon the activist lawyer within him.

Friends will talk about those scenes, how London was packed with more than100,000 day-tripperschanting “send them back”. Then they’ll say: “It’s the 1970s all over again.” I can almost see their minds playing the old reels of Enoch Powell and the National Front.Being of similar vintage, I too know about abuse in playgrounds and getting chased by skinheads and the house-warming gift of a brick through the window (which the police didn’t deem racist because the motive wasn’t sufficiently explicit – guys, next time wrap it in a memo!). We’re still some way from those days, thankfully, but one important aspect is much worse. Back then, racism was a furtive, guilty pleasure: deep down, even bigots knew their bigotry was ugly. No more.What was striking about last weekend’s march wasn’t the turnout, easily matched by some of the protests about Gaza. It’s the lack of shame, the brazen insistence on an Englishman’s right to make others feel small. It’s the normalisation of what was until recently considered malicious extremism. And a big driver isn’t the crowds down in the street, but the suits in our supposedly progressive government.Whenever confronted with violent prejudice,Keir Starmercoughs, splutters and takes the coward’s way out. He either pretends not to see racism or panders to it.Just over a couple of months ago, in smalltowns across Northern Ireland, migrants were burned out of their homes and a mosque was petrol bombed. The prime minister’s response? First and foremost, he deplored attacks on the police. Muslims deluged with hate and fearing for their lives got only a promise of “every step possibleto keep you safe”. Stripped of rhetorical flourish, this is the bare minimum any citizen might expect from a state. It was much the same from No 10 after last summer’s riots: a huge and often heavy-handed crackdown on law-breaking, and a vast and strategic silence on the prejudice and disinformation that fuelled the savagery.Worse still is when Starmer simpers in the face of prejudice, something he is doing more and more as his approval ratings go further and further south. At the end of last month, Nigel Farage promised mass deportation of practically anyone seeking asylum in this country, even if it meant handing Afghan women over to the Taliban and sending Iranian dissidents to their deaths. To the press, No 10 didn’t so much as raise an eyebrow at the Reform UK leader referring to other humans as a“scourge” or an “invasion”. For the great unwashed, it posted the mostextraordinary advert. “Whilst Nigel Farage moans from the sidelines, Labour is getting on with the job,” it read, showing an image of Starmer stamped with “removed over 35,000 people from the UK”. Why vote for the full-fat hatemongers when diet racists will do the job just fine?Plenty ofLabourpeople will say they aren’t racist at all, and I wouldn’t wish to argue. But one lesson about prejudice I learned fast growing up was to focus on impact rather than quibble about intention. A brick, in other words, is always a brick, whatever the reasons of the clown chucking it.However impeccably liberal Labour ministers might think themselves, they are in effect dabbling in the politics of hatred in order to gain a point or two in opinion polls. Getting thrashed by Reform? Then we’ll get the prime minister to call migration a “squalid chapter” causing “incalculable” damage to Britain. Voters won’t wear that? Then we’ll say the entire speechwas a big mistakecaused by, um, the PM having a lot in his in-tray.For the sake of a few inglorious careers, no tactic is too cheap and every single principle can be chucked out of the window. So after a bit of throat-clearing, No 10 tells the Guardian and other leftwing outlets how worried it is about Saturday’s march of extremists, while sending a minister on TV to tell everyone else that Tommy Robinson’s rally shows free speech is “alive and well”.“The British people have a far more nuanced view of immigration than the media and political narrative would have us believe,” observesNick Lowlesof anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate in his new book, How to Defeat the Far Right. Only one out of 10 Britons is outright opposed to immigration, while many who identify, say, asylum seekers as a huge issue have never met one. Of the top 50 areas in the UK most vehemently opposed to Muslims, Lowles finds that 27 are in the district of Tendring, in Farage’s constituency of Clacton. Yet how much of Tendring’s population is Muslim? Fewer than one out of 200: 0.4%.I left the Tommy Robinson rally with the worrying realisation: this movement is only going to get bigger | Helen PiddRead moreArmed with such findings and a historic majority, Labour could easily counter some of the wild extremism. Ministers might point out that “English patriot” Robinson is an Irish passport-holder (up until last summer, anyway) who hunkers down in Spain and has a list of criminal convictions long enough for a tattoo sleeve. Starmer might observe how much of the UK would simply fall apart without migrants and their children – from your local hospital to the school to the care home. How universities are facing collapse without foreign students and their bumper fees. He might even point out – imagine! – that migrants are human too, with their own lives and dreams for themselves and their families. We could get on to the legacy of empire, and about how the climate crisis and poverty force other populations to move.But who am I kidding? This government would rather entertain a planeload of rich Americans, over here this week to take our landfor their datacentres, our subsidies for their businesses, and demand we alter our tax code for their investors. As for the rest of us, any hope of material improvement is forbidden by “the markets”, “fiscal rules” and of course “asylum seekers”.History has a habit of giving little men big tasks. Joe Biden had one job: to stop Donald Trump returning to power. His failure will have consequences for the world. Starmer’s one historic role is to stave off the hard right. He is not only failing, he is paving the way for Farage and his crew. The supposed “centrists” are ushering fringe politics into the mainstream and normalising the abhorrent.But just listen to the speeches and chants made by the extremists. Robinson no longer talks about small boats; he wants his country back. After years of resisting mass deportations as “impossible”, Farage now touts them as the solution. The Overton window is shifting further and further to the right. The ultimate price for that will not be paid by a politician, but by people far from power: an Ethiopian boy, perhaps, with no family, or an Asian kid looking out the window one evening.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFar rightOpinionTommy RobinsonLabourNigel FarageKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

In the foyer of the venue, 56-year-old Kiran has just arrived from her home in Milton Keynes.“I’d never protested in my life before October 2023,” she says. “It’s been so horrific to see what’s happening inGaza, I felt I had to do something since if you don’t make a stand now, when would you ever? Things might feel futile but this is a way to show the world we care and that we stand together more than we are torn apart.”View image in fullscreenNeneh Cherry performs with Greentea PengKiran is one of the 12,500 people attending Together for Palestine, a marathon four-hour musical and activist fundraising event for the civilians currently undergoing the horrors of war and genocide in Gaza. The brainchild of producer and composerBrian Eno, tonight’s concert has been 18 months in the making and its tickets sold out after only two hours. The evening features over 70 performers raising funds for the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund, Palestinian Medical Relief Society and charity Taawon.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenEric Cantona (L) and Brian Eno (R)View image in fullscreenJamie xx and Sama AbdulhadiInside the cavernous arena, a few hundred early arrivals begin to take their seats and standing positions in the pit as British producer Jamie xx and Palestinian DJSama’ Abdulhadiplay back to back, an enlivening mix of Arabicmaqamvocal melody, hammering kick drums and skittering synths.“I felt I had to bring my seven-year-old son Louis with me today as this is a defining moment in history,” Tom, 43, says over the fast-paced breakbeats as Louis clutches a bottle of water. “I know he might not remember this when he grows up but I hope the world and the people of Palestine know that we are here.”View image in fullscreenCelesteAs the show kicks off proper with a rousing introduction by comicGuz Khan, actorRiz Ahmedhighlights the diversity in the crowd. “I was raised here in Wembley and seeing you all tonight, this is what community looks like,” he says. “While world leaders and governments let the people of Palestine down, we will not.”Claire, 71, echoes the need to show solidarity together. “I’m here with my husband and daughter and we’re based in Hampshire, where no one around us talks about what’s happening in Gaza,” she says. “It’s wonderful to be with other people who feel like us and to hopefully show the people of Gaza they haven’t been forgotten. My husband Nigel has been protesting since the 70s – it’s ongoing work.”View image in fullscreenElyanna and her brother FerasView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBastille (L) and King Krule (R)Early performers Hot Chip and Ibibio Sound Machine strike an upbeat, hopeful mood with their trance-infused track Melody of Love and a blast of 90s house standard Sweet Harmony. It’s a joyous vibe that carries on through the London Arab Orchestra’s stirring medley featuring Damon Albarn and a showstopping performance from Palestinian singer-songwriter Saint Levant, who transforms the arena into a makeshift wedding reception as the audience whips flags above their heads.The testimony from aid workers and Palestinians between songs provides a deeply moving counterpoint, with journalist Yara Eid recounting the death of her family members and partner in solemn detail and surgeon Dr Victoria Rose reading a message from a colleague still on the ground in Gaza who is struggling to survive, never mind perform vital medical duties. A huge screen behind her displays the names and images of medics who have been killed, while paintings by 25-year-old Palestinian artistMalak Mattarshow wide-eyed images of children tenderly embracing each other.View image in fullscreenPalestinian doctors on stage“I’m proud to be Jewish and I feel it’s my duty to be here and say that what is happening in Gaza right now is not in our name,” Nathan, 31, says in the foyer after Dr Rose’s speech. “It is a genocide and I condemn it in the strongest terms. I hope this show of solidarity tonight can bring people together and show the world that so many more of us are for Palestine than against it.”As well as the advertised performances, there are several surprise appearances added to the evening’s proceedings. Over video link, a reformed Portishead perform an especially downbeat, affecting rendition of 1994’s Roads, while Richard Gere appears on stage to recount how he was last at Wembley to celebrate Nelson Mandela and protest apartheid. “I’m back here now because I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” he says. “Trump could stop this in one day – if he wants the Nobel peace prize, this is what he needs to do.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFlorence Pugh and Jameela Jamil (L), Mehdi Hasan, Louis Theroux and Amelia Dimoldenberg (R)View image in fullscreenAdnan JoubranEno’s own all-star performance with Paul Weller and Nadine Shah meanwhile features a moving reading of Palestinian poet Khaled Juma’s poemOh Rascal Children of Gaza, written in 2014 to mourn the 550 children killed that summer, and oud player Adnan Joubran’s lyrical, hypnotic playing adds a touch of virtuosity to their stage time, meandering effortlessly over the band’s otherwise heavy guitar distortion.View image in fullscreenFans watch the performancesIn fact, as much of the evening plays through despairing testimony, tender performances and quiet introspection, it is the breadth and depth of Palestinian artistry on display that provides hope. Pianist Faraj Suleiman’s fiery jazz fusion is delightfully proggy and strange, veering from theatrical chord stabs to intricate, fast-paced runs along the keys, while rapper El Far3i’s acoustic guitar and rhythmic vocal performance alongside actor Guy Pearce and poet Inua Ellams produces a poignant tribute to the dead Palestinian men often unaccounted for in official figures.View image in fullscreenThe crowdWest Bank-born singer Nai Barghouti steals the show with her full-throated, indefatigable vocals. She performs melismatic Arabic scales on a folk standard, as well as keening phrases on theneyflute and soars through her own composition,If I Must Die, which was written to the poem of the same name by the late Palestinian doctor Refaat Alareer. As she ululates to screams from the audience, she dedicates her performance to the memory of five-year-old Palestinian girlHind Rajab, underscoring the fact that while the horrors of the war continue and lives are meaninglessly lost, the legacy of Palestine’s culture lives on and cannot be destroyed.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warActivismBrian EnoGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now the star of Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film is creating a buzz in HollywoodThu 18 Sep 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 14.03 EDTShareTeyana Taylor is – as she often says to interviewers – the entertainment equivalent of “a Glade plug-in” air freshener: put her in “any socket” and she will make “every room smell good”. And, at 34, she has the CV to prove it. After kicking off her career at 15 as a choreographer for Beyoncé (she later showcased her own moves to millions in the headline-grabbing video for Kanye West’s 2016 single Fade), the New York native began making her own critically acclaimed, cutting-edge R&B. She has also acted in a slew of movies and TV shows – including an award-winning turn as a mother who kidnaps her son from the care system in 2023’sA Thousand and One– and worked as a creative director for brands and a host of other musicians.But Taylor also likens herself to another household item. “I am a sponge,” she says. “I’m never above being a student.” This was especially true on the set of her latest project, Paul Thomas Anderson’s vigilante group caper One Battle After Another. Observing castmates including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro – plus the director himself (to many, the greatest of his generation) – turned her into “SpongeBob SquarePants. I get to have my notebook and take all these notes and soak everything in.”Having seen her in action as the film’s swaggering, libidinous revolutionary Perfidia Beverly Hills, it is extremely difficult to imagine Taylor hunched in the corner between takes, scribbling down acting tips. On screen, she is absolutely cocksure, whether demanding fellow vigilante Ghetto Pat (DiCaprio) have sex with her on a car bonnet in the two minutes before the bomb they’ve just planted explodes, instructing Penn’s Colonel Lockjaw at gunpoint to get an erection, or firing off rounds with a machine gun resting on her heavily pregnant stomach before proclaiming: “Bitch! I felt like Tony Montana!”That priceless line was Taylor’s own. Anderson, she says, would frequently ask her to “do that thing that you do”, which meant “stop worrying about your lines” and “add my extra little spice to it”. Anderson had been impressed by her performance in A Thousand and One, she says. He ran the idea of casting her by DiCaprio, “knowing that me and Leo is cool” (the pair became pals after meeting a few years ago at Diana Ross’s birthday party). The punt paid off: the film’s first act relies almost entirely on Taylor’s ability to channel an alarming maelstrom of lust, fury, recklessness and righteousness in a crop top and cargo pants. She pulls it off with aplomb.When we speak, Taylor is in her hotel room in LA; One Battle After Another had its premiere in the city a couple of days earlier, generating instant Oscar buzz. Steven Spielberg describing it as “insane” and “really incredible” certainly helped. Taylor is thrilled: “That means he knows who I am, he knows what I look like!” she says with hushed disbelief.Soon, many more will know. One Battle After Another is likely to be one of the season’s biggest blockbusters – the car chases alone are worth the price of admission – but as you’d expect from Anderson, whose eclectic oeuvre includes Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood and Phantom Thread, this is by no means standard Hollywood fare. Loosely based on Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel Vineland, it combines political satire, stoner comedy, social realism and slick heist-film styling to chronicle the activities of the French 75, a fictional revolutionary gang who liberate immigration camps and rob banks for funds, before fast-forwarding 16 years to the moment when Perfidia’s daughter is kidnapped.View image in fullscreen‘I was always in go mode’ … Taylor performing in 2021.Photograph: Scott Dudelson/Getty ImagesAs a protagonist, Perfidia is morally ambivalent, to put it mildly (the clue’s in the name), and it is her relationship with Penn’s brutal yet pathetic wannabe white supremacist that triggers the action. “I think she’s badass, I think she’s complex, I think she’s selfish,” is Taylor’s take on Perfidia. What about her baffling dalliance with Lockjaw? She lets out a short laugh. “I mean … that is so toxic. Was it manipulation, or was it just lust, or was it her falling for the bad guy? You never really know with Perfidia,” she says, sounding a little confounded.Perfidia’s other big, bewildering decision is to walk out on her baby and resume her violent activism, informing a horrified Pat: “I put myself first and reject your lack of originality.” It’s not the easiest move to empathise with, and Taylor, who has two daughters with her basketball player ex-husband Iman Shumpert, struggled to act it out. “It was one of the most difficult scenes for me to film without getting emotional. Just imagining myself walking out on my child, that’s a lot. Me personally, in real life, I wouldn’t do that.”Yet like Perfidia – who is clearly at a low ebb after giving birth – Taylor also struggled with her mental health in early motherhood. “I’ve been in survival mode before, I’ve dealt with postpartum depression. I know what it feels like to not receive grace and compassion [when you are] categorised as strong. Especially for black women, it’s just like: you’re a strong black woman. What does that even mean? Just because I’m strong doesn’t mean I don’t have moments of weakness, or moments of needing to feel heard and seen.” She commends Anderson “so much for spreading awareness” of postpartum depression.View image in fullscreen‘I’ve been in survival mode before’ … Taylor and Leonardo DiCaprio in One Battle After Another.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros PicturesUnlike the film’s bomb-dispensing, gun-toting vigilante, Taylor has been able to incorporate motherhood into her work. In 2020, she announced her retirement from music, having felt hemmed in by the industry (“thrown in a box where music is everything, you can’t do nothing else – and that’s not me”), only to return this August with a new collection of sultry R&B co-released by her own label. Escape Room, which deals with Taylor’s divorce, ends with a congratulatory message from her nine-year-old (“The world loves you so much / Thank you for coming back to music and back to you”). When she first heard her daughter’s words, Taylor “broke down. Her emotional intelligence is out of this world,” she says, describing her relationship with her children as “the purest form of love”.Both Taylor’s daughters – her youngest is five – already remind her of herself as a child (“Oh my God, this is what I was doing when I was five, this is what I was doing when I was nine”), but she wants them to keep their options open. “I’m not the parent who is like: ‘I did this so you have to do this too.’ So right now they’re in ballet, they do basketball, they dance, they sing, my youngest is a fashionista. At one point my daughter wanted to play drums. I got her a drum set. At another point she wanted to be a chef; OK, here’s the tools you need. They want to be a janitor? Here’s a broom.”View image in fullscreen‘As a 15-year-old, I had the opportunity to be around some of the most creative people in the industry’ … Taylor at the Met Gala in 2025.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesTaylor, on the other hand, always knew she wanted to be in show business. She describes her younger self as “a character. I was a bossy little thing, I always wanted to direct something.” Yet her experience was limited to singing and dancing around her local neighbourhood, “and Harlem is small”. Things changed abruptly in her mid-teens. “One of my mom’s good friends worked at Universal [Music] and I remember skateboarding back home and I ran into him on the block. He stopped me and was like: ‘Listen, you’re talented, you’re fly, I want you to meet my boss and I want you to sing to him.” When the record executive in question asked who she admired, she saidPharrell Williams. “And it’s so crazy, because the guy happened to be really close with Pharrell. So I met Pharrell and got signed on the spot [to his label] and everything happened from there.”It was a fairytale beginning – she released her first single, Google Me, at 17 – but Taylor never got swept up in the fantasy of overnight fame. “It was surreal, but I was always in go mode – I never got lost on that. I’m from Harlem, I’m a hustler, I’m a grinder. I’ve always been this little businesswoman.”Taylor spent the rest of her teens and early 20s as a protege, first for Williams, thenKanye West, whose label she signed to in 2012. She didn’t mind the dynamic. “I was their artist but we built an adult friendship and respect for each other in the fashion space as well. That’s how me and Ye got cool, we were fashion friends,” she says. “Being able to have those men in my life has really shaped me: imagine this 15-year-old girl already having this mind full of creativity and then have the opportunity to be around some of the most creative people in the industry. That’s a cheat sheet right there.”One Battle After Another review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s thrillingly helter-skelter counterculture caperRead moreYet in some ways her success has been a slow-burn: two decades on from that street-corner collision, it finally feels as if Taylor is taking off. Soon, she’ll star in Ryan Murphy’s hotly anticipated legal drama All’s Fair alongside Kim Kardashian, and in Kevin Hart’s action thriller 72 Hours. She’s also been hand-picked by Dionne Warwick to play her in a biopic. Next year she will direct her first feature film, about a New York dance crew.“As people we fly a plane,” she says. “And that air may be turbulent. The runway might be too crowded so you got to circle around for a few minutes. You might have an emergency landing. But ultimately the goal is to make it to the destination.” Taylor’s love of a career-based metaphor may know no bounds, but her combination of swagger and conscientiousness is infectious. Musician, actor, dancer, director, air freshener, sponge, pilot: Teyana Taylor can be anything she sets her mind to.One Battle After Another is released on 25 September in Australia, and on 26 September in the UK and USExplore more on these topicsFilmR&BPharrell WilliamsKanye WestFilm adaptationsPaul Thomas AndersonPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Some slightly clunky traditional moments for our two leading males, but also a few exciting ones.10.The Weight of Water(2000)View image in fullscreenCerebral drama … Sean Penn and Elizabeth Hurley in The Weight of Water.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyAt the time, this cerebral and multilayered psychological drama was sympathetically received as Kathryn Bigelow’s (possibly permanent) pivot to arthouse-type film-making and away from the high-impact action genre. Catherine McCormack plays a journalist researching the 19th-century murders of Norwegian immigrants, who notices an eerie parallel between a witness to these slayings and herself. An interesting, worthwhile film, though maybe a bit weighty and watery. Audiences would later come to see that, for Bigelow, action was the real artistry.9.Strange Days(1995)This is a head-trippy dystopian thriller with a touch of modish millennial angst, co-written by Bigelow’s former partner James Cameron; the elements of virtual reality chime with the industry’s enduring reverence for Philip K Dick and the film arguably anticipates the debate on AI. In 1999, LA is a futuristic, lawless hellhole, and winsomely creepyRalph Fiennesplays a black-marketeer whose immersive sensory tech allows his customers to experience other people’s thrills, including those of violent crime. Bold and lively, technically sensational but maybe a bit overwrought and even clumsy.8.Blue Steel(1990)Generations of moviegoers now associate this title with fashion model Derek Zoolander and his most compellingly sexy yet complex facial expression. But Bigelow was there first with this film, co-produced by Oliver Stone, showing the steel of a courageous woman in blue: gutsy rookie cop Megan Turner, played byJamie Lee Curtis. She accidentally kills a criminal whose gun is stolen at the crime scene by a psychopath – this man then embarks on an obsessive affair with Megan, who doesn’t realise how their paths have crossed. The audacity and sheer hardboiled craziness of this movie have won it a place in the hearts of the Bigelow and Curtis fans.7.Zero Dark Thirty(2012)View image in fullscreenTension and thrills … Zero Dark Thirty.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarBigelow’s punchy war-on-terror procedural thriller took on the US special forces’ mission to apprehend, or rather assassinate, al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, who they discovered was hiding out in Abbottabad, Pakistan – with the soldiers nail-bitingly beginning their raid at half past midnight or “zero dark thirty”. Some tension and thrills, undoubtedly, although as the film was releasedmore than a decade after 9/11, critics wondered if any more perspective could have been shone on proceedings. There was also the contentious point about whether usable intel was obtained through CIA torture, a topic that elicited Amy Poehler’s classic line about the film at the Golden Globes: “When it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married toJames Cameron.”6. Near Dark (1987)In her solo directing debut, Bigelow stunned Hollywood with her appetite (and talent) for gonzo mayhem – and gave audiences a neo-vampire freakout that anticipated Abel Ferrara’s own nihilist use of that trope. It was considerably darker and less romantic than the Twilight tales that gripped the industry a generation later. A nervy young cowboy makes out with a mysterious, attractive young woman who, after a playful neck bite, introduces him to her friends – a feral group of undead outlaws who must decide if this newcomer is worthy of being inducted into the gang.5.Detroit(2017)View image in fullscreenA bold, muscular movie … Detroit.Photograph: Album/AlamyA tough, fierce, socially engaged picture on which Bigelow worked with her longtime screenwriter Mark Boal. This was about the Algiers Motel murders, a police-brutality incident that took place during Detroit’s 12th Street riot in 1967. It brought the fraught history of racism into parallel with an episode of musical history – the early career of the soul group the Dramatics.John Boyegaplays Melvin Dismukes, a black security guard who wanted to support the police on a night of disorder but became the intimate and disenchanted witness to white officers’ paranoid racism. And, alongside that, the Dramatics find that their debut concert is cancelled because of the riot, but are then called to a recording session that night. A bold, muscular movie.4.The Loveless(1981)This was Bigelow’s first directorial outing, a joint credit with producer and David Lynch associate Monty Montgomery. It’s an outlaw biker movie that has something of The Wild One or a John Ford western to it, or indeed her later vampire movie Near Dark. The intense youngWillem Dafoeplays biker bad guy Vance who has a passionate affair with a teenage girl (played by Marin Kanter). Her rage-filled dad intervenes, but it soon becomes clear that this girl has an emotional history that Vance does not appreciate and he is going to be used as a weapon in his new girlfriend’s campaign of vengeance and self-harm.3.Point Break(1991)View image in fullscreenCult masterpiece … Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break.Photograph: Album/AlamyThe generic strangeness and uniqueness of Point Break is what makes it a cult masterpiece: an action bromance that is a heist movie … but also a surf movie. (And the surfers are charismatic outlaws like the bikers in The Loveless and vampires in Near Dark.) Keanu Reeves is the dedicated young FBI man with the unimprovable name of Johnny Utah, investigating bank robberies by a gang called the Ex-Presidents (four guys wearing Reagan, Carter, Nixon and Johnson masks). From the culprits’ tan lines, visible on CCTV, and traces of surfboard wax recovered at the scene, he deduces that the robbers are surfers who steal cash to finance their addiction to surfing and other thrill-seeking activities. (Isn’t bank robbing thrilling enough?) So Keanu infiltrates a surfer gang led by the charismaticPatrick Swayzeand, in time-honoured undercover style, finds himself falling under the criminal’s spell.2.A House of Dynamite(2025)Bigelow detonates a megaton action blast with this brutal nuclear Armageddon thriller, closer in spirit to Sidney Lumet’s grim Fail Safe than the satire of Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove. The world’s final 18 minutes before a nuclear missile hits a major American city is replayed three times from the viewpoints of various high-ranking people – finally, that of the stunned and helpless president, played byIdris Elba. The disorientation and unthinkable horror are refined and amplified with each reiteration, with particular emphasis on the high-spending incompetence and mendacity of the military-industrial complex that took the US taxpayer for billions of dollars to no effect.1.The Hurt Locker(2008)View image in fullscreenSuperbly bleak … The Hurt Locker.Photograph: First Light Production/AllstarBigelow’s blazingly powerfulThe Hurt Lockerwas the nearest Hollywood came to a compelling anti-war movie about the retaliatory campaign that followed 9/11. It is about the long, painful, futile endgame in Iraq, asymmetric warfare in which the enemy cannot be engaged in any meaningful sense. Military patrols go round and round in the desert, and endure an almost existential wait to be killed by an IED. Jeremy Renner made his name playing the scary Staff Sergeant William James, a bomb disposal officer who, driven mad by the sheer fatal emptiness of what they are doing, has chosen to disable bombs himself, rather than using robots that can be remotely piloted into the danger zone, and often even refuses to use protective safety gear. Is he simply mad? Or does he want to mainline the craziness of war into his veins. Or does he, in some even more poignant sense, want to reclaim the honour of a soldier’s death in combat? A superbly bleak film that also – as ever with Bigelow – delivers A-grade action and thrills.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedThe Hurt LockerZero Dark ThirtyPoint BreakKathryn BigelowJeremy RennerPatrick SwayzefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s also when the UK,and much of Europe, opens doors usually closed to the public, with various organisations offering rare and free access to architectural gems, cultural institutions, science hubs, courts, palaces, medieval castles, embassies – and houses that you could never afford to own.TheOpen House festival(London),Heritage Open Days(England),Doors Open Days(Scotland),Cadw’s Open Doors(Wales) andEuropean Heritage Open Days(Northern Ireland) have created programmes that celebrate the culture, history and contemporary life of the UK.Here is a selection of participating venues.Abbot House, DunfermlineView image in fullscreenThe ‘pink hoose’ of Dunfermline.Photograph: Abbot HouseThe oldest secular building in Scotland’s ancient capital, dating back to at least the 16th century and known to local people as “the pink hoose”, Abbot House is a glorious melange of architectural styles: gothic tracery windows; a fresco dated to 1571; a 1990s mural by the celebrated writer and artist Alasdair Gray. The house survived thegreat fire of Dunfermlinein 1624 – and has a lot to show for it.Awarded more than £600,000 in various grants, the house is reaching the end of a mammoth five-year restoration effort. The building is not generally open to the public yet (and the top floor is reserved for local artists’ studio space), but will be welcoming visitors this weekend. There’s a coffee shop to have a brew in before exploring the inside or taking a stroll around a beautiful walled garden. There will also be activities for the bairns.20 September, 10am-4pm, no booking required. For more details, clickhere.Granada cinema, LondonView image in fullscreen‘Miss the Tower of London if you have to, but don’t miss this’Photograph: Garry Weaser/the Guardian“Miss the Tower of London if you have to, but don’t miss this” is quite the ringing endorsement from an architecture critic, especially if the critic in question was the Observer’s hard-to-pleaseIan Nairn. This cinema (now, alas, the Buzz bingo hall) from the 1930s is the only Grade I-listed cinema in the UK, and the tenor of its magic is disparate inside and out.The stunning exterior of the building was designed by Cecil Masey in the art deco style, complete with handsome Corinthian columns. But the vast and splendorous gothic-inspired interior is the work of Russian émigré Theodore Komisarjevsky, a stage and theatre director who had also trained as an architect in St Petersburg. Komisarjevsky whipped up a 150ft-long hall of mirrors, an ornate chandelier hanging from a high, coffered ceiling, and a 58ft-wide proscenium. Frank Sinatra and the Beatles have performed on its stage (sadly not together).21 September, 10am-12pm, no booking required.

Square-eyed guests will be able to explore the vaults and take a peek at restoration techniques; the process of digital preservation; iconic film posters; and the thinking that goes into collection development. The archive consists mostly of British material, but international work that has contributed significantly to British cultural life is also stored and preserved. A rare opportunity to go behind-the-scenes of the scenes.For those unable to visit in-person, check out the archive’s meticulous and frequently updatedblog(sample entry:securing Tom Cruise’s legacy).

Lasdun was awarded a Trustees’ Medal by Riba for his gorgeous design, with the citation that the poured concrete and clean lines of the RCP represented “the best architecture of its time anywhere in the world”.For those more interested in medicine than architecture, it is hosting an exhibition,A Body of Knowledge, dedicated to 500 years’ worth of medical texts and books charting the history and innovation of the discipline. Visitors are welcome on a drop-in basis, but there will also be guided tours, and activities for kids on a ticketed basis.20 September, 10am-4pm, drop-in slots or booked tours. For more details, clickhere.Laugharne Castle, LaugharneView image in fullscreenLaugharne Castle, beloved by Dylan Thomas.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyFans of Welsh literature might recognise the Carmarthenshire town of Laugharne by one of its most famous residents, the poet Dylan Thomas. The town almost certainly provided the inspiration for the fictional Llareggub inUnder Milk Wood. Its eponymous castle, originally built in 1116 as a Norman stronghold, overlooks the estuary of the River Taf. The handsome fortress has been much fought over – literally; it changed hands twice during the English civil war.In 1730, an adjacent guesthouse was built on the grounds (called, rather unimaginatively,Castle House– not everybody can have Thomas’s way with words). It was here that Thomas wrote his short story collectionPortrait of the Artist as a Young Dog, and author Richard Hughes completed his 1938 novelIn Hazard. Thomas once described it as “the best of houses in the best of places”. Unfortunately Castle House itself is now privately owned and the interior is not accessible, but the neighbouring ornamental gardens and the castle which inspired him are.20 and 21 September, 11am-4pm. No booking required.

A construction blend of concrete and timber,Edgley’s designpreserved the ancient remnant of a Victorian fruit orchard; the tree is now a central feature of a pretty internal courtyard. Floor-to-ceiling windows flood the interior spaces with light, and the house is environmentally friendly and sustainable, built with zero formaldehyde materials and thermodynamic roof panels. Edgley himself will be on hand to show guests around.20 September, 10am-4.30pm. No booking required. For more details, clickhere.Decontamination suite, Greenham air base, NewburyView image in fullscreenToxic tourism … Greenham’s control tower.Photograph: David Hartley/REX/ShutterstockIn what might prove to be prudent preparation given the current state of the world, this is a chance to visit the old decontamination suite at the former US airbase – home to 96 cruise missiles – made famous by theGreenham Common Women’s Peace Camp. Only one of the few remaining structures,the Control Tower, is usually open to the public, but this weekend the reinforced, blast-proof doors of the decontamination suite are being thrown open. (Well, maybe not thrown.)The decontamination suite was designed to cleanse personnel exposed to nerve agents in the event of a chemical attack. The suite is apparently not suitable for babies, young children and “people who suffer from claustrophobia”. The nearby control tower itself has a cafe and visitors’ centre.20 and 21 September, 11am-3pm. No booking required. For more details, clickhere.Australia House, LondonView image in fullscreenMagical… the largest polling station for Australian federal elections.Photograph: Matt Brown/MattFromLondonAficionados of the top decks of buses who happen to swing by the Strand in central London may have admired this grand, eye-catching Grade II-listed building before. The Australian flag might give away its purpose as the home of the country’s high commission – but it was also once theGringotts Wizarding Bankin the Harry Potter films, thanks to its breathtaking beaux-arts inspired interiors (grandiose staircase, opulent patterned-marble finishes, classical pillars).Designed by a pair offather and son architects, construction began on the building in 1913, but the small matter of the first world war delayed completion, and it was eventually opened by King George V in 1918. Australia House also serves as the largest polling station in Australia’s federal elections – more votes are cast here than any station in Australian states or territories.For obvious reasons the building isn’t usually open to the public, and visitors will have to bring a government-issued form of ID to enter.20 September, 10am-3pm.

Is it true you’vegot into meditation recently?SassyWrapsAbout 12 years ago I had a nervous breakdown, and in therapy I did so much meditation that everything became existential and I thought there was no point to anything. In the last few years I’ve revisited therapy for my mental health but also started to enjoy life. I realised that I hadn’t noticed a lot of my happiest – and saddest – moments until years after the fact. Last year, I looked at old family photos for the first time in 20 years, since my mum passed away. I realised that, by ignoring painful memories, I’d been denying part of myself. I found joy in understanding that everything that happens makes you who you are. It pulled me out of a fog – so the album is about embracing whatever’s happening now. Last year, Ben, James and I fell out for the first time ever, but focusing on the friendship and the positive things we’d shared brought us back together: we could have easily dropped everything and walked away.Did you really take [Slayer drummer] Dave Lombardoto Greggs inTodmorden[West Yorkshire]?gongpaulTodmorden is the UFO sightings capital of Europe! We spent eight days there [in Lapwing studio] and it was hilarious. We took Dave for a curry and a pint, and whenever anyone recognised him they were in disbelief. Below the studio, there’s a nursery. The day we left, the council wrote to the studio asking them to close, because the noise of us playing thrash metal upstairs was traumatising the children.Do you have a favourite tattoo and whatis its significance?JoddietI’ve got loads of ridiculous tattoos, but the one that means most to me is the one on my arm that I got in memory of my mother the year she passed away. It’s from a photo [of my parents] which I couldn’t look at for years, but I put it on my arm and now on the album cover [of Futique], because I’ve resolved my relationship with it. Rather than seeing my mum who isn’t here any more, I see two young people about to start their life together. Every step I’ve ever taken goes back to my parents, so now I see the picture as celebratory rather than sad. It reminds me that I’m an adult now – “He plays guitar with his shirt off … Really?!” – but that picture goes hand in hand with how I ended up where I am.View image in fullscreenL-R: Simon Neil, James Johnston and Ben Johnston of Biffy Clyro.Photograph: Warner Music GroupWhat are your thoughts onMatt Cardle’s version of Many of Horror?stephenw1979At the time [2010], an X Factor pop performer doing one of our songs was seen as blasphemous, which is probably why I liked it. We’ve got the worst name in history and were making weird music to purposely alienate people, and suddenly The X Factor came to us. We said they could cover it as long as they changed the title [to When We Collide], so if you Googled Many of Horror you didn’t get a cover version. I love the fact that [Cardle’s version of] our song became the mainstream Christmas No 1 – it’s one of the most iconoclastic things we’ve done. He did a great job, although the other day we were staying in an Airbnb near rehearsals and the owner said she wanted to show us a video of her young sons dancing to Many of Horror. It was the Matt Cardle version.As well asEmpire State Bastardyou also have alesser-known side project, Marmaduke Duke. Is a third record on the cards?AdamVallelyEvery four or five albums, I need to make music that doesn’t have the weight of expectation – my own – of Biffy songs. Marmaduke Duke are better to talk about than listen to. The first album is acoustic songs, punk songs and drone songs. For the second, Duke Pandemonium, we wore masks and tights and channelled the Bee Gees. It was quite provocative. A third album is 80% finished but I’m now in Biffy mode. Empire State Bastard is atonal noise. Dave Lombardo – the best metal drummer of all time – played with us. During Covid I needed to make something almost everyone I knew would hate. My dad said: “I’ve tried to listen to it, son. I just couldn’t.”Do you remember when you played a swimming pool in Germany?APraiseChorus30Of course we do! We ended up soaking wet on stage and the entire crowd were in the water in their swimming gear. There was some eyebrow-raising sexual stuff going on at the front. It was a memorable show, then at the end I threw my guitar down and leaped off the Olympic-size diving board. I’ve got a great photo of it: it’s the longest I’ve ever spent in the air apart from flying.I’ve watched you go fromsupporting the Cooper Temple Clause in 2002(tickets £5) to WembleyStadium. Do you miss those raw intimate venues or do you prefer arenas?KangafeetTen years ago I’d have said the magic of a small gig can’t be replicated, but you can create a different kind of magic in a big show. We’ve learned so much about the stage show from touring with Muse, Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, but when I was 18 I saw Girls Against Boys with two bass players at Glasgow’s King Tut’s and thought it was the coolest, sexiest thing I’d ever seen. Those gigs change lives. You come out of those shows physically and molecularly transformed. Although the power of a large show can elevate your spirit. I went to see Oasis recently and seeing the joy on people’s faces meant so much. You know you’re getting carried away when you’re watching the support act and going: “Richard Ashcroft’s the greatest singer this country’s ever …” Honestly, man? [laughter] God bless you, Richard. Don’t fight me.View image in fullscreenOn stage in Glasgow last summer.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/RedfernsHow did it feel to finallytop the bill at Download [in 2017]?NotDrivingAMiniMetroDownload’s a weird one for me because I came from metal. I started with Guns N’ Roses, then got into Pantera and all that. Everything I bought back in the day led to Download. It’s one of the few festivals, like Glastonbury, where there’s so much history and you feel the glorious comebacks, the tragedies, the amazing moments. I still think of it as being for legendary bands and to finally headline felt like impostor syndrome. Once we started playing, I thought, “We’re here because we deserve it!” But you never take it for granted and you want to give someone the best show they’ll see all weekend.I’m a big fan, aged 75, from Manchester and love the fact that you sound so Scottish. Was it important to retain your accents and did you encounter any resistance?teemacOn our first couple of records I’ve got an American twang which I’m kind of embarrassed about. When you start off, you impersonate your heroes, and I was inspired by American music. Gradually, I realised that the songs people remember are real, from the heart, and you can’t fake that stuff. It was a huge turning point, and I started singing in my own voice. The only resistance we’ve had is in America – “People won’t understand a Scottish accent” – but if that conversation starts now I can’t be dealing with it.Biffy Clyro: ‘In grief, you feel a dozen different things every day’Read moreWhen I was in a band in Ireland, our singer excitedly told us about your guerrilla“play anywhere” approach to gigging. Am I remembering correctly?kingofthestoneageThat makes us sound a bit more anarchic than we were, but we toured deep Ireland a few times when we were young and if anyone wanted us to play a show, we’d try to make it happen. It’s a bit romantic to call them guerrilla gigs, but we played the Half Moon in Cork to 14 people and a tiny room in Belfast to 12 people. They were some of our most exciting shows at that point, because the people coming really cared. We learned that we’d rather be 100 people’s favourite band than a million people’s 10th favourite. When I look back at our touring schedule or the fact we made three records in three years, I don’t know how we did that, but back then we had energy to burn.I first saw you at theKay Park Tavern, Kilmarnock. Did you opt for the £40 payment or the free bar?darko1979Of course we took the free bar, because we knew we’d drink more than £40 worth of booze. At those gigs there was always some old drunk guy going, “Play some fucking Motörhead!” or something, but it taught us to keep on doing what we were doing. Looking back, it was a bit arrogant at 16 years of age to turn up and play original songs, but people remember that. They don’t remember a set of Led Zeppelin or Oasis covers.Futique is released on Friday.Biffy Clyrowill perform intimate acoustic outstore shows in October beforean arena tourstarts in Belfast on 9 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsMusicFilm & Music reader interviewBiffy ClyroPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

What can it tell us about America today?Jonathan JonesThu 18 Sep 2025 11.16 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 11.17 EDTShareAmerica is descending into violence. The president blames the radical left. Soldiers are sent in to curb supposedly violent protests. The death toll mounts.This is May 1970 and a single month of war, civil war and music has been anatomised by Naeem Mohaiemen in his three-channel film Through a Mirror, Darkly. Mohaiemen had no way of knowing it would open as the US entered a frightening new phase of the second Trump presidency, with the shot that struck down rightwing activist Charlie Kirk echoing through sinister attempts to suppress dissent. Where will it end?Where did it end? You could make the case that this documentary artwork has an optimistic message about America today. Fifty-five years ago, in May 1970, six college students were shot dead – four by the National Guard at Kent State, Ohio, two by local police in Jackson, Mississippi. Then, as now, this seemed a country so divided and angry the result could only be civil war or dictatorship. But that did not happen. US democracy did not collapse, there was no civil war and a free press helped ensure that Nixon’s presidency ended in disgrace.Now that era is bathed in a kind of nostalgia – after all, the music was great. Bob Dylan’s Forever Young and Jimmy Cliff’s Vietnam are on Mohaiemen’s soundtrack while a student choir performs the Neil Young classic Ohio about the Kent State shooting. (“This summer I hear the drumming / Four dead in Ohio”). It was also a virulently cinematic moment. The students were protesting a war not only seen on TV screens every night, but one that would soon become the subject of iconic movies.View image in fullscreenA discussion across three channels … Through a Mirror, Darkly.Photograph: PR IMAGEIn a section on Michael Cimino’s The Deer Hunter, a Vietnamese-American film critic explains that early viewers from the Vietnamese community complained it was inaccurate: American vets were not really lured into backstreet games of Russian roulette in Saigon. But Cimino’s film is of course “metaphorical” rather than literal, she says in its defence, creating poetic images of war’s madness and despair. It is fascinating to watch this discussion across three channels with a talking head interview juxtaposed with clips of Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken playing blue-collar Americans sucked into a meaningless conflict that destroys them all in different ways.This is typical of the work’s openness and complexity. Mohaiemen forgoes a narrator or dogmatic agenda for multiple colliding images that leave you always feeling you are missing something, sowing doubt and ambiguity. One thread concerns the nature of public memory. Who gets memorialised and why? What makes one victim of violence a “martyr” while others are forgotten?He wonders why the white students killed at Kent State were mourned more widely and are remembered more vividly than a Black student and school pupil killed by police at Jackson College in the same bloody month. And why are the 58,220 US soldiers who died in Vietnam remembered with a monument in Washington DC while up to three million Vietnamese deaths are treated as less significant? Such inequalities of grief give this film a restless edge you don’t get in a standard TV documentary.The artist’s passion for archival research and respect for his interviewees leads him, however, to beautifully undermine and complicate his own argument. The very details of what happened at Jackson remain opaque. The police claimed they were fired on by a sniper, but no evidence of this was ever found. One reason, by contrast, that Kent State is so “iconic” is that the National Guard opened fire in broad daylight, surrounded by cameras, with hundreds of witnesses.View image in fullscreenOpenness and complexity … Naeem MohaiemenIn spite of his scepticism about white martyrs, Mohaiemen ends up showing with great power why Kent State haunts modern memory – in a more intimate way than Ken Burns did in his Vietnam documentary. We see it up close here, in enlarged photographs, as eyewitnesses tell the story one more time. After ordering protesters to disperse, National Guard officers huddle to discuss strategy. They then order their men to walk away from the students and, as they seem to retreat, a body of soldiers all turn at the same time, take aim and let loose hundreds of bullets. Students lie dead and dying on the grass. We no longer see it through a glass darkly. We see it face to face.Mohaiemen’s film blows away nostalgia for the era of protest and classic rock. The setting helps.Artangelhas taken over Albany House, a bleak office block that was once home to London Transport Police and has since housed various government agencies. Its sterile aesthetic reminds me of US government building from All the President’s Men.There is no reassurance here about the present. On screen, Tricky Dicky worms his way out of responsibility for the killings by pointing out that the National Guard is under state, not federal, control. But Nixon was just a crook. Trump by contrast uses the National Guard for his own ends. Worse things are just a shot away.AtAlbany House, London, from 21 September until 9 NovemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtArtangelInstallationVideo artVietnam warreviewsShareReuse this content"

No wonder it’s become such a sensation – and that a movie is on the wayJess BaconThu 18 Sep 2025 08.33 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 10.28 EDTShareIt’s often said that the romcom is dead. Kiss goodbye to the crisp charm of Nora Ephron’s freshly sharpened pencil bouquets in the fall, embrace the era of musings on love as nothing more than a maths equation. Then along comes gripping teen romance The Summer I Turned Pretty and it gets us at the first Taylor Swift track.Across its 26-episode run, the adaptation of Jenny Han’s trilogy of novels has won the hearts of millennials who have been desperately yearning for a nostalgic watch to fill the void of 00s romcoms. Reminiscent of rose-tinted love stories of their youth, before dating apps, catfishing and ghosting entered their vocabulary, the show’s potency has been such that Prime Video even issued a warning asking viewers not to use hate speech towards the cast. It isn’t real, no matter how visceral it feels, and the streamer didn’t even wait 24 hours to let fans know that a feature film finale is on the way.There are hopes online that the film holds snippets of Christmas in Paris, a wedding where the bride actually makes it down the aisle and pleas for more scenes with Conrad smiling. A small ask from the surprise hit of the year.If you’ve somehow missed this sensation, it follows Isabel “Belly” Conklin, who in season one is on the brink of 16 when her childlike quirks bloom into beauty (yes, really) and the Fisher brothers, Conrad and Jeremiah, both fall in love with her. As nonsensical as it sounds, the series is an agonising masterclass in modern romance with reflections on identity, grief, betrayal and first loves.Bathed in a Nancy Meyers aesthetic of the quaint coastal town of Cousins, combined with the enduring allure of the most romantic city in Europe, season three is an amalgamation of everything that is poetic about this supposedly dying genre. There’s a love triangle that emerges as the trio grow up together, the will-they-won’t-they pull of Belly’s first love with Conrad, and an American living that whimsical dream of Paris. It’s not with the outlandish opulence of Emily in Paris either, but has a charming realism that doesn’t romanticise the grit of working two jobs and being eternally homesick in a city full of strangers. Throw in a Friends-style “did he get on the plane?” moment and a Love Actually-esque race through a train station in Paris, and it’s a recipe for swooning.View image in fullscreenWill they or won’t they … Conrad (Christopher Briney) and Belly (Lola Tung) in The Summer I Turned Pretty.Photograph: Eddy Chen/PrimeDramatic declarations of love are nothing without the turbulence it takes to get there, and the show is full of the chaos of teen romance. No self-respecting grown woman would call herself “Belly”, or torment two brothers by having them fight over her, seemingly switching between them with each passing summer. It also usually doesn’t take sending a man home sobbing to realise – a beat too late – which of two brothers you’re actually in love with.The Summer I Turned Pretty also has that distinctively mid-2000s feel to it, with the rivalries of Team Conrad and Team Jeremiah having spawned T-shirts, watch parties and even themed hen dos. Han penned the novels from 2008 to 2011, before social media became all-consuming, which may account for it having an old-school charm without being overtly intentional with its 2000s nostalgia. Weave in some “sad girl” Swift anthems and you have all teen girls’ dreams: an epic love story – where everyone is loved back – told to the backdrop of hazy, sun-soaked days with a Swift-heavy soundtrack.View image in fullscreenAn addictive puzzle … Belly (Lola Tung) in The Summer I Turned Pretty.Photograph: Eddy Chen/PrimeThis week’s finale, aptly titled At Last, slots in the missing romantic pieces to this addictive puzzle. Handwritten love letters lead to a surprise turn-up-at-your-door arrival, a definitive choice and a pledge to love each other in all universes. In the real world, of course, men aren’t written by women, romance isn’t like a teen novel and most of us will never be chased through the streets of Paris by someone wanting to declare the urgency of their love. So, for now, The Summer I Turned Pretty is that comforting reassurance that a love like that exists. The chaotic, all-consuming, lifelong kind of love that makes you feel like a teenager again.Han has already come through on her promise of returning to Cousins, in movie form. Until then, I’m just a girl sitting in front of a laptop asking youto devour this show. And, studios, take note – The Summer I Turn Pretty should be the blueprint for all future romantic endeavours.It has it all, and it isn’t afraid to own it.The Summer I Turned Pretty is on Prime Video nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A total of 69 artists, speakers and activists were to appear at Ovo Arena Wembley.There were stars of music: Damon Albarn, Bastille, PinkPantheress, Hot Chip and a festival’s worth of others. There were stars of stage and screen:Benedict Cumberbatch, Florence Pugh, Guy Pearce, Ramy Youssef and a huge supporting cast. There were the firebrands, the podcasters, the people you’re sure are important but you have no idea why. And there were the people who, well, you don’t really know what they’re bringing: the former footballer Eric Cantona, the Love Island host Laura Whitmore, the Chicken Shop Dates YouTuber Amelia Dimoldenberg.To one of the evening’s artists,Paul Weller, it might have all seemed very familiar: the combination of righteousness and music was reminiscent of the big events of the Thatcher years – the GLC Jobs for a Change festival in Battersea Park in July 1985, or the Artists Against Apartheid’s Festival for Freedom on Clapham Common the following summer. (Weller played with the Style Council at the latter, which offered a similarly eclectic experience: Archbishop Trevor Huddleston reminiscing about giving Gary Kemp his first guitar, before Spandau Ballet premiered Through the Barricades.)In other respects, though, it was very modern. There was no need for wandering through the crowd shaking buckets – as well as the £500,000 or so raised by ticket sales (they all sold in two hours), Together for Palestine solicits online donations, and, like any good arena event, offered a vast array of merch designed by Ayham Hassan, Bella Freud, Katherine Hamnett, Priya Ahluwalia and other fashion stars, from the quotidian T-shirts to the inevitable keffiyehs. Given that arena rock shows expect to add up to 50% in merch sales to ticket revenue, and that these designs, too, are available online, it shaped up to be an efficient fundraising exercise.View image in fullscreenHot Chip on stage.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesIt was not an exercise in white saviourism.Though Brian Eno had assembled the bill, the artistic director was the exiled Palestinian artist Malak Mattar, who had left Gaza on 6 October 2023 to begin studying at Central St Martin’s. The oud player Adnan Joubran, the rapper El Far3i and the singer Nai Barghouti were on the bill, representing different strands of Palestinian musical identity.Before the event began, as crowds filed in – bamboozled by a lack of signage – a dozen or so protesters clutching Israeli flags tried to make their presence known to a snake of people waving Palestinian flags and chanting and drumming their way around the plaza outside the arena. But few ticket holders stopped for more than a moment and it took no more than a few police to keep them apart.View image in fullscreenBenedict Cumberbatch reads a poem.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesInside, the mood was far from insurrectionary. The nearest thing to dissent came when Louis Theroux referred to Israeli violence and was heckled: “It’s genocide!” One of the oddities of events like this is that they are the only gatherings at which mentions of genocide are cheered.One participant appeared to feel the need to exercise caution: Benedict Cumberbatch shared the reading of a poem by Mahmoud Darwish with the playwright Amer Hlehel and, while the teleprompter spoke of the dead ofGazaascending to heaven “with a smile”, he paused and left that bit out.Richard Gere went wildly off-piste, ditching his scripted speech about Gaza’s doctors to instead talk about his “caravan of love and compassion and dancing”. The teleprompter operator scrolled up and scrolled down and eventually gave up.Palestinian speakers and musicians made a huge impression. The journalist Yara Eid spoke fiercely about the 270 journalists killed in Gaza, to huge cheers. The pianist Faraj Suleiman will never play again to 12,500 people at Wembley but here he did, backed thrillingly by a jazz-prog power trio. Bargouti, too, enthralled the crowd. No cheer was louder, though, than the one that greetedNeneh Cherry, who joined Greentea Peng on stage to perform her hit Seven Seconds.After four hours – during which time few left the auditorium; Wembley’s beer sales will not have broken any records – some of the audience were losing focus and sloping off, ignoring Albarn, Omar Souleyman and Gorillaz. The organisers probably didn’t mind, for so many left wearing Together for Palestine T-shirts and clutching tote bags. By 10pm, Jameela Jamil announced, the show had already raised £1.5m.

At a ceremony on Tuesday, audiences were told that Rooney “couldn’t be here”, before her editor, Faber publisher Alex Bowler, collected the award on her behalf.Bowler read a statement from Rooney, in which she explained that because of her support for “non-violent anti-war protest” she had been advised that she could “no longer safely enter the UK” without potentially facing arrest.In August,Rooney said that she intends to use proceeds from her works, which include Normal People and Conversations with Friends, along with BBC adaptations of them, to support Palestine Action, which was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK in July.“I’m so touched and grateful to receive this prize”, beganRooney’s statementon Tuesday, read by Bowler. “I truly loved writing Intermezzo and it means the world to me to think that it has found some small place in the lives of its readers – thank you.”“I wish that I could be with you this evening to accept the honour in person, but because of my support for non-violent anti-war protest, I’m advised that I can no longer safely enter the UK without potentially facing arrest,” her statement continued. “In that context, I want to thank you all the more warmly for honouring my work tonight, and to reiterate my belief in the dignity and beauty of all human life, and my solidarity with the people of Palestine.”Last month, the lawyer and writer Sadakat Kadritold the Guardianthat “receiving money with the intention of using it to support terrorism is an offence under section 15 of the 2000 act”, meaning Rooney could be “arrested without a warrant as a ‘terrorist’.” He said that she could face prosecution if she were to express her views at, for example, a UK book festival, underscoring the proscription’s “gross disproportionality”.More than 1,600 people have beenarrested in connectionwith Palestine Action since the ban in early July.In a statement to the Guardian, Rooney said “at present, because of my ongoing public support for Palestine Action, it is my understanding that I cannot visit the UK without risking detention or arrest. Sadly, this means I have had to cancel any future public engagements in Britain, and I could not attend theSky Artsceremony at which my work was honoured this week.“While I would have liked very much to accept the honour in person, this is far from the gravest consequence of the proscription of a non-violent protest group. Peaceful protesters have already been arrested in unprecedented numbers, and the ramifications for artistic and cultural life are only just beginning. I am presently in the process of seeking advice on legal issues that could affect the very availability of my work to the public.“As theUN [commission of inquiry]finds that Israel has committed and is committing genocide against the Palestinian people, the work of Palestine Action could not possibly be more courageous or important. The least I can do is to make clear that I support them and will go on doing so, no matter the consequences.”Explore more on these topicsSally RooneyPalestine ActionAwards and prizesSky ArtsnewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson confirmed a compulsory scheme would begin if insufficient people took up the voluntary offer.As well as the redundancy scheme, the RSC is also making “operational efficiencies and [seeking to] generate additional forms of income”.Leveson toldthe Stagenewspaper that many organisations were struggling, but blamed the RSC’s woes on a “year-on-year gap between what it costs to run the organisation and what we are capable of generating in income to support that”.He added that the Matilda show in the West End had been a “gift” that generated £30m for the RSC but that income had slowed down significantly in the last year, adding to the financial pressure.The move is the largest redundancy programme at the RSC since 2020, when the company announced cuts during the pandemic.Last week the RSC announced its full spring season for 2026. Kenneth Branagh will appear on the Stratford-upon-Avon stage for the first time in more than 30 years when he appears in the Tempest, while the Oscar winner Helen Hunt will star in a new version of Anton Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. Mark Gatiss will make his RSC debut in The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui.Explore more on these topicsRoyal Shakespeare CompanyTheatreArts fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re all Picassos. Not one is Dora Maar.”The couple met at the end of 1935 when she was taking photographs to promote Jean Renoir’s film The Crime of Monsieur Lange. At the time, Picasso was in a relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter, with whom he had a daughter Maya, that continued during his years with Maar.He frequently represented Maar, whose masochistic tendencies fascinated him, as a tortured figure often in tears as in La Femme qui pleure (Weeping Woman), which experts say he intended to represent the suffering of the Spanish civil war but was also indicative of his allegedabuse of Maarand the couple’s many physical fights.In the rediscovered work, Maar’s face, fragmented but painted in bright colour without perspective, appears anguished and on the point of weeping. At the time Maar had learned that Picasso, then 61, intended to leave her for the artist Françoise Gilot, 21.The portrait was completed in July 1943 and was only displayed a handful of times outside hisParisatelier in the Rue des Grands Augustins. It has been in a private collection since it was bought in August 1944 – the month of the liberation of Paris.Its existence was known from a black and white photograph taken shortly before it was sold that featured in an art catalogue. The seller, who inherited the painting from a grandparent, an unnamed French collector, has asked to remain anonymous.The Nazis occupying Paris during the second world war considered Picasso’s work “degenerate”, which led to raids on his atelier and threats of a ban on exhibiting his paintings.Maar, who died in Paris in 1997 aged 89, is credited with being Picasso’s muse as well as his subject and lover,but she was a surrealist photographer in her own rightand her style had a major influence on his work during their relationship.The auction house Lucien Paris, which has conservatively estimated the oil painting measuring 80cm x 60cm at about €8m (£6.9m) but expects it to fetch far more, had kept the painting’s existence a secret before unveiling it to the press on Thursday.Auctioneer Christophe Lucien said it was a significant discovery and described the work as a masterpiece and a rare example of how Picasso’s output was a much needed light during the dark days of the occupation. He said experts knew it existed from the photographs but it was the first time the true colours of the work could be seen.“It is not only a milestone in the history of art but also in the private life of Picasso,” Lucien said.“It is a refreshing portrait of Dora Maar; exceptional and full of emotion. Discovering it is a big moment in our lives as experts.”The painting will be sold at auction by Lucien Paris on 24 October and will be on display for three days before the sale.Explore more on these topicsPablo PicassoParisFranceEuropePaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

For others, the cabinets of pristine Wallabees and Desert Boots may recall teenage obsessions with US hip-hop or Britpop movements.Memories will also flood back for the many local people whose families made Clarks shoes for generations, when the box-freshShoemakers Museumopens in the Somerset village of Street, near Glastonbury, on Thursday.Nicky Dowding, collections manager, said some visitors may be surprised at how far a very British brand, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, spread across the globe. “In the UK, Clarks is often associated with school shoes but within audiences across the world it’s perceived in very different ways,” she said.Hundreds of pairs of shoes are on display, with some of the cabinets looking like bright, abstract works of modern art. Dowding said many more were in storage: “One of the biggest jobs we’ve had while developing the museum is actually what do we put on display? Which stories do we want to tell? Because there is just so much.”View image in fullscreenA display in the new Shoemakers Museum.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianFans of hip-hop and the crime drama series Breaking Bad are likely to hot-foot it to the examples of Wallabees,created in the late 1960s, and inspired by the moccasin.The Wallabee was initially considered too radical in Britain but proved hugely popular in the US and was championed by members of the New York hip-hop bandWu-Tang Clan, who wore them, wrote about them, and included them in art work.More recently, Wallabees played a starring role in the opening scene of Breaking Bad when Walter White, the chemistry teacher turned crystal meth super-cook, sported a pair, together with unflattering white underwear.Another highlight of the museum is its story of the Desert Boot, inspired by the travels of aClarks family member to Myanmar and Indiain the second world war. They became a favourite of the mods in the UK and were also worn enthusiastically by Liam and Noel Gallagher.View image in fullscreenCato Pedder, chair of the trust and a member of the Clarks family, outside the new museum.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianClarks’ Quaker founders may have been surprised that their brand became such a favourite of the stars.The first exhibit in the museum is a modest pair of slippers made from offcuts of a sheepskin rug in about 1825. The museum describes how the business quickly grew to one of the most important in the English West Country, and how the family did good works inSomersetand farther afield.Cato Pedder, a member of the family and chair of theAlfred Gillett Trust,a charity that preserves and shares the Clarks story, said the business flourished because of its Quaker roots.“One of the Quaker testimonies is to truth and that means that you’re very honest in all your dealings,” she said. “Everyone trusted them. The family made some money through the business. This allowed them to become philanthropic and work for votes for women. They were active in the abolition movement against slavery in the US.”View image in fullscreenOne of the early exhibits. The Quaker family who started Clarks may have been surprised their shoes were later worn by the stars.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianTim Crumplin, a business archivist, said his favourite section of the new museum was a collection of machines from the Desert Boot production line, which was based at the Bushacre factory in Weston-super-Mare. The factory closed a quarter of a century ago and the boots are now made in the far east.Crumplin said: “Most of the people that worked on that line worked on it for decades.” One worker was nicknamed Nureyev, after the ballet dancer, because he moved so quickly and gracefully between the two machines he worked on. “They were so skilled at what they did.”If the Wallabees and Desert Boots will appeal to music fans, lovely recreations of Clarks shoe shops will bring back memories for many more people.View image in fullscreenClarks Village in Street, where the story began.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianRosie Martin, the museum’s director, said: “I think people will be able to find themselves in the museum. People will remember having their feet measured in the gauge so that their first shoes were properly fitted. It was a ceremony, a rite of passage.”One of the cases features her daughter’s first shoe, with a Polaroid photo of her in the shop. “I treasure that,” Martin said. “It opens up a box of memories.”Explore more on these topicsMuseumsWomen's shoesMen's shoesSomersetRetail industryManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Sadly three hours of him speaking is deadeningly boringStuart HeritageThu 18 Sep 2025 06.11 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 07.28 EDTShareIf nothing else, you have to applaud their commitment to the bit. Broadly speaking, the British media responded to Donald Trump’s state visit with a series of cautious little inserts nestled within scheduled news programming. Then along came Channel 4, which decided to go big, junking off a full night’s schedule to deliver an unbroken almost three-hour, fact-based, point-by-point repudiation of almost every single thing that Trump has said since he retook office in January.This sprawling extravaganza, entitled Trump v the Truth, formed the backbone of what effectively became Channel 4’s Trump Day on Wednesday. Preceding it was episode two of TheDonald TrumpShow, a weird hour that overlaid an arch Come Dine With Me narration over old Trump clips. And throughout the day, continuity announcers were replaced with a Trump impersonator who whined about the channel’s output. During Frasier at 10:40am, for instance, he complained about his intense dislike of tossed salads.Still, Trump v the Truth was always the real pull; a monumental flex that few other broadcasters would have dared to attempt. Starting at 10pm and rolling on into the small hours, the show was billed as a rigorously sourced factcheck of more than 100 untruths that Trump has told during his second term so far, in speeches, interviews, statements and social media posts.On paper, this is an admirable demonstration of public service journalism. We live in an age where Trump routinely attempts to silence the media – just this week, he filed a$15bn lawsuit against the New York Times– so for a channel to call him out as comprehensively as this might set an example for the rest of the world to follow.But sitting through it all was a different matter entirely. From its opening moments, the show chose to stick to an unwavering format: first we’d see a clip of Trump, and then white-on-black text would drily correct him. Footage of him announcing a 1400% reduction in drug prices was followed by text reading “It is impossible to reduce a price by more than 100% because a 100% reduction means the price is free”. Footage of him claiming that the US is the only country on Earth to have mail-in voting was followed by text pointing out that more than 30 other countries allow it.View image in fullscreenYou’ll need three months in a sensory deprivation tank to recover from this …Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesOn it went, flitting between small untruths about Trump claiming to have invented the word “equalise” and bigger untruths about Ukraine starting the war with Russia. Of these, you found yourself wishing that Channel 4 had made a shorter show that concentrated only on the latter. The anger you feel when confronted by a big destabilising distortion – like his repeated assertions that the majority of immigrants are violent criminals – is almost immediately deflated by more minor fare, such as a correction about the nationality of the first person to split the atom. When this happens, it feels like being trapped in a pub with the world’s most pedantic boor.It’s hard to find a decent comparison for the numbing experience of watching Trump v the Truth. It was a bit likeSlow TV, but with the nice long train journey replaced by a tangible threat to global democracy. It was a bit like the old Pop-Up Videos on VH1, but with fun trivia about Madonna replaced with statistics about the penalty for murdering bald eagles. It was, in its sheer unrelenting length, a little bit like being visited by a particularly terrifying sleep paralysis demon.However, this deadening boredom was probably intentional. This was less a call to arms and more a grand filibustering designed to wear you down under the weight of Trump’s nonsense. And it worked. After sitting through it, I want nothing more than to spend the next three months in a sensory deprivation tank until my nervous system recovers.The bigger question is who this was actually for. Trump supporters won’t be swayed by the fact that a foreign television channel spent hours drily rectifying his stance on where the Unabomber was educated. His opponents already know that he doesn’t tell the truth, and didn’t need to be kept awake all night to be reminded.Maybe there’s a sliver of a possibility that Trump himself accidentally sat on a remote control before he crashed out at Windsor Castle last night, and this came on, and it caused him to see the error of his ways. If that’s the case, then Trump v the Truth will have been worth it. If not, perhaps it’s best that we write this off as a noble but flawed experiment.Trump v the Truth is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDonald TrumpreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a relentlessly cheerless watchLucy ManganThu 18 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 10.39 EDTShareHard on the heels of the airless misery of Mark Ruffalo’s new venture,Task, comes Jude Law and Jason Bateman’s Black Rabbit, which has a bit more action but the same relentless, cheerless tone and even less forgiving lighting. One more entry and it’s officially a trend! We’ll all have to schedule recoveryviewings of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, like winter vitamin D shots, to make it through unbowed.Law and Bateman are working-class brothers Jake (Law) and Vince (Bateman) Friedkin from Coney Island. They grew up in what we assume from relatively early on was a violent home, dominated by an alcoholic father. They became a Nirvana-lite rock group – Jake the handsome lead, Vince the drummer and creative force – until the latter’s taste for drugs and mayhem put paid to their success. Jake pivoted into management, primarily of multihyphenate talent Wes (Sope Dirisu), and when Vince regained his sobriety and vision and found a building that seized his imagination they all went into business together as restaurateurs, creating the Black Rabbit – a three-storey clubhouse that soon became the toast of bohemian New York.As the show opens, Jake and his team are celebrating their success with – in the first of many slightly “Eh, what, really?” dislocating details in the series – a trunk show of high-end jewellery for its supposedly cool crowd. Alas, no sooner has Jake limned their joy in building “a home for our family, our friends, our people … a place where the night could go anywhere” than a group of armed robbers rush in and Jake freezes with a gun in his face while we are catapulted back to “One month earlier.”View image in fullscreenWhen the chips are down …. Jason Bateman as Vince in Black Rabbit.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixVince is in Reno, trying to get out of Reno before certain denizens of Reno find him. We infer from his desperation, his accidental killing of a man in a car park and his haircut that the sobriety did not last. As a last resort, he calls Jake. Despite the fact that Vince evidently left the Black Rabbit some time ago and very messily, Jake buys him a ticket home and – when key bar worker Anna (Abbey Lee) refuses to come in, for C-plot reasons it takes too long to get to and will remain, as many other points in the overstuffed narrative will do, underdeveloped – gives him a job.Never do this.From there, we largely follow the brothers as Vince repeatedly screws up and Jake repeatedly saves him. A gangster’s son is pursuing Vince for outstanding debts and, as anyone who hasseen The Bearknows, even the most successful restaurant is not awash with cash. Jake can only pay so much. We know how this story goes, so although the physical stakes for the pair increase, the law of diminishing returns for the viewer sets in pretty quickly. The lack of affect is aggravated by the fact that even the two main characters are hard to care about, and the others (great potential though they have, especially the star chef Roxie, played by Amaka Okafor, and her relationship with the suffering Anna, plus Wes and his suspect attitude towards his girlfriend Estelle – Cleopatra Coleman – when she threatens to eclipse him) are little more than ciphers.View image in fullscreenBrotherly love …  Jude Law as Jake in Black Rabbit.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixVince behaves with such selfishness and stupidity that caring about his fate is very difficult, and it is never clear what kind of man Jake really is beneath the constant firefighting he has to do both as a businessman and as minder for his awful brother. Such clarity as is provided for them as individuals and insight into their twisted relationship comes too late to allow even retrospective satisfaction for those who stick with the unlovely pair and their stressful adventures. There is only one way this kind of thing ends, and so it does – without anything like the level of growth or change it would require from Vince to make it credible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The host was Elisabeth von Thadden and the nominal reason for the get-together was her younger sister’s 50th birthday. Really, though, this was a cover story for nine influential people meeting to discuss what should happen now that it was clear that Hitler was losing the war.Otto Kiep, a former diplomat, talked hopefully about how Mussolini’s recent toppling meant that Italy was ready to make peace with the allies, while political hostess Hanna Solf gleefully anticipated the moment when Hitler fell: “We’ll put him against a wall.” Meanwhile, Von Thadden herself, a devout Protestant and former headteacher of an elite girls’ school, warned of the humanitarian crisis that would follow the end of hostilities. For those who gathered on that late summer’s day for tea, sandwiches and a particularly unappetising food item called “war cake”, Germany’s rebirth as a democratic nation state felt so near that they could almost touch it.None of these people were natural rebels, and Jonathan Freedland does an excellent job of reaching inside their heads to reveal a slow-growing and late-flowering disillusionment with the Nazis. Many were from distinguished military families who had been burned by the defeat of the first world war and the subsequent humiliation of the treaty of Versailles. To these quintessential patriots, the national socialists’ promise to restore Germany’s military pride, not to mention economic stability, had been initially appealing. A return to the enduring values of Goethe and Beethoven could surely not be far behind.This naivety didn’t last long. As the full horror of the Nazis’ programme for racial cleansing became clear, it was impossible to stand by. In 1933, Kiep, then consul general to the US, risked everything to publicly honour Albert Einstein, the best-known Jewish refugee from nazism. It earned him an immediate recall to the fatherland. For Von Thadden, the moment of reckoning had come when she saw what the Third Reich had planned for Christianity – a new “German church” in which Hitler outranked Jesus Christ. For Countess Lagi von Ballestrem, the challenge was helping hundreds of “submarines” – Jews in hiding – survive the terrible Berlin winters, before pointing them to freedom via a network of tunnels and false papers. The countess had perfected the art of the silent insult: everywhere she went, she made sure to carry a bag of heavy laundry in each hand – it was the perfect excuse for failing to give the obligatory “Heil Hitler” salute.What no one realised until it was too late was that there was an informant in their midst. He arrived at the tea party with excellent references, but in retrospect, there was something fishy about him. He hung on to everyone’s words as if taking mental notes and tried to pump people for further revelations. That was because he was typing it all up and presenting it to his Gestapo boss, the notoriously ruthless Herbert Lange. Within 18 months, nearly everyone who had attended the gathering would be either dead or imprisoned.In 74 short, punchy chapters, each ending on a cliffhanger, Freedland tracks the twists and turns by which these reluctant heroes sought to evade and then face their fate. At first there was an unnerving silence, but then came a knock at the door, or a tap on the shoulder. Given that these were prestige prisoners with names or fortunes associated with Germany’s prewar elite, it was inevitable that they would be exploited for propaganda purposes. There were show trials, complete with expensive barristers and witnesses and family pleas for mercy. It didn’t do any good. Kiep was hanged, Von Thadden beheaded. Arthur Zarden, a mandarin at the German ministry of finance, managed to break away from his captors and jump to his death, while the rest got long prison sentences.Freedland has produced that elusive thing – an impeccably sourced history book that reads as propulsively as an airport thriller. Yet this is also a profoundly serious work, posing an uncomfortable question. How many of us, given the chance to sit out an unpalatable political present without too much discomfort, would find the courage to step up, speak out and face the inevitably terrible consequences?The Traitors Circle: The Rebels Against the Nazis and the Spy Who Betrayed Them by Jonathan Freedland is published by John Murray (£25).

It opens with Isaiah breaking his leg on a championship-winning drive, and young Cameron taking in the gruesome injury from his living room floor while his father drills the mantra “no guts, no glory” into his psyche. It reintroduces football, quite rightly, as averitable meat marketwhere players are poked, prodded and scrutinized like chattel. Director Justin Tipping even switches to X-ray vision to bring out the underlying damage that can result fromfootball’s incessant collisions, one of many stylish visual touches.But where a sports movie like F1 can get away with stretching the truth for US audiences who aren’t likely to know the difference, Him makes suspending disbelief a staggering struggle. Because of football’s seemingly intractable position at the center of American life, the viewers who come to this film are more than likely already acutely aware of thesingular privilege and leveragethat quarterbacks enjoy in the game and, thus, likely to call bullshit on the idea of a prospect of Cameron’s caliber having to jump through the same physical challenges as a middling wide receiver or defensive lineman. Another terrible stretch is Wayans playing a fading gridiron legend at the dear age of 53, much less one who can afford a desert compound – more of a luxury for Major League Baseball, where contracts arefully guaranteed.Him makes a big deal of Cameron showcasing his abilities at a scouting combine, a once-important job interview that top quarterbacks routinely blow off now. Cameron’s physical fitness becomes something to obsess over even as standout NFL QBs rockdad bods. (Brady’sshirtless combine photo, more than 25 years old now, is famously disappointing.) Cameron and Isaiah are offered up as exceptional football players without a practical demonstration for a setup or a payoff. Isaiah is established as a mentor to Cameron even though a pro QB fighting against time to keep his job wouldneverassume that role. Recall: job replacement training was a central point of conflict in Any Given Sunday, a film that manages to successfully relate the horrors of professional football without much distortion.Without firm grounding in reality, Him can only skid, hopelessly, into the realm of kabuki theater and make a muddle of its football critique. It’s too bad because the film has some interesting things to say about the game – specifically, its conflation of white Christian values and American jingoism. In the real world, players are coached to order their lives in a three-pile stack: God, family and football. But in Him, Isaiah puts football above the divine and talks quite soberly about how “He died for us so I play for Him.” The pro team in question here is called the Saviors, and Isaiah’s picture is propped up among young Cameron’s football trophies like a holy card among votive candles – a true shrine.Tipping, one of three writers on the film, uses the concept of the sports Goat, the acronym for greatest of all time, to present football as a pagan religion, complete with blood sacraments and tangible sacrifices, while cutting back and forth from Christian symbols to occult imagery. One shot in particular, of Cameron at a Last Supper-style photoshoot in the Jesus position, prompted a handful of viewers at my Atlanta screening to walk out. You can just imagine God-fearing football fans – ostensibly, Him’s target audience – taking similar offense.The most memorable performances in Him come from the supporting cast. Tim Heidecker and Jim Jefferies shine as Cameron’s agent and Isaiah’s doctor, respectively, and the model Julia Fox is a pleasant surprise as Isaiah’s wife. But it’s not enough to negate Wayans’s hammier tics or stand up a story that would have anyone believe he ishim– itself a neologism for “the man”. What could have been a truly cutting takedown of the American football meat grinder just winds up playing to the very appetite for human carnage that fans can’t get enough of. No matter your view of Him, as a slasher or a sports film, it’s a fumble.Him is out in US cinemas on 19 September, in Australia on 2 October and in the UK on 3 OctoberExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsJordan PeeleNFLUS sportsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It doesn’t quite lasso the bronco, but the ambitions of writer-director Tony Tost’s yarn are ambitious and interesting, and he has at least assembled a cracking cast to tell it.Audiences will probably be most excited about the presence of star-billedSydney Sweeney, here playing Penny Jo, a sweet waitress with a stammer, although Sweeney is very much part of an ensemble that distributes screen time democratically. (The film premiered in 2023 at South by Southwest, but is only coming out now, perhaps because Sweeney has now become a legit phenomenon.) At the New Mexico middle-of-nowhere diner where Penny Jo slings hash, she stumbles on a plot to steal a rare Lakota artefact from a collector (Toby Huss, making the most of a cameo role).This calfskin MacGuffin becomes of interest to a number of other parties, including: antiquities dealer Roy (Simon Rex from Red Rocket); Cal (Gavin Maddox Bergman), a little kid who thinks he is the reincarnation of Sitting Bull, and Cal’s damaged mother Mandy (Halsey), the survivor of a patriarchal cult/ family; sad but none-too-bright cowboy Lefty (Paul Walter Hauser), who grows sweet on Penny Jo; and indigenous revolutionary Ghost Eye (the always wondrous Zahn McClarnon from Reservation Dogs), who is apt to quote Frantz Fanon and Karl Marx when not committing crimes.The chronologically scrambled chapter structure, so in vogue these days (see, for instance, Weapons) sets everything up for a big showdown that is mildly anticlimactic in action movie terms, but presumably was all the budget permitted. Also, Tost’s screenplay is not afraid to deploy the odd hokey line or genre cliche, and that includes what feels like half a dozen camera setups harkening back to the last shot of The Searchers, just to drive home the point. But McClarnon’s wry reservation intellectual, and most of the other colourful turns, makes this eminently watchable.Americana is on digital platforms in the UK from 22 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsThrillersSydney SweeneyNew MexicoSXSW FilmreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Alice Birch’s epic about the mess of modern masculinity, they are three brothers born into privilege. “My father wanted only sons,” says Jack Roman (Kyle Soller), kicking off the narrative. Birch plays boldly with time and form, so the boys – questing Jack, voracious Marlow and troubled Edmund – are children in the late Victorian era and emerge into manhood through the succeeding 150 years.The play is subtitled “a novel” and Soller gives a pointed opening narration of familial decline and an icily abusive boarding school. For the Roman brothers, to become a man is an education in cruelty and a prompt to adventure. Each goes their own way: Jack explores the world, Marlow (Oliver Johnstone) exploits it and Edmund (beautifully played by Stuart Thompson) seeks to escape it entirely. It is only Edmund who tries to retain contact in a unreciprocated tumble of lonely words. All men, we hear, are self-made – though he laments: “I do not know that I have the pieces.”View image in fullscreenGoing their own way … Kyle Soller, Stuart Thompson and Oliver Johnstone in The Romans.Photograph: Marc BrennerBirch follows their various models of self-making through a brilliant modernist sequence, shards of experience darting between each other on Merle Hensel’s spinning platform stage. Refusing to look inward is dramatically testing. As Marlow marches inexorably from imperialist to edgelord, Johnstone can’t make him other than monumentally uninteresting.‘I had to think about Andrew Tate. That was miserable’: 150 years of masculinity, all in one playRead moreIt is a relief when women insert their voices, revising a romantic origin story (“it is essentially kidnap”) or failed marriage. Things turn postmodern as we approach the present: after the interval, Birch mediates male experience through film, cancel culture and podcasts. Masculinity becomes less an essence than a position – seductive to whooping bros and the women they grind down.Romans is a fascinating, upsetting project, and Sam Pritchard’s alert production quivers with tension under Lee Curran’s sculptural lighting. Ultimately, patriarchy seems a legacy of damage, its ravening adventures dwindling unhappily into domestic life. These Romans may have set out to take the world, but they are fundamentally lost boys, hurting themselves and perhaps all of us.AtAlmeida theatre, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlice BirchAlmeida theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

A retired police officer, he has dealt with enough lowlifes to see the worst in everyone. Played with frightening humourlessness by Stuart Fox, he is all suspicion and mistrust. When his newly bereaved brother-in-law, Gerald (Russell Richardson), is befriended by Daniel (Iskandar Eaton), an enigmatic young man, he thinks only the worst of the relationship.View image in fullscreenNeighbourhood on watch … Stuart Fox and Elizabeth Boag in Earth Angel by Alan Ayckbourn, at the Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough.Photograph: Tony BartholomewAnd he is not alone. In Alan Ayckbourn’s 91st play, he is joined in speculative plotting by Maxine (Liza Goddard), his misanthropic wife, as well as Gerald’s neighbours, the well-meaning Norah (Elizabeth Boag) and the online conspiracist Hugo (Hayden Wood). They are stoked by fear, small-mindedness and tribalism.In our polarised times, it feels radical for Ayckbourn to propose that Daniel might simply be good. The stranger is seeking neither to rob the older man nor to turn his house into a drug den. The level-headed Gerald, a retired teacher, has too sharp a mind to tolerate the nay-saying neighbours. Their cynicism about Daniel, he says, is like the Pharisees saying of Jesus, “We don’t trust him, he’s altogether far too nice.”He is not entirely right: there is another twist in store, albeit one that admits to messy humanity more than criminal intent. But the playwright would rather celebrate those who bring joy, such as Gerald’s late wife Amy, or comfort, such as Daniel, than those who sow only division.Despite the play’s title, the many references to death and the allusions to Jesus, Ayckbourn’s plea for decency is secular not spiritual. Daniel’s evasiveness gives him an otherworldly air, but the play has less to do with the supernatural than with the 1954 doo-wop hitEarth Angel by the Penguins. It is a humane and, in the final scene, touching vision.‘My first play was terrible!’ Alan Ayckbourn on his dazzling career – and writing his 90th playRead moreBut it is also one that is slow in coming. On a heavy-handed set by Kevin Jenkins (we can understand the concept of an exterior wall without seeing the bricks), Ayckbourn proceeds at a stately pace, allowing baggy stretches of inactivity between the dramatic flashpoints, and taking his time to celebrate love in the face of grief, compassion in the face of hostility.AtStephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, until 11 October.

All of the performances use historical instruments, with Mullova playing her gut-strung 1750 Guadagnini and using a classical bow, while here Beatson plays a different keyboard for each sonata. For the rather Mozartian Op 12 no 2 he uses a copy of a Walter fortepiano made in 1805, seven years after the sonata was composed; while for the much more ambitious keyboard writing of Op 96 it’s a copy of a Graf from 1819.View image in fullscreenMullova/Beatson: Beethoven: Violin Sonatas Opp 12 & 96.Photograph: SignumWhat is common to the performances of both sonatas is the sheerjoie de vivreof the playing.

The fine detail of both the violin and the keyboard playing is exquisite; the shape of every phrase, you feel, has been considered and weighted accordingly, without losing any sense of spontaneity, so the music never stales.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Scientists now have answers, but they’re not what you thinkThe phenomenal response to an article we published on this question led to detailed cognitive research – and the findings have implications that go way beyond gamersKeith StuartThu 18 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Sep 2025 10.23 EDTShareFive years ago, on the verge of the first Covid lockdown, I wrote an article asking what seemed to be an extremely niche question:why do some people invert their controls when playing 3D games? A majority of players push down on the controller to make their onscreen character look down, and up to make them look up. But there is a sizeable minority who do the opposite, controlling their avatars like a pilot controls a plane, pulling back to go up. For most modern games, this requires going into the settings and reconfiguring the default controls. Why do they still persist?I thought a few hardcore gamers would be interested in the question. Instead, more than one million people read the article, and the ensuing debate caught the attention of Dr Jennifer Corbett (quoted in the original piece) and Dr Jaap Munneke, then based at the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London.At the time, the two were conducting research into vision science and cognitive neuroscience, but when the country locked down, they were no longer able to test volunteers in their laboratory. The question of controller inversion provided the perfect opportunity to study the neuroscience of human-computer interactions using remote subjects. Theyput out a call for gamerswilling to help research the reasons behind controller inversion and receivedmany hundreds of replies.View image in fullscreenMicrosoft Flight Simulator … many thought what they first played affected the way they configured their controls.Photograph: MicrosoftAnd it wasn’t just gamers who were interested. “Machinists, equipment operators, pilots, designers, surgeons – people from so many different backgrounds reached out,” says Corbett. “Because there were so many different answers, we realised we had a lot of scientific literature to review to design the best possible study. Readers’ responses turned this study into the first of its kind to try to figure out what actually are those factors that shape how users configure their controllers. Personal experiences, favourite games, different genres, age, consoles, which way you scroll with a mouse … all of these things could potentially be involved.”This month the duo published their findings in a paper entitled “Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments”. And the reason why some people invert their controls? It’s complicated.The process started with participants completing a survey about their backgrounds and gaming experiences. “Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not,” says Corbett. “Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback.”View image in fullscreenMental rotation … a subject being tested as part of controller inversion research.Photograph: Jen CorbettBut Corbett and Munneke,now based at MITand Northeastern University respectively, were certain that there would also be important cognitive components to the inversion question that could be measured only through behavioural responses. So they devised a questionnaire and a series of four experiments that participants would take part in while being instructed and observed via Zoom. As Corbett explains: “They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an ‘avatar’ object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical ‘Simon effect’ where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button. Then we used some machine-learning algorithms to help us sort through all this survey and experiment data and pick out what combination of all of these things best explained whether someone inverted.”What they discovered through the cognitive testing was that a lot of assumptions being made around controller preferences were wrong. “None of the reasons people gave us [for inverting controls] had anything to do with whether they actually inverted,” says Corbett. “It turns out the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and ​​overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks.” So does this mean non-inverters are better gamers? No, says Corbett. “Though they tended to be faster, they didn’t get the correct answer more than inverters who were actually slightly more accurate.”In short, gamersthinkthey are an inverter or a non-inverter because of how they were first exposed to game controls. Someone who played a lot of flight sims in the 1980s may have unconsciously taught themselves to invert and now they consider that their innate preference; alternatively a gamer who grew up in the 2000s, when non-inverted controls became prevalent may think they are naturally a non-inverter. However, cognitive tests suggest otherwise. It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space.Consequently, Corbett says that it may improve you as a gamer to try the controller setup you are currently not using. “Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot,” she says. “You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better. A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back.”Through this research, Corbett and Munneke have established that there are complex and often unconscious cognitive processes involved in how individuals use controllers, and that these may have important ramifications for not just game hardware but for any human-computer interfaces, from aircraft controls to surgical devices. They were able to design a framework for assessing how to best configure controls for any given individual and have now made that available via their research paper.View image in fullscreenLearning curve … Corbett and Munneke’s research could even have ramifications for surgeons.Photograph: Oksana Krasiuk/Alamy“This work opened our eyes to the huge potential that optimising inversion settings has for advancing human-machine teaming,” says Corbett. “So many technologies are pairing humans with AI and other machines to augment what we can do alone. Understanding how a given individual best performs with a certain setup (controller configuration, screen placement, whether they are trying to hit a target or avoid an obstacle) can allow for much smoother interactions between humans and machines in lots of scenarios from partnering with an AI player to defeat a boss, to preventing damage to delicate internal tissue while performing a complicated laparoscopic surgery.”So what started as an idle, slightly nerdy question has now become a published cognitive research paper. One scientific publication has already cited it and interview requests are pouring in from podcasts and Youtubers. As for my takeaway? “The most surprising finding for gamers [who don’t invert] is that they might perform better if they practised with an inverted control scheme,” says Corbett. “Maybe not, but given our findings, it’s definitely worth a shot because it could dramatically improve competitive game play!”Explore more on these topicsGamesNeurosciencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, her submission was rejected by the organisers on the basis that it simply wasn’t Black enough. “You have to recognise the political climate at that time around practice and making a mark and I was basically taking pictures of flowers,” says Gregory. “For me, you have the right to make whatever work you want. By shutting down what can and cannot be, you start to censor yourself. I was a bit pissed off, thinking: why should you pander to what people think you should be and sit within the box that they’ve created?”Understanding the capabilities of photography has always been of great importance to Gregory, who was given the £110,000 Freelands award in 2023. It’s a journey that began by experimenting with lots of self-portraits. Her 1990 work Autoportrait is perhaps what she is best known for. It’s a set of nine individual black-and-white self-portraits, each one uniquely angled. “I think for years people thought that was the only work I had ever made,” she says.Gregory’s body of work spans media ranging from still life to portraiture to film to textiles and explores identity, cultural memory and linguistic traditions. More than 250 of her works will be on display at her retrospectiveCatching Flies With Honeyat London’s Whitechapel Gallery from October. Visitors to the show can expect to see series such as The Blonde, which examines Eurocentric ideas of beauty and Language of Flowers, inspired by the Victorians’ symbolic use of flowers to communicate messages.She’ll also be debuting a piece that has taken two decades to make. “The new commission, if I ever manage to pull it off, looks at research I’ve been doing since 2003 on endangered languages. I’ve been working with a single community and family for over 20 years. A lot of people that I worked with on it have died, and they expected something to happen eventually, so it was important to have some sort of object to show to the community.”Born in Bicester in England in 1959 to Jamaican parents, Gregory was creative from a young age. She painted, drew, made clothes and read at least one book a day. “We lived near a bindery, so when the company would throw books out that had mistakes, they would end up in a dumpster and I would pick those books out and sit and read them.” She got her first camera for her 18th birthday, which she says cost her family “all the money that they ever had”.Gregory’s dreams have always been simple: “My aspirations were about making good work.” Since the early days, she has prioritised innovation. Be it cyanotype or salt printing, photography techniques are as important as the subject matter in creating a memorable, singular image. “With digital, everything can be absolutely perfect all the time.

It was about exploring the relationship between Europe and the Caribbean. Having grown up in a Caribbean family in Europe, you become bilingual, bicultural. It was about being able to look between the two, [and explore] people’s assumptions about Europe and what they thought of the Caribbean.”The Fairest, 1999 (main image)“I got on to the idea of: why would anyone want to become blond?

Blond had always been seen as something very European, but it was also about being an object of desire, feeding into the whole Marilyn Monroe thing. There were furious rants on chatrooms about these people betraying their race, but they were playing with the idea of being able to choose your identity, which was really fascinating.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Born Welsh and Creole into largely black Dominican society in 1890, she was out of place everywhere – too foreign for Europe, too Caribbean for Britain, too white forDominica, and much too female to be taken seriously as a writer for most of her lifetime.But her literary influence continues to grow and resonate, especially with American critic and curatorHilton Als. His group show is a heady, passionate, experimental love letter to Jean Rhys – to her literature, her in-betweenness, her life of unbound creativity in a postcolonial world – in the vein of his previous exhibitions-as-portraits ofJoan DidionandJames Baldwin.View image in fullscreenBodies writhing … Untitled by Florian Krewer.Photograph: © Florian Krewer. Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery.It starts with Dominica, evoked through a blood redKara Walkerwatercolour of palms and ships, and a lush, jungly-green painting of fires and figures on horseback byHurvin Anderson, two contemporary black painters exploring the Caribbean as a place so laden with historical violence it obscures its beauty. Dominica was Rhys’s early home, and the inspiration for her most important (and final) novel,Wide Sargasso Sea, a prequel to Jane Eyre that gave voice to the Creole “madwoman in the attic” of Charlotte Brontë’s novel.Celia Paul’s wide-eyed, manic portrait of Brontë stares wildly out of a tiny canvas,Gwen John’s gorgeous, ghostly painting of a girl in a shawl stares back. Als is combining directly related work with images that invoke a wider sense of Rhys and her world, and it’s totally transportive – it immerses you in Rhys’s humid, alienating universe.Rhys left Dominica as a teen and headed for Europe, where she travelled, worked, married and remarried. Two intensely neon paintings by the young German artistFlorian Krewershow bodies twisting and writhing together, vintageHans Bellmerphotos are filled with kinky titillation, there are snapshots of Parisian streets, paintings of grubby rooms, a contorted Sarah Lucas sculpture, a grubby, textural Eugène Leroy abstract. Interwar Europe, at least for Rhys, was all sex, squalor, love and art.Downstairs, we’re taken back to Dominica, and then back again to England, as Rhys moves between the two. A hugeReggie Burrows Hodgeslandscape drenches you in jungle sweat, a dress that belonged to Rhys stands before it on a pale mannequin – small, but not dwarfed by what surrounds it.It’s hard to tell when any of the works are from. Modern Celia Paul landscapes aren’t a million miles away from an 1800 etching of a Dominican bay, history seems to be collapsing in on itself all over the show. Sex appears again in an incredible, vast, swirling, thickLeon Kossoffnude, and a wall of Walker watercolours, before the final room looks at Caribbean writers who were inspired and influenced by Rhys.Not everything here is great – twoGeorg Baselitzscribbles look tossed off and add nothing, and the Walker charcoal sex scene looks like a naff newspaper cartoon – but the show is still a highly successful exercise in exhibition making.View image in fullscreenUnbound creativity … Jean Rhys by Paul Joyce, 1977.Photograph: National Portrait Gallery LondonAls has painted a portrait of Rhys through ephemera, archive material and art. It’s not proscriptive, it doesn’t particularly have a narrative – it relies instead on vibe, on creating an atmosphere of Caribbean heat, throbbing desire, racial tension and emotional isolation. It’s like walking through memories, snapshots of a past life. It lets the idea of Rhys, her life and her world, unfold in your head.Do you have to have read Wide Sargasso Sea and Jane Eyre to get it? Well, I definitely haven’t (with apologies to my high school English teacher) but the show’s themes are deep enough to keep you hooked, and leave you bathing in the cold, shark-filled waters of Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea.Postures: Jean Rhys in the Modern World is at Michael Werner Gallery, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtFictionDominicaInstallationExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a sparkling prosecco-like aperitif, but made from apples instead of grapes. I eat a few cinnamon apple chips, then move on to the hard stuff: brandy made from heritage apple varieties.If you hadn’t guessed, apples are big business around here. I’m on a walking trip along the shores of Lake Constance, on Germany’s southern border. About 250,000 tonnes of apples are harvested in this region each year. Our trip has coincided with theannual gourmet event, when local producers set up stalls and sell their wares along 9 miles (15km) of theSeeGang hiking trailbetween Überlingen, Sipplingen and Bodman-Ludwigshafen (this year it takes place on 12 October). If apples aren’t your jam, there’s also pear-secco and spirits made from everything from plums, cherries and blackcurrants to jerusalem artichokes. Hikers can also sample food such as smoked sausages, cheeses, onion tarts, and homemade cakes and pies.Lake Constance mapLake Constance’s tourism tagline is: “Four countries – one lake”. Germany, Austria and Switzerland all meet at the lake, while Lichtenstein is just a half-hour drive away. On our short break, my boyfriend and I stick to the German section, but those with more time could easily visit three or four countries. There is a160-mile cycling circuitaround the lake, which can be divided into four to eight stages; and week-longfoodie,activeandhighlightsitineraries, all doable using public transport. TheBodensee ticketgives unlimited travel on trains, buses and ferries (from €48 for three days), while theBodensee Card Plusalso includes entry to 160 attractions (from €78 for three days; €124 for seven).View image in fullscreenHearty meat dishes and their vegan equivalents are on the menu at Constanzer Wirtshaus, on Lake Constance.Photograph: Image Broker/AlamyWe started our trip in Konstanz (anglicised as Constance), the biggest city on the lake. We took aguided tourto learn about the city’s long history – most notably the Council of Constance of 1414-1418, a series of meetings to resolve years of schism within the Catholic church – and visit its landmarks: the council building itself; Imperia, a controversial 9-metre (30ft) rotating waterfront statue of a voluptuous woman, believed to be a courtesan, holding a king and a pope in her hands, created in 1993 by Peter Lenk; themünster(cathedral) and its 78-metre tower with views over the city, lake and mountains; and the charming Niederburg district, with its cobbled alleyways and houses from the late Middle Ages.While the sun was shining, we ate outside by the water atConstanzer Wirtshaus, an inn in a former officers’ mess, built for Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1899. As well as hearty meat dishes such as knuckle of pork, shredded ox and beef roulade, I was delighted to find delicious vegan versions of regional dishes.Maultaschen, usually meat-filled dumplings, were made with plant-based mince and served with a potato and cucumber salad and vegetable gravy.We were starting to tire when we heard the rousing sound of an oompah band. Heading towards the music, we emerged at a picture-perfect mountain innWhen it rained, we took refuge inBrauhaus Joh Albrecht, a brewery and restaurant in a medieval building. Alongside its core menu of sausages, schnitzels and Swabian (southwest German) specialities such askäsespätzle(pasta with cheese and roasted onions), it serves seasonal dishes. The pumpkin soup with giant pretzels was proving popular; this autumn there is a chanterelle mushroom menu, pleasingly called apfifferlingskartein German. We tried the malty Copper beer; later in the year, the dark, strong Xmas Bock will go on sale.View image in fullscreenFruit liqueurs and spirits for sale on the shores of Lake Constance.Photograph: Neil Clive FowlerAfter all this indulgence, it was time to walk to our campsite, nearly 19km (12 miles) around the lake. Just outside the city, we reached the invitingBodensee-Thermebaths, with indoor and outdoor pools, saunas and steam rooms. We pressed on and passedMainau, known as the flower island. In September, the dahlias are in full bloom and the katsura trees give off scents of gingerbread and caramel; the arboretum is at its leaf-peeping peak in October; and the illuminatedChristmas gardenopens on 18 November.We left the lake and headed a little way into the countryside, walking through meadows and climbing a couple of hills, before strolling through the lakeside village of Dingelsdorf to theCampingplatz Klausenhornjust beyond. The nights were getting chilly, so we were glad to be staying in a cosy sleeping barrel rather than a tent. These wooden structures are supposedly based on the accommodation at the Council of Constance – but presumably a lot warmer and cleaner. The campsite has a cafe, sells fresh bread in the mornings and hosts a market on Fridays.Ufer 39, a restaurant a short walk away, serves local dishes plus pizza and pasta, in a modern space with a vaulted ceiling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was the start of our gourmet walk – shorter (at about 7 miles) than the previous day’s route but more challenging – traversing ravines, forests and, of course, orchards. A particularly memorable stop was at the Torkelbühl viewpoint, where the Kress Winery was serving wine and snacks to accompany the incredible lake panorama.Beyond Sipplingen, we were starting to tire when we heard the rousing sound of an oompah band. We headed towards the music and emerged at theHöhengasthaus Haldenhof, a picture-perfect mountain inn whose sun terrace has views all the way to the Alps. Fortified by more excellent German beer, it was a short hop to our journey’s end, theSeehotel Adlerin Bodman-Ludwigshafen. With a heated outdoor pool and three saunas, it was certainly a good place to relax after a hike. The restaurant serves pike and char fish alongside pork cheeks and steaks, and more excellent vegetarian options such aspanzerotti(mini calzones) stuffed with porcini and truffles, with thyme butter.We’d packed a lot in, but there was so much left to see: the island old town ofLindau; the Middle Agescastle at Meersburg; the Zeppelin city ofFriedrichshafen.

This week, the particular drum I’m beating has “moschofilero” written all over it. Yes, mos-ko-FIL-ero, because this is a grape variety to explore if you’re after a new wine that can be had for very competitive prices.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s an ancient grape that’s grown predominantly in the Peloponnese and onthe Mantinia plateau, where the cool climate and average elevation help this delicate grape ripen. While the wines it makes are united by a steady acid, they can also range from the intensely aromatic to the clean and zesty.So, what’s it like? I can compare it to a few things, which I always find helpful to my understanding of any grape. First, much like pinot grigio/pinot gris, moschofilero has a gorgeous, sunset-pink skin, despite it being a white grape. This means that, when the wine is left in contact with those skins, it turns a gorgeous blush pink. While such wines are marketed as rosés, technically they’re actually orange wines, because they’re produced with white grapes.The other grape I’d compare it to is gewürztraminer, which is to say, moschofilero is also used to make intensely aromatic whites: think rose petals, blossoms, jasmine, stone fruit, et cetera, et cetera. That’s why it’s known as a chameleon grape, a description that hints at its versatility and the many styles it can be used to produce, which is just one reason modern sommeliers love it so.Emily Acha Derrington, who helped develop the wine list for London’s smash hit GreekOma(she’s now wine buyer atManteca), attests to its shapeshifting qualities: “It can sit in more than one category on a restaurant list, so it’s ideal for playing around with different styles to find what works with the food you cook at home.”As a white wine, it has an acidity that works well with herby starters and Greek-style flaky filo pastries, but when it’s pink, it goes with lighter meat dishes, such as lamby salads. Emily’s favourite, however, is when it’s turned into an orange wine with more skin contact than conventional pale rosés: “They can be quite powerful, both in terms of colour and in tannin texture, but the pithy orange aromatics balance so well with the savoury, tea-like hints and dry finish.” These are wines that work especially well with chargrilled skewers, zesty salads and dips with bread for mopping them up.Those who buy their wine at the supermarket will be pleased to learn that a few of the big boys have at last embraced moschofilero as part of their own-label ranges (I suggest a couple below), but if you’re keen to shop independent, then may I recommend specialist retailerMaltby & Greek, which doesn’t have just moschofilero or even just Greek wines, but also olive oil, cheese, meat and breads.Four faces of moschofileroLoved & Found Moschofilero Rosé£9.25 Waitrose, 12.5%.

That is, first work out the size of the dish in relation to the size of the pasta sheets (this applies to both fresh and dried), then decide how many layers you want, not only to establish how many sheets you need, but also to proportion the various fillings accordingly. We also decided that the construction of a lasagne should be like that of a bricklayer combined with a Jackson Pollock approach to the sauces.My ceramic lasagne dish is 30cm x 20cm, and three 10cm x 25cm dried lasagne sheets make a single layer in it, so a five-layer lasagne requires 15 sheets. Most dried lasagne sold today doesn’t require pre-cooking or soaking, but those sheets depend on the sauce being liquid enough to provide enough moisture to hydrate and cook them. Dry sheets also require a relatively long cooking time, so, in the case of today’s lasagne, which involves a dense and creamy, rather than a liquid sauce, I dip the sheets into boiling water for 30 seconds, then in cold water and then lay them on a tea towel to dry, which gives them a head start. It also reduces the total cooking time, which suits the delicate texture of the courgette and ricotta in the sauce.Aware of the price of cheese (and also of what you might have in your fridge), I have given a range of quantities for the ricotta, parmesan and either taleggio or asiago. You can also substitute cheeses, using whatever you have to hand and to your taste, and compensate with generous seasoning and the addition of herbs. What is key for flavour, however, is the initial frying of the courgettes in olive oil and with salt, but this is intended only to get them started, because they will continue cooking in the oven, as well as fusing with the cheese and bechamel, which also functions as lasagne binding.I think that lasagne is invariably better when it is allowed to sit for at least 20 minutes before serving (and up to an hour in a warm spot), which gives the flavours time to settle and the whole thing – and in particular the cheese – time to firm up, so it cuts more easily into squares. The last slice, reheated the next day, is, of course, the best slice of all.Lasagne with courgette and three cheesesServes4-615dried lasagne sheets, or enough to make 5 layers3 tbsp olive oil,plus extra for greasing3 large or 4 medium courgettes, cut into small cubesSalt and black pepper400g ricotta1 heaped tbspfreshlyminced marjoram80g butter,plus extra for dotting on top70g plain flour800ml whole milkNutmeg60-80g parmesan, grated100-200g taleggio or asiago, cut into cubes2 tbsp dried breadcrumbsPrepare the lasagne sheets according to the packet instructions; if you are blanching them, lay them on tea towels until you are ready.Warm the olive oil in a frying pan on a medium flame, then cook the cubed courgettes with a pinch of salt, moving the cubes around until they are just starting to soften and turns translucent. Remember they will continue cooking in oven, so pull off the heat and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the ricotta, marjoram and a pinch of salt.Melt the butter in a pan, then add the flour and stir to make a thick paste. Slowly whisk in the milk and continue cooking, whisking continuously, until the bechamel thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a tablespoon of the grated parmesan.Smear the base of a suitable oven dish with olive oil, spread over spoonful of the bechamel, then make a base layer of dried lasagne sheets. Make another layer using a fifth of the bechamel topped with a quarter of the courgette and ricotta mixture, a quarter of the cubed cheese and a sprinkling of parmesan. Make another layer of pasta, then repeat the process three more times, ending with a layer of pasta. Cover that with the remaining bechamel, the breadcrumbs and dots of butter, then bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20-30 minutes, or until the edges are bubbling and the top golden.Explore more on these topicsPastaA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkCheeseVegetablesMain courseStarterrecipesShareReuse this content"

It is a traditional Sicilian breakfast, after all, so it would be rude not to. And then, perhaps, I can cling on to that summer feeling for just a tiny bit longer.Read Italian-flavoured recipes in a special edition of Feast with the Guardian this Saturday, in the Feast app and ontheguardian.com/food.My week in foodSweet’n’sour|Chick’n’Sours, my all-time favourite chicken shop, shut its doors for the last time this summer, so I was delighted to find out it isn’t closing shop for good, but instead is now focusing on festivals, pop-ups and delivery. Their tenders and seaweed crack are out of this world. So, while I’ll miss long afternoons and late-night chicken feasts with a side of perfectly sour cocktails, I’m thrilled that I’ll get to enjoy them without even having to leave the house.Cider of my eye|My husband and I don’t often share tastes in alcoholic beverages, but we have recently found common ground inthe Newt Cyder Club. This quarterly subscription treats you to a range of homegrown and pressed ciders, with a little backstory on the apples and a few of the Newt’s in-house-made treats for good measure. It’s very early for the “C” word, but this really would make a lovely present – Christmas, birthday or otherwise.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.
