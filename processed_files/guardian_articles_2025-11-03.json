The music: first, Richard Clayderman plays Bach. Then Pachelbel’s Canon, followed by the Adagio from Mahler’s 5th. Death in Venice, Live in London. Not the usual venue or playlist for a Reform press conference.Could it …? Could it be? Surely not the latest defection? Step forward, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. It would all have made perfect sense. A grifter joins a party of grifters. After all, Nige had come to Andy’s rescue last week when he called on the country to stop being so beastly to the alleged sex offender formerly known as prince.Andy has time on his hands now. Plus he no longer has any royal titles, so he’s free to stand for parliament. Plus he could probably use the money. And don’t forget that Andy was once a trade ambassador. There’s probably no dodgy dictator or billionaire with whom he is not on first-name terms. Our next foreign secretary?Sadly that would have to wait for another day. Only a matter of time. Instead we were told that Nige would be “performing” a major speech on the economy. Not “giving” but “performing”. The mock grandeur was for Nige and Nige alone. As if being in the City had somehow bought him extra credibility. His ego is expanding by the day.Still, he had drawn a fair-sized crowd. Mostly young white men in shiny dark suits. Just the kind of audience of whichSarah Pochin would approve. There again, there was no sign of Sarah at all. Maybe she is still on Nige’s naughty step. She wasn’t at any of last week’s three press conferences, either. The only Reform MP to be absent throughout. That will teach her not to say out loud what she’s thinking.Instead we got the familiar crowd of Dicky Tice, Lee Anderson, David “Diddy” Bull and Danny Kruger applauding themselves as they took their seats in the front row, closely followed by Zia Yusuf, once he had fulfilled his role of Nige’s fluffer-in-chief and master of ceremonies. “Laydeez an’ gennulmen, I give you …”Nige bounced down the marble staircase looking every bit a dead ringer for Leslie Crowther on The Price is Right before taking his place at the lectern. Serious face for a serious moment. This was meant to be a BIG speech. If by BIG you mean BORING. Forty minutes of their lives that no one would ever get back.This was really all about Farage trying to position himself as a mainstream politician. A person with views and policies that demand attention. Except all Nige really had to offer was some of his greatest hits. It turns out that four press conferences inside a week is at least three too many. He just hasn’t got that much new or interesting to say. He increasingly sounds like a broken record. One that now takes himself deadly seriously. The old Nige who could laugh at himself has been axed.But a mainstream politician is as a mainstream politician does. And Nige is learning fast. Unafraid to contradict himself and gaslight his audience. If you had taken Reform’s manifesto pledges at the last election seriously, that was because you hadn’t been reading the small print. The bits where the promise to cut taxes were merely aspirations. Things he would quite like to do in a Panglossian world. If anyone had assumed he would do the things he said he would then they were mugs. It seems Farage is learning from Labour and the Tories. When things go wrong it is invariably the voters’ fault.Nige got under way. His main theme was that the country was basically fucked. Largely because of Brexit. Weirdly, he has no memory of being the main architect behind the Brexit vote. He seems to think it happened in a world in which he played no part. Because if he had been involved he would have done it all differently. Deregulated everything and never traded with the EU ever again. Who needed the largest trading partner on our doorstep? For a politician demanding personal and fiscal responsibility, this was the height of cheek.On we went. The current crop of Labour and Tory MPs were all know-nothings. Professional politicians, the lot of them. At which point you were dying for someone to point out that Farage has been a professional politician for more than a quarter of a century. He has literally done nothing more than be a gobshite. Only, Nige will always make an exception for Nige. He is the hypocrite’s hypocrite. Come to think of it, it’s hard to think of anything useful his MPs have done, either.Next, a paean to the rich. Would no one think of them? How they suffer? (A moment’s silence for Andrew.) They needed as many breaks as they could get. Unlike those on benefits or the minimum wage – which was far too high. And pensioners could get stuffed. Them and their unaffordable triple lock. Nige had never met a pensioner who wasn’t taking several holidays a year to Barbados.So there would be welfare cuts. Saving £9bn a year on a mental health budget that only amounted to £4.5bn in total. Go figure. Now we were on a road to nowhere, just to pad out time. It couldn’t be a major speech unless it was long. Time for some more pet hates. Immigrants could go. Everyone was too afraid to wear a watch on the streets of London. Mmm. Can’t say anyone has ever cast envious glances at my Casio.Come the end, Dicky, Diddy, Danny, Lee and Zia were all nodding along. Desperate to find out if they were still wanted on voyage. They had all been written off as has-beens by Nige. In the new world order, most cabinet posts would be going to Farage’s unelected cronies. People who, Nige assured us, would know what they were doing. But not the present crowd. Nige was invited to name his chancellor. Dicky and Zia looked up needily. Farage blanked them. To be decided.

At one juncture, the interviewer asked if she didn’t think that Lux was demanding a lot from her listeners: a not entirely unreasonable question, given that it features a song cycle in four “movements”, based on the lives of various female saints and involves the 33-year-old Catalan star singing in 13 different languages to the thunderous accompaniment of the London Symphony Orchestra; and that it sounds nothing whatsoever like its predecessor, 2022’s Motomami. “Absolutely,” she responded, framing Lux as a reaction to the quick-fix dopamine hit of idly scrolling social media: something you had to focus on.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Lux.Photograph: APDemanding a lot from her listeners didn’t seem like something Rosalía was terribly bothered about, which is, in a sense, surprising. Pop has seldom seemed more prone to user-friendliness, to demanding as little as it can from its audience, as if the convenience of its primary means of transmission has affected its sound: it occasionally feels as though streaming’s algorithms – always coming up with something new that’s similar to stuff you already know – have started to define the way artists prosecute their careers. Then again, Rosalía has form when it comes to challenging her fanbase: variously infused with reggaeton, hip-hop, dubstep, dembow and experimental electronica, Motomami represented a dramatic pivot away from her 2018 breakthrough, El Mal Querer, a pop overhaul of flamenco that – incredibly – began life as the singer’s college project. It seems oddly telling that the biggest guest star on Lux is Björk, whose distinctive tone appears during Berghain, somewhere in betweena resounding orchestral arrangement, Rosalía’s own operatic vocals and the sound of Yves Tumor reprising Mike Tyson’s “I’ll fuck you ‘til you love me” tirade over and over again. It’s hard not to suspect that Rosalía sees Björk as a kindred spirit or even a model, someone who has predicated a decades-long solo career on making artistic handbrake turns through a glossy aesthetic.Rosalía: Berghain – videoStill, the shift in sound between El Mal Querer and Motomami is nothing compared to the leap between the latter and what’s on offer here. Both of Lux’s predecessors were pop albums, albeit hugely adventurous and original ones. A debate is raging about whether or not the contents of Lux could be described as classical music, a question about which Rosalía herself seems undecided – on the waltz-time La Perla, a particularly dramatic swell of strings and brass is followed by the sound of the singer giggling, as if she’s keen to undercut any pretensions. But, whether you want to label it as such or not, Lux certainlysoundscloser to classical music than it does to anything in the charts. There are definitely pop elements to these songs: Auto-Tune amid the Bernard Herrmann-ish stabs of strings, roiling kettledrums and flamenco handclaps of Porcelana; rapping on Novia Robot; melodies that you can imagine transposed into a more familiar musical setting, most obviously on the lovely Sauvignon Blanc; the kind of sped-up vocal sample that’s regularly deployed by hip-hop or house producers but that here forms part of an authentically astonishing sonic barrage at the start of Focu ‘Ranni. But these elements never feel central to Lux’s sound. Quite the opposite: they seem like oddly spectral presences, drifting through an alien landscape.So Lux demands the listener abandon preconceptions and submit themselves to its author’s way of doing things. There’s no question that this is quite a big ask. Lux is a long album; whatever its overarching story may be, it seems almost impossible to follow even with the aid of a lyric sheet that translates the sudden leaps between Spanish, Mandarin, Ukrainian, Latin et al. That said, you get the sense that somewhere in the mix of stuff about God, Catholicism, beatification and transcendence lurks the more earthy theme of an ex-boyfriend getting it in the neck: “gold medal in being a motherfucker”, run some characteristic (Spanish-sung) lines in La Perla, “emotional terrorist … world class fuck-up”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

These are uniformly beautiful songs, filled with striking moments – the point in Reliquia where a Michael Nyman-ish string arrangement is suddenly joined by a frantic, glitchy rhythm that recalls Aphex Twin’s take on drum’n’ bass; the whirlpool of strings and wordless vocals at the end of Jeanne; the moment midway through De Madrugá where the orchestra dramatically surges and the song changes key. Rosalía’s vocal performances, meanwhile, are spectacular firework displays of talent: she seems just as comfortable in the presence of fado singers on La Rumba del Perdón as she does rapping or indeed belting as if she’s on stage at the Royal Opera House. Moreover, for all their facility, they’re possessed of an emotional rawness that negates the obvious charge you might level against Lux: that it’s an arid intellectual exercise. Whatever pains have been staked in its making – the learning of languages and the hiring of Pulitzer prize-winning classical composer Caroline Shaw to provide arrangements among them – Lux is too dramatic to feel just like the answer to a clever hypothesis.It may also be too different and challenging to gain the kind of mass acceptance afforded Motomami and El Mal Querer – although the position of Berghain in the global streaming chart suggests not, and there’s something genuinely buoying about that. In a world where listeners are increasingly encouraged to lean back and let the algorithm and AI do the work for them, it would be hugely encouraging to think that people might embrace an album that asks you to do the exact opposite. If you have to put effort in to appreciate Lux, the effort is repaid: there’s a lesson in there that’s worth taking note of.Explore more on these topicsRosalíaPop and rockBjörkClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s whyAdapting your fitness routine to your physical realities can help prevent injury from over-exercisingTell us: have you fallen in love this year?Theresa MacPhailMon 3 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 12.02 ESTShareLast year, I had to give up running. It was, as my sports medicine doctor counseled, “time”.Since I was a teen, it had been my primary form of exercise and stress relief. But for months, I had been ignoring small signs of encroaching decrepitude: the popping and grinding in my right knee and hip joints whenever I stood up, bent down or took the stairs. The medical term for this is crepitus, yet I kept stubbornly persuading myself that I was still a “young” fiftysomething.I had imbibed the common positive ageing message: “50 is the new 30.” Yet as far as the cells that make up my knee and hip tendons and cartilage are concerned, 50 is still very much 50. So much for the popular idea that our overall “biological age” can be far younger than our chronological age.For decades, I had done everything experts recommend – eat well, sleep well, exercise – and yet my doctor was still telling me it was time to adapt to my changing body.My physiatrist told me that many of his gen X patients, now in their late 40s and 50s, have bought into the idea that age shouldn’t be a factor when it comes to what exercise they do or how they do it. Each trendy sport or exercise sends a new wave of us into his office and others like it. For instance,a 2020 studyfound that nearly 91% of people showing up to the emergency room with injuries related to playing pickleball were over 50.Many people approach their physical fitness as if they were a decade or two younger. My GP told me that patients over 50 are often frustrated by any suggestion that their routines might have to change. I started to see this denial of physical realities everywhere. One of my colleagues injured her shoulder doing CrossFit, then re-injured herself a few months later doing the same routine. A friend who has practiced yoga for decades fractured her chin in a fall from crow pose. When I suggested she modify her routine, she scoffed.How do I stay healthy in my 50s, 60s and 70s?Read moreAs a medical anthropologist, I wondered: had anti-ageing messaging accidentally created a new problem? Was our generation at risk not from under-exercising, like the boomer and silent generations before us, but from over-exercising?How our bodies change as we ageDr Emily Finkelstein, a geriatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine, loves that people in their 40s, 50s and 60s have internalized that exercise is important for healthy ageing and longevity. That being said, there are some practical considerations.“Our muscle mass and our performance peak in our mid-30s,” Finkelstein said, “and start to naturally decline after that. We do need to be flexible in terms of what we’re doing and expecting of ourselves.”As we edge past 45, we begin to lose critical muscle mass, which can decrease our strength and balance. Decreases in bone density can leave us more vulnerable to stress fractures from repetitive motions and stress. The cartilage in our joints thin, while tendons and ligaments stiffen. All of this means we’re more prone to injuries during physical activity. Recovery takes longer too.“The thing that people don’t know and don’t learn,” Dr Rosanne Leipzig said, “is that ageing begins at birth, and your abilities are definitely going to change.” Leipzig knows quite a lot about this process, both as a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and as someone in her 70s.“You reach a maximum for your muscle mass, bone strength, ability to remember a list of words, all in your 30s. And everything starts to decline after that,” she said. “Ageing doesn’t mean that you can’t do what you did previously, but you probably can’t do as much in the same time period.”One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptableDr Emily FinkelsteinMost experts agreed that messages like “50 is the new 30” can be helpful if they convince people not to write themselves off as they age. It’s OK to push ourselves a bit physically. But the flip side is an assumption that a 50-year-old body isn’t different from a 30-year-old body. It is.“One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable,” Finkelstein said. “We need to change our expectations and we need to change how we exercise as we get older.”How to adapt to ageing bodies and avoid injuryIn midlife, we should all learn to be more in tune with our bodies. That might mean taking more recovery time between intense workouts, doing more stretching and integrating more weights into our fitness routines.A healthy adaptive approach to exercising as we age might involve regular self-monitoring and assessment of how our bodies feel both during and after workouts, and seeking input from a qualified medical professional when we start to notice any signs or symptoms of an encroaching problem, such as pain or discomfort.Leipzig suggests that physicians begin conversations about adjustments by asking patients what it is they love about an activity they’re holding on to. A tennis player might really love the social aspect. In that case, they could switch to pickleball – which is less taxing, but similar – with a complementary strength-training and stretching regimen to prevent injuries.But since risk of injury naturally rises as we age, it’s also important to have a backup plan for if and when we overdo it. When I talked to Dr Melissa Leber, associate professor of orthopedics and emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine, she had just finished working at the US Open. Leber has a lot of experience dealing with athletes – both professional and amateur – who have pushed themselves a bit too hard.“Some people are really good at adjusting and they’re comfortable with their bodies changing,” Leber said. “Others go hardcore. I’ve seen some patients who don’t even want a day off.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLeber counsels patients to switch things up while allowing their body to recover. So, if you’re a runner with an injury, try a modified strength-training routine and a lower-impact activity, like swimming. Then, when you start running again, run fewer times a week or for shorter distances. To avoid injury or overuse, experts recommend one or two rest days a week, at minimum.Strength training is also very important. “The stronger you are,” Leber said, “the more you will avoid injury and falls. And when you do fall, you will fall differently. Your balance will be better, and you’ll recover from injury faster.”As a rule, Leber advises that someone in their 50s should spend 50% of their total exercise time on strength training and 50% doing cardio. By age 60, that metric should be 60% strength and 40% cardio. By 70, cardio should only comprise 30% of a workout.All of the experts I spoke to agree that pain should never be ignored – and it’s never a good idea to push through the pain without seeing your doctor. That being said, Finkelstein pointed out that most general physicians aren’t all that well-trained in exercise physiology. For specific recommendations pertaining to exercise regimens, it’s better to see a physiatrist, specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation or certified physical trainer.“I wish we were all better trained in that,” Finkelstein said, “because it’s so important.”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’To compound this, conversations about how to maintain muscle mass, bone health, aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness take more time than the average physician can spend with their patients. Many people fill that gap with advice from fitness influencers online.Cultivating realistic expectations of ageingFinkelstein worries about the effect of the media – especially social media, with its legions of wellness and anti-ageing influencers. “Take these supplements, do this exercise program, join this fitness routine: you name it, people are serving it up,” she said. “I worry a lot about that in terms of the reliability of those people and the science behind what they’re offering, and people being vulnerable to that because you want to do what you can to stay healthy and youthful.”Popular media also loves to feature “superagers” – people whose mental and/or physical abilities are comparable to people 20-30 years younger. And while it’s good to see, say, an 87-year-old running a marathon, it may lead to false expectations about normal ageing. Superagers are rare; only about 10% of the general population fit all the criteria for inclusion in the category.In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting … that things are going to changeDr Rosanne LeipzigIn other words, it’s not very realistic for those of us in our middle age or older to think we’ll rack up those personal bests forever. As the experts kept pointing out, the best approach to exercising as we age is realistic and adaptive. A runner who adapts to the changes of their ageing body and trains effectively may still be able to run the Boston marathon, but the time it takes for them to cross the finish line will necessarily lengthen.Part of the problem might be optimism bias. While we may logically understand that bodies change, we don’t think we are actually changing. Maybe that’s because we’re living in a culture that is obsessed not only with longevity, but with looking younger. The number of cosmetic procedures hasincreased 42.5% globallyover the last four years, and Americans spent an estimated$20bn on cosmetic surgeryin 2024.“In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting the fact that things are going to change,” Leipzig said. “People are in better shape in general than they ever have been, if they’re privileged enough to be able to take care of their needs, but it leads them to think they will never die. It leads to ageism.”And that’s the rub: being overly concerned with how much “younger” you are for your age is just another form of bias – one that you can hold against your future self. “Fifty is the new 30” simply underscores our misconception that being healthy means not ageing at all. It would be healthier if we occasionally reminded ourselves that ageing is a privilege; that “50 is 50” and “80 is 80” – and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAgeingFitnessHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a cost of living crisis, the elves struggle to afford top-notch toy-making materials, and there is strong resistance to using plastic amid the climate crisis. Nonetheless, the wishlists remain the same: teddies, model cars, jewellery, games. What is the person in charge of presents to do?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.AYouGov poll last yearfound more than half of parents planned to spend in excess of £90 a child on Christmas presents. And yet, asresearch by toy subscription service Whirlifound, approximately 26% of Christmas toys – a jaw-dropping 25 million – are neglected by the end of January in the UK alone. What’s more, almost 80% of toys – much of them plastic –will eventually end up in landfill, incinerators or the ocean.As a mum of two, these statistics weigh heavily on my mind, and I’ve become increasingly irritated by how hard it is to find eco-friendly options that won’t break the bank. Well, necessity is indeed the mother of invention, which is why I created my own list. The gifts on it have largely been tested by children – some by my own (aged two and four), others by family (aged 10) and friends’ (aged three and five) – and a few by adults. Not everything is completely plastic-free, but I have focused on eco-friendly materials, design and cost to help you have a happy, and hopefully guilt-free, shopping experience.The best sustainable gifts for young childrenTake comfortView image in fullscreenGolden Lion baby comforter toy£14 at Little Green RadicalsIf you worry about the impact of polyester teddies, take note of these baby comforters by Little Green Radicals.

Suitable from birth (supervised), this comforter is also machine washable at 30C.Suitable:from birthToys built to lastView image in fullscreenConstruction toy cars, trucks and diggers£24.95 at Le Toy Van£24.95 at ScandibornEco-conscious parents love a wooden car, but the challenge is getting children to love them more than their plastic counterparts. Le Toy Van may have cracked it with this exquisite construction set: five vehicles, three traffic cones, one roadworks sign, all made from FSC-certified wood. Highly prized by the testers of this piece, their status as VITs – Very ImportantToys– grew to incomparable heights when it was discovered they were compatible with wooden tracks (Brio etc). Including a cement mixer and dumper truck, they are not cheap, but the quality is premium, and if you wrap them individually, technically, this counts as at least five gifts.Suitable:for 3+Enjoy the great outdoorsView image in fullscreenForaging friend kit£10.50 at the Den Kit CompanyIt’s an intriguing idea: charge around the great outdoors in search of leaves and sticks to create a woodland companion. The winter months are perfect for this foraging kit as there tends to be more on the ground than up in the branches. In your hunt for ears for your new friend (a figure made from UK-grown wood), you may discover such delights as snowdrops and primroses, and of course, all manner of sticks and leaves. It’s helpful if you have a plant ID app, as that adds an educational element to the fun. I also found it’s useful to name your friend before you start, bringing it to life.Suitable:for 3+Sow it growsView image in fullscreenGrow your own cress kit£5.99 at Gardening for KidsCarefully water the coir disc (made from waste coconut husks, not peat), pat it into the bamboo pot (made from recycled chopsticks) and sow rather too many of the seeds all at once. This seed growing kit is the perfect way to introduce little ones to gardening – and there’s an impressive range, from sunflowers to cherry tomatoes.Suitable:for 3+A bit of biteView image in fullscreenVeggie baby teething ring£12.95 at BabipurIs it ever too early to get children into vegetables? I think not. Start them early with one of Oli & Carol’s veggie teething rings. Made from 100% natural rubber from hevea trees, the radish and carrot design is brightly coloured and features interesting textures to rub against the gums. Biodegradable and hand-painted (with natural pigments), it ticks all the environmentally-friendly boxes you’d want from something your baby spends a lot of time sucking. A doddle to clean (no holes to prevent mould), once your baby has grown out of teethers, repurpose it as a bath toy.Suitable:from birthMeet your matchView image in fullscreenTractors pairs game£5.39 at Tinney’s Toys£5.51 at AmazonIt’s a competitive field, pairs cards. With so many on the market, it seems remiss to favour just one, though if you have a tractor lover in your family, this is an easy win. You start by explaining the rules of snap – matching blue tractors or red tractors – but be prepared to get educated because you may find yourself corrected by your little one to refer to “blue tractors with the seed drill” or “red tractors with the mower”. It’s as much a test of your memory for machinery as it is for your child to match pictures. Beyond the game, there is amusement to be found in examining the cards – a handy distraction to have up your sleeve.Suitable:for 3+Artfully recycledView image in fullscreenRecycling craft kit£3.50 at Tutti Frutti ClothingAn estimatedthree million tonnes of extra wasteis thrown out over Christmas in the UK. A recycling craft kit is not going to minimise much of that, but it’s a good way to get your kids thinking about what they throw away. Each RecycleMe mini kit comes with clear instructions on how to make a specific project, which could be a rocket, mermaid or animal. Your child has to seek out the main material from “rubbish” they find in the home – an egg box or a plastic bottle – and then use it, plus accessories in the kit, to make an artistic creation. This one got the thumbs up from little ones of ages three, four and five.Suitable:for 4+Lighting up play timeView image in fullscreenHand-powered flashlight£17 at Jarrolds£19.24 at AmazonA torch that is chargeable by hand sounds a bit like magic, but that is how Hape’s hand-powered flashlight operates. It converts kinetic energy into electricity and light, meaning all your child has to do to power it up is pull a green ring at the end a few times, turn the front to “on”, and – abracadabra – light! Made from bamboo and biomass plastic, this ingenious gadget would be ideal for camping, outdoor adventures or simply checking up on bug life in the garden after dark.

This is perfect for a rainy afternoon, if you have hard floors, so much the better, as that makes for a faster game, but even on carpet, it appeals. It’s great for developing hand-eye coordination while numbered pins help with numeracy. They arrive with a practical pouch for storage.Suitable:for 1+, but very much enjoyed by older kidsLife in colourView image in fullscreenRice bran wax crayons, set of 12£14.95 at Cass Art£16.99 at AmazonIt is impossible to overemphasise how deluxe these crayons are. Described by its manufacturers as “buttery”, that’s exactly how they feel, gliding smoothly across the page. What’s special about them is that they are made from one of the waste products of rice production, rice bran wax, which is non-toxic and uses less energy to process. You can draw with them on mirrors and glass, in addition to paper, and if you encourage your children to go over their masterpieces with a wet paintbrush, they can also transform into watercolours.Suitable:for 3+Hoop dreamsView image in fullscreenMini croquet set£16.95 at eBay£16.95 at AmazonOne for older kids, this classic in miniature enables the enjoyment of the historic game to be brought indoors and played throughout the winter. A lot more precision is required than you may at first think, tapping small balls through small hoops with a mallet the size of your hand. A lot depends on how level the floor is, although an uneven one makes the sport as much one of luck as skill – and isn’t that more exciting?Suitable:for 3+Brace yourself, and othersView image in fullscreenFriendship bracelet kit£19 at John Lewis£19 at DunelmNo place for plastic beads here – enjoy the friendship bracelet fun in eco-fashion with cotton thread, courtesy of Cotton Clara. While originally designed for adults, these kits are great for older children, who would enjoy the more intricate patterns of chevrons and, for instance, zippers. With six designs included for up to 15 bracelets – as well as a bulldog clip to keep the thread steady as you work – this pastime provides a welcome escape from screens, with something creative to show for it afterwards.Suitable:children under 14 should be supervised by an adultModel behaviourView image in fullscreenWooden 3D gorilla model£11.20 at eBay£8.96 at AmazonIf you are raising a future architect who would relish the challenge of building aHedwig with broom, R2-D2, Iron Man or perhaps a primate, take a look at IncrediBuilds. The 3D models are constructed from FSC-certified wooden pieces, which pop out from wooden sheets to be pieced together with the help of instructions. While not as hardy as they may seem – a heavy hand could snap one of the components, so a light touch is advised – your child can paint them before assembling, which makes for an impressive finish. Worthy of display on a bookshelf or even in pride of place in a bedroom.Suitable:9+Facts made funView image in fullscreenChildren’s encyclopedia£30 at Waterstones£23.13 at AmazonPre-digital age, the fastest way to find things out would be to look them up in a reference book. Keep this skill alive by investing in Britannica’s updated children’s encyclopedia. Inside its colourful pages lies a wealth of information, which takes the reader from the origins of the universe through to AI – a different experience from the static A-Z format of old. Covering topics including space, history, and climate change, it engages through beautiful illustrations, photographs, diagrams, and some pretty impressive facts. Did you know that our noses can pick out one trillion different smells? Or that an Earth-sized nebula cloud would only be as heavy as … some potatoes? The children I asked to test this loved it – even those who can’t read yet.Suitable:8+Great pick-me upView image in fullscreenPick-up sticks£2.99 at Mulberry BushAn oldie but a goodie, this game teaches kids about precision. The sticks are held upright, then dropped so they fall chaotically in a pile. The object of the game is to remove the sticks from the heap, one at a time, without disturbing any of the others. If you do, you forgo your turn; the person with the most sticks at the end wins the game. Nail-biting at times, and positively irritating at others, this game is surprisingly addictive.

The tension ratchets up as incoming communications show a catastrophe taking place outside, and gets worse as the boss appears to be infected, and the two Home Office officials attempt to leave, forcing Matthew Macfadyen’s character to decide between shooting them, or letting them go and risking contaminating the sealed MI5 offices. This being Spooks, it is unsurprising which one he chooses.Paul, Sheffield‘A 66-minute stress bomb’: TV’s most intense episodes everRead moreThreads (1984)View image in fullscreenAbsolutely terrifying … Victoria O’Keefe as a survivor in the ruins in Threads.Photograph: BBC ArchiveThreads was low budget but one of the most frightening programmes I’ve ever seen because of the stark reality and grim official statistics. Watched it about a month ago having watched the original; I used to visit the pub in Sheffield from the programme which emphasised the reality and the glib matter-of-fact official information which was broadcast. Still absolutely terrifying 35 years later.John Bradbury, IlkleySeverance – The We We Are (2022)View image in fullscreenLike an eruption! … Severance.Photograph: AppleThe season one finale of Severance has to be right up there. I spent the entire episode quite literally on the edge of my seat, straining every sinew with Dylan to keep his hands on the levers that kept the Innies on overtime, while screaming at the Innies to get their truths out there.

I had to pause and get up and leave the room several times because of the sheer scale of the wanton self-destruction I was witnessing. Rishi Ramdani is in deep shit at work and home – up to his eyeballs in debt to loan sharks because of his compulsive gambling, taking such risks with a bet on sterling which could lose his company millions. So of course, he goes on a gambling spree, does tons of drugs and drink and wins, loses, wins, gets beaten to a pulp. Every time you think it can’t get any worse, it does. There’s hope of redemption at the end of the episode but he squanders the opportunity, with horrifying consequences in the season finale. Definitely needed a lie-down after that!Tania, LondonPeep Show – Holiday (2007)View image in fullscreenSo cringe you’ll end up riddled with anxiety … Robert Webb as Jez in Peep Show.Photograph: Channel 4Peep Show itself isn’t necessarily a stressful show. But the episode Holiday contains such levels of cringe that it’ll have you standing up the whole episode, riddled with anxiety. It all ramps up once Jeremy and Mark find themselves having to lie about the dog they accidentally run over and subsequent attempts to dispose of it. You then spend the rest of the episode questioning whether it truly can be worse than incineration, and it can be!Dan, Canberra, AustraliaThe West Wing – The Two Cathedrals (2001)View image in fullscreenWonderful television, never bettered … Martin Sheen in The West Wing.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyNothing I’ve watched has been more intense than the first time I watched the season two finale to The West Wing. The episode starts with the aftermath of the death (in a traffic accident) of the president’s personal secretary and reaches a crescendo with a crisis in Haiti, and the fallout from the non-disclosure of the president’s MS diagnosis, with confirmation of his intention to seek re-election.

And if you watched it when it originally aired, you – at first – weren’t sure why. Tony’s enemies, real and imagined, were all vanquished. Surely this has the feel of the season one ending? “Remember the little things.” But the mood is bizarrely ominous. Almost Twin Peaks levels of terror. The family sit in a restaurant. Meadow parks. Tony sadly tells Carmela there’s trouble afoot with yet another of his crew working with the government. Meadow parks. Strange people enter the restaurant. Stare at Tony(?) Meadow parks. Tony puts a record on the jukebox. Meadow parks. The bell rings, someone enters the restaurant. Can’t be Meadow, she’s still parking. Tony looks up. Don’t stop. It stops. My heart dropped from my mouth about 20 minutes later.Paul Wilson, Hebburn Tyne and WearThe Walking Dead – The Last Day on Earth (2016)View image in fullscreenWhat a cliffhanger … The Walking Dead.Photograph: Gene Page/AMCI stayed up to watch this episode at 2am.

The victim’s POV shot and the muffled sounds – argh! We then had to wait for season seven for the outcome.

The battle sequences hold up but the sheer weight of the stakes involved and the performances by Bruce Boxleitner and especially the late Mira Furlan are utterly compelling. Creator J Michael Straczynski originated the term “Wham Episode”, and this one delivers both in terms of building suspense when the opposing forces square off and at the end when the dust has settled you’re not left with a feeling of victory but instead the biggest “well what now?” of the show’s run. It gives me goosebumps even 30 years later.Greg, MerseysideThe Killing (Danish version) – episode 19 (2007)View image in fullscreenAn absolute masterpiece … Sofie Gråbøl in The Killing.Photograph: Nbc/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe first series of the The Killing (Danish version) is an absolute masterpiece, which spawned many a copycat and yet to be matched.

BTP said the suspect left the location. A BTP spokesperson said: “Police subsequently identified Williams as a suspect and took steps to locate and arrest him.”0:17Moment suspect in Huntingdon train attack was arrested – videoBTP’s investigation now includes three other incidents in Peterborough on Friday and Saturday morning. Cambridgeshire police said the first was the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy, who received minor injuries, by a man in Peterborough city centre.A man was later seen with a knife at a barber’s in Fletton, Peterborough, at 7.25pm on Friday. That incident was reported at 9.10pm to police. The Cambridgeshire force said a crime was recorded but officers were not sent.Police said that at 9.25am on Saturday officers were called to the same barber’s. They arrived 18 minutes later and could not find the suspect.View image in fullscreenThe barbershop in Fletton, Peterborough, where a man with a knife was seen.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PACambridgeshire police said: “We are currently reviewing all incidents in the timeframe to understand whether there were any further potential offences.”Details have emerged about the victims of the train attack. A Scunthorpe United footballer, Jonathan Gjoshe, was one of 11 people treated in hospital after the incident. Five remain in hospital including a train guard hailed as a hero for protecting passengers.Williams was remanded in custody after his court hearing and Stuart Cundy, the deputy chief constable of BTP, said: “Our investigation is also looking at other possible linked offences.”Williams is also charged with one count of actual bodily harm over an alleged attack on a police officer in a custody suite after the train incident.Graphic of timelineOn Monday the train’s driver, Andrew Johnson, who was praised for diverting the train to Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, where police were able to intervene, spoke for the first time.He was driving the 6.25pm service from Doncaster to London when the violence broke out onboard. He contacted a signaller and the decision was taken to divert the train.Johnson said: “As train drivers, we hold a lot of responsibility. We practise our emergency response and keep up to date with our knowledge of the route, so if needed, we know exactly where to stop and what to do.“The action I took is the same as any other driver. I think my colleagues onboard were the real heroes and I’d like to pay tribute to their bravery.”1:50Shabana Mahmood gives update on the Cambridgeshire train stabbing suspect – videoThe government has ruled out routinely installing knife arches in rail stations, and in the House of Commons on Monday the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, praised the bravery of police, the emergency services, train staff and passengers.“I would also like to pay tribute to the breathtaking bravery of those on the train itself, including the heroic acts of the passengers and train crew who intercepted the attacker,” Mahmood said. “I would like to draw particular attention to one member of the onboard crew, who ran towards danger, confronting the attacker for a sustained period of time, and stopped his advance through the train.“He put himself in harm’s way, suffered grievous injuries as a result, and remains in hospital today, in a critical but stable condition. On Saturday he went to work to do his job. Today he is a hero, and for ever will be.”Mahmood added: “Since Saturday’s attack, the British Transport Police have increased their presence at key points in the transport network, though it should be noted their operational assessment of the risk posed on our trains has not changed as this was an isolated attack.“I know that ideas have already been suggested about how policing should change in response to this event. Once the facts are known, we must examine what more might have been done to stop this horrific event from ever occurring, and whether there are measures that we must now take to better protect the public, on our streets and on our trains. However, that must be done when all the facts are available to us.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Though it often leaves no visible injury, oxygen deprivation, even for very short moments, causes changes to the fragile structures of the brain.Multiple studies have specifically shown brain changes in women who have been repeatedly “choked” during sex,including markers for brain damageanddisruptions in brain hemispheres linked to depression and anxiety.Due to these dangers, non-fatal strangulation and non-fatal suffocation were made a criminal offence as part of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, after concerns that perpetrators would often avoid punishment because they leave no visible marks.Under the new amendment, platforms will be required to take proactive steps to prevent users from seeing illegal strangulation and suffocation content.The choking ban is set to become a priority offence, meaning porn sites and tech platforms will have a legal requirement to ensure UK users do not see this material.The Ministry of Justice said this could include companies using automated systems to pre-emptively detect and hide images, moderation tools or stricter content policies to prevent abusive content from circulating.Those who fail to take action will be subject to fines of up to £18m from Ofcom.Bernie Ryan, chief executive of the Institute For Addressing Strangulation, said the organisation welcomed the ban. “While consenting adults have the right to explore their sexuality safely and freely, we must recognise the serious risks posed by unregulated online content, especially to children and young people.“Strangulation is a serious form of violence, often used in domestic abuse to control, silence, or terrify. When it’s portrayed in pornography, particularly without context, it can send confusing and harmful messages to young people about what is normal or acceptable in intimate relationships. Our research shows there is no safe way to strangle.”Minister for Victims and Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls, Alex Davies-Jones said online misogyny had “devastating real-life consequences for all of us”. Every day, women and girls have their lives turned upside down by cowards who hide behind screens to abuse and exploit them.“This government will not stand by whilst women are violated online and victimised by violent pornography which is allowed to normalise harm.“We are sending a strong message that dangerous and sexist behaviour will not be tolerated.”It follows a UK government-commissioned review in 2020 that highlighted “substantial evidence ofan association between the use of pornography and harmful sexual attitudes and behaviours towards women”.A separate survey of children the same year found that most of them had come across violent or aggressive pornography that they found upsetting or disturbing, with some of them copying the behaviour they had seen online. Children who watched porn were between three and six times more likely to have “potentially dangerous behaviour” around consent,the research by the British Board of Film Classification found.Explore more on these topicsPornographyViolence against women and girlsOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

The victim was hospitalised with injuries including broken ribs, a punctured lung and rectal damage, according to the indictment, and Tomer-Yerushalmi launched an investigation.The government and far-right politicians and pundits have accused her of damaging Israel’s global standing by pursing the case and releasing the video, in effect casting her efforts to prosecute extreme violence as a project to undermine the state.“The incident in Sde Teiman caused immense damage to the image of the state of Israel and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement on Sunday. “This is perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the state of Israel has experienced since its establishment.”After the first detentions of soldiers in the case in summer 2024, a far-right mob gathered outside Sde Teiman calling for the investigation to be dropped. Some of the protesters – including a minister and two members of the Knesset –broke into the base.Tomer-Yerushalmi leaked the video in August 2024 after the protests, saying in her resignation letter that it was “an attempt to debunk false propaganda against army law enforcement bodies”.Days later, five soldiers were charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm. They have not been named and arecurrently not in custody or under any legal restrictions, Israeli media reported.Tomer-Yerushalemi subsequently refused to open or advance investigations into other cases of possible war crimes by the Israeli military, because of the pressure of public attacks over the case, Haaretzreported.There has been only oneconvictionof an Israeli soldier for assaulting Palestinians in detention during the war, althoughwidespread torture and abusehave been documented in Israel’s jail system, and dozens of Palestinians have died in captivity.No soldiers have been charged for killing civilians in Gaza, even after high-profile attacks that prompted international outrage, including the killing ofparamedicsand strikes on ateamfrom the World Central Kitchen charity. Tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza have been killed in attacks and airstrikes over two years.Attacks on Tomer-Yerushalemi over the Sde Teiman affair intensified in recent days amid reports that she was responsible for leaking the video. There were official demands for her to step down and personal threats online, even after she announced her resignation.The campaign briefly halted on Sunday afternoon amid fears for her life, after her partner reported her missing to the police and her car was found empty at a beach in the Tel Aviv area with a note inside, Israeli media reported.Then she was found, and within minutes the attacks resumed. The far-right commentator Yinon Magal posted on X, “we can proceed with the lynching”, adding a winking emoji.Soon after, protesters had gathered outside her house, Israeli media reported, shouting slogans including “we will give you no peace”. The defence minister, Israel Katz, later accused her of “spreading blood libels”.Traditionally Israel’s government and military have considered the existence of an independent judiciary a crucial barrier to international legal tribunals investigating Israel for alleged abuses against Palestinians.Where there is a robust national legal system willing and able to investigate and prosecute crimes, international courts are less likely to have jurisdiction to intervene.“Don’t they understand we had no choice? That the only way to address the wave of international legal proceedings is by proving we can investigate ourselves?” the investigative reporter Ronen Bergman quoted the advocate general telling colleagues six weeks ago, in a report for Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.In recent decades many Israelis have seen the role of the military advocate general “as protecting soldiers from prosecution abroad”, said Prof Yagil Levy, head of the Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at Israel’s Open University.“In other words, the law is not upheld as a value in itself, but as a defence against international tribunals.”Now even such legal pragmatism is under attack by the political right, whose influence can be seen in the lack of legal accountability for soldiers’ conduct in Gaza over the past two years, Levy added.“During the war, the advocate general gave the army a free hand in Gaza, for example, regarding the unprecedented collateral damage from airstrikes,” he said.“This reflects a far weaker commitment to international law, with some on the right claiming that Israel is exempt from respecting it, and even providing religious justifications for this view.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite this, the parish council will still be liable for the hire cost, as the arrangements were in place before the permit was issued.”It said it would be “disappointing” if the lights could not be installed “but unfortunately this situation is beyond the parish council’s control”.In a statement to the Guardian, the parish council said: “It is not within the contractor’s remit to remove flags as part of the installation process. As the flags and street columns are not council property, the parish council is not permitted to use public funds to pay for their removal.“We are hoping that whoever installed the flags will be able to remove them in due course to allow for the festive lights to be installed as planned.” It said it would not be making any further comment.After Reform’s landslide election win in May, the new Reform leader ofKentcounty council, Linden Kemkaran, said:“The union jack, the flag of St George and the flag of Kent, they are the identity that we all share and it is that identity that we need to focus on.”In August it was reported that highways teams in Kent would not be removing St George’s flags unless they posed a safety risk, such as blocking the view of CCTV cameras, or anything affecting road signage and the safety of the public.Peter Osborne, Kent council’s cabinet member for highways and transport, said: “The claim that Harrietsham parish council will face significant extra costs is simply wrong. The contractor they have already hired to install the Christmas lights can remove any obstructing flags as part of the same job – no additional significant expense should be expected.“We fully support communities coming together to celebrate Christmas with festive lights – it’s a valued tradition that brings people together. But safety must come first. Flags on streetlight columns pose a risk during installation, so they must be removed to ensure the lights go up safely and can be enjoyed by everyone.”Stuart Jeffrey, a Kent county councillor for the Greens and leader of Maidstone borough council, said the situation was “beyond ironic”.He said the A20 running through the middle of Harrietsham was “lined either side with these flags”. While the county council had removed flags when they were a danger, “they have been very clear that they are fundamentally supportive”, he said.The parish council could remove the flags, Jeffrey said, as they had not been put up with Kent’s permission and removing them “would not be breaking the law”.Alister Brady, a Labour Kent county councillor, said: “Putting up flags on lamp-posts, by the so called patriots, with the intention to intimate minorities is a disgraceful use of our flag. We are a proudly tolerant country which has a history of inclusion.“We now hear that through the actions of the few they have impacted the festive period for the many. Kent county council should now come out and be clear on this matter instead of being concerned about a negative reaction from the far right.“The festive lights are a way to bring people together; those who put flags on lamp-posts are trying to do the opposite. Kent county council have a duty to keep the highways safe and street furniture clear, so instead of posturing and infighting they should get on with that job.”Explore more on these topicsKentReform UKLocal governmentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

While it did not announce any new policies as such, it marked the most detailed explanation yet of what a Reform UK government might prioritise. Below are six areas he discussed.1.Tax cuts – or the lack of themAs recently as the buildup to May’s local elections, Reform was pledging to raise the threshold at which people start paying income tax from £12,570 to £20,000, bringing many thousands out of tax butcosting the exchequermore than £40bn a year.Amid increasing scrutiny about how or if this could be paid for, Farage has rolled back. Quizzed after the speech on whether the policy still stood, he said he would “want” a £20,000 threshold but this was an eventual aspiration.It was, he said, impossible to know what state the economy would be in by the time of the next election, meaning most firm promises would need to wait for now. There was one exception – Farage said he would reverse Labour’s changes toinheritance tax on farms.Whatever Labour achieves over the rest of the parliament there will be a difficult inheritance. But raising the tax threshold is difficult to justify when it mainly benefits richer taxpayers who can earn more before they hit the 40p tax rate.2.Two-child benefit cap, wages and pensionsAt a press conference last week, Reformsaid it could save £9bn a yearby tightening eligibility for personal independence payments, or Pip. Asked about another benefit-related policy – the party’s pledge to scrap the two-child limit on payments of some benefits such as universal credit – Farage said this would happen for UK nationals only where both parents worked, which notably limits its generosity.As part of his wider reluctance to spell out specific policies, Farage declined to commit to the so-called triple lock on guaranteeing significant annual increases to pensions – but was willing to say that the minimum wage was possibly “too high for younger workers”.Most economists recommend tackling mental health issues before the withdrawal of benefits. They would also be concerned at the discriminatory effect of raising the two-child cap only for UK nationals., but would welcome equivocation over the triple lock. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has proposed reverting to the earnings link with a safety net, saving the government billions of pounds over the next 30 years.3.Rich people and entrepreneursWhile polling regularly shows that the cost of living is one of the biggest priorities for voters, Farage paid little attention to this, beyond passing references to fuel bills and the supposed impact of migration.There was, however, a lot of talk about an alleged exodus of wealthy people and young entrepreneurs amid a punitive tax regime, a narrativenot backed up by much evidence. Such types, whom Farage called a different economic “breed” to ordinary mortals, should be cherished at all costs, he said.Even more leftwing Labour MPs would accept the role of entrepreneurs and other wealth-creators in generating growth. But repeated talk about the vital role of the rich – even if Farage also took pains to talk up the role of all small businesses – might feel some distance from histalk a few months agoabout Reform being the party of workers and unions.4.PensionsWhile public sector workers might not always be Reform’s primary target group for support, if they are to win the election they need to spread the net wide. As such, theparty’s hintsat possibly scrapping defined benefits pensions for public sector workers might not go down so well, even if (like the triple lock) it is a conversation most parties will be having in private.Asked about this, Farage was somewhat coy, saying only that the party was committed to reducing the fees paid by councils to administer pension schemes, something its deputy leader, Richard Tice, has talked about before.Labour has put in train plans to consolidate council retirement schemes and reduce the fees, and in so doing, might have stymied Farage’s plan by 2029.5.Energy and net zeroKeeping with the theme of “Reform-favourite policies which don’t necessarily poll hugely well with voters more widely”, Farage used a long section of his speech to condemn what he called the “lunatic” push for net zero, promising instead to prioritise new drilling for fossil fuels in the North Sea.While the idea of lower energy costs, as promised by Farage, would be popular, there is very limited evidence that a new drilling push in the North Sea would achieve this. And for all that some rightwing papers and commentators talk as if the government’s net zero targets are hated, polling generally suggests otherwise.That said, Ed Miliband may need to slow the pace of solar and wind projects, neutering this line of attack. The energy secretary is under pressure to alleviate the burden on business from high energy costs made wore by net zero subsidies.6.Diversity and inclusionOn economics, as with other policies, Farage is generally careful to keep some distance from Donald Trump, who is a distinctly niche proposition for UK voters. But in one area he is fully onboard with the UK president – diversity policies.A fairly large section of Farage’s speech lambasted what he called the massive over-regulation of the UK economy, including a swipe at what he called the “one booming sector” of HR and compliance.Farage looked back to his era as a City metals trader and the lack of diversity programmes then: “When I worked here, it didn’t matter what religion you were, didn’t matter where you came from, didn’t matter what class you were, didn’t matter what colour you were … It was based on, are you good enough?” It is possible that some women, not to mention people of colour, who worked in the City at the same time might disagree.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, and is often framed as religious persecution. However, most analysts argue the situation is more complex.In parts of central Nigeria, deadly clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water but exacerbated by religious and ethnic differences. The herders often claim reprisals for the killing of their people and cattle, while local communities see the attacks as ethnic cleansing targeting their settlements.Priests and pastors have increasingly been kidnapped for ransom, as they are viewed as influential figures whose worshippers or organisations can mobilise funds quickly. Some analysts say this may be a trend driven more by criminal economics than religious discrimination.What is the wider security situation in Nigeria?In the north-east, Boko Haram and its splinter groups such as Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have waged an insurgency since 2009, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions.In the north-west,heavily armed criminal gangs – often labelled “bandits” – carry out mass kidnappings and raidsthat affect both Muslim and Christian communities. These groups have expanded operations into north-central Nigeria, exploiting weak state presence and local grievances.“Christians are being killed, we can’t deny the fact that Muslims are [also] being killed,” Danjuma Dickson Auta, a Christian and community leader from Plateau state in the Middle Belt, told Agence France-Presse.Meanwhile, in the south-east, separatists seeking to revive the defunct state of Biafra have been linked to violence against government institutions and civilians, with most victims being Christians. In all, thousands have been killed across multiple fronts, creating overlapping humanitarian and governance crises.How has Nigeria responded to its security crises?Successive Nigerian governments have struggled to contain these threats and security forces are stretched thin across multiple fronts. They are also often accused of human rights abuses that previously halted US support – most notably underthe Leahy Law, which restricts arms sales to forces accused of violations.In the absence of state police and proper intelligence collaborations at all levels of the security hierarchy, many communities remain unprotected, and vigilante groups have filled the vacuum in some states.How has Nigeria responded to Trump?In a statement on Sunday, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu did not name Trump directly but emphasised that Nigeria “is a democracy with constitutional guarantees of religious liberty”. He said characterising the country as religiously intolerant “does not reflect our national reality”.Meanwhile, his presidential spokesperson, Daniel Bwala, described Trump’s post as “a miscommunication” and expressed hope that both leaders would “iron out” their differences if they meet. He insisted that “a data-driven assessment” rather than “isolated reports and social media videos” should guide international conclusions.Bwala added that any military action “would only happen if it is a joint action with the Nigerian government”, reaffirming Nigeria’s sovereignty.Still, concerns are mounting that Trump’s remarks could affect bilateral relations, particularly aid and sales of arms, or be exploited by secessionist groups such as the Biafra Republic Government in Exile, which is already lobbying in Washington.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaDonald TrumpTrump administrationChristianityReligionAfricaUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Fresh from supporting Oasis as the self-proclaimed “only man for the job”, the former Verve singer is back with an (almost) sold-out arena tour for 2026, and some more Oasis dates in South America, not to mention a seventh solo album, Lovin’ You. We caught up with Ashcroft to chat about loving Abba, being inspired by Serge Gainsbourg and fighting Liam Gallagher.Hi, Richard! Always a pleasure to interview another Richard – who else is in the club?Madeley … Hammond … It’s dying out. I wonder if it’s because of the Dick abbreviation? Back in the day, old actors were very happy being Dickie. I went into an off licence in Chiswick and this lad went: “All right, Dickie?” I said: “Do you know what happens to people who call me Dickie?” He said: “Oh no, sorry mate.” I said: “I’m only joking. I don’t give a shit. Call me what you want.”Everything’s so fractured, we’ve almost forgotten what it’s like to come together and have a good timeHow does it feel to be selling out arenas in 2025?The seeds have been germinating. The summer Oasis gigs shone a light on them. Now, the plants have grown faster.The older fans thought: “I’ve forgotten how much I love these songs.” The younger fans are getting introduced to your Bitter Sweets viacover versionsand TikTok. My ability to communicate to the audience is reaching the zenith. Everything’s so fractured, we’ve almost forgotten what it’s like to come together and have a fucking good time. I remember seeing what looked like a proper football hooligan crying his eyes out toThe Drugs Don’t Work. These songs and moments have that power. There are so few spaces left on this planet where we can create that kind of energy.Have theOasisshows helped introduce you to new fans?My set was only 45 minutes. People thought: “I want to see this guy do his life’s work over two hours.” I’ve already built up a good following. It can be hard when you lose the Verve and just become Richard Ashcroft. It can take people time to rediscover you.What did you think ofthat viral clipof someone Shazamming Bitter Sweet Symphony at an Oasis show?I see that as a beautiful thing. That’s a brand new fan, joining the team.You came out on stage the nextweek and said:“Get your Shazams out!”Exactly. Be proud! Why should everyone know everything? They may have only heard that song before England play football on ITV. If someone doesn’t recognise a famous painting, so what? We can’t be cultural snobs. I’d love to get her on stage with her phone when I’m doing Bitter Sweet. That would be really funny.Oasis review – a shameless trip back to the 90s for Britpop’s loudest, greatest songsRead moreDo people still shout “the Bitter Sweet Symphony video’s over, mate” when they see you walking down the road?Back in the day, I’d walk around in literally the same jacket, T-shirt, corduroys and Wallabees [as in the video]. It doesn’t happen so much now, thank God. I’m supposed to get retribution outside this pub, butwe edited that outbecause it looked ridiculous.Your2018 appearance on BBC Breakfastwas legendary: fromdissing Kellogg’s Kravetocomplimenting Charlie Stayt on his hairandjumping over the sofaclaiming the studio was The Truman Show.Would you like your own chatshow?In my mind, jumping over the couch, doing the whole Truman Show thing, was a deeper analysis than people thought. Live TV just makes you – me – want to do something stupid, mess the thing up. I’d like my own chatshow, but I’d take it back to the 70s and interview Peter Sellers and Peter Cook. I want to be able to smoke, because that was the great heyday for smokers. If you look at the old chatshows, like Parkinson, there were some amazing moments …Did you get to go on a Supermarket Sweep-style, grab-all-you-can binge around John Lewis for lettingit useSonnet inits2024 Christmas advert?It’s funny you should say that. The first thing I thought was: “Do I get a Christmas run at midnight?” I just got paid and that was it. I don’t think it was loud enough. If you’re going to use a beautiful song like that, make sure people can hear it. But it was cool. I was offered PG Tips, but like nearly all adverts, I turned it down.View image in fullscreenSongs for the lovers … Ashcroft with the Verve, performing on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in 2008.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PAHang on … You mean you could have moved in with the PG Tips monkey inplace of Johnny Vegas?This was post-monkeys, when monkeys were no longer politically correct. I’ve always loved [French songwriter/actor] Serge Gainsbourg and all the eclectic, crazy cultural things he would do. He’d do a reggae album, then an advert for sausages. The way he looked at it was: “I’m going to be omnipresent from high up to the lowest of the low.” Then it all becomes pop art.Sir Paul, Sir Bob, Sir Cliff, Sir Elton, Sir Rod, Sir Brian … when can we expect Sir Richard?Years ago, I got invited to Windsor Castle to meet the queen, but it was a solo invite without my wife, and I didn’t want to go on my own. Maybe it was a vetting process? People who were knighted used to have acted in the greatest films of all time. These days, you’re like: “Fucking hell? What has he done?” There are people who give their lives to ensure society doesn’t crumble who never get recognised. Recognising people who are getting paid for their passion can be distasteful. Why should you get the cold steel on your shoulder just because you run around a track or jump over some hurdles? So, no. I firmly believe you will never hear that moment – even though Sir Richard has a great ring to it. Where are Sir Liam and Sir Noel? Who else has brought billions into the economy this summer?As an artist, I’m happy so many people put up AI things on YouTube that get zero views. People are bored alreadyLiam Gallagher reckonsyou’d have him in a fight(“He’s a lean machine,” Gallagher said).But who’s got the best hair?That’s a tough one. Other than when I go skinhead, my hair has been the same for 30 years.

He threads through gleaming shopfronts in Grand Central station and past the Bullring before slipping into the fish-scented bustle on the ground floor of Edgbaston Street car park. At Birmingham indoor market he buys a bag of cockles. “Where else would you find this quality?” he says. “There’s no place like this, it’s the heart of Birmingham.”But Frank’s weekly visits may soon come to an end. Plans to demolish the market and replace it with housing wereapprovedat the end of October.The market is part of a trading tradition dating back to 1166 and is home to a mix of stalls, from butchers and fishmongers to fabric sellers and phone shops. Once accused ofmaking the US rapper Azealia Banks ill, it remains a beloved part of Birmingham life.Birmingham city council has said the market will be demolished in 2027 and a new one will be opened away from the Bullring in “at least five years”. Traders will be relocated to a new permanent building in Smithfield, part of a £1.9bn development project by the council in conjunction with the international property group Lendlease.Greg Pearce, the owner of the 200-year-old Pearce’s Shellfish, says he is the fifth generation in his family to trade. He is not against a market makeover. “It needs renovating, we need a new market that has life in it,” he says. “We’ve got two years here at least, so we’ll just keep going.” Still, he voices frustration at the council’s communication. “They should’ve informed us more. How are we going to survive in the interim period, and how will people get to us?”View image in fullscreenGreg Pearce is the fifth generation in his family to trade.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianThe council has said any decisions on current or future traders “will be based on the situation at that time” but added that the “intention is that all existing traders will have the opportunity to relocate to the new markets”. For many traders, these words have provided little comfort.Johnny, who runs Jeff’s Fishmongers, which caters mainly to customers looking for east Asian seafood, says: “If they move it too far, a lot of customers won’t visit. People like to go to the Bullring, have a little shop and then come here to buy food.” He hopes the new market will have improved facilities, including freezers on the same floor as the stalls, to make daily operations easier.Other traders are worried about being priced out of the new market should rents rise. “They’re going to build nice, big, shiny buildings that look nice in photos. What happens to us? Are we going to be in a tent over there?” says Lorraine Wooton, pointing to the street.View image in fullscreen‘It used to be a lot more vibrant, a lot of the stalls were filled,’ says Lorraine Wooton.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianShe has worked as a hairstylist in the market for 13 years and says the change has been visible. “Birmingham has turned into a complete shithole,” she laughs. “Footfall has fallen, it used to be a lot more vibrant. A lot of the stalls were filled. There was so much more variety.”The current version of the market has existed since 2003, when the old 1960s shopping centre and earlier market buildings were demolished to make way for the Bullring complex. Still, the approval of plans to knock it down for housing cuts a deep wound for some Brummies who believe it undercuts the city’s rich market trading history.Prof Carl Chinn, a social historian, says the market has cultural significance. “Without the markets there would never have been a Birmingham,” he says. “Brummies feel very strongly that the markets are where people from all backgrounds come together. We’re losing who we are, our heart and soul. This is part of the ongoing gentrification of the city centre.”View image in fullscreenThe market is located on the ground floor of Edgbaston Street car park.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianThe market site will be turned into either 745 flats, 1,544 student bedrooms or a combination of the two. The council said all existing traders would have the opportunity to be moved to temporary market facilities while the new building, which will be located in between St Martin’s Church and the new Manor Square, is constructed.But traders and shoppers remain anxious. For many, the market is more than a place to buy fish or fabric, it is a community hub, a place where history, culture and daily life intersect. Marcia Philbin, who grew up visiting the market every Saturday with her parents, sums it up: “It was an occasion, something you don’t have nowadays. Who is the new market actually going to cater to?”A spokesperson for Hammerson, the property company that owns the site, said: “The plans have consistently been backed by the city’s planners and it builds on Hammerson’s ongoing investment and commitment to Birmingham. The plans are also for additional commercial space, investment into the green spaces and public realm, and a contribution to affordable housing agreed with Birmingham city council.”A spokesperson for Lendlease said: “Markets are the beating heart of Birmingham and we’re committed to ensuring that the new development at Smithfield will honour that legacy. Our plans will deliver modern and inclusive markets that reflect the city’s diversity, support existing traders and remain a welcoming space for all communities.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamRetail industryWest MidlandsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

According to a recent survey of 10,000 teachers, over half reported hearing the word “candy” instead of sweets, and “trash” and “garbage” for rubbish.This is an outrage!Some teachers even claimed to have heard the word “diaper” instead of nappy.Neither of those is a word you want to hear in a primary school setting.Also “apartment” rather than flat, and “closet” for cupboard. Some parents even report their children speaking in American accents.Where are the young peoplegetting this stuff?From American YouTube cartoons, US social media stars, Netflix and even children’s programming on the BBC.Can’t the UK slap tariffs on these shows, before the children start talking ‘trash’?We could, but children’s speech habits are famously difficult to measure because they change so quickly. While 65% of British primary teachers reported hearing “candy” in the classroom, only 26% of secondary teachers did – which suggests that either the Americanisms wear off, or that it’s getting worse with each generation.Either way, the UKmust do something to stop this one-way language invasion.But it’s not one-way. Americans are also resorting to Britishisms more often.They are?Use of British words and phrases – including “gobsmacked” and “knickers in a twist” – has been steadily increasing in the US. They’ve also picked up on “ginger” for red-haired, and “cuppa” for tea.I’ll admit I didn’t see that coming.Now there are even signs in the US that say“lift” instead of “elevator”. Wider access to global media means that, if anything, the two languages are cross-pollinating.I can’t work out whether to becross about this any more.It’s complicated. When a word imported from another culture addresses a specific need, it might be deemed worthy of adoption. But often it’s just an example of trendy affectation.Can you give me an example?For Americans a word such as “twee” fills a gap; they have no exact equivalent. But other Britishisms can seem a bit, um, twee.Do say:“The more words we have for something, the richer our language becomes.”Don’t say:“It’s just cross-pollination, don’t get your panties in a tangle!”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesLinguisticsShareReuse this content"

Best known as the inventor of auto-destructive art – a response, he said, to the destructive horrors of the Holocaust – Metzger had also, over the course of a long career, been an inspirational teacher to Pete Townshend of the Who and campaigned for numerous causes including nuclear disarmament and vegetarianism. Now, on a video message barely three minutes long, he was making one final plea.“I, Gustav Metzger, am asking for your participation in this worldwide call for a day of action to remember nature on November 4th, 2015,” he began, appealing to creatives to take a stand against the ongoing erasure of species. “Our task is to remind people of the richness and complexity in nature … and by doing so art will enter territories that are inherently creative.”And soRemember Naturewas born, a day in which artists across the country created responses to our unfolding climate catastrophe (the 89-year-old Metzger spent the day with students at Central Saint Martins in London who had been cutting out climate crisis stories from old issues of the Guardian).“There was a great sense of urgency for him at the end of his life,” says Jo Joelson, one of the original curators of Remember Nature, as well as being a neighbour and carer for Metzger in his final years. “I just said to him – let’s not mess around. Let’s not wait for funding or for anyone to green light this. Let’s just do it.”View image in fullscreen‘He had a great sense of urgency’ … Gustav Metzger with students from Central Saint Martins in 2015.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Serpentine GalleriesA decade on, Remember Nature might not have incited the mass movement across the arts that Metzger had wished for, but Joelson believes its ripples can still be felt in movements such asCulture DeclaresandExtinction Rebellion, as well as in the way artists approach the sustainability of their practices. That’s why she’s restaging it to mark its 10-year anniversary. Among the 18 lead artists involved this time areCornelia Parker,Yu-Chen Wang,A Man Called AdamandAnya Gallaccio. They have all designed posters, recorded their own Remember Nature calls to action and created artworks set to be unveiled on 4 November 2025.When I speak to Gallaccio she’s out in a field in Kent, helping plant apple trees that will grow to form a spiral-shaped orchard. Working with schoolchildren, her project is half artwork (the espalier trees will, in the future, look as if they’re holding hands with each other) and half educational workshop. As she tells me, the planning and planting sessions have already involved learning about maths (measuring out the spaces between trees), science (they discussed the apple’s DNA) and geography (tracing the stories of how different apples arrived in Britain).A lot of the apples were chosen because they’ve got funny names such as the Bloody Butcher or the Duck’s Bill. We have one apple that ‘bleeds’ red juice“A lot of the apples were chosen because they’ve got funny names such as the Bloody Butcher or the Duck’s Bill,” says Gallaccio. “We have one apple that ‘bleeds’ red juice. They all have stories behind them. The decio apple was introduced by the Romans. The Flower of Kent is the apple that fell from a tree and landed on Isaac Newton’s head.”Gallaccio wanted the children to be more actively aware of nature and the control we have over it. “For a lot of them, apples were just things you find in a supermarket, so I was encouraging them, next time they were out with whoever does the shopping, to look on the bag and see what they’re called and where they were grown. Hopefully it says Kent!”Next year Gallaccio intends for the children to return to the orchard to harvest and taste the different apples – and hopefully form a connection with the trees that endures over the 20-year period the field has been reserved for. She also sees the orchard as a “very good visual marker of climate change and global warming” in that there is evidence already that our warmer seasons are making trees confused about what time of year it actually is. “It will be interesting to see what that means in terms of how the trees adapt and when they fruit or don’t fruit.”View image in fullscreenSinging plants back to health … Some Kind of Love/Forest Choir by Uta Kögelsberger.Photograph: Courtesy the artistThe planting was filmed and a stream will be available to watch on 4 November, but of course Gallaccio’s project is just one of many. In London,Youngsook Choi’s Book of Losswill involve participants searching Tate Modern on a quest to find the seven major glaciers that have been lost in recent years. Each glacier will be drawn on the gallery’s windows and walls using ultraviolet markers. Whenever one is found, a bell will ring and a reading will be performed to commemorate that particular glacier.Meanwhile, up in Barrow-in-Furness,Maddi Nicholsonwill be putting on a free exhibition about our disconnection from the land, as well as hosting a communal feast, prepared with organic, local produce. Over in Newcastle,Uta Kögelsbergeris streaming her Some Kind of Love / Forest Choir, in which local singers embark on a mission to sing plants back to health in Newcastle’s Jesmond Dene.Like Gallaccio, Cornelia Parker will be working with schoolchildren – on the day itself she is aiming to cover Cambridge’s Kettle’s Yard in kids’ letters and drawings that document their hopes and fears for the future. “Children’s words and images are powerful because they’re not as trammelled as adults,” she says in her call to action video. “What children have to offer to the world is something quite unique and hopefully it will provoke a sense of responsibility from us all. Children are innocent. They have fears about the future. But this shouldn’t be about fear – it should be about hope and us ensuring that they get a future.”Paul Harfleet’s work also appeals to children. As a former drag queen, his Birds Can Fly project involves drawing birds and then dressing up as them – and for Remember Nature day he is planning to tackle Liverpool’s famous Liver bird. He is also staging a walking tour of the city, visiting various sites that have been part of hisPansy Projectover the last two decades. That ongoing series began when he was living in Manchester and endured three incidents of homophobic abuse on a single day. In response, Harfleet decided to plant a pansy at the site of each occurrence and photograph it – the project has since spiralled to include incidents experienced by other people across the world. “I leave the pansies there but they don’t often last very long,” says Harfleet. “Apparently pigeons like to eat them, so they’re a very temporary memorial.”View image in fullscreenTemporary memorial … Paul Harfleet’s Pansy Project.Photograph: Wen-Chi-Su 2014Harfleet chose the pansy not just for the obvious reason – it has long been a term of homophobic abuse – but also because its name derives from the French verb,penser, to think. “It became associated with a man who is thoughtful, and that, of course, is a terrible thing,” he says.The plan on 4 November is to plant pansies at new locations and also replant flowers in places he has previously memorialised, all the while talking to those on the walking tour about the incidents and his memories of them. “There’s been quite a few since I last planted,” he says sadly.Harfleet hopes his work – and that of other artists participating – will create conversations and spark debate, just like Metzger’s work. “I found it really moving the way he remained optimistic, even in old age,” he says.Joelson also cherishes Metzger’s positive nature, and says that’s what guided her to restage Remember Nature in the first place. “We wanted to offer something compelling and empowering rather than doomy and gloomy, which we’re bombarded with all the time,” she says. “We can’t live our lives in darkness, so let’s use his mantra instead: go forwards, with hope!”Remember Nature 2025 takes place on 4 November at 16 arts institutions across BritainExplore more on these topicsArt and designEnvironmental activismProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He may have lived in California for decades but some Welshness remains, in his distinctive, mellifluous voice – perhaps a little hoarser than it once was – and his preoccupation with the climate. It’s a dark evening in London but a bright, sunny morning in Los Angeles, and Hopkins is equally bright in demeanour and attire, sporting a turquoise and green shirt. “I came here 50 years ago. Somebody said: ‘Are you selling out?’ I said: ‘No, I just like the climate and to get a suntan.’ But I like Los Angeles. I’ve had a great life here.”It hasn’t been all that great recently, actually. In January this year, Hopkins’ house inPacific Palisadeswas destroyed by the wildfires. “It was a bit of a calamity,” he says, with almost cheerful understatement. “We’re thankful that no one was hurt, and we got our cats and our little family into the clear.” He wasn’t there at the time; he and his wife, Stella, were in Saudi Arabia, where he was hosting a concert of his own music played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. They’re now in a rented house in the nearby neighbourhood of Brentwood. “We lost everything, but you think: ‘Oh well, at least we are alive.’ I feel sorry for the thousands of people who have been really affected. People who were way past retirement age, and had worked hard over the years and now … nothing.”Hopkins will be 88 this December, but clearly doesn’t consider himself past retirement age. As a two-time Oscar-winner, a knight of the realm, a fixture of pop culture and one of the most revered actors alive, he has an embarrassment of laurels to rest on, but there’s still plenty on his schedule. He’s just finished a movie with Guy Ritchie, for whom he has a newfound admiration – “He’s precise in what he wants to see” – and he’s coming back to Britain soon, he says, to make a new movie with Richard Eyre (The Housekeeper, about Daphne du Maurier), then another one inWales.Nor is he too old to move with the times. On a recent Instagram video, he put on one of Kim Kardashian’s much-ridiculed Skims face wraps and channelled Hannibal Lecter. “Hello, Kim. I’m already feeling 10 years younger,” he announces to the camera, followed by Lecter’s trademark sinister lisping-slurping action. “Fun, wasn’t it?” he says, laughing. Kardashian told him she thought it was hilarious, he says.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueBut recently Hopkins has also been looking back, too – at his whole life. His new memoir, We Did OK, Kid, is far from your stereotypical luvvie memoir, partly because Hopkins is far from your typical luvvie – even if he does cross paths with past greats such as Laurence Olivier, Peter O’Toole,Katharine Hepburnand Richard Burton – but mainly because he’s surprisingly upfront about his often troubled early life. When he describes his childhood in the Welsh town of Port Talbot, the only son of a family of bakers, it feels like a different planet. “My father had that attitude: stop whining, stop complaining, you don’t know what you’re talking about, stand up straight, get on with it!” His father was also prone to depression and anxiety, Hopkins says. It was wartime and postwar Britain; life was just like that.By his own account, the young Hopkins comes across as a bit of a loner and an oddball. He had few friends, was frequently bullied and wouldn’t even go to his own birthday parties. He showed so little promise at school, one teacher told him he was “a brainless carthorse”. “I was living in my imagination, my dream world, I suppose,” he says. “I couldn’t understand anything intellectually or academically and that drove me into a kind of loneliness and resentment.” He retreated behind a mask of insolence, “a tough stance and a cold remoteness”, and that became his identity. Perhaps, in a way, he was already acting?View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes on The Silence of the Lambs.Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock“Yes, yes, I think I was,” he says. “The only way I could protect myself was, if I got a slap across the head from a school teacher, I’d stare them out and I’d defy them. I wouldn’t react at all.” You can almost picture a young Hannibal Lecter doing the same.His despairing parents had all but written him off, but he told them: “One day, I’ll show you,” he says. “I discovered that I had one small gift: I could remember things.” He was an avid reader, and easily retained facts, figures, whole poems and speeches from plays.An early epiphany in terms of acting was seeing Olivier’s film adaptation of Hamlet at school in 1949, when he was 12. “I was shocked by my reaction,” he says. “I don’t know what it was about that, but it made such a punch in my head, hearing Shakespeare for the first time.” He started memorising speeches from Hamlet and Julius Caesar. His parents were amazed. (Decades later, his father, on his deathbed, asked Hopkins to recite Hamlet for him.)Hopkins even goes as far as wondering if he has Asperger’s or some other form of autism. As well as his memory, he details behaviour such as repeating words obsessively and a “lack of emotionality”. He has never sought a professional assessment. “My wife, Stella, she diagnosed me. She said: ‘Well, you’re obsessive. Everything has to be laid out perfectly.’ I have to have everything arranged. So that’s a little twist in the brain, I suppose. But I’m quite happy with whatever inner disturbance I have.”Hopkins’ memory is the foundation of his acting, he says. He reads his scripts 100 or 200 times, so every line is etched into his memory before he turns up on set. It started as a protection mechanism when he was a young actor, but it’s become his technique. “That was my gift, really: to know the part so well that I had no fear. Once you know the script, you have a relaxation to go on stage in rehearsal, so you can hear the other person. The art of acting, I think, is to be able to listen.”View image in fullscreenHopkins as Odin alongside Chris Hemsworth as Thor in Thor: The Dark World.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIn 1964, 15 years after being transfixed by Olivier’s Hamlet, Hopkins found himself auditioning in front of the man himself to join London’s NationalTheatre(cheekily, he did Othello, a role Olivier had recently made his own, albeit in blackface). He considers Olivier his mentor. “He gave me this huge break in my life. He seemed to admire my physical strength, because I had that in me, and I had this sense of Welsh danger, you know, quick-tempered.” He didn’t really get along with the English middle-class chumminess of the British theatre-world, though – the “kissy-smoochy-darling stuff”, as he puts it. “I’ve never felt comfortable with that.”One area where he did find common ground – far too much of it – was alcohol. “Drinking was a family tradition,” he says. It was a theatre tradition, too. This was the era of “angry young men” epitomised by John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger (Hopkins had been riveted seeing Peter O’Toole’s version in 1957), and of legendary, hard-drinking “hell-raisers” like O’Toole, Oliver Reed,Richard Burtonand Richard Harris. Did he fit that description?“Yes, yes, I did. I would not be trusted, and I would have fights and quarrel with, especially, directors. Looking back, it’s all paranoia. They were trying to do their job; I was trying to do mine, but I couldn’t take any … it wasn’t criticism, I couldn’t take any authoritative bullying. So I’d lash out.” He would often get into physical fights in pubs, too.The week before Hopkins’ first marriage, to fellow actor Petronella Barker in 1966, he impulsively quit the National because of one such director, declaring he was giving up acting. He recalls his colleagues getting sloshed at the wedding reception then heading off to perform in the afternoon matinee. He used to do the same. “Oh yeah, it was terrible. You used to be on stage and not know where you were or why you were there, adding 10 minutes to the play.”It was just the done thing, he says. “Yeah, we are rebels. We can fight. Who cares about the establishment? When you’re growing up, it’s healthy to want to punch out and be rebellious and survive. And it was a bit of fun, I thought. But I remember thinking one day: ‘Yeah, and it’s going to kill you as well.’”View image in fullscreenAs Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs.Photograph: Orion Pictures/AllstarIt certainly took many of his contemporaries. By the mid-70s, even as his career was going places, Hopkins’ drinking and heavy smoking were taking a toll on his health – and his relationships. In 1969, after two years of marriage marked by rows, depression and a lot of whisky, he walked out on Barker and their one-year-old daughter, Abigail. He describes it as “the saddest fact of my life, and my greatest regret, and yet I feel absolutely sure that it would have been much worse for everyone if I’d stayed”. He and Barker divorced in 1972.The real wake-up call came in December 1975, in LA. He woke up one morning to find his car missing, and called his agent to tell him. “Nobody stole it,” his agent replied. “We found you on the road.” Hopkins had driven all night from Arizona to Beverly Hills, about 500 miles, blackout drunk. “I was insane, I was nuts, I couldn’t remember half the journey,” he says. “And that’s a deadly way to live, because I didn’t care about myself. I could have taken out an entire family … I knew I needed help, I knew it was over.”The way he narrates it, a literal voice in his head asked him if he wanted to live or die. He replied: “‘I want to live,’ and the voice said, ‘It’s all over now. You can start living.’” He went straight to Alcoholics Anonymous. Afterwards, “I got out on the street, 11am, 29 December 1975, and everything looked different. Everything seemed sunnier, everything seemed more …benign. No threat in the air.”He doesn’t go as far as to claim it was God that spoke to him, but it was “a moment of clarity”, he says, “from deep inside here [he points to his head] or here [he points to his heart].” He has never craved a drink since. “We all have that power within us, and we choose our lives and navigate through that kind of … inspiration, I suppose it is.”By this stage Hopkins was living and working more and more in the US, and in cinema. “I just wanted some sunshine, and I didn’t want to be standing around in wrinkled tights holding a spear for the rest of my life,” he jokes. It was his hero O’Toole who had first coaxed him on to a movie set, in 1968. He knocked on Hopkins’ dressing room door at the National one day and said, “I want you to do a test for me,” Hopkins says. “He’d had a few jars, and we went to the pub afterwards.”View image in fullscreenHopkins in The Lion in Winter.Laurence Olivier gave me this huge break in my life.

It’s beyond my comprehension. And I mean this deeplyThe screen test was for the historical drama The Lion in Winter, starring O’Toole and Katharine Hepburn. As Richard the Lionheart, Hopkins looked and felt at home on screen. “I think that anger in me, or whatever it was, it gave me a strong presence. And I was cunning. I could listen to advice. Hepburn said to me: ‘You don’t actually need to act. You’ve got a good head, you’ve got good shoulders. Just speak the lines.’”By the 1980s he was building a solid, steady career as a character actor – all of which went out of the window, or at least up to a higher floor, with The Silence of the Lambs in 1991. Director Jonathan Demme had seen Hopkins in David Lynch’s The Elephant Man, playing a kindly Victorian doctor, and somehow thought he’d be perfect for the part of Hannibal Lecter – the psychiatrist turned cannibal serial killer. When his agent told him the title, Hopkins asked: “Is it a children’s film?”Hearing him talk about his most famous role, it’s clear how much Hopkins brought to the part himself. He instinctively knew how to play Lecter, he says – not as a monster but as the opposite: serene, precise, unblinking, “at once remote and awake”. Elements that went into the character, he’s said, included Hal from Kubrick’s 2001, Bela Lugosi’s Dracula, Katharine Hepburn and his old drama teacher at Rada, plus a soupçon of camp. The result was a character like no other; a new horror archetype, even.View image in fullscreenHopkins, aged 5, in 1943.Photograph: Courtesy Anthony Hopkins“I went to Pittsburgh for the initial wardrobe-fitting,” he says. “They wanted me to be in an orange jumpsuit. I said: ‘No, I want a slimline green suit. Lecter can employ anyone to make it, because he’s so smart, and he’ll kill if you don’t obey his orders.’” He thought hard about his first scene with Jodie Foster, when she visits his prison cell to ask for his help. “I remember Jonathan Demme saying: ‘How do you want to be discovered when Jodie first sees you? Would you be lying down or reading a book?’ I said: ‘No, standing.’ He said: ‘OK. Why?’ I said: ‘I can smell her coming down the corridor.’ He said: ‘You’re weird.’”Foster was also weirded out by him. She later admitted she avoided him as much as she could on set. On the last day of the shoot they had lunch together. Foster told him she was scared of him. “I was scared of you, too!” he replied.Such was the cultural reach of The Silence of the Lambs that on Oscars night 1992, host Billy Crystal was wheeled on to the stage strapped to a gurney in a Lecter mask. Hopkins still didn’t believe he’d win best actor (the movie won five Oscars that night, including his award). In his mid-50s, he was suddenly in the A-league and in demand, with some of his best (and certainly his most lucrative) work ahead of him. He seems to have thrown himself into it – big-budget epics, broad action thrillers, horror sequels (he played Lecter twice more) and period dramas, plus the occasional paycheck role (Transformers: The Last Knight, say).He has played a whole gallery of great men: Richard Nixon, Alfred Hitchcock, Pope Benedict, Sigmund Freud, Charles Dickens, Pablo Picasso, King Herod, King Lear, Methuselah, not to mention the Norse god Odin in Marvel’s Thor movies.But he is perhaps at his best playing the less-great ones. His outstanding turn as a repressed butler in Merchant Ivory’s The Remains of the Day, for example, who is tragically incapable of connecting with those around him, especially the housekeeper played by Emma Thompson. It’s another meticulously controlled character in the Lecter vein, which surely says something about the British class system. “James Ivory is one of those special directors,” says Hopkins, “because he lets you figure it out. He doesn’t direct but he’s got an artist’s eye. He knows about design. Everything was so perfectly arranged, you didn’t have to act.”It was as another relative nobody that Hopkins won his second Oscar in 2021, as an old man untethered from reality by dementia, in Florian Zeller’s The Father. The awards ceremony was one of the most awkward in history. As well as being delayed and curtailed by the Covid pandemic, the event was overshadowed by the recent death of Chadwick Boseman, who it was assumed was such a shoo-in for best actor that this was made the final award of the night rather than the traditional best picture. To everyone’s surprise, the Oscar went to Hopkins instead.View image in fullscreenAs Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone’s Nixon.Photograph: AlamyHopkins wasn’t there to pick up the award. He wasn’t even watching. “I was asleep!” he says. “I certainly did not expect it. God, where was I? I was in England, yes.” He was about to start shooting a film the next morning. “And so I didn’t show up and went to bed. Four o’clock in the morning, my agent’s voice: ‘You got the Oscar!’ I said: ‘What?’ It was a wonderful surprise, but the film itself was one of the easiest. I thought: ‘Well, I don’t have to act old. Iamold.’”Despite having been a Hollywood fixture for so long, and a latter-day Instagram star, Hopkins is not at all interested in celebrity. “I’ve never been one for the glamour side, the red carpet. I go along if I have to do one of those premiere things, and they’re pleasant and friendly and they’re OK, but I’d rather be at home playing the piano or reading a book,” he says. “It’s a necessary part of my professional life, to do publicity, but I don’t crave it.” His social circle is small: a few close friends, and his third wife and her family. He met Stella Arroyave in 2000, when she was running an antiques shop in Pacific Palisades, and they married in 2003. “She broke me wide open, helped me overcome the old feelings of regret and anxiety in a way that’s set me free,” he writes of her in his book.Even talking now, about his life, there’s the distinct impression that this is not Hopkins’ comfort zone. He is cordial but guarded, happier to offer an anecdote than an opinion. There are areas of his life he’s not keen to discuss: his daughter, for example, from whom he remains estranged. (He doesn’t dwell on it. “If you want to waste your life being in resentment … fine, go ahead. That’s not in my camp,” he said in a recent interview.) There’s also a line in his memoir about his second marriage, of nearly 30 years, to Jennifer Lynton, where he says: “It was only years later that she knew about my infidelities,” but he does not expand any further on that. He first met Lynton in 1969 when she was a production assistant – she picked him up from Heathrow after he’d missed a flight because of his drinking – and they married in 1973. She saw him through the worst of his alcoholism, he says, but she always preferred London to LA, and they drifted apart. “She deserved better than me,” he writes, regretfully.He is also reluctant to comment directly on politics or current affairs (he became an American citizen in 2000), although he sometimes does so obliquely, through the prism of one of his roles. When I ask about his repeated mentions in the book to having “a monster inside me”, for example, he references Nicholas Winton, the real-life hero he portrayed in 2023’s One Life, who rescued more than 600 children from the Nazis in eastern Europe and brought them to Britain.View image in fullscreenWith Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy“His only belief was, we must learn to be flexible, learn to be reasonable, learn to listen to the other guy, even if you don’t agree,” says Hopkins. “And stop being certain. Once you have certainty, no one can get into you. That’s deadly. That causes horrific problems in the world, once you think you’ve got the answer and nobody else. We’re living in it today: you’re wrong, I’m right; if you differ from me, I’ll have you killed or I’ll have you cancelled or unfollowed. I mean, what are we talking about? It’s rubbish. Changing the language to suit our own preconceived bigotry because somebody doesn’t agree with us, politically or philosophically or racially. What are we doing? We’re human beings, fragile animals.”There is nothing studied or strategic about Hopkins’ reticence, though. That’s just the way he is, and doubtless always has been. When he mentions the photograph of himself, aged four, on the back cover of his book, he says: “I still feel like that young kid.” At that age he was “too young to comprehend any meaning in existence”, he writes. So, as he approaches his 10th decade, has Hopkins come to any conclusions?“No. I know nothing,” he says, laughing. “I don’t think we know anything. I look around and I think: ‘How did I get this far?’ I have no idea how my particular life has moved from when I was in Port Talbot, a little boy lost, to here. It’s beyond my comprehension. And I mean this deeply.”He does, however, invoke that desire he had within him from a young age: to succeed, to show his parents and the world that he wasn’t “a complete dummy”. “I try to tell this to younger people, if they want to listen to me: really begin to believe that you have a power inside. You can do almost anything. Just tap into that trigger moment that will push you forward. Never give in. If you fall down, get up again. Don’t feel sorry for stuff, never be a victim and just get on with it. It’s a tough philosophy, but I think some of my younger friends have taken that advice.”Does he still have that desire to show the world?“Yes, I go on working,” he says. “They offer me work, and I do it and I enjoy it. I go over my script over and over and over, so that by the time I get there, I know it all, and that inspires confidence in people around you. You better show up and know your stuff, because otherwise you get left behind. I suppose the message is, live life as if this is your last day.”That’s exactly what he’s doing. “Now, at my age, I’ve accepted everything. I have no guarantees. I wake up in the morning, I say: ‘I’m still here. I’m strong, I’m fit, and a lot of my friends have gone.’ I look at my life and I think: Oh God, I’m so – and I mean this, really – I’m so lucky. I was gonna use the expletive, but I won’t.”It’s the Guardian, I say, you’re allowed to swear.“Fucking lucky!” he says.We Did OK, Kid by Anthony Hopkins is out now.

Here in my favourite north London cafe, among the bare lightbulbs and the £3.80 cinnamon buns, I take shelter from the screaming terrors of Sadiq Khan’s no-go hellscape. Toddlers in pushchairs scream for salvation. A Lime bike comes dangerously close to running a red light. Like the Roman, I see the Blackstock Road foaming with much blood, albeit from this distance it may actually be a discarded pastrami sandwich.“Welcome to London, don’t forget your stab vest,” reads a proposed tube billboard for a brand of vodka being promoted by the comedian Ricky Gervais. Gervais is furious that Transport for London has rejected his advertising slogan, and rightly so, because this is the sort of generational wit that deserves the widest possible audience. It is, of course, the most minor of inconveniences that the design was never actually submitted to TfL and only ever existed for the benefit of social media. Because when it comes to the nation’s metropole, you can say pretty much whatever you want and someone, somewhere will believe it.I have spent close to two decades travelling up and down the country covering football, and one of the most striking insights has been how openly disparaging people from outside London can be about it. London is perhaps the only place inEnglandwhere you can tell people where you’re from, and instantly they feel empowered to inform you what a terrible place it is. Occasionally, your interlocutor will deploy the pre-emptive qualifying phrase “it’s a great city, but …”, before launching into a tirade about the traffic, or the cost of West End theatre tickets, or a dog turd their aunt once stepped in 1998.Allied to this is the misguided idea that to be fromLondonis to partake of some sort of category privilege, a place where life is effortlessly gilded and indulged. I met a Newcastle fan who assured me that there were three motorways connecting the capital with Brighton. I have met multiple people labouring under the impression (“no, seriously, look it up”) that London buses are free. Here in Sadiq Khan’s no-go hellscape, everything is too expensive and yet everything is endlessly subsidised: a kind of practical joke at the expense of everyone else.And of course London condescension is a phenomenon as old as London itself. But in the social media age, where those with big platforms have long been able to create their own reality as they go along, this kind of myth-making has real-world consequences. It is whypollsters consistently findpeople saying London gets more than its fair share of public spending. It is why working-class Londoners, mostly clustered in safe Labour seats, are perhaps the most politically disenfranchised group of voters in Britain. And it is why Khan, one of the country’s mildest and most inoffensive politicians, is forced to travel with a similar level of 24-hour securityto the king.Witness the sheer desperation among rightwing agitators and certain parts of the media to fold Saturday’s horrific train attack in Cambridgeshire into a wider narrative. “Multiple stabbings on train north of London,” read a headline in the Financial Times (that was later changed). “I’ve had enough, Sadiq Khan and Keir Starmer,”fumes a presenteron TalkTV in response to an incident that took place closer to Lincolnshire than London.In this respect, London seems to be part of a broader urban obsession among the global right, one in which the city itself is recast as a malign, seditious entity, a cesspit of violence and vice. The Trump administration’s deployment of federal forces in Democratic-run cities has been billed as a war against “invasion from within”. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has made theStadtbild(cityscape) a major plank of hisstrategy of mass deportations, an intentionally vague phrase designed to evoke fear of immigrants without referencing them directly.And of course to the rightwing demagogue, the demonisation of the city is often little more than a convenient vehicle for airing baser, more impolite grievances. When Nigel Farage referred to London, Birmingham and Manchester in 2022 as “minority-white cities” –wrongly, as it turned out– he was simply saying out loud the part that the right has long been content to leave as subtext. Anti-urbanism has long been a first cousin of white supremacy, each feeding into the other, the idea that there is an “authentic” homeland – the bits outside the city – of which the city itself is a kind of betrayal.This is not an argument that can really be won with facts and figures. It makes no odds to point out that, according to the Office for National Statistics, knife crime in Londonrose by only 1%in the last year, compared with 19% in Dorset, 31% in North Yorkshire and 51% in Suffolk. Or that violent crime in Washington DC was at a30-year-lowwhen Trump chose to unleash the national guard, or that there is only one motorway to Brighton. What the anti-urbanites find distasteful about cities – often while living in those very same cities – is so rarely a genuine concern for economic inequality or law and order.Rather, it helps to see rightwing populism as an attempt to process an increasingly complex world in increasingly simple terms. Cities, by contrast, are messy places: places of fluidity and freedom and possibility, places of chaos and collaboration and conflict. And sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t, but we embrace them nonetheless because in their forced intimacy, in their inexorable flow of ideas and influences and cuisines, they are the fullest expression of what it is to be human.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no way to appease them – they just want to find any way they can to denounce migrantsMon 3 Nov 2025 13.24 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 19.17 ESTShareAthousand years ago, in 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales was killed in a car accident – you may have heard about this – and the country went absolutely crackers. It was pretty spooky to watch, as people filed towards London’s Kensington Palace, her former residence, weeping and hugging, but it also seemed like maybe it was a good thing. Pent-up grief about who knows what other losses was expressing itself collectively, the upper lip for which the nation was fabled had unstiffened, it was conceivable, just about, that we’d emerge a more cohesive society.And then – this is a deep dive – two Slovakians stole 11 soft toys that had been left among the flowers outside Westminster Abbey, and they each got a month-long prison sentence, though this was later reduced on appeal to a fine of £200. The original sentencing judge said he had a duty to “reflect the public sense of outrage”, which set off every tripwire: mate, no, you do not have to reflect the public sense of outrage. The public has gone wild and you are a judge.This case came rushing back to me on Saturday, when the horrific stabbings on the train from Doncaster to London started to be reported. Nothing was clear, nothing made sense: at that point, there were thought to be two assailants, and so it was reasonable to wonder what their relationship was, and whether the motive was terrorism. By the end of Sunday, it transpired that the older man had nothing to do with the attack, and they were charging just one 32-year-old suspect.The release of both men’s nationality (British), their skin colour and their heritage, was not reasonable, though. It was incredibly jarring to hear news reporters intone that one was Black and the other was of Caribbean descent, even before we knew that the second guy had nothing to do with it. Since when did we describe suspects by their citizenship status? Since when did we distinguish one British citizen from another by their skin colour? Since when has that been the country we are?People immediately justified theBritish Transport Police statement, on the grounds that where information was lacking, disinformation rushed in to fill the vacuum. Look at Southport, where apparently the riots could have been averted if people hadn’t “got the sense that something was being withheld or fudged”, in the words of Jonathan Hall KC, the UK’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.But disinformation and insinuation rush in anyway. Matt Goodwin, the GB news presenter who has ahistory of expressing anti-immigrant sentiments, said on X that this was the result of “mass uncontrolled immigration”. Grok, Elon Musk’s handy far-right AI chatbot, was immediately spreading Islamophobic falsehoods (I’m not going to provide a link but just trust me). Reform’s Zia Yusuf threw in a random parallel to a knife attack committed by an asylum seeker while talking to Laura Kuenssberg.There is now a segment of British society that will use any violent crime as a stick to beat migrants with. It doesn’t matter whether an alleged suspect could be said to represent all immigrants or, indeed, whether they were an immigrant at all, some grifter will jump on a horrific scene, while it’s still fresh enough that society’s panic-brain is engaged, saying “mass uncontrolled immigration”. No information can be released fast enough for these people, because they’re not looking for the truth. No amount of transparency will appease them. “British born” means nothing to them. They’re always racing to a new low, blaming faith when nationality doesn’t support their generalisations, and race when religion doesn’t. Whatever the sea wall is between the anti-migrant faction and the rest of civilisation, you can’t expect it to be the British Transport Police, especially given the College of Policingreleased new interim guidancein August, advising that forces release the ethnicity or nationality of suspects where there was a risk of “misinformation or disinformation leading to community tension.”What wecanexpect from the authorities, though, is that they don’t roll over to demands just because they are stridently made.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But if he makes it to No 10, Labour will be to blameMon 3 Nov 2025 13.43 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 14.34 ESTShareIf you screw up your eyes and look four years into the future, can you imagine a Prime Minister Farage standing victorious on that No 10 doorstep? I’m afraid the answer is yes – just about. I can see that ghastly grin. If everything that can go wrong does go wrong, then it’s not inconceivable, and everyone had better believe it.The showman had on his serious face to talk about the economy in today’s speech. He had some pretty heavy lifting to do, heaving out impossible promises made only a short time ago. Gone washis £90bn tax cut bonanza. Public spending will be slashed instead: Reform has already put 100,000 civil servants “on notice”. Farage the chameleon now says his is both “the party of workers” and one that is “pro-business”. Reform had also briefly posed as the party of poor children with asuggestionthat it would end the two-child benefit cap, but Farage rapidly cut back eligibility: now it’s only for couples, only when both work, and onlyfor British nationals. He also promised spending cuts andbig cuts to the benefits bill.His mercurial shapeshifting comes under a little more scrutiny now he tops the polls, but not much. His will be the greatest party of “risk-takers”,plunging the country into cryptolike Donald Trump. (Might he, too, launchhis own token?) With undisguised glee he predicts an economic collapse in 2027, forcing an election to sweep him to power. He mentions “a self-induced act of financial stupidity”. At last! Among all his backflips and reversions, is this the confession we deserve from the man who instigated the great Brexit calamity? No, of course not. He is talking about the non-dom tax he would remove to lure back wealthy expats, including some of the quarter of a million Britons now in Dubai.On Brexit, since the popular mood has turned against it, all we get is a grumble that others have “squandered” the opportunity it provided to reduce regulation. Expect nothing on the thousands of extra civil servantshired to replicate tasks done in Brussels. Nothing either on£80bn in tax revenues lost annuallydue to Brexit, a costly price for “sovereignty”. How absurdly he poses as the friend of Brexit-stricken business. Labour has, at last, taken off itsself-imposed gag about Brexit. It needs to hammer home the damage this man did to the economy.The only reason we listen to Farage, and the only reason he tops the polls, is his prowess in pumpinganimosity towards immigrantsto the top of the political agenda. This one-man band has only his xenophobic dog whistle to signal his party’s course into government, the same one sweeping the right in across the democratic world. Without that, who would care about his views on anything else? He has pledged “net zero migration”. In a deeply angry country, other sources of discontent may well fill his sails, but however hard he tried to promote other policies today, immigration is his only proven winner. As he takes up the mantle of the next popular issue, he buries his own perverse political predilections: his choice of Putin as hismost admired leader, his fondness for Trump, and his frequent calls to replace the NHS with private health insurance. Despite all this, his only calling card with voters is a toxic loathing for foreigners.He may have reached his peak. The political scientist John Curtice tells me that having scooped up older, socially conservative voters, Farage is less popular among the young, especially female voters, who are “almost all socially liberal on diversity, graduates and non-graduates alike”. Nor will Reform’s record in its 10 county councils back up Farage’s national promises of vast efficiency.Farage answered every question after his speech, except one. The Guardian asked if he still adheres to his lifelong support for proportional representation. Silence. It’s become clear recently he has changed his mind, now that our wildly distorting first-past-the-post (FPTP) system is his only path to power. FPTP is becoming his “friend”, he recently told Sky News Australia.Shamefully, there is silence from Labour on this, too, despitemajority supportfor electoral reform. If Farage should win, it will not be because of any image transformation, but because Labour’s failure to reform our electoral system would give Reform victory onjust over a quarter of the vote. That, after all, is why PM Farage is in any way imaginable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

AstraZeneca’s proposal to list its sharesdirectly on the New York Stock Exchangewhile retaining the quotes in London and Stockholm disadvantages nobody on the shareholder register.US investors get the chance to ownAstraZenecain full-fat form rather than via American depositary receipts (a wrapper provided by a handful of banks), a rejig that should widen the pool of potential investors and help the company with any future big deals in the US. Meanwhile, the pharma giant keeps its presence in the FTSE 100 index, upsetting no shareholders on the home front. “A global listing for global investors in a global company,” as Pascal Soriot, the chief executive, called it. Sure enough, the proposal sailed through on Monday with 99% in favour.But one non-shareholding party will suffer from this setup. It is HM Treasury, which will be out of pocket to the tune of about £200m a year from lost stamp duty on transactions in London. Buyers of AstraZeneca shares in the UK, you see, will be getting a depositary interest in the company in future. It will carry the same voting and ownership rights as before but, critically, stamp duty does not apply to such instruments.The arrangement drives a coach and horses through the UK’s stamp duty regime. It would only take a few other Footsie big beasts to copy the structure for the government’s £3bn-ish annual receipts from stamp duty on shares to collapse.What should Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, do? Step one should be to recognise that the tax is doomed in its current form. Stamp duty reserve tax, to give its full name, is the 0.5% levy on purchases of shares in UK companies, and virtually no other country sets the rate so high. The US, China and Germany don’t impose any equivalent tax at all and only Ireland, at 1%, has a higher rate. Worse, it is only a subset of investors who pay it – UK retail investors and UK pension funds – because everybody else has practical workarounds already. As an advert for popular share ownership, or just the competitiveness of the London market, stamp duty has become a very obvious own goal,as argued here regularly.In step two, Reeves should make a virtue of the necessity of cutting the tax. The endless months of pre-budget speculation have brought the strong suggestion that the chancellor isconsidering capping annual cash Isa contributionsin the hope of encouraging a few cash obsessives into shares. If that is the stick then the carrot ought to be overdue reform of the costs of transacting in UK shares.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If that is deemed politically impossible in a tax-raising budget, at least chop the rate in half, which could encourage more trading. Suggested alternatives, such as granting a three-year stamp duty holiday to new listings on the London market, are too fiddly and too minor to make a difference. The timing is rotten for the chancellor, but the blunt truth is that the UK’s most valuable company has demonstrated the multiple flaws in the stamp duty regime for all the world to see. Time to recognise reality before the receipts leak away anyway.Explore more on these topicsAstraZenecaNils Pratley on financeStock marketsRachel ReevesTax and spendingSharesBudgetcommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, try saying it all the time yourselfMon 3 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 08.19 ESTShareDon’t tell your kids, but “6-7” isDictionary.com’s “word of the year” for 2025. Of course, “6-7” is not a word in the strictest sense. It’s two random numbers strung together for the purposes of annoying parents around the world. What does it mean? Nothing. When can it be used? Pretty much whenever you want to piss off an old person. Such is the state of global linguistics. Having a purpose or meaning to what you’re articulating is cringe. The point is to troll, to frustrate, and to alienate. Isn’t that the whole reason the internet exists? To organize us into factions – the smartened up and the hapless?For the childless among us, “6-7” is just online gibberish that is easily ignored – the password into a nightclub you don’t want to actually enter. For people like me with a Gen Alpha boy obsessed with belonging, “6-7” is something like the Rosetta Stone for having even a passing verbal interaction with your spawn. About a month ago, my son started saying “6-7” at any lull in conversation. He’d start asking for the thermostat in our car to be turned down to 67 degrees even if it was 62 degrees outside. For his eighth birthday, I bought him a personalized Dodgers jersey with his name on the back. The number he chose was 67. I purchased a size big enough for him to grow into, but the rest of the jersey will probably age like an apple on the side of the freeway. “Why did I pick this number again?” he’ll ask in three years. “Because your brain wasn’t developed enough,” I’ll respond.I know there are parents out there who aren’t just perplexed by this phenomenon, but actively furious about it. Another sign of the end of the world. The gradual decay of the discourse. If a phrase (“6-7” is not a word, by the way. Someone tellDictionary.com) means nothing, what’s the point of saying it? Steve Johnson, director of lexicography for the Dictionary Media Group at IXL Learning, who helped select the word of the year,told CBS News: “It’s something that’s used to show, ‘I’m part of this generation. This is who I am.’ It’s kind of like an in-group joke.” In short, its only purpose is to disassociate from polite society. A middle finger or acrotch chopused to suffice, but it’s 2025. Am I so old now that I can’t tell an authority figure to “suck it” and get my point across? What a tragedy.“6-7” is so ubiquitous in Gen Alpha circles that my son’s teacher has banned the term from her class. Seems a bit harsh, I think. How does math class go when my child has to add 35 and 32? Should he run out of the room screaming? Should he voluntarily send himself to the principal’s office instead of solving the problem? I remember being 12 and laughing about the number 69 any time it came up in passing. At least that meant something rude. And if you don’t know what 69 means, don’t Google it right now. I’m not trying to get you fired in this economy.All we’re doing is giving these little goobers too much power. By banning a random coupling of numbers, we’re telling the prepubescent that they can make just about anything inappropriate with enough coordination. If every child in America started saying “Bazinga” from Big Bang Theory on the playground, should we banYoung Sheldon? I remember when my parents’ generation thought Bart Simpson telling an adult to “eat my shorts” was the end of western civilization. Looking around at the world today, maybe they were right. But was that really the tipping point, or was it The Apprentice? I’m not arrogant enough to say one way or the other.Nothing makes a stupid child want to say or do a thing more than banning it. My mother telling me I couldn’t watch MTV just made Mariah Carey music videos seem like free softcore pornography. Today’s kids say all manner of completely abhorrent things on social media, YouTube orRobloxbecause we’ve told them they can’t. This is not to imply that children should be given no rules or structure. Just that, when given that structure, they will inevitably rebel against it. That’s frustrating, but it’s also incredibly natural. Our job as parents isn’t just to create rules, but to give practical and clear reasons for why those rules exist in the first place.If “6-7” truly means nothing, then why are we, as adults, telling kids to stop saying it? Can you tell a child why they can’t say it without sounding like a complete buffoon? “Because it’s distracting” isn’t going to work, either. It’s like telling a dog to stop humping the air because you can’t focus on bingeing the latest season of Stranger Things. You could just, you know, learn to ignore it.If adults really want to squash the “6-7” phenomenon, then I recommend doing what I’ve been trying at my house. Say it. Say it all the time. Suggest a “6-7”-themed birthday party. Randomly scribble it on the walls in water-soluble ink. Scream it in the middle of your child’s soccer practice. When you pick them up, give them a hug and whisper “6-7” into their ear. Prank-call their friends’ parents and say it. On pizza night, arrange the pepperoni into a “6-7” formation and take tons of pictures that you tag them in on Instagram. Nothing in this world is lamer than adults understanding and appreciating youth slang. Stop fighting it. Stop acting like you are above such nonsense. What are you, your own parents?Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionLanguageFamilyChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

Nobody can feign ignorance about what’s going onNesrine MalikThe massacres carried out by the RSF in El Fasher, Darfur, with the support of its UAE sponsors, will only stop when the international community actsMon 3 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 04.47 ESTShareIt unfolded in plain sight over 18 months. The city of El Fasher in the Darfur region of Sudan, besieged by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), fell to the militia group last week, and whathas followed is a catastrophe.Mass killings are under way. There are reports that in one maternity hospital alone almost 500 people – patients and their families –were killed. The few that managed to escape tell ofsummary executions of civilians. The RSF has embarked on a killing spree of civilians so severe that images of blood saturating the ground have beenpicked up by satellite. The speed and intensity of the killings in the immediate aftermath of the fall of El Fasher has already beencompared by war monitorsto the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide.This is the culmination of a campaign that had walled in the population of the city – hundreds of thousands of people – and reduced it to starvation. Those who attempted to fleerisked death and rape, and those that remained were bombed and surviving on nothing more thananimal feed.El Fasher was the Sudanese military’s last remaining stronghold inDarfur, and this past week marks a grave turning point in Sudan’s war. Now two and a half years long, the fight for control of the country between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF has been brutal and relentless.Previously partners in government, the two parties ruled in a tense coalition with civilians after a popular revolution overthrew president Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The parties then turned on the civilians, before turning on each other. When it came, their confrontation was explosive; a revelation of just how much the RSF (created by Bashir from the ranks of Janjaweed fighters to protect him and fight his wars in Darfur) had amassed power and resources in the shadows. The war that started in April 2023 was not between the military and an upstart militia, but two armies, both with arsenals, income streams, thousands of troops, and external supply lines.Since then, millions have been displaced, an estimated150,000 have been killed, and more than 30 million people now needurgent humanitarian assistance. These staggering statistics still do not fully tell the story of Sudan’s tragedy, the country’s rapid unravelling, the destruction of its infrastructure, or the particularly merciless way the RSF has conducted its campaign in Darfur.View image in fullscreenA satellite image released on 31 October shows smoke billowing from fires around El Fasher airport.Photograph: Satellite image ©2025 Vantor/AFP/Getty ImagesWith El Fasher’s capture, the RSF has consolidated its position in the west of the country. Having taken the capital city, Khartoum, in the early days of the war in 2023, the RSF then lost it to the military, and focused its efforts on Darfur. There, it has wreaked its vengeance on the non-Arab populations, ethnically targeting them in mass killings. Earlier this year, in an attack on Sudan’s largest displacement camp, the RSFslaughtered hundredsof civilians along ethnic lines. What further awaits El Fasher after its fall, a city that held out against the RSF for so long, is unthinkable. Thevideos emergingare of locals pleading with militiamen for their lives. One was told by a commander that none will be spared, before being shot. “I will never have mercy on you,” the commander said. “Our job is only killing.”The siege of Khartoum has lifted. Left behind are scenes of unimaginable horror | Nesrine MalikRead moreAnd it was all predicted and predictable.Warnings were being issuedfor months about the risk of mass slaughter and atrocities. A million displaced Darfuris, fleeing other flashpoints, had become concentrated in El Fasher. As fighting intensified, they then dispersed once again or became trapped. It is a scenario that not only recalls the first days of the Rwanda genocide, but past episodes of Darfur’s genocide 20 years ago, only this time more concentrated and intense. The RSF of today is the Janjaweed of yesteryear, except this time armed to the teeth, supported by powerful external allies, and with a renewed appetite to purge once more non-Arab populations it has been hostile to for decades. Todaythey comenot on camel or horseback, but on4x4 “technicals”armed with mounted machine guns andpowerful drones.That arsenal, and therefore the calamity in El Fasher and the wider Darfur region, is sponsored by the United Arab Emirates. A staunch historical ally of the RSF (whosetroops the UAE hiredto prosecute its war in Yemen), the Emirates haspumped fundsandweaponryinto the RSF’s hands and, in doing so, extended the life and intensity of Sudan’s war. It continues to deny its role,despite overwhelming evidence. In return, the UAE secures a foothold in a large, strategic, resource-rich country, and alreadyreceives the majority of goldmined in RSF-controlled areas. Other actorshave been drawn in, overlaying proxy agendas on a domestic conflict. The result is deadlock, quagmire and blood loss that seems impossible to stem, even as the crisis unravels in full view.Sudan’s war is described as forgotten, but in reality it is tolerated and relegated. Because to reckon with the horror in Sudan is to look into the abyss of regional and global politics. It is to see the growing imperialist role of some Gulf powers in Africa and beyond – and to acknowledge the fact that no meaningful pressure is applied to these powers, including the UAE, to cease and desist from supportinga genocidal militiabecause the UK, US and others are close allies with these states. As the RSF encircled El Fasher last year, sources told the Guardian that UK government officials were working to suppress criticism of the UAE among African diplomats. Last week it was revealed that British military equipment used by the RSFwas found on the battlefieldsin Sudan.In Sudan, there are two military parties that cannot decisively defeat each other. Globally, foreign policy that was once the result of a mixture of diplomatic pragmatism and parties amenable to moral pressure has now been reduced to the naked practice of powerful states pursuing business and political interests, however they see fit. The scale and clarity – crimes visible from space – of what is occurring in El Fasher and the wider Darfur region leaves no room for pretences of ignorance. It is a repeat of what we have seen before, and a new chapter in a war that has gone on for long enough for all to know what is on the cards. Those who have leverage over the UAE, and therefore the RSF, but allow the violence to pass without urgent action or pressure have blood on their hands. The majority of El Fasher’s population istrapped in a killing field. Every minute counts.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Our exchanges of ideas and points of view are making me a better personMon 3 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 18.04 ESTShareIt seems like intergenerational warfare is everywhere right now. Aside from the fact it’s the burden of every generation to feel misunderstood by those older than them, and to condescend to those younger, the current tension between baby boomers, gen X, millennials and gen Z does seem to run deeper.Those of us in the latter two categories blame everyone older than us for the dire state of the world today (a viewpoint that sometimes ignores the fact that the world has been getting worse since the big bang). And let’s face it, it’s impossible to not be bewildered and feel attacked by people younger than you when they automatically dismiss your life experiences, start speaking seemingly in code (I still don’t knowwhat “six-seven” means) and laugh at your idea of fashion.Moving house has never been so stressful. Which is why you need an elite squadron of helpers | Maddie ThomasRead moreBut all of this antagonism may result in a major loss of opportunity, because there is truly nothing as rewarding as a good intergenerational friendship. I have the benefit of having a number of friends who are both much younger than me, and somewhat older than me, and the exchanges we have of ideas, advice and points of view are undoubtedly making me a better person.Importantly, it’s through these friendships that I’ve been able to both question my own assumptions, push back against stereotypes about generational identities and also stay connected to emerging ideologies, pop culture and technology that I’ve “aged” out of.When I was a teenager, it was my friendships with older women that helped me develop my confidence in my thinking, to put my problems in perspective and to understand that I could learn from my elders without it meaning letting go of my emerging independence and agency.One of my close friends, Sally*, is only seven years older than me, which, when I was 18, seemed like a massive difference. Functionally, it meant she was firmly in a different stage of life when we became friends and this was immensely helpful to me. When I look back on my coming of age, Sally was an instrumental sounding board for so many of my major decisions; when I dropped out of the first university I attended and enrolled in another, she lent me a box set of the90s TV show Felicitywhere the eponymous protagonist did the same, and I remember her humour and grace while I worked through the big decisions of who and what I wanted to be as a “grown up”.As I have gotten older and we’ve stayed friends, the dynamic in our friendship has shifted and, although I’ve always felt respected and understood by her, now I feel as though our exchanges are deeper through more shared experiences. I hope I’ve been a useful source of wisdom over the years too, having gained so much from her.On the other side of the coin, I find myself in the privileged position these days of being connected to several incredible young women, including nieces and a few special friends I’ve made via hobbies and grown very close to. Recently, one young woman, Milly*, who I have known since she was in her early teens, and who has recently turned 18, turned to me as a friendly ear to listen to some emotional turmoil she was going through in her social life. I felt so moved – and humbled – to be seen not only as a trusted person to talk to, but as someone she felt could offer judgment-free wisdom.Too often Australians weaponise the word ‘mate’ to mean the opposite of friendship | Paul DaleyRead moreIn return, Milly keeps me supplied in excellent social media memes, is my cheer squad and support when needed, and is a useful source of insight when I come across yet another gen Z term I don’t understand.Chatting on the phone to her the other night, I found myself thinking of when I was her age and Sally was listening to me work through this or that friendship conflict over a coffee. I can’t wait to be sitting across a cafe table from Milly in 10 years’ time, with our age and life experience evened out, and hear about all the cool stuff she will no doubt be up to then.When I see the feuds unfolding between generations online –the recent spat between Emma Watson and JK Rowlingcomes to mind – I can’t help but feel we’ve got it wrong when it comes to socially understanding generational difference. Each generation ismeantto forge new social movements and ideological shifts to the ones before them. We’remeantto find some things baffling about each other, but we should also be able to recognise how crucial that diversity of experience and thought is, not just to society, but in our individual lives as well.* Names have been changedZoya Patel is a writer and editor based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsFriendshipOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

As passengers fled through the carriages, some of them bleeding and shouting warnings, it became clear that this was one of those terrible moments when a nightmare comes true.LNER staff and the emergency services deserve credit for their swift response. By diverting the high‑speed service to Huntingdon, train driver Andrew Johnson averted a worse disaster.Another crew member, who remains in a critical condition, has been described by police as “heroic”. Five out of 10 people who were injured in the rampage have been discharged. A suspect, Anthony Williams, was arrested at the scene and has appeared in court.The contrast between frontline professionalism and the kneejerk cynicism of some rightwing politicians and commentators, in using these events to stoke fear and prejudice, could hardly be greater. Police announced at 10.30am on Sunday that two male suspects, both black British nationals, had been detained. Given that one of these men was later released and had nothing to do with the attack, his arrest and the decision to announce it must be reviewed promptly.But the conduct ofsenior politicians, as well as less significant public figures, over the weekend was an ugly reminder of whyguidance was changedto enable suspects’ nationality or ethnicity to be made public in high-profile cases where there is a risk of misinformation. While Chris Philp, the Tory shadow home secretary, said that police ought to have released “identity details” even sooner, Reform UK’s former co-leader, Ben Habib, said it was “almost inconceivable” that this was not a terrorist attack.Such ill-judged remarks not only undermine the police – exposing the hypocrisy of rightwing politicians’ claims to champion law and order. They actively contribute to a climate of suspicion, in which social media rumours can easily create the false impression that facts are being hidden. The reality is that neither of the two highest-profile multiple stabbings involving strangers, in recent years, have been terrorist attacks. The inquiries into the killings carried out byValdo Calocanein Nottingham in 2023, andAxel Rudakubanain Southport in 2024, are both focused on the men’s interactions with mental health and other public services.It will take time to reach an understanding of what happened on Saturday. But looking at previous knife attacks, we can be certain that public services including the NHS need to get better at identifying people who pose a threat. In the case of Rudakubana, a failure of information-sharing between police forces is expected to be highlighted, when the inquiry report is published next year. An NHS review of the care given to Calocane, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, pointed totreatment and risk assessment failures. Shortages of mental health beds and other resources have been found on many occasions to contribute to such lapses.Mental illness-related explanations for extreme violence, and terrorism, are of course not mutually exclusive. Thedebate is ongoing in policy circlesabout how attackers who are fixated on violence rather than a particular ideology or worldview should be dealt with. But the opportunistic use of such tragedies to foment antagonism towards asylum seekers, and racist prejudice more broadly, must cease. It drags our politics towards the gutter.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A society that rewards proximity to capital over contribution risks ruptureMon 3 Nov 2025 13.49 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 14.36 ESTShareIn the US, the brightest are said to joinAI firms. In Britain, they sign up to be quantitative analysts. The Financial Times reports that the City is becoming one of the world’s leading “quant” centres. An Oxford don in charge of mathematical financetoldits reporters that almost all his students ended up working at quant trading firms, on salaries from £250,000 to £800,000. “If you get offered a salary less than £250K, you’re kind of the sad guy,” he said, adding that “nobody I know interviews for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs  … not once do I hear anybody entertain any of these traditional investment banking jobs.”The lure is obvious: 45-year-old billionaire traderAlex Gerkoearned £682m from his City quant firm XTX Markets last year. Harder to grasp is that modest salaries in once respectable professions now function to deter people from the very graduate careers they once defined. On the FT’s front page, employers warned thatgraduate entrantsto City bluechips earn a median yearly salary of £33,000, not much more than the new £26,400 minimum wage. Executives cautioned that university debt no longer yields a wage premium. To preserve profits, firms said they would look to using more AI or offshore roles.This ought to be warning for the professions that have provided the backbone of theBritish middle class. What is emerging is a world in which a tiny sliver at the top captures rents from financial capital, and a great many credentialed professionals earn a little above the legal salary floor. While London lags behind New York as the quant capital of global finance, the US is a larger and more variegated economy with other industries – notably AI – attracting top graduates. The war for “talent” across the pond is so ridiculous that Mr Gerko’s XTX New York office offers interns$35,000 a monthin compensation.Both AI andquantitative investingneed huge amounts of cash to builddata centres. Intuitively it feels like machine learning will probably add something to society though few can say what exactly.Financeby comparison is useless. Its quantitative version adds no real value: it’s clever people betting against other clever people, shuffling wealth a little faster between them. The theory is that the best mathematical models put investors on the right side of trades.After the crash of 2008, thefinancial sectorwas fingered for being responsible for inequality rising faster in the UK than its rich world peers. But that knowledge did little to reorient the British economy and steer talent toward socially useful sectors. Today the UK’sexchange-rateandinterest‑rateregimes still privilege financial assets over productive investment. The result is a misallocation of human capital: with a surplus in finance and a scarcity almost anywhere else.Financialised economies no longertranslateinnovation into productivity. The gains end up in concentrated ownership and shareholder payouts. Finance’s pull in the UK is so strong that it shapescultural aspirations, pay norms and even the justification of education. Meanwhile minimum-wage workers approach the pay of young auditors, while quant traders approach that of chief executives. Britain’s professional class is quietly being proletarianised. Culturally privileged but economically precarious, white-collar workers risk souring on the system they were trained to serve. That should worry politicians.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I want a school that understands play is learning, 29 October).Time allocated for non-traditional learning such as outdoor learning in the school day has been eroded in recent years, while research shows that only one in three primary school pupils in the UK meet the in-school target of half an hour of physical activity every day. This is despite evidence which shows that pupils learn best through supported play experiences and outdoor exploration.Sufficient time needs to be built into the curriculum, as well as physical spaces within schools, to allow children and young people the time to play and socialise. This includes not only breaktimes, but concrete opportunities to play in a meaningful way. Socially interactive playfulness should be embedded into teaching and across all ages and stages, especially in primary education.The government must act to reverse this decline in play and give our children a school experience that nurtures both body and mind.Dr Helena BunnChair of the British Psychological Society’s Division of Education and Child PsychologyRhiannon Lucy Cosslett is absolutely right. It is both tragic and absurd that state education in England has somehow reverted to the utilitarian sterility satirised by Dickens in Hard Times.Inflicting formal learning on five-year-olds is both cruel and counterproductive, as we see in the growing number of children who have learned to dislike reading. Countries with more successful education systems than ours nearly all delay formal learning until age seven.Bridget Phillipson has declared herself to have a special interest in early years education.

Between July and September 2025,4,711 people were seen sleeping rough in Londonby outreach workers and 2,116 of these people were doing so for the first time. At last count, the king had seven palaces and 10 castles. Then there are the4.5 million children living in relative poverty.But the monarchy has fabulous wealth. For the year 2025-26, the king is receiving a sovereign grant of £132.1m. The crown estate has assets of £15bn.The monarch holds the Duchy of Lancaster, which at the end of March was worth £679m and had made £24.4m in annual profits. Similarly, the Duchy of Cornwall had assets worth £1.1bn and annual profits of £22.9m.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater ManchesterI notice that the Sandringham estate is run as a business, with holiday lets and public access to parks and gardens (Andrew in line for six-figure payout and annual stipend from king, sources say, 31 October).Surely, rather than give Andrew a stipend to stay in a grace-and-favour house doing nothing, the king should offer him a wage to do something useful? I am sure the estate needs tour guides, cleaners, groundspersons, gardeners and rubbish collectors: good jobs on the national living wage for a commoner.Time was, disgraced aristocrats did penance through good works. It is probably just the sort of therapy this disgraced former prince needs, now that solutions such as banishment to the colonies are thoroughly out of fashion.John RobinsonDeal, KentSince the word “folly” is derived from the Old French “folie”, meaning “madness” or “foolishness”, perhaps The Folly, of all the possible new homes on the Sandringham estate, is the most appropriate choice for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor (Which property on the Sandringham estate is fit for a former prince?, 31 October). The etymology is the basis for the original English meaning of “foolish behaviour”, which later expanded to include concepts of wickedness, and then later to the specific and modern use of “folly” as a large, extravagant, and often purposeless structure or building. Large, extravagant and purposeless? Yes, that just about sums it up.Paul GoodmanLoughborough, LeicestershireYour article about which house Andrew Windsor might live in could have been combined with your fantasy house hunt feature in the Money section: “Best Sandringham rental properties for a disgraced former prince.”Chris PackhamBirminghamAccording to the statement issued by the royal family, the last names of the commoner formerly known as Prince Andrew are not hyphenated, so surely Andrew Windsor is sufficient, or just plain Windsor. It would save time, ink and patience.Paulina ChurchManchesterSurely the one title/honour which Andrew Mountbatten Windsor should be allowed to keep is the probably appropriate “vice-admiral” (Andrew to be stripped of naval title, says UK defence secretary, 2 November).Lydia WoolleyWeybridge, SurreyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The England international would have exited on a free transfer but for Real paying an £8.5m fee to cancel his Liverpool contract early and include him in their squad for the Club World Cup.Slot insists Wirtz has ‘brought exactly what we expected’ before Real Madrid tieRead moreThe 27-year-old was part of a Real delegation that laid floral tributes to Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva outside Anfield on Monday night. The head coach and formerLiverpoolmidfielder Alonso, the defender Dean Huijsen and Real’s director of institutional relations, Emilio Butragueño, were also present. Alexander-Arnold laid his own floral tribute, with a message that read: “My mate Diogo, you are so missed but still so loved. Yours and André’s memories will always live on. I smile every time I think about you and will always remember the great times we shared. Miss you mate every day. Love Trent and family.”Alonso is guaranteed a warm reception from the Anfield crowd having graced Liverpool’s midfield between 2004 and 2009. He believes Alexander-Arnold should relish facing his boyhood team, if selected. “We haven’t spoken about that precisely [the reception that awaits Alexander-Arnold] but we have spoken about the team and the club,” the Real head coach said.“He has to have his own feelings and enjoy it his own way. So I am not going to say how he needs to feel it. For sure his history is different from mine, he was born and bred in Liverpool. I remember him from a young age in the academy and then coming to the first team and winning theChampions League. So he needs to enjoy the moment because it is nice to be back.”View image in fullscreenA tribute to Liverpool’s Diogo Jota left outside Anfield by Trent Alexander-Arnold of Real Madrid.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe former Liverpool defender’s move to Real has not gone to plan on the pitch having sustained a hamstring injury on hisChampions League debut for the clubagainst Marseille on 16 September. He has not played since and has been an unused substitute in Real’s last two games.But Alonso said: “He is good. He didn’t play [against Valencia on Saturday] because of the context of the game but he is available for any number of minutes. Tomorrow he may play and after the injury he had we need his qualities; he has great qualities. He is in a new stage for him – sporting, physically and mentally.

Back then, the club were on a downward slope. Now, things are on the up.Régis Le Bris’s side moved up to fourth place ahead of Saturday’s home game against thePremier Leagueleaders, Arsenal, after a 1-1 draw against Moyes’s Everton. A deflected strike from the impressive Granit Xhaka cancelled out Iliman Ndiaye’s brilliant opening goal.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreEverton had dominated much of the first half, and were unfortunate not to be further ahead at the break. It was a different story in the second half, as Sunderland laid siege to theEvertongoal. “We didn’t start well,” said Le Bris. “They were better than us, they were dominant.”Asked if his main emotion was disappointment, Le Bris said: “Not really, because this league is so tough. It’s a good reminder how hard it is to win a single point. We started [the season] really well, so we might forget that we still are a promoted team. It’s a good point.”Moyes took charge of Sunderland at short notice in the summer of 2016 for what would prove to be a long and troubled season after Sam Allardyce left to manage England. Moyes would last longer at the Stadium of Light than Allardyce would at the Football Association, but the injury-ravaged campaign did not end well. Sunderland bought badly, and the season ended badly. The team went down with just 24 points –and Moyes resigned.Another relegation followed and, in the dark days of Sunderland’s four-year stay in League One, it would have been hard for fans to imagine the club competing in the upper echelons of the Premier League given they were struggling to compete where they were in the pyramid. Ahead of the game, Moyes said thathe had a “good time”on Wearside, despite suffering the only relegation of his managerial career. Fans remember the campaign less fondly.Le Bris named an unchanged team, while Moyes fielded Thierno Barry up front rather than Beto after his side had gone two games without a goal.A goal was not long in coming for Everton, however, and Barry played his part. Ndiaye took the ball on the right with the help of Barry and raced towards the box. He superbly evaded three challenges before getting the ball on to his left foot and opening the scoring with a shot which stunned Robin Roefs, who has kept a lot out of Sunderland’s goal so far this season.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Iliman Ndiaye fires in a spectacular opener after 15 minutes.Photograph: Richard Lee/ShutterstockJack Grealish, a threat from the left, struck a post from 20 yards during a dominant spell for Everton. Sunderland struggled to get hold of the ball for the first 30 minutes, but they rallied late in the half, and Everton scrambled the ball away after Dan Ballard headed a ball from Nordi Mukiele towards goal. Even so, the former Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, making his first appearance at the stadium since leaving the same summer as Moyes, did not face a first-half shot on target.Sunderland, though, do not give up. The slogan of last season’s Championship playoff run was “Til the end”, and they were back level a minute after the restart. Pickford was helpless after James Tarkowski inadvertently diverted a shot from Xhaka past him after Enzo Le Fée teed up Sunderland’s captain on the edge of the box.Pickford did well to stop a strike from Le Fée which bounced off Wilson Isidor.

The visitors somehow did not come unstuck. Mukiele headed over from close range.“I think after 30 minutes, I’d have been disappointed to be only going home with a point,” said Moyes. “After 90 minutes I was quite pleased with a point.”He was asked after the game if Sunderland felt like a different club to the one he managed. “Absolutely,” said Moyes. “They’ve done amazingly to bring themselves back round. Maybe they’ve been away longer than they hoped to be, but it’s great to see them back.

The defenders stormed past Frank towards the tunnel, ignoring their manager’s attempts to get them to acknowledge the supporters in the South Stand – a bad look at the end of another bad Premier League day at the stadium.Why Saudi money hasn’t transformed Newcastle into title contendersRead moreTottenham have won only once in five games there under Frank in the competition, losing three, which has continued a worrying trend. The team have three victories and 12 defeats in 19 home league matches and have lost 41 times at the stadium since it opened in 2019. It hurts the Spurs fanbase to realise that their fiercest rivals, Arsenal, have lost 48 league games at the Emirates Stadium – and that opened in 2006.Frank was happy to provide the detail of how Van de Ven and Spence had been to see him separately on Sunday to say sorry as they began preparations for theChampions Leaguegame at home against Copenhagen on Tuesday night.Frank is acutely aware ofhow poor his team wereagainst Chelsea – they offered nothing in attacking terms – and he accepted that the jeers could come after the final whistle. But he was also clear that there needed to be greater positivity from the stands during the game. There were boos, for example, towards the end against Chelsea when the goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario played a sideways pass rather than something more forward-thinking.“I want to get the point across that the fans were fantastic in the first 30 minutes,” Frank said. “It seems there was a little bit of a turning point when we conceded the goal, where we all get a little bit frustrated, which is natural.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank believes the Spurs fans can act as the turning point in matches.Photograph: John Walton/PA“After the game, if we perform badly and on top of that we lose, it’s more than fair enough that they boo us. We are in the performance business and if we can’t deal with the pressure, the negativity or the criticism, we shouldn’t sit here. But during the game, we need a little bit of help. And especially when it’s not going the right way.“They [the fans] can be the turning point. We were 1-0 down in the last 15 minutes … imagine they carry us over the line and we got a little bit of an unfair 1-1. What a feeling! That point can be the difference in a long season.”Vicario was seen after the match pushing his young teammate Lucas Bergvall away from a confrontation with an irate supporter. The goalkeeper pointed at his own eyes and then at the fan as though to say he was watching him.“In every environment there are very good people and some bad people,” Vicario said. “Probably [Bergvall] got contact with one bad person. That doesn’t necessarily say that everyone are bad people. But there are some bad people in every environment and I had to protect him because he was a little bit emotional in that time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In some moments during the game, probably when we are chasing, we need a little more cool heads and if we have a little bit more help in some situations coming from the stands it could be, of course, better.”On the Van de Ven and Spence situation, Frank said: “They came into my office yesterday, unprompted, and just said: ‘Want to say sorry for the situation.’ They didn’t want it to look bad or disrespectful or all of the kind of perceptions you can get in this beautiful media world. That was not the intention at all towards me or the team or the club. They were just frustrated with the performance, the loss and the booing during the game.“Of course, I’m happy [they apologised] because I knew the question would come today and it means that they care. They care about the team, the club and, in this case, me.”Frank, who reported that Bergvall was observing the 12-day concussion protocol after his withdrawal againstChelseaand would miss the games against Copenhagen and Manchester United on Saturday, also made a gentle plea for perspective. Despite Spurs’ difficulties at home, they have been excellent on their travels – a contrast to the domestic horrors of last season when they finished 17th. They are also unbeaten in their three Champions League matches.“If anyone would have said that we would have 17 points after 10 games, fifth place [beforeSunderland 1-1 Everton] and unbeaten in the Champions League … everything’s definitely not perfect but there’s a decent foundation and it’s up to us to add layers,” Frank said. “I think everyone would have taken where we are now [after] 22 [league] defeats last season and finishing 17th. The Europa League [victory last season] was fantastic, wow.

Gauff had struggled in the first set of their opening match at theWTA Finalsin Riyadh on Sunday, but then she dug deep and slowly turned the match around. The American reached set point on her serve at 6-5 in the second set.Gauff then proceeded to hit three double faults in a row, which allowed Pegula to retrieve the break without touching the ball. Not a single attempt was even close.That sequence illustrated perfectly Gauff’s struggles at the end of a curious season. On one hand, things are going supremely well in her career overall. She won her second grand slam titleat the French Openin June by outsmarting the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, a win that showed Gauff and the rest of the tour that her first slam victory was no fluke. It was reasonable to assume that such a win would allow her to build even greater momentum.From burnout to brilliance: Amanda Anisimova on how honesty sparked her remarkable revivalRead moreInstead, aside from her title runat the Wuhan Openlast month, the past five months have been some of the most challenging of her career. Those struggles can be attributed largely to one shot: Gauff’s second serve.While she has always been prone to double faults, over the past two seasons her serve has fallen apart.According to Tennis Abstract, Gauff’s double‑fault rate, the amount of service points that end in a double fault, is by far the worst of all top 50 players this year at 9.9%. The next worst performer inside the top 10 is Amanda Anisimova, who has a double‑fault rate of 6.2%. In a sport of narrow margins where matches are decided usually by a few points, Gauff freely hands over a tenth of her service points.On the court, she possesses many assets. Her defensive skills and athleticism are peerless, her two-handed backhand is sublime and her intelligence on the court is complemented by a well-rounded game. While her forehand can be inconsistent, all evidence suggests that the quality of her second serve will probably determine just how far she can go in her career. Gauff leads the tour for success in return games, winning 46.8% of her return games this year, and she has won a respectable 68.6% of first‑serve points, which places her at No 12 in the top 50.The problems begin with her second serve. Gauff is the sixth-worst performer in the top 50 for second‑serve points won this year. Excluding double faults, however, she has won the second‑highest proportion of second‑serve points on the tour. If she can lower her double‑fault count, her results will improve significantly.After an excruciating series of serving performances from Gauff during the summer, including 23 double faults against Danielle Collins in Montreal, she finally took drastic action. Days before the US Open, the American parted ways with her coach Matt Daly in favour of hiring the tennis biomechanics expert Gavin MacMillan. They immediately made significant changes to her “hitchy” service technique, particularly on her knee bend and tendency to throw her head down, in her attempts to generate racket head speed which often leads to an off‑balance landing.A top player making such a significant coaching change days before a grand slam tournament is practically unheard of and it made for a miserable week in New York. After crying on court during her second‑round win against Donna Vekic and feeling put under pressure by all the scrutiny she received,Gauff lost in the fourth roundagainst Naomi Osaka.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gauff is ranked No 3 and she has been competing at the highest level of professional tennis for half a decade. It can be hard to focus on future improvements when a player is expected to win nearly every match they play. However, she is still only 21 years old and she should still be focusing on her development as a player. She clearly understands this.Despite her defeat against Pegula, Gauff still has the chance to advance from the group stages of the WTA Finals, where she is the defending champion. However, how her game evolves in the coming years is far more important. An obvious point of reference is Sabalenka, whose serve was a disaster three years ago.On numerous occasions in 2022, unable to control her second serve, Sabalenka resorted to hitting underarm second serves. This year, her double‑fault rate of 3.1% is the third lowest inside the top 50. It will take some time for Gauff to see if her work with MacMillan will also yield long-term improvements but, if they are even half as successful as the best player in the world, there will be many more big titles to come.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffWTA FinalsTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My dad, who didn’t do the actions so well, had to be Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Shane Warne. He was most proud of his Gillespie but his Warne wasn’t great.”Wood snorts at the idea that his dad, Derek, might have let him win most of those matches. “No, no, no. It was proper cricket.You had to give each other lbw and every time I hit my dad in the leg he’d be going: ‘No, that’s going over’ or ‘That’s down the leg side.’ I was like: ‘Dad, that was plumb.’ I had to get my DRS right.”Jofra Archer and Mark Wood give England a lift after epic ODI failureRead moreHe laughs before pointing out that his dad had been a decent batter who played a high level of club cricket. “Back in the day they played against some pretty good professionals. He still talks about facing Courtney Walsh and Ian Bishop. In the garden, we’d bowl to each other from 16 yards away with these little Incrediballs. We did that for years until, when I was 14, I bounced my dad and hit him on the head. At that point he thought: ‘This is a bit much …’”That mention of Wood’s extreme pace is a timely reminder that we are less than three weeksfrom an intriguing Ashes series. The first Test, in Perth, begins on 21 November and England plan to bombard Australia with a bowling attack full of bounce, hostility and raw speed.Wood’s respect and admiration for Australia is obvious. From those fiercely contested Ashes series with his father to playing club cricket on the Gold Coast to his dramaticinvolvement in 11 Tests against the real thing, taking 41 wickets, Wood defines himself against the old enemy. He took the wicket that sealed England’s series victory in 2015 and bagged 17 wickets in four Tests in 2021-22 where Wood’s searing bowling,including a career-best six for 37, was a rare highlight in a 4-0 drubbing. In 2023 he helped England win two of the last three Tests as he sparked a dramatic revival which resulted in the home seriesbeing drawn 2-2.View image in fullscreenMark Wood hopes to take another bite out of the Australia batting lineup in the forthcoming Ashes.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut there is a poignant undertow because, turning 36 three days after the fifth Test is due to end on 8 January, Woods’s fourth Ashes might be his last. His career has been blighted by injury – and his latest rehabilitation has been testing because he has not played since February.“I’ve obviously had a poor and strange summer,” he says ofhis struggle to recover fullyfrom knee surgery in March. “I could have played at the back end of the season, for Durham, but England took a more cautious approach.”Wood explains that “Chris Woakes was completely different – he wanted games under his belt to feel the rhythm whereas I can get up to speed very fast”.Rather than making any brash predictions of a certain England victory, Wood says: “I can truly say there’s a quiet confidence within the group. It’s a different feel this time. Last time we had Covid and problems behind the scenes. Under this coach [Brendon McCullum] and this captain [Ben Stokes] there’s a specific way of playing and we’re going with more confidence and belief.”Wood is at the Oval with a small group of his England teammates. Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Brydon Carse and Woodare ambassadors for New Balanceand they’re all in a relaxed mood. Wood has worked with the company for more than 10 years and his loyalty is matched by his humour as England’s resident prankster. But the seriousness of the coming weeks cannot be escaped, and thinking ofRoot, who captained England during the last Ashes in Australia, Wood says: “Everybody talks about Joe not having got a hundred in Australia but that doesn’t take away how great a player he is. I believe in Joe 100% and he’ll deliver for us like he has numerous times when we’ve been under the pump. I just hope that, when he comes in, we’re not 15 for two.”View image in fullscreenMark Wood wheels away after taking the wicket of Travis Head in Australia’s second innings of the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 2023.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe ferocity and fragility of England’s bowlers, however, might decide the series. “It’s about having a collection of bowlers who can come in if anyone needs resting or there are injuries,” Wood says of a squad crammed with quick bowlers including Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, Matthew Potts and Carse. “We want a battery of fast bowlers and we’ve tried to change from the norm of England, where there are lots of seamers, to Australia’s vision of fast bowling. Look at Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood: they can all bowl at 90[mph] or in the high 80s and they’ve been especially consistent and relentless. So we’re going there with a bit of an Australia blueprint to see if we can replicate that and put their batters under pressure like they’ve done with ours.”Archer, England’s other seriously rapid and intimidating quick, has also suffered for years with injuries but Wood says: “He’s ready to go. All the bowlers are ready to go. Atkinson has had a fantastic year and Tongue seems to be getting better with every game he plays for England. I know Carse really well, from Durham, and he will have a huge impact in games, not just with bowling fast but with the bat as well.”Stokes overcame his own injury woes to return as a frontline bowler in the summer series against India. But he missed the final Test with a grade-three tear of a shoulder muscle. “He’s in fantastic physical shape,” Wood says of his captain. “He’s worked really hard in the past year with the injuries and there’s a real good atmosphere around Stokesy. Once we’re in Australia he’ll not want to take a backward step, because that’s who he is as a character and a player.”View image in fullscreenThe Ashes spotlight on England starts at the airport as Mark Wood arrives in Perth.Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty ImagesStokes and McCullum also understand Wood. Sometimes, when throwing the ball to Wood, Stokes will offer a few simple words like: “Make something happen, Woody.”“I don’t think he would do that with everybody,” Wood says. “He knows how to get the best out of me by just keeping it fun and with a simple gameplan.”Similarly, with England 2-0 down in the 2023 Ashes, McCullum sidled up to the returning Wood before the Headingley Test. “Baz just said: ‘Are you ready to bowl some rockets, boss?”Wood responded with five for 34on the opening day. Every ball of his first four overs exceeded 90mph and, at his quickest, he hit 96.5mph. “That’s Baz,” Wood confirms. “Keep it simple and enjoy it. Sometimes I’ll say I’m not pleased with how I bowled and he’ll pick out a specific ball and say: ‘How fast was that?’ or ‘Can you imagine what they’re thinking next door when they saw that?’ He’ll always find a positive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere’s also a positive spin in Wood’s reaction to the public barbs that England will experience in Australia. “Last time I quite enjoyed it,” he says. “It was good craic back and forth. Some lads, and I’ll not name names, struggled with the hostility. I tried to have fun with it and my time on the Gold Coast helped because I could relate to that.”He played two seasons of club cricket in Australia for Palm Beach Currumbin. “Sounds tough, Palm Beach, doesn’t it?” Wood says. “I wouldn’t say I did amazingly well but it helped me grow up. I went out at 19 and back again when I was 21. I found lots of similarities in the lads that played there and my cricket friends at Ashington. I’ve still got six or seven friends from there that made the big journey over to my wedding. They’re fantastic people.”Wood, amusingly, remembers one of his Gold Coast mishaps. “I was living with another English guy and we stayed with the captain’s mother. She worked night shifts so we never really saw her. We’d try and do chores for her but I nearly cut my toe off trying to cut the grass. The strimmer took the skin off the top of my toe and I couldn’t play cricket that weekend. I made sure it was the other lad’s chore after that.”There are sombre memories when Wood recalls his darkest period. In 2016 a string of injuries led to a panic attack at an airport. “When I look back, all the signs were there that I was struggling with anxiety,” he says. “Would I be the same bowler? If I was in that position now I’d handle it differently by working with people and knowing what it was. But it was very scary because I didn’t know what was happening. I was going to see a surgeon in Holland for a second opinion on why my ankle kept breaking down. Little things added to [the panic attack]. I was going to an airport I’d never been to before and driving at four in the morning. When I got to the airport I was shaking and in a really bad place. The physio got me there but it was a tough day.”View image in fullscreenMark Wood in buoyant mood at The Oval after his recent injury woes.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianDid Wood came close to giving up on cricket? “Yes, with that ankle, I definitely thought: ‘Can I continue?”Wood has come through fraught times with his trademark humour and zany stunts. He has been known to startle his teammates by barking like a dog. His impression is so convincing that, until they see Wood laughing, some players have been convinced that a stray pooch has sneaked into the dressing room. Could the dog be brought out during the Ashes?“I don’t plan it but sometimes it comes out. I’ve been on England tours where it’s not been as strong as it could be but this group has a real togetherness. You have to gauge the feeling in the room. If the atmosphere is a bit sombre, or people are angry, I’m not sure barking like a dog would go down particularly well.”He smiles at a reminder thathe used to ride an imaginary horsein the outfield. “The horse has gone now,” he says. “I’m going through the animals and by the time I finish, I might have a farmyard. I’m just trying to be a little daft and create a relaxed atmosphere.”Wood clearly loves playing so could he continue in Test cricket for a few more years? “As long as I feel I’m contributing, and my body’s good, I’d love to keep going.”When I ask Wood what he expects to be doing 10 years from now he smiles again: “Playing at Ashington [Cricket Club] with my boy, probably. That would be a great thing.”Before then there are Ashes series to play in the back yard with his son, Harry, who is six now. “My dad had a lovely blend of playing tough in the back garden but also encouraging me,” Wood recalls. “I’ll be the same with my son.”But first comes the small matter of facing Australia for real in the coming weeks. Wood leans forward and says, intently: “I can’t wait. I’m ready.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesCricketEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teaminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Henry Slade, Tom Roebuck or Henry Arundell could in theory play at full-back but Smith would be the natural choice.Tommy Freeman started at No 13 against Australia while the in-form centres Slade and Ollie Lawrence missed out, and Borthwick may look to experiment again before aiming to field a first-choice XV for the All Blacks a week on Saturday.View image in fullscreenBen Earl would relish the opportunity to slot in at inside centre for England.Photograph: Sandra Mailer/ShutterstockThe Saracens flanker Ben Earl, who raced under the posts for England’s first try against the Wallabies, is another player seen as capable of making a switch to midfield. Earl said he would love to play at No 12 and that there are several hybrid options available.“I am just trying to help the team any way I can,” he said. “We have got a lot of boys now who could do a good job anywhere. Henry [Pollock] could do a very good job on the wing, Ted Hill when he was involved was very, very fast. There are a few boys that could do it. It is going to be a strength of our team going forward.”Earl said of potentially being selected at No 12: “I would love it. Just playing for England is the best … I am buzzing to be involved.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s no coincidence that Sam [Underhill] and I were there in that position because we trained a lot, we focused a lot on that, and you sort of work out where the ball’s going to go.”Earl also revealed that England have taken inspiration from the Last Dance, the Netflix documentary about the rise of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. “Dennis Rodman talks about it coming off the rim,” Earl said. “We spend a lot of time working on watching the balls come out of the hands, not to that same extent, but we talk a lot about where we think the ball’s going to go and gambling.“It was no coincidence that Henry scored that try, and that we [Earl and Underhill] had an opportunity to score ourselves.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamFiji rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It began with a two‑hour rain delay; it concluded with a catch at cover, taken on the stroke of midnight, which sealeda 52-run victory against South Africaand a maiden World Cup title.But amid the fireworks, tears, hugs, a lap of honour at the DY Patil Stadium, and rumours of a forthcoming winners’ parade in Mumbai, Kaur found time to deliver an important message to the media. “We’ve been waiting for this moment,” she said. “The celebration will go on all night. And then let’s see what BCCI is planning for us … this is just the beginning.”The implication was clear. A World Cup win in a country which is cricket obsessed, which has a population of 1.46 billion and yet which has historically been slow to embrace the women’s game, could be epoch‑defining. But this is no time for anyone to rest on their laurels.India rejoice in first Women’s World Cup triumph as South Africa fall shortRead moreIndia are the first non-western nation to win the Women’s World Cup – only England (four times), Australia (seven times) and New Zealand (once) have previously lifted the trophy. Nobody aside from Australia and England have managed it in 25 years. The reason? A global title requires sustained investment and that money has not been forthcoming in any nations outside the Big Two. Really, the first act of the Board of Control forCricketin India towards Kaur and her team should be an apology: we are sorry that we were so slow to believe in the enormous potential of women’s cricket. (Good luck with that one.)Australia’s dominance in women’s cricket was grounded in the introduction of the world’s first franchise league, the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL), creating an infuriatingly deep player pool which is still the envy of the world. So what did the BCCI do between the first season of WBBL in 2015‑16 and finally introducing the Women’s Premier League in 2023? Dragged their feet and fiddled around with a half-hearted three‑team “T20 Challenge”.Even now, there is a sense that had India not beaten South Africa on Sunday, their board could have continued to make excuses about their far from equal support of the women’s game. “We’ve been playing good cricket, but we had to win one big tournament,” Kaur said. “Without that, we couldn’t talk about change.”Partly, this is a reflection of the broader status of women within Indian society. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, India is one of the worst-performing countries in the world when scored on key gender equality benchmarks (ranked 131 out of 148). The main decision-makers and shakers in Indian cricket – as across the world – are men: the products of a society where women are still seen as the ones whose defining role in cricket is to make the tea.Change is coming. The BCCI has already announced a reward of 510m Indian rupees for Kaur and her team, to go alongside the $4.5m (£3.4m) prize money which they will receive from the International Cricket Council as tournament winners. Smriti Mandhana’s image has already filled billboards across India – now she will be joined by Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma, new national heroes who proudly proclaim different religious faiths in a nation torn apart by sectarianism. Cricket really can change society.View image in fullscreenIndia fans show their support during the Women’s World Cup final against South Africa.Photograph: Prakash Singh/ICC/Getty ImagesBut if you want a permanent shift, then the BCCI’s money shouldn’t just be used to make a handful of current players richer. It needs to trickle down: it is about time that girls all the way across India, from Mumbai shanties to the parched fields of Bihar, were encouraged to pick up a bat in the same way as their brothers are. A nation of millions of girls, all playing cricket? That’s the real way to build a cricketing dynasty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alyssa Healy’s sidelost against South Africain a T20 World Cup semi-final last year and three months later whitewashed England 16-0 in the Ashes.South Africa, too, will fight on. “We’re the team that consistently is making finals now,” their captain, Laura Wolvaardt, said. “I’m really proud that we were able to reach three in a row. Hopefully, we can keep reaching finals and one day we can win one.”What of Kaur’s India? They have ambition. That was made clear on their tour of England in July, when they sealed theirfirst ever T20 series victoryin Manchester and Radha Yadav told the media that her team were “going to dominate, no matter what – we want to create something big”. But while winning a World Cup is big, changing an unequal society is even bigger.

And the style of his win was equally memorable. Punters who backed the proven Group One form of Minnie Hauk and Rebel’s Romance might beg to differ, but it gladdened the heart to see anEbor Handicap winnerleave the pair of them standing with a stretch run for the ages.Gezora wins Breeders’ Cup 2025 after Ethical Diamond’s triumph for Willie MullinsRead moreMullins was, momentarily at least, lost for words after Ethical Diamond and Dylan Browne McMonagle powered across the line. “Wow,” he said. “Wow, wow, wow, wow.” But he recovered his composure in time for the post-race press conference, where Mullins explained that had it not been for the strict veterinary rules attached to runners in theMelbourne Cup, Ethical Diamond would not have been within a thousand miles of southern California.View image in fullscreenEthical Diamond wins the Breeders’ Cup Turf Del Mar.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock“It was only a very last-minute plan after winning the Ebor,” Mullins said, “when we knew we couldn’t get down to Australia with him, and we thought, let’s have a go at this race. David Casey, my assistant, came up with the plan. He said: ‘Look, the mile-and-a-half there, he’s good enough to run in and take a shot.’ You can’t win these races unless you’re in them. That’s always been my policy, have a go.”Ethical Diamond had a screw inserted into one of his legs earlier in his career to aid his recovery from an injury, which is far from uncommon. It is enough tostop him running in a Melbourne Cup, however, regardless of the fact that he has run multiple times since, on the Flat and over hurdles, and won demanding staying events such as the Ebor.View image in fullscreenHorses and jockeys make their way from the paddock to the track at Del Mar on Breeders’ Cup weekend.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APThe Australian rules were introduced after a series of fatal injuries in the Melbourne Cup, including an injury suffered by Anthony Van Dyck, the 2019 Derby winner, in the Cupa year later. It still feels odd, however, that one set of vets can effectively bar a horse from a race as the result of a procedure recommended by a different set of vets to aid the same horse’s recovery.Mullins was on a plane to Australia a few hours after Saturday’s race, and scheduled to arrive in Melbourne on Monday to see Absurde, who runs in the same colours as Ethical Diamond, line up for the Melbourne Cup the following day. Absurde is priced up at around 18-1 with the local bookies and has a decent draw in stall four so – assuming he passes the vets – an outrageous, unprecedented across-the-continents double is still a live possibility.Japan’s racing industry was the other big winner on Saturday, and perhaps not before time in the case of Forever Young, the first ever Japanese-trained winner of the Breeders’ Cup Classic. The four-year-old was leant on for much of the straight in the Kentucky Derby in 2024 and was still less than a quarter-length behind the winner, and he reversed the form of last year’s Classic, when he was third behind Sierra Leone and Fierceness, in convincing fashion.View image in fullscreenRyusei Sakai rides Forever Young (No 5) to victory in the Breeders’ Cup Classic.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APBetween them, Ethical Diamond and Forever Young were the key winners on Saturday, horses that deviated from the norm and set the crowd abuzz. Frankie Dettori’s farewell to the meeting, meanwhile, went largely unnoticed, because his rides – with the honourable exception of Khaadem in the Turf Sprint, who finished third – were not good enough. The one significant disappointment for the Europeans was the news on Sunday morning that She’s Quality, third home in the Prix de l’Abbaye in October, died overnight at a local equine hospital after suffering a pelvic injury in Saturday’s Turf Sprint.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added that countries with high inequality were seven times more likely to experience democratic decline than more equal countries.Ramaphosa said the report by an “extraordinary committee of independent experts” had provided a “blueprint for greater equality” that supported South Africa’s G20 plan “to put inequality on the international agenda”.Without endorsing the need for a high-level panel of experts to monitor the gap between rich and poor, he said: “Inequality is a betrayal of people’s dignity, an impediment to inclusive growth and a threat to democracy itself. Addressing inequality is our inescapable generational challenge. This report lays out prudent and pragmatic steps we can take to reduce it.”The G20 was established after the 2008 banking crash to be a more representative group of the G7 group of the world’s richest nations. It includes Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Africa and the UK.Campaigners expect several G20 countries will back the demand for a panel to monitorinequality, including Germany, before the ministerial meeting on 22 November.Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University and the chair of the independent experts, said the committee’s main recommendation was for the G20 to establish a permanent panel that “would monitor trends and assess its consequences and evaluate alternative policies for addressing it, to inform governments, policymakers, and the international community”.Stiglitz said studies have shown a widening gap between rich and poor undermines democratic institutions and fuels populism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was acquitted over the alleged theft because of a lack of proof, Duffau said on Monday.TheForeign, Commonwealth and Development Officesaid at the time that Lammy and his spouse were victims in the case and denied that the Labour MP for Tottenham had refused to pay the driver.Lammy and Mimun both filed complaints but only the justice secretary’s was deemed substantial and the Frenchman wascharged with “theft of cash and personal belongings”.The driver had claimed to French media that Lammy became “aggressive” when asked to pay €700 (£590) of the €1,550 bill, the remainder of which was to be paid by the booking service.The fee was paid upfront to the transfer service but Mimun insisted he was owed money on arrival and that he needed to be paid in cash, a source said at the time.The MP and his wife had been in Italy tojoin King Charles on a state visitbefore heading to the French Alps for a private holiday.Lammy was foreign secretary at the time of the incident and wasnamed justice secretary and deputy prime minister in Septemberas part of Keir Starmer’s reshuffle.Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyFranceEuropeForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

These records have since been released by the National Archives after a delay.Wormald set out the due diligence process involved in Mandelson’s appointment, starting with the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics report, followed by a conflict of interest declaration and in-depth national security vetting carried out on behalf of the Foreign Office.The department haspreviously admittedthat Mandelson’s appointment was announced before that developed vetting process was complete.Oliver Robbins, the permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, said Mandelson was no longer on the government payroll and that the process of terminating his civil service employment was complete. He declined to reveal whether Mandelson had received a severance package.Asked whether the Foreign Office had had a different preferred candidate for US ambassador before the appointment, Robbins said: “At the time we’re describing, it was clear that the prime minister wanted to make this appointment himself and therefore I understand that the FCDO was informed of his decision and acted upon it.“In this particular case the prime minister took advice and formed a view himself and we then acted on that view.”Mandelson wassacked last monthover a tranche of leaked emails in which he expressed his love and support for Epstein and urged him to “fight for early release” in 2008 while the financier was facing charges ofsoliciting sex from minors.Wormald said it was the publication of the “new and previously unknown emails that led to the decision to withdraw the ambassador to Washington”. He said the emails were “gamechanging in terms of what was known”.Wormald and Robbins admitted that Starmerwas not informedabout the contents of Mandelson’s emails before the session of prime minister’s questions when he expressed his full support for him as ambassador.Robbins said that after being contacted by Bloomberg about the emails, officials asked Mandelson a series of questions as they sought to confirm their veracity without yet involving ministers. At that stage Starmer was told only that there was a media inquiry that was being looked into. Bloomberg published the full set of emails later on Wednesday, after he had given Mandelson his backing.Robbins argued that although it “may sound naive” with hindsight, Mandelson was in “an extremely exposed position” and was an employee to whom the department “owed a duty of care”.The government has set out new guidance for politically appointed ambassadors intended to avoid a repeat of the Mandelson scandal. The updated guidelines state that candidates directly appointed by ministers outside the civil service system should undergo a pre-appointment interview with a senior official and an informal “fireside chat” with the minister in charge.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Criteria included whether or not a project demonstrated meaningful participation from workers, women and affected communities; promoted systemic shifts away from fossil fuels and highly polluting industrial agriculture; incorporated plans for re-skilling or livelihood support; and addressed inequality.“Basically, we tried to say, is this project genuinely just, in terms of its impact on workers, on women, communities, and then, does it genuinely help with a transition?” said Anderson.Just one in 50 of the approved projects met the just-transition qualifications, the authors found – a “jaw-droppingly” low figure, they wrote.Bert De Wel, global climate policy coordinator at the International Trade Union Confederation, who did not work on the report, said the data “confirms what workers and their unions are seeing in many places: climate finance is determined by the needs of the investors instead of the people affected by the emergency.”“We’re surprised nevertheless that the amounts are so low,” he said. “It goes against all the good intentions and promises of the funders. It also goes against common sense, as we know that climate policies urgently need to connect much better with the needs of workers, their families and communities.”When ActionAid considered the sums spent on each project, they found that only $1 of every $35 was spent on just transition-aligned projects. Those schemes received just $630m over more than a decade, which is less than the amount that the tech billionaire Jeff Bezos has shelled out for his superyacht, the report notes.“Barely any climate finance is going to support workers and communities to undertake just transitions,” it says. “This is absurd.”The lack of consideration for workers and communities poses not only ethical questions for climate action, but also practical ones, said Anderson. She recalledone programin Bangladesh, for which developersdid not consult with stakeholders. The scheme encouraged Bangladeshi farmers to plant mango crops instead of methane-heavy rice. But it was designed with input from only landowning farmers, without consulting seasonal workers or the mostly women workers who made money by processing rice into local food items.“The project didn’t map all the people that were directly or indirectly involved with those farming activities,” she said.Had they consulted workers, the developers might have also realized that because mangoes only have one harvest a year – rice has three – the project would not be economically viable “before it turned out to be an economic disaster”, she added.The forthcoming UN climate talks, said Anderson, will provide the opportunity to remedy these trends. This year, Brazilian officials have identifiedjust-transition approachesas a priority for the negotiations, known this year as Cop30.A banner demand from activists at the conference will be for negotiators to flesh out the details of the “just transition work programme”, which was launched at the 2022 Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, but on which progress has stalled.AtCop30, civil society groups will demand countries agree to a new “Belém Action Mechanism” under the program to flesh out actionable, specific plans to boost finance for just transition-aligned projects. That would shift “justice from the margins to the heart of the climate agenda,” Anabella Rosemberg, senior advisor on just transition at the international climate nonprofit Climate Action Network, who called the new data “shocking.”ActionAid is also calling for wealthy nations to commit trillions of dollars annually in grant-based climate finance for global south countries to smoothly and equitably phase out polluting sectors. And the group demanded the Green Climate Fund overhaul its principles to ensure projects focus more on labor and justice.No high-level US representatives will go to UN climate talks, Trump officials sayRead moreThe Climate Investment Funds, on the other hand, should be “sunset”, the report says. While the Green Climate Fund is governed by nations who are party to the UN climate body and are therefore subject to democracy, the Climate Investment Funds are operated by the World Bank, which means they are largely controlled by the global north, said Anderson.The Climate Investment Funds were designed with a “sunset clause”, stating they would be wound down when a “new global climate‑finance architecture” was operational.“Given the Green Climate Fund has now been distributing money for nearly a decade, the Climate Investment Funds have long overstayed their welcome,” said Anderson.Right now, international climate negotiators seem to see just transition-focused considerations as an “optional or nice-to-have” aspect of climate action, said Anderson.“We’ll hear arguments like, we don’t have time, we don’t have money to spare, so let’s just cut to the chase and focus on carbon,” she said. “But really, shortcuts that leave justice out make the journey longer because they prevent people from getting onboard.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCop30newsShareReuse this content"

Without drastic global cuts to emissions and deforestation, acollapse of the Amazon rainforestcould be locked in within the next 10 to 20 years.Throughout the 90s and 00s, Exxon helped fund and lead a constellation of US-based organisations that sought to discredit climate science and block America’s participation in a UN-led climate treaty – a campaign that is now the subject ofdozens of lawsuitsaccusing the company of lying to the public about the climate emergency.But by 1997, Exxon was “comfortable with the support we provide to US-based organisations and on US-related issues”. It asked Atlas Network for help “in nurturing free-market thinktanks outside the United States”, particularly in Asia, the former Soviet Union, Europe and Latin America.The following year, Exxon sent a $50,000 check to Atlas Network – which adjusted for inflation would be roughly $100,000 today. The oil company’s goal was to grow “international groups which have the ability to influence government policies”.Atlas Network later reported back that its partners in Latin America had produced a Spanish translation of a booklet byFred Singerentitled “The Scientific Case Against the Global Climate Treaty” which claimed “there is no significant scientific support for a global ‘threat’ of climate warming”.Atlas Network partners, including the Argentine thinktank Fundación República para una Nueva Generación and the Brazilian thinktank Instituto Liberal, led and participated in seminars in Argentina on the eve of the Cop4 climate talks in Buenos Aires.At least one event featured the now-deceased US climate denierPatrick Michaels, who had referred to climate change as “hysteria”. Atlas Network had aimed to introduce Michaels and other American speakers to “ministers, politicians, editorial boards [and] business leaders”.Is Shell to blame for a ‘super typhoon’? Philippines survivors to sue oil giant in legal firstRead moreAtlas facilitated translating Singer’s booklet into Chinese, as well as organising meetings between an India-based thinktank called Liberty Institute and US rightwing groups that have disputed the scientific consensus on climate change, including theHeritage Foundationand theCato Institute.Summarising its activities in a 1998 letter to its donor, Atlas Network reported that “few of these accomplishments would have been possible without Exxon Corporation’s generous financial assistance”. Exxon stressed that it did not want to be identified publicly.“The approach has been behind-the-scenes, intentionally not seeking public kudos for its efforts,” Atlas wrote in notes summarising a meeting with Exxon executives in 2000. “The objective is to help, but not be known for its help.”Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsClimate crisisEnergyExxonMobilOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The new inspection framework will launch on 10 November as planned.The NAHT had asked the judge to temporarily suspend the rollout of the new grading system, pending a full hearing of the challenge. Saini said he would have refused an interim injunction on public interest grounds “had the issue arisen”.The schools inspectorate has been embroiled in controversy since the 2023 death by suicide of the Reading headteacher Ruth Perry, with a coroner finding that an Ofsted inspection contributed to her death.It prompted the scrapping of controversial one-word overall judgments, such as “outstanding” or “inadequate”. After a lengthy consultation that drew 6,500 responses, Ofsted came up with a new colour-coded “report card”, which grades six inspection areas on a five-point scale.The NAHT’s general secretary, Paul Whiteman, said the union was considering an appeal. “It is disappointing that the decision today was made to decline our request for a judicial review, but this case was always being brought forward on a very narrow point of law relating to the validity of Ofsted’s consultation process for their new framework.He added: “The decision today doesn’t detract from our valid and reasonable concern about the damage to the mental health and wellbeing of school leaders and staff of the new report cards.“Both Ofsted and the government have failed to address the very real risk posed by the new framework to school leaders. It is a fundamental responsibility of a trade union to protect its members. We will now consider an appeal and will be consulting our members about the possibility of moving to industrial action.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Parents and carers, however, preferred some form of grading or scaling. Ofsted hopes to have combined both.Welcoming the judge’s decision, the chief inspector of schools, Martyn Oliver, said: “The changes will be better for parents, giving them more detailed and useful information about their child’s school, nursery or college. And, crucially, they will be better for children and older learners – helping to raise standards of education for all, particularly those who are disadvantaged or vulnerable.“I have every confidence that headteachers will recognise the changes are fair, that inspection takes staff wellbeing fully into account, and that the whole experience is collaborative and constructive. We will continue to engage constructively with all representative bodies as we roll out our reforms.”Explore more on these topicsOfstedTeachingSchoolsEnglandTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

After nearly 20 years there, Gow moved to the Guardian in 1989.He was briefly education editor before going to Bonn to cover, for nearly six years, one of the most momentous periods in Germany’s postwar history, including its rebirth as a single nation with the reunification of east and west Germanyin 1990.Gow, who studied modern languages at Oxford and spoke fluent French and German, then moved to the business and industry desk in London before heading to Brussels as European business correspondent, where he stayed until he retired in 2012.“David was an impressively professional journalist, the sort of versatile, reliable correspondent who never let you down and would get his teeth into a breaking story with speed and skill,” said Simon Tisdall, a former Guardian foreign editor.“He was very knowledgable indeed about European affairs. But it wasn’t just the politics. He was also expert on the history and culture of the countries and movements he wrote about – and as a colleague, a pleasure to work with.”View image in fullscreenGow at the TUC conference in Brighton in 1999 alongside the then Labour MP Peter Hain.Photograph: Martin Argles/The GuardianA convinced – though never starry-eyed – European since before the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, Gow took Brexit almost as a personal affront. He continued writing for numerous continental thinktanks and publications after leaving the Guardian.Henning Meyer, the chief executive and editor-in-chief of the progressive debate platform Social Europe, for which Gow was for many years a contributor, editor and senior adviser, said: “We are incredibly saddened to learn of David Gow’s passing.“Until his death, David was instrumental not only in shaping European intellectual debate but also in defining the direction of the Social Europe platform itself. He will be profoundly missed. Our deepest condolences go out to his wife and family.”Gow also worked as a consultant editor for the Jacques Delors Centre in Berlin, and was a leading light in the pressure group European Movement in Scotland (EMiS), where he settled – in the city of his birth, Edinburgh – with his second wife, Gayle, after retirement.EMiS said Gow had “a great hinterland of knowledge, the journalist’s ability to make the complex simple and to interpret with great clarity the political tides and eddies of our time. He was thoughtful, engaging and helpful to many.”It said he was “an ever-dependable adviser and the best of company. We shall miss him as a friend, and as a man in the great Scottish tradition of the democratic intellect.”In 2023, Gow was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for his contribution to journalism and public understanding of European affairs. The RSE’s president, Anton Muscatelli, said Gow would be remembered “for his warmth, charm and commitment to open, informed dialogue”.He brought “real energy and insight to the society’s work”, including through his leadership of a Scotland-Europe initiative, Muscatelli said. “He was a friend and present in so many of the spaces for public debate in Scotland.”Gow was equally committed to the labour movement and to social justice. He served on the national executive council of the National Union of Journalists, whose general secretary, Laura Davison, said the union’s thoughts were with his family.View image in fullscreenGow was described as knowledgable on a vast array of topics.Photograph: family“He adored them and they were justifiably proud of his record in journalism, and of his commitment to the labour movement – not least the NUJ,” Davison said. “David was an old-school journalist, insistent on maintaining the highest ethical standards.“He was forthright and firm in his views. But my memory of him will be his courtesy and respectful manner in debate. We have lost a good friend, and a loyal member.”Séamus Dooley, the NUJ’s assistant general secretary, said Gow “understood the difference between scepticism and cynicism. He was always ready to question and challenge the perceived wisdom or a political consensus, not least in economics.”Christine Buckley, the editor of the NUJ magazine the Journalist, who knew Gow from her time as business and industry correspondent at the Times, said he was “a class act: indefatigable, zero tolerance for nonsense – and a strong belief in fairness”.Knowledgable and witty on a vast array of topics, Gow was also a passionate gardener, at his cottage in Aumelas in the south of France and then at the lodge he bought in St Fillans, Perthshire.He is survived by his wife, Gayle; by Gemma, his daughter with his first wife, Sue, who died of cancer in 2001; and by three grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and his brother, Rod.Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianNewspapersNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

It said it was a crucial tool to influence policy, though the group hassince changed its tactics to stop high-profile stunts.Dan Jarvis, the security minister, said the level of abuse faced by politicians was “truly shocking – it’s a threat to our democracy. People should be able to participate in our politics without fearing for their own or their family’s safety.“When good people choose not to put themselves forward, communities lose out and the country is poorer for it.”Jarvis said the measure was “a serious but necessary and proportionate step. Targeting public office holders at their homes crosses a line – it’s intimidation, not protest, and we’re putting a stop to it.”The change has been backed by the Jo Cox Foundation, set up in the name of the murdered Labour MP who was attacked outside her constituency surgery by a far-right terrorist.“Protest and robust debate are important to our democracy, and there are many ways that people can make their voices heard without crossing the line into intimidation at someone’s home,” the organisation said.Starmer was understood to have been furious about Gaza protests outside his north London home byYouth Demandwhen he was leader of the opposition. The group placed children’s shoes outside his door while demanding further opposition from Labour to arms sales to Israel.Three people were charged under section 42 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which already covers harassment at a home address. Protesters were also arrested for targeting the constituency home of Rishi Sunak.Home Office sources said the amendment would expand the scope of police powers to cover a wider range of behaviours and to give clarity to officers.Some MPs have previously complained that police have taken a laxer approach to protests outside their family homes, including when children were present. The former chair of the defence select committee Tobias Ellwood was targeted by dozens of pro-Gaza protesters at his home in Bournemouth, calling him complicit in genocide.The former Conservative MP Mike Freer said last year he was stepping down as an MPbecause of the repeated targeting of his constituency office, including in an arson attack.The Labour MP Stella Creasy has also condemned the targeting of MPs at their homes, having beenthe target of anti-abortion protestersin her Walthamstow constituency.Youth Demand recently staged a protest with body bags outside the home of David Lammy, when he was the foreign secretary. They said the government was “allowing Israel to murder children en masse”.The amendment excludes official residences – so would allow protests outside Downing Street or grace-and-favour homes for the prime minister or other ministers such as Chequers or Dorneywood.Explore more on these topicsProtestEnglandWalesActivismnewsShareReuse this content"

The government department is thought to be considering if there has been a breach of the legislation.The title’s former editor Charles Moore disclosed in his Telegraph column last month that inquiries by the paper’s journalists into RedBird Capital’s bid had prompted Cardinale to“threaten he would go to war with our entire newsroom”.Moore added there had been “apparent media briefings” that Evans would be removed and replaced as editor – although that was followed up by a column the Telegraph published by Cardinale last week.In it, the private equity boss said: “We won’t ever compromise theeditorial independence of the Telegraph. At RedBird, we are very clear about one fundamental premise: don’t invest in a newspaper if you want to influence it – that will kill the investment thesis and is just bad business.”Last year the government introduced astatutory instrument compelling partiesto “take all reasonable steps to retain key staff within the Telegraph Media Group business and to ensure that no key staff are removed from their position”.The order added: “At all times, the … acquiring entities must keep the secretary of state informed of any material developments relating to the Telegraph Media Group business, which includes details of key staff who leave or join the Telegraph Media Group business.”The referral to the culture department follows yet another eventful few weeks in the saga of the acquisition of the Telegraph, which has come under scrutiny as the initial acquisition was funded by foreign state interests. Last week the newspaperlinked its presumed new owner to the suspected ringleaderof the alleged Chinese spy ring in Westminster.The Telegraph’s future has been uncertain since the Barclay familylost its grip on the media group in 2023in a row about unpaid debts. An organisation connected to Redbird Capital, called Redbird IMI,took controlof the newspaper titles later that year.However, RedBird IMI was forced to put the papers up for sale in spring 2024 after the then Conservative government passed a law blocking foreign states or associated individualsfrom owning newspaper assets in the UK. Redbird IMI is in the process of selling TMG to RedBird Capital – which holds various investments, including astake in the parent companyof Liverpool football club.While a quarter of RedBird IMI’s funding came from RedBird Capital, the remainder wassourced from International Media Investments(IMI), which is controlled by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates and owner of Manchester City FC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So when will power bills stop rising?Read moreThe solar sharer scheme would be implemented through a change to the default market offer that sets the maximum price retailers can charge customers for electricity in parts of the country. The climate change and energy minister,Chris Bowen, said the program would ensure “every last ray of sunshine was powering our homes” instead of some solar energy being wasted.Australians have installed more than 4m solar systems and there is regularly cheap excess generation in the middle of the day. Part of the rationale for the program is that it could shift demand for electricity from peak times – particularly early in the evening – to when it is sunniest.This could help minimise peak electricity prices and reduce the need for network upgrades and intervention to ensure the power grid was stable.The announcement comes as the Albanese government faces criticism over increases in electricity prices. Critics have linked this to the rise of solar and wind –largely erroneously.Bowen said the new offer showed that free solar energy in the day was “proof that what’s good for the planet is good for your pocket”.“People who are able to move electricity use into the zero cost power period will benefit directly, whether they have solar panels or not and whether they own or rent. And the more people [who] take up the offer and move their use, the greater the system benefits that lower costs for all electricity users will be,” he said.Bowen said the AustralianEnergyRegulator would oversee the change to ensure households “get a fair deal” outside the free power period. He said the government would consult with states not covered by the default market operator to potentially extend the offer after next year.Cop out? Anthony Albanese wants to host the next global climate summit – so why isn’t he attending this one?Read moreSome retailers, including AGL and Red Energy, already offer periods of free solar energy to their customers. But the Australian Energy Council, representing generators and retailers, said it was disappointed by the lack of consultation before the announcement.The council’s chief executive, Louisa Kinnear, said the announcement without notice risked “damaging industry confidence, as well as creating the potential for unintended consequences”. They could include some businesses “exiting a market”.“While it is positive that the government recognises that customers are benefiting from innovative products our members are offering, failing to consult with the industry prior to making announcements such as this could have an enduring impact on product innovation that can further support the energy transition and customers,” she said.The Smart Energy Council, whose members include solar installers, said the offer was “good news for Australian households struggling with the cost of living”. The council’s chief advocacy officer, David McElrea, said the program would “actually help people get access to free power, because the sun doesn’t send you a bill”.Explore more on these topicsEnergyChris BowenLabor partySolar powerRenewable energyAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Banks died of complications from renal neoplasm, or kidney cancer, said Montgomery county coroner Dr Janine Darby.Banks had been in prison since 1982 after shooting 14 people, and killing 13, including his own children, during a rampage in Wilkes-Barre. At time, it was considered one of the worst mass murders in American history. He was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and one count of third-degree murder.Banks had been drinking at a party late at night before using an AR-15 rifle to start the rampage at his home.Five victims were his children, ages one to six. Four more were the mothers of his children. Other victims were bystanders, including an 11-year-old child who sometimes stayed with his family, a seven-year-old child and a teenager who saw Banks leaving his home armed with the rifle and recognized him.Banks killed three women and five children at his home, authorities say. Then, dressed in green army fatigues with an ammunition bandolier around his chest and shoulders, Banks left, when he saw four teenagers walking to their car from a nearby friend’s house. He shot one fatally, and another, who survived, authorities say.He stole a car and went to the Heather Highlands trailer park, where police found the bodies of Banks’s son and the child’s mother, as well as her mother and her nephew.From there, Banks went to his mother’s house, who told police that Banks told her: “I killed them. I killed them all,” court records say.Banks eventually surrendered after a four-hour standoff at a friend’s house after police tried to convince him that his victims had survived.Eventually, state courts prevented his execution, saying he wasn’t mentally competent. That left Banks with a sentence of life imprisonment.The teenager who survived being shot by Banks, Jim Olson, later expressed frustration in 2012 that Banks had not been executed, saying: “What is the sense of having a death penalty if you don’t use it or enforce it?″Defense lawyers had argued that Banks was insane when he went on the shooting spree.After his arrest, Banks, who is biracial, claimed he had killed his children to save them from the pain of growing up in a racist society. During his trial, he overruled his lawyer on strategic decisions, and argued instead that prosecutors, the judge and the mayor of Wilkes-Barre were conspiring against him.Banks also showed the jury gory pictures of his victims, even after his lawyer had successfully gotten the photos barred on the grounds that they were gruesome and prejudicial.Explore more on these topicsUS crimePennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

The news was announced in a statement shared by her daughter, Oscar-winning actorLaura Dern.Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore at 50: Scorsese’s low-key, high-impact 70s dramaRead moreDern, who starred with her mother in a number of films including David Lynch’s Wild at Heart – where they played mother and daughter – and Rambling Rose, called her “my amazing hero and my profound gift of a mother”, writing that she was at her bedside as she died.“She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,” she wrote. We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.”Her ex-husband, the actor Bruce Dern,told the Hollywood Reporter: “Diane was a tremendous actress and I feel like a bit of a ‘hidden treasure’ until she ran into David Lynch. When he cast her as Laura’s mom in Wild at Heart, it felt like the world then really understood her brilliance.“She lived a good life. She saw everything the way it was. She was a great teammate to her fellow actors. She was funny, clever, gracious. But most importantly to me, she was a wonderful mother to our incredible wunderkind daughter. And for that I will be forever grateful to her.”Ladd’s early career saw small roles in TV shows such as Perry Mason, The Fugitive and Gunsmoke while the 1970s saw her starring alongside Jack Nicholson in Chinatown.In the same year, 1974, she shared the screen with Ellen Burstyn in Martin Scorsese’s acclaimed comedy drama Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. The performance landed Ladd her first Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.View image in fullscreenDiane Ladd and Ellen Burstyn in Alice Doesn’t Live Here AnymorePhotograph: Warner BrosIn the 1980s, she appeared in crime thriller Black Widow and comedy sequel National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation while also joining Alice, a sitcom based on Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.In the following decade, she received another best supporting actress Oscar nomination for her role in Wild at Heart. The following year she received another nomination for her role in Rambling Rose, which also starred Dern.“This was the picture that the late Princess Diana chose as her absolutely favorite, and she flew Laura and I to London for a royal premiere and a party in our honor,” Ladd said of Rambling Rose ina later interview. “And she sat between us, holding both our hands, and crying, watching us perform.”The 1990s also saw roles in comedy Cemetery Club reuniting her with Burstyn, Primary Colors, a political comedy, with John Travolta and Alexander Payne’s Citizen Ruth where she played Dern’s mother again. The decade also saw her score Emmy nominations for work inDr Quinn, Medicine Woman, Grace Under Fire and Touched by an Angel.She continued to star with her daughter in comedy drama Daddy and Them, David Lynch’s Inland Empire and Mike White’s dark comedy series Enlightened. She also appeared alongside Sandra Bullock in 28 Days, Anthony Hopkins in The World’s Fastest Indian and Jennifer Lawrence in Joy.Her later TV roles included Ray Donovan and Young Sheldon.Ladd also wrote and directed the comedy film Mrs Munck which starred herself and ex-husband Bruce Dern, who she married in 1960 and divorced in 1969. “Bruce is a great actor,”she said in an interview. “I’m privileged to have directed him in a movie. In fact, I’m the only woman in history to direct her ex-husband. I make a joke: ‘I say ladies, if you want revenge, direct your ex-husband.’ But I’m only kidding.”Ladd was also the third cousin of Tennessee Williams, who she called “a great influence on my life”.In 2018, Ladd was misdiagnosed with lung disease and told she had just six months to live but made a full recovery after her daughter transferred her to a different hospital.“If you can take your pain and not let it back up like a sore or something, instead use it to explore, to make the path clearer for yourself and others, then you are winning,”Ladd said in 2023.Explore more on these topicsFilmLaura DernnewsShareReuse this content"

These warnings all follow the same basic pattern: a warning about profits, caveated with the risk to the market of lenders withdrawing their products and hitting consumer choice.”Banks are due to pay out £700 per claim on average under the FCA’s proposals, which the APPG says is far less than the £1,500 average payout that some could receive by taking their cases to court.However, banks and the FCA have warned that borrowers who use claims firms to take their cases to court may end uplosing up to 30%of their compensation in legal fees.Lenders and lobby groups have for months warned that a massive bill could deter investors, force some lenders to fold, or raise borrowing costs for consumers as lenders try to recoup their costs.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, attempted to intervene in a landmark supreme court hearing in January when she urged judges to avoid handing “windfall” compensation to borrowers.At that point, lenders including Lloyds, Barclays, Close Brothers and the financial arms of manufacturers such as Ford were steeling themselves for a compensation bill worth up to £44bn. A supreme court case in August brought further clarity and significantly brought down the regulator’s estimates of the potential compensation bill.Lenders have continued to lobby against the £11bn bill, which accounts for administrative costs. Last week Santander UK’s chief executive, Mike Regnier, called for further interventions by ministers, claiming the FCA’s current proposals could end up inflicting“significant” harmto consumers, jobs and the broader economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We recognise that there will be a wide range of views on the scheme and not everyone will get everything they would like. But we want to work together on the best possible scheme and draw a line under this issue quickly.“That certainty is vital, so a trusted motor finance market can continue to serve millions of families every year.”The Financing and Leasing Association was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFinancial Conduct AuthorityMotor financeRegulatorsBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

The problem was, as Prof Evans discovered when he logged on to check his own entry, all these facts were false.It was part of a choppy start for humanity’s latest attempt to corral the sum of human knowledge or, as Musk put it, create a compendium of “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth” – all revealed through the magic of his Grok artificial intelligence model.When the multibillionaireswitchedon Grokipedia on Tuesday, he said it was “better than Wikipedia”, or “Wokepedia” as his supporters call it, reflecting a view that the dominant online encyclopedia often reflects leftwing talking points. One post on X caught the triumphant mood among Musk’s fans: “Elon just killed Wikipedia. Good riddance.”Elon Musk launches encyclopedia ‘fact-checked’ by AI and aligning with rightwing viewsRead moreBut users found Grokipedia lifted large chunks from the website it intended to usurp, contained numerous factual errors and seemed to promote Musk’s favoured rightwing talking points. In between posts on X promoting his creation, Musk this week declared “civil war in Britain is inevitable”, called for the English “to ally with the hard men” such as the far-right agitator Tommy Robinson, and said only the far-right AfD party could “save Germany”.Musk was so enamoured of his AI-encyclopedia he said he planned to one day etch the “comprehensive collection of all knowledge” into a stable oxide and “place copies … in orbit, the moon and Mars to preserve it for the future”.Evans, however, was discovering that Musk’s use of AI to weigh and check facts was suffering a more earth-bound problem. “Chatroom contributions are given equal status with serious academic work,” Evans, an expert on the Third Reich, told the Guardian, after being invited to test out Grokipedia. “AI just hoovers up everything.”View image in fullscreenRichard Evans said Grokipedia’s entry for Albert Speer (pictured on Hitler’s left) repeated lies and distortions spread by the Nazi munitions minister himself.Photograph: Picture libraryHe noted its entry for Albert Speer, Hitler’s architect and wartime munitions minister, repeated lies and distortions spread by Speer even though they had been corrected in a 2017 award-winning biography. The site’s entry on the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, whose biography Evans wrote, claimed wrongly he experienced German hyperinflation in 1923, that he was an officer in the Royal Corps of Signals and didn’t mention that he had been married twice, Evans said.The problem, said David Larsson Heidenblad, the deputy director of theLund Centre for the History of Knowledgein Sweden, was a clash of knowledge cultures.“We live in a moment where there is a growing belief that algorithmic aggregation is more trustworthy than human-to-human insight,” Heidenblad said. “The Silicon Valley mindset is very different from the traditional scholarly approach. Its knowledge culture is very iterative where making mistakes is a feature, not a bug. By contrast, the academic world is about building trust over time and scholarship over long periods during which the illusion that you know everything cracks. Those are real knowledge processes.”Grokipedia’s arrival continues a centuries-old encyclopedia tradition from the 15th-century Chinese Yongle scrolls to the Encyclopédie, an engine for spreading controversial enlightenment views in 18th-century France. These were followed by the anglophone-centric Encyclopedia Britannica and, since 2001, the crowd-sourcedWikipedia. But Grokipedia is the first to be largely created by AI and this week a question swirled: who controls the truth when AIs, steered by powerful individuals, are holding the pen?“If it’s Musk doing it then I am afraid of political manipulation,” said the cultural historian Peter Burke, emeritus professor at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, who in 2000 wroteA Social History of Knowledgesince the time of Johannes Gutenberg’s 15th-century printing press.“I am sure some of it will be overt to some readers, but the problem may be that other readers may miss it,” Burke said. The anonymity of many encyclopedia entries often gave them “an air of authority it shouldn’t have”, he added.Andrew Dudfield, the head of AI at Full Fact, a UK-based factchecking organisation, said: “We really have to consider whether an AI-generated encyclopedia – a facsimile of reality, run through a filter – is a better proposition than any of the previous things that we have. It doesn’t display the same transparency but it is asking for the same trust. It is not clear how far the human hand is involved, how far it is AI=generated and what content the AI was trained on. It is hard to place trust in something when you can’t see how those choices are made.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those are his hands you see in the film. I could never have ripped my face off with the same joie de vivre’Interviews byChris BroughtonMon 3 Nov 2025 10.19 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 16.46 ESTShareJoBeth Williams, played Diane FreelingWhen my agent said, “We have a script called Poltergeist”, my response was: “Is it horror? I’m not interested.” Then he said: “Well,Steven Spielbergis producing.” So I read the script, which Spielberg had also written, and loved the family in it, and the fact that there were so many strong female characters: Diane, Dr Lesh, Tangina the psychic. Zelda Rubinstein, who played Tangina, was a dynamo. Spielberg was busy prepping ET, so even though he was often on set, Tobe Hooper, who made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, directed. I’d never seen that because when it comes to horror, I’m a nervous Nellie.We’d all do improv to give the sense of a real family life – sometimes they’d just roll a camera while we were chatting and telling jokes. Craig T Nelson, who played my husband, had been a standup. Where we’re smoking pot in the bedroom, he improvised the “before/after/before” routine with his stomach. Little Heather O’Rourke, who played my youngest daughter, Carol Anne, was just five at the time, but very intuitive. If I cried in a scene, she’d cry too. When we were covered in cold goop, she was shivering and shaking but never complained. She was such a trooper.Early in the film, the camera follows Diane across the kitchen after she’s juststraightened some chairs. When she turns back, they’ve been silently stacked on the table, impossibly fast. It was all done in one uninterrupted take, with crew members rushing on while out of shot to remove one set of chairs and put the pre-stacked tower in place. They were like a herd of elephants – the sound was re-dubbed afterwards. My biggest problem was trying to keep a straight face.Later, I get dragged across the bed, up the wall and across the ceiling by an invisible force. That was filmed on a rotating set called a gimbal, like the one that allowedFred Astaire to dance on the ceiling in Royal Wedding. The cameraman, Dennis, was strapped to the set and had to go round and round like he was on a ferris wheel. After a few takes, bless his heart, he had to get off, because he was nauseous.Theskeletonsthat surround Diane after she falls into the pool were all real – though I didn’t learn that until I ran into one of the special effects guys later. I’d have been even more disgusted had I realised they weren’t just props, but at the time I was more concerned about the lights and the huge fans creating the wind effect. I was terrified one would fall into the water and electrocute me. Spielberg actually waded in up to his waist and said: “If you get electrocuted, it’ll kill me, too.” That was reassuring.Martin Casella, played Dr Marty CaseyPoltergeist was my first movie and I got to act withBeatrice Straight, who I worshipped. She’s exquisite in the role of Dr Lesh, the parapsychologist who investigates the house. Richard Lawson and I played her assistants and I guess it’s because my character is the sceptical one that, as Tobe put it, the house hates me.The steak Marty sees crawling along a kitchen countertop like an inchworm was operated by a guy underneath poking a couple of chopsticks up through a track disguised as the grouting between the tiles. When Marty throws the chicken leg he’s eating on the floor in disgust and we see it covered in maggots, there were handlers on set to scoop them up and ensure none of them came to harm.They made a complete upper-body dummy of me for the moment Marty hallucinates clawing off his own face in the bathroom mirror. I asked how much it cost and they said: “Oh, the wig alone was $10,000.” Remember, this was 1981. This would be a one-take, unrepeatable shot, with me reaching up from under the dummy and tearing away its cheeks to release the semi-set jello and pockets of blood underneath. I thought: “There’s no way I can do this.” Steven lit up when I told him – those are his hands you see in the film! He’s just wearing my ring. I could never have ripped that face off with the same joie de vivre.Later, I had to go back to shoot some extra footage of me picking at my real face. By then I was acting in a play I’d written and my hair had been cut short – luckily they’d saved the wig from the dummy. It took three hours to rig my face up with prosthetics full of stage blood. It was only when I got to the sound stage that someone realised the makeup guy had been working from the image in the mirror and put everything on the wrong side.There was no PG-13 rating back then. That wasn’t introduced until the second Indiana Jones film a couple of years later. Poltergeist ended up rated PG but, until Steven talked the ratings board round, that scene meant they wanted to make it an R. Another scene of mine was cut, where Marty is lifted into the air and bitten by some gigantic ghost. They rigged me with explosive squibs full of liquid detergent, representing saliva, but the first time they tried it the effects guys were joking that it looked like ghost semen.That wasn’t the reason it had to go, though. Steven told me it interrupted the scene where Diane senses her daughter trapped on the other side and says: “She went through my soul.” It’s a testament to JoBeth’s wonderful performance that he just couldn’t cut away from that.JoBeth Williams’s new film Not Without Hope opens in cinemas on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeHorror filmsSteven SpielbergFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The drummer is talking about his favourite gig with the Smiths: the night in July 1986 when The Queen Is Dead tour hit Salford Maxwell Hall. “They weren’t taking ticket stubs off people coming in. So they were giving their tickets back out through the bog window.” The show ended up at double capacity. “They had to evacuate the bar downstairs because the sprung dancefloor was collapsing. Delirium! There were people crying their eyes out, strangers hugging each other – and that was before E!”Joyce, garrulously upbeat company, has just written a warm, engaging memoir, The Drums, celebrating the Smiths. It’s a “right place, right time” story of his memories as the great indie band tore down the boundaries of British guitar music, with Johnny Marr’s beautifully intricate playing merging immaculately with Morrissey’s words, resulting in devastating, romantic and witty vignettes that perfectly captured everyday life.Some guy opened the door and told me to fuck off“I wanted the book to be about the majesty of it,” says Joyce. “How it was wonderful and interesting and crazy and weird. Not the negatives.” That’s why The Drums stops just after the 1987 split, before Joyce went on to work with the likes of Sinéad O’Connor and Julian Cope, and before the Smiths’s infamously chequered legacy of court cases, spats and the ongoing drama of Morrissey’s controversial worldview. “From what I’ve gleaned, he’s certainly got very different politics to mine,” Joyce says. “But that’s his opinion. He just seems very angry about a lot of things. Of course I hear it – people saying, ‘I can’t listen to the Smiths. I can’t separate the art from the artist.’ If that’s how you feel, that’s fine.” Does that make sense to him? “Not to me. But I’m listening to it from a very different perspective.”Joyce was born in Manchester in 1963, into a “strongly Catholic” Irish immigrant family. “The fear of God was absolutely entrenched in our lives,” says the drummer, although he does still remember a “happy childhood full of love”. It was not without its traumas: Joyce spent six months in hospital after being hit by car outside his house, an undiagnosed ruptured spleen causing internal bleeding that nearly killed him. The seizures faded after a year.View image in fullscreen‘The majesty of it’ … the Smiths in 1984.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesSeeing Buzzcocks live was his ground zero, John Maher’s drumming inspiring him to buy a kit. Joyce became so obsessed with the band, he once tracked down frontman Pete Shelley’s house. “Some guy opened the door,” he recalls, “and told me to fuck off.”In his teens, Joyce joined punk bands, first the Hoax and then Victim, before a friend who also knew Marr invited him to audition for the Smiths. Before he got there, he took mushrooms but “not a call-an-ambulance amount”. He played well enough to get the job, before he started to hallucinate. Band dynamics were already in place: Marr as MD (“I’d never heard anyone play guitar like that”) and Morrissey, then still plain old Steven from Stretford, an aloof presence. “He hardly spoke to me.”Joyce says he found it difficult to describe Morrissey in the book. “I don’t want it to sound like I didn’t like Morrissey. He was fucking great. Very funny bloke, cutting humour. But it was such an unusual relationship. There was a distance. I accepted we were just very different people.”I went to court because I wanted what was due to me – and what was rightHe’s more comfortable talking about his bandmates’ talents, in particular Marr’s inexhaustible productivity. “Every day, you’d go round the house and he’d play some riff sat having a spliff in his jimmy-jams. You’d be like, ‘That’s amazing. What’s that?’” Then there were Morrissey’s lyrics. “Unique. Nobody writes like that. The introduction of gruesome, handsome, vile, charming elements. A brilliant voice. Stage performance interesting, intriguing, incredibly skilled. It’s a potent brew.” Andy Rourke, a friend for life who Joyce writes about lovingly, was last to join on bass. “I’d heard bass played like that, but I’ve never seen it played like that.”It all left Joyce feeling slightly intimidated. “I struggled because Andy and Johnny were miles ahead of me.” But he says he never felt unappreciated as the Smiths quickly caught fire. In November 1983, the band played This Charming Man on Top of the Pops, the same night as a wild show at the Haçienda. But in 1984, Joyce was called into a meeting with the band’s accountant. He hadn’t paid too much heed when only Morrissey and Marr signed the contract as the band joined Rough Trade.View image in fullscreen‘We sound like the Smiths because of the four of us’ … Marr, Morrissey, Joyce and Rourke in 1985.Photograph: Icon and Image/Getty Images“I assumed it was on behalf of all of us,” he says. “I was wrong.” Now he and Rourke were being told they couldn’t expect recording royalties in perpetuity after the band split. “I just said, ‘That doesn’t sound right.’ It was never mentioned again.” In 1985, he took a call from Rough Trade employee Martha Defoe, who on Morrissey’s behalf suggested Joyce take a pay cut, from 25% to 15%, because he didn’t do interviews or create artwork. He refused point blank.Does he mean to imply, in the book, that they were being underhand? “You can call it that. I mean, that’s why I went to court.” Both Joyce and Rourke began a lawsuit against Morrissey and Marr in 1989, claiming a 25% equal share of performance and recording royalties – they had subsequently discovered they were paid 10%. Morrissey and Marr argued the band members were not equal partners, though that’s not how Joyce sees it. “I think it sounded like the Smiths because of the four of us.”Rourke settled out of court (under “a lot of duress”) but Joyce proceeded to trial in 1996. He says if he’d lost, he would have been ruined. “But I thought that if I didn’t, then nobody would ever know what happened. I just wanted what I thought was due to me, and what was right.” Despite calling him “unintellectual and not financially sophisticated”,Judge John Weeks ruled in Joyce’s favourafter a brutal seven-day hearing, awarding him £1m. Weeks famously stated he found Morrissey “devious, truculent and unreliable” and Marr “willing to embroider his evidence to a point where he became less credible”.The case caused a schism that is still playing out. Joyce says he regularly gets trolled by Morrissey fans on social media. “I wish you were dead, how dare you, all that stuff.” He says he last properly spoke to Morrissey in 1992 when they bumped into each other in Altrincham. Aside from occasional glances in the crowd at Manchester City matches, he had no contact with Marr until the memorial service forRourke, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2023 aged 59.“It was good to see him. Because it wasn’t about court cases or who did what. It was about Andy.” Is he still glad he went through with the case? “Yeah. I don’t regret it.” Even with the personal cost? “Yeah,” he says hesitantly. “But I didn’t take Julian Cope to court and I haven’t spoken to him for 30 years. To not be in touch with people you’ve been in bands with isn’t that strange.”Joyce, now 62, chooses to take a positive outlook, talking enthusiastically about his favourite Smiths moments, from the studio playback of debut single Hand in Glove, which was the first time they’d heard themselves recorded as a band, to the time a rendition of I Don’t You Owe Anything made him so emotional he started crying as he sat on his drum stool. “I’m getting goosebumps talking about it now,” he says. From 1985, he adds, Morrissey would record his vocals without the rest of the band knowing what he was about to do. “He never had any light in the studio. It would always be pitch black so we couldn’t see him.” Then he’d start singing. “Mindblowing,” says Joyce. “When he did I Know It’s Over for the first time? Tears.”‘The musty whiff of a yard sale’: why is Morrissey attempting to sell his share of the Smiths’ catalogue?Read moreThe Smiths’s split was sudden. Marr summoned them all to a fish and chip shop in Notting Hill, London, and told them he was leaving. Joyce was blindsided – “I thought we were going for chips” – and writes about feeling bereaved. Having been a radio DJ in Manchester, Joyce has just come out of a 21-year touring retirement to drum for Pete Doherty. Yet Smiths reunion rumours haven’t stopped. Last year, AEG offered a reported $25m for the band to tour. Joyce learned of this via the press and doubts he’d have been asked to join. “I think I forfeited that with the court case.”In September, there was another twist to the saga.Morrissey announced his intention to sell his business interests in the Smiths, inviting prospective buyers to send an email. “I’ve got no skin in the game,” says Joyce, referring to any business interests. “But I thought it was a strange thing to do.” The drummer was mentioned directly: naming “Marr, Rourke, Joyce”, Morrissey said he “would now like to live dissociated from those who wish me nothing but ill-will and destruction”. Does he wish that? “I don’t,” Joyce says. “I’ve been sat here talking candidly about how brilliant the man is. It’s very confusing.”Despite everything that’s happened, Joyce couldn’t be prouder of his time as a Smith. “I was in the coolest, best British band that’s ever been.

And there’s a strong possibility you won’t get what you vote for; much like the Guardian wrote ofRaschid’s 2022 endeavour The Gallery, this feels like an appositely post-Brexit format.The path we guide characters down here is literal: we’re directing fitness influencer Zanna (Roxanne McKee) as she circles Lake Garda on what proves an eventful morning jog. The interactive element begins with some light stretches – the audience choose whether she listens to music or a podcast while running, and whether to greet passing locals – before turning existential as our heroine attracts masked pursuers. I felt constitutionally bound to propose kindness wherever possible, but the lively Saturday night audience chose anarchy at most junctures, yielding several chastening false starts and dead ends. Every audience’s mileage will vary; I will say that, collectively, we got what we deserved.As a 21st-century artefact, The Run does seem clunky. There is scope for Raschid to tighten the cause-and-effect, and some of his dialogue feels rough-edged when it’s not purely functional. As an audience experience, it falls somewhere between an uncommonly adaptable test screening, and dropping by afriendly D&D game.An athletic McKee makes her big moments count as the character who comes into closest focus. Huntsman Franco Nero and priest Dario Argento lurk in the corners. Unlike many of the technological deviations now plaguing us, this one does feel hand-turned and human-derived, its narrative crowdsourced by definition. And bad losers can always return the following night and make better informed choices – not least profiling their fellow voters going in.The Run is atthe Genesis, London, until 31 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsItalyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

But when film-maker Peter Watkins deployed them in the 1960s, they were revolutionary, and Watkins himself was revolutionary as well – an English revolutionary, in fact, alive to the cruelty and iniquity of kings but also to that of people bent on decapitation. His cinema persistently asked questions about those in power, and what will happen when their power goes catastrophically wrong. An artist dedicated to challenging and upsetting, Watkins came from the dissenter tradition of uncompromising radicalism on screen and stage – the same tradition as Edward Bond, Ken Loach and Dennis Potter.His enduringly brilliant and angry anti-nuclear dramaThe War Gamewas commissioned but then banned by the BBC in 1965. (It screened in cinemas, and was finally shown on television a couple of decades later.) It lasts just 47 minutes but viewers felt they had lived through a lifetime of fear. When I first saw it as a teenager at a CND meeting 15 years after it was made, it seemed as if I had entered a new era of disillusioned adulthood.View image in fullscreenDemonic genius … The War Game.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyMovie audiences knew about Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove, which had been released in 1964, and they may have known about Sidney Lumet’s Fail Safe from the same year, but The War Game was chillingly different. Strangelove and Fail Safe, in their different ways, were top-down dramas, dramatising the people in charge. The War Game is about the ordinary people on the ground: the chivvied, anxious, ordinary British people glumly submitting to the instructions of the increasingly dumbstruck low-level admin types, a few minutes before and then during and after a nuclear bomb blast. We saw that these GPs, police, soldiers and civil servants, whose authority and expertise had been developed for the needs of the second world war, were grotesquely inadequate.And the almost demonic genius of The War Game is that it is addressed to the viewer in the clipped, informative tone of aProtect and Survivepublic information film, a Reithian, Men-from-the-Ministry voice that would in other circumstances be deployed to bamboozle or soft-soap the public. Watkins uses it to reveal the awful truth. It is this voice that coolly comments as police constables execute irretrievably irradiated casualties in the street with specially issued revolvers, in an effort to prevent the health service from being overwhelmed.View image in fullscreenRadical style … Culloden (1964).Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThe film is all in the pseudo-documentary style, with the faces of shocked, wraithlike people looming up to the camera as they obediently answer the implacable narrator’s questions. The mockumentary form – so often used for irony, comedy and satire, and to undermine the status of media and television – is here deadly serious. Watkins used it to emphasise that this is real; what happens on screen in The War Game happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and indeed in non-nuclear theatres of war including Dresden, Hamburg and Tokyo. Perhaps we in the west had been encouraged not to think about these things; to think they applied only to the defeated Axis powers – and since the passing of the Cuban missile crisis, that the problem was in any case at an end. Watkins fiercely told us: “No – it could happen and is happening.” The unstable geopolitical negotiations were always wobbling.Barry Hines’s Threads, from 1984 was the obvious inheritor of The War Game on British television.Watkins’ mockumentary style was probably even more radical in his previous film: the 1964 BBC classicCulloden, in which a modern-day camera crew, like American photojournalists in Vietnam, have arrived to cover the Battle of Culloden in 1746, in which the Jacobite rebel forces of Charles Edward Stuart, “Bonnie Prince Charlie”, are decisively routed by the government army of the Duke of Cumberland, son of George II. There are no coy or arch shots of the ahistorical cameras or sound recordists; we just hear the calm, off-camera voice of the journalist “interviewing” the various foot soldiers, commanding officers and blue-blood leaders, with their faces crowding candidly up to Watkins’s camera in the same way.The rebel forces – exhausted, underfed and outnumbered, beset with Scottish clan divisions and badly led by their vain, petulant leader – are horribly defeated. But Watkins doesn’t leave it there. His camera shows us the aftermath, and what would now be called war crimes. Cumberland’s men, cruelly overexcited by their victory, follow the retreating forces on the road to Inverness, slaughtering combatants and civilians alike in the service of “pacifying” the Highlands. When Cumberland’s forces bayonet the Jacobite wounded on the field of battle it is worryingly like those police constables shooting casualties in The War Game. And Watkins always emphasises how much the leaders and men have in common: they are brothers, cousins, kinsmen. Their differences are a function of war.At the beginning of the 1970s, Watkins gave us a movie that is less well known than Culloden and The War Game, but is perhaps his masterpiece.Punishment Park, from 1971, is closer to the deadpan dystopian satire that was soon to be fashionable in Hollywood, but is absolutely characteristic of Watkins. Though it is set in the US, a crisp, received-pronunciation English voice introduces what is apparently to be a BBC-style documentary. The American government is getting tough with hippies, troublemakers and radicals, and makes them choose between 20 years in jail or a few days in the mysterious new “Punishment Park”. Of course most choose the Park, not knowing what is in store, and for once Watkins’ godlike narrator loses his cool at what is happening, eventually screaming in horror and disgust, as if Ludovic Kennedy or David Attenborough had been reduced to a nervous breakdown. It is an unforgettable moment.Watkins’ career continued in its own way, and included a conventional bread-and-circuses satire of pop culture in Privilege (1967); a Bergman-esque and much admired account of Edvard Munch from 1974; the epic 14-hour anti-nuclear documentary project The Journey (1987); and another historical docudrama in 2000, La Commune (Paris, 1871), about the Paris Commune. The cold, clear flame of passion burned until the end.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsPeriod and historical filmsNuclear weaponsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We see in flashback that, as a young child, she survived the horrific experience of her disturbed mother attempting to carry out a murder-suicide. Unluckily, one of her first jobs after returning to work is to respond to a call from a dilapidated nursing home in the middle of nowhere. The first sign that something is amiss when she and the crew rock up, is that nobody at the home will admit to having made the call in the first place. The place itself is also obviously trouble; it’s got the kind of damp in the walls that isn’t just a challenge for estate agents, but might also seep into your soul.The stage is thus set for Ana’s past and present day perils to collide. Of course, people with traumatic backgrounds are 10 a penny in the horror genre at the moment; gone are the days when terror and unease sprang from the fact that this gnarly stuff was happening to a normal family, a nice young girl or an average bunch of teens, and could therefore happen to you, too. Perhaps film-makers have cottoned on to the fact that nobody really perceives themselves as having lived an untroubled life. Everybody is vulnerable.A Mother’s Embrace turns out to be a minor but interestingly woozy and off-kilter entry into the canon of thoughtful trauma horror; its strongest suit is vibes and imagery, with the persistent queasy sensation that Ana has wandered into a bad dream. But is it her bad dream or someone else’s? The excellent and nightmarish production design suggests the answer doesn’t matter; she’s in trouble either way.A Mother’s Embrace is on digital platforms from 10 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersBrazilAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tonight in Manchester, her kooky on-stage persona is mirrored by a surprisingly baby-faced group of misfits pressed against the barrier: a sea of trend-conscious twentysomethings in slouchy cargos and Y2K outfits desperate for a chance to brush against the singer’s hand. Supported by a guitarist, drummer and backing track, Lenae twirls on to the stage with the groove-heavy Sticky, and a lone wind machine whooshes her curls into the air.Some songs from her2024 album Bird’s Eyeland on eager ears. The new material takes a sweet yet sharp turn from her earlier work, bouncing from the fun, rocksteady dubby speaker rattles in Candy to the tender, heart-on-chest ballad Love Is Blind. She airs her ruptured romantic frustrations in plaintive pleas: “How do you love me if you leave me behind?” But feels such as the slower, sad-girl moments on the new record, including Pilot, struggle to maintain the same momentum. Her recent melancholy undoubtedly means a great deal to her: Lenae punctuates the set with warm reflections on her owngrowth as an artistand offers a healthy, relatable dose of sisterly love and guidance: “Stay the course. Time is a gift.”Mostly, OG tracks such as Free Room, doused with shuffly deep-house chords, and the glitchy drum machines of 4 Leaf Clover, still draw the biggest cheers. But then, Bird’s Eye’s hit track Love Me Not swings into the country revival with a delectable slice of western charm, and an earworm hook, “I wish you were right here”, that rings out long after the show is finished. Her word-for-word fans obviously adore her, but it still feels as though Lenae has untapped potential: maybe a heavier band – and less reliance on pre-recordings – as well as a sprinkle more pizazz would make her evident talent and ambition shine.Explore more on these topicsMusicR&BreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, as he moves into film production, he’ll be answering your questions.Barrow grew up in Somerset, including in the town of Portishead which gave his band their name. Alongside Beth Gibbons and Adrian Utley, they created a prowling, nape-prickling sound which would be filed in the trip-hop genre, and which has proved hugely influential. They released three albums and still occasionally perform live, most recently at the Together for Palestine benefit concert in September.Beak> meanwhile formed in 2007 and are still going, though Barrow left in 2024 saying he wanted to focus on other projects (a send-off tour was givena five-star rave review in the Guardian). Barrow also founded the record label Invada, putting out records by the likes of Billy Nomates, Benefits and Gazelle Twin as well as the scores to Stranger Things, Drive, Red Dead Redemption and more. He did hip-hop project Quakers and in partnership with Ben Salisbury scored films such as Ben Wheatley’s Free Fire and Alex Garland’s Ex Machina, Annihilation, Devs, Men and Civil War.When he left Beak> he cited “other work I need to do before I get too old”, and that is now coming to fruition. Barrow has created a film production arm of Invada and is putting out their first film, Game, on 21 November. With a story co-written by Barrow, and starring Sleaford Mods’ Jason Williamson, it’s a thriller set against the backdrop of the 1993 rave scene.Barrow will answer your questions about that and anything else in his richly varied creative life – post them in the comments below before Thursday 6 November.Explore more on these topicsMusicFilm & Music reader interviewPortisheadPop and rockIndiecalloutShareReuse this content"

She worried it would be boring – “I wrote a book, I wrote a second book, I wrote another book …” Alcoholic excess, debauched parties and sexual transgressions would have perked things up, but she hasn’t lived that way.In the end what she has written is less a memoir than an autobiography, not a slice of life but the whole works, 85 years. Where most such backward looks are cosily triumphalist or anxiously self-justifying, hers is sharp, funny and engaging, a book you can warm to even if you’re not fully au fait (and few people are) with her astonishing output, which in the “also by” contents list here fills two pages.She was lucky in her parents, a foresting entomologist father, Carl, and tomboyish mother, Margaret, both from Nova Scotia. Carl’s work on insects meant that the family spent half the year in the bush, at times without electricity, running water or a telephone. They’d camp in tents or shacks by a lake while Carl cut down trees to build a wooden cabin. Young Margaret – Peggy to everyone – loved the outdoors; she learned to fish, canoe, beachcomb, pick berries, delight in birds, insects, mushrooms and frogs. At summer camp, in her teens, she was known as Peggy Nature.In the fall they’d move back to Ottawa or Toronto, like country mice transformed into city mice – they were good at being both. At six she wrote her first pieces, short poems under the heading “Rhyming Cats”. School went smoothly till she reached the fourth grade, and experienced “the unpredictable, oblique, underhanded, and Byzantine nature of the power politics practised by nine- and ten-year-old girls”. She was bullied, humiliated and scapegoated. After a year she broke the spell (an “Alice in Wonderland moment” of defying her tormentors) but the experience taught her a valuable lesson and found its way into her novel Cat’s Eye.She’s happy to share wackier things: her faith in horoscopes, palm-reading and exorcistsAt the co-ed high school she’d opted for (“a school full of girls and nothing but girls was my idea of the Ninth Circle of Hell”), she soon graduated to the “brain class”. A small, “flat-chested weirdo”, with horn-rimmed glasses, a snaggle tooth, frizzy hair, astigmatism and anaemia, she put her energies into sewing and fancy dress. She also made her first television appearance, showing off her pet praying mantis Lenore. By 14 she was dating: older, artsy boyfriends “somehow just appeared, like mushrooms after rain”. Poetry pursued her, too: her adolescent efforts were “heavily sensational, sometimes macabre”. According to her school yearbook, “Peggy’s not-so-secret ambition is to write THE Canadian novel”. But her first publications were poems that appeared under the name ME Atwood, “so I wouldn’t be tagged as a girl”. Here was a new writerly self, no longer the “sprightly daylight” Peggy, but someone more shadowy, the baleful ME.From university in Toronto, with its star academicsMarshall McLuhanand Northrop Frye, she moved on to Harvard, a tweedily unglamorous scholarship girl. There she researched the Salem witch trials, which along with the patriarchal norms of Harvard graduate school fed into The Handmaid’s Tale many years later. Atwood makes connections between her life and work throughout the book, though not so crudely as the man at an event who told her: “The Handmaid’s Tale is autobiography.” It’s to her reflections on that novel that many readers will turn first. She wasn’t an active feminist in her 20s, when the idea that “domestic tasks might be shared equally” hadn’t arrived. But the oppression of women increasingly troubled her. And by the time the TV version was made, in the era of Trumpism, it was more salient than ever.Her breakthrough came much earlier, in her early 30s. She had made a promising start, winning the Governor General’s award (Canada’s biggest prize), publishing two novels, and making her mark in the UK and US. Then she offered to help out the small publishing house she was attached to, Anansi, with a book that would define and celebrate literary writing in her home country. Written in four months, Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature sold 100,000 copies and kept Anansi solvent for years. The success prompted jealousy and malice. “One of these days that smart mouth of yours is going to get you into trouble,” her father had warned, and it did. She was attacked as a man-killer – acid-tongued, frightening, no longer a nice 1950s girl but a terrifying maenad, abelle dame sans merci.View image in fullscreenAtwood in 1972.Photograph: Ron Bull/Toronto Star/Getty ImagesThe novels came regularly thereafter but “Canadians are prone to be offended by the success of other Canadians”, she notes, and since an “undiluted celebration of one’s feats is a gross violation of etiquette” she doesn’t overdo the self-praise. Tributes are paid to the many who helped her (friends, editors, agents, film producers, writers), not all of them familiar names. And she’s happy to share a wackier side – her faith in horoscopes, palm-reading and exorcists. She loves to knit, make pies, decorate cakes, weed the garden: homespun Peggy (“what I don’t know about toilet‑cleaning isn’t worth knowing”) lives alongside the dystopian novelist. There’s the drawing she does too, samples of which enliven the pages. It’s not all about writing.At a party in 1969 she met Graeme Gibson, novelist, trickster, spendthrift, high-energy oddball. He was wearing blue denims, she a “white crocheted lace mini dress with wooden buttons down” (Atwood is scrupulous in recording her changing outfits and hairstyles), and at first she had no awareness of his “non-platonic interest” in her. There were complications: she’d married an American poet, less from love than to spare him being drafted to Vietnam, and Graeme had a child by a woman with whom he had an open marriage, Shirley. A cautious courtship followed; Graeme wooed Peggy with yearning letters. If she’d not met him she’d still have been a great novelist, he said, but she’d have had a lot less fun.Shirley did her best to stop the fun, and Atwood is acerbic about her enslavement of Graeme as someone to do the household duties while Shirley went on dates and badmouthed Peggy as a homewrecker. Along with the odd enemy hack, interviewer or “accuser”, Shirley is one of the few people who come out badly here. But Atwood dilutes her venom through jokey exchanges with an Inner Advice Columnist who tells her to calm down and wise up. There’s a lot of proverbial wisdom in the book, “life lessons” as she calls them. And she did have a life with Graeme for half a century: they had a daughter, campaigned, farmed, gardened, camped, canoed, birdwatched and travelled the world.Margaret Atwood’s 10 best books – ranked!Read moreHis decline, dementia and death bring a sombre tone to the book’s last pages. Ever the workaholic Ms Fixit, Atwood keeps going rather than miss out on the publicity whirl for The Testaments (her sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale): “Ask yourself, Dear Reader: The busy schedule or the empty chair? I chose the busy schedule. The empty chair would be there when I got home.” She has a pacemaker these days and eventually her body “will decide to go off on an adventure of its own”. But for now mind and body are still together and so, in friendly opposition, are the many selves she unveils here in a “blizzard” of memories and photos: nerdy brainiac, waifish poet, Medusa-eyed feminist, uncanny prophet and one of the great novelists of our time.Book of Lives by Margaret Atwood is published by Chatto & Windus (£30).

Those were generous, funny, big-hearted books, tying characters he calls “outliers” to social issues from feminism to abortion.Since Owen Meany, it’s been diminishing returns, except in page length. His last novel, 2022’sThe Last Chairlift, was 900 pages of subjects Irving had explored better in earlier books (mutism, dwarfism, transgenderism), with a 200-page screenplay in the middle to pad it out – as if padding were needed.So we approach a new Irving with caution but still a small flame of hope, which burns hotter when we learn that Queen Esther – a mere 432 pages – “returns to the world of The Cider House Rules”. That 1985 novel is one of Irving’s very best, set largely in an orphanage in St Cloud’s, Maine, run by Dr Wilbur Larch and his protege Homer Wells.In The Cider House Rules, Irving wrote about abortion and belonging with colour, comedy and an all-encompassing empathy. And it was a significant work because it left behind the topics that were becoming tiresome tics in his books: wrestling, bears, Vienna, prostitution.Queen Esther opens in the fictional town of Penacook, New Hampshire in the early 20th century, where Thomas and Constance Winslow adopt 14-year-old orphan Esther from St Cloud’s. We are a few decades before the action of The Cider House Rules, yet Wilbur Larch remains recognisable: already addicted to ether, adored by his nurses, starting every speech with “Here in St Cloud’s …” But his appearance in Queen Esther is limited to these early scenes.Queen Esther is a disappointment from a writer who once gave such joyThe Winslows worry about raising Esther well: she’s Jewish, and “how could they help a young Jewish girl find herself?” To answer that, we flash forward to Esther’s adulthood in the 1920s. She will be part of the Jewish emigration to Palestine, where she will become part of Haganah, the Zionist paramilitary organisation whose “purpose was to protect Jewish settlements from Arab attacks” and which would later form the core of the Israeli Defense Forces.These are huge subjects to tackle, but having introduced them, Irving dodges out. Because if it’s disappointing that Queen Esther is not really about St Cloud’s and Dr Larch, it’s even more disappointing that it’s also not about Esther. For reasons that must relate to plot engineering, Esther becomes a surrogate mother for another of the Winslows’ daughters, and gives birth to a baby boy, Jimmy, in 1941 – and the bulk of this novel is Jimmy’s story.And here is where Irving’s obsessions come roaring back, both regular and specific. Jimmy moves to – where else? – Vienna; there’s discussion of dodging the Vietnam draft through self-mutilation (A Prayer for Owen Meany); a dog with a symbolic name (Hard Rain, meet Sorrow from The Hotel New Hampshire); as well as wrestling, prostitutes, writers and penises (Irvingspassim).Jimmy is a less interesting character than Esther promised to be, and the secondary players, such as students Claude and Jolanda, and Jimmy’s tutor Annelies Eissler, are flat too. There are some nice set pieces – Jimmy losing his virginity; a fight where a couple of thugs get battered with a crutch and a bicycle pump – but they’re here and gone.Irving has never been a subtle writer, but that is not the problem. He has always reiterated his points, foreshadowed plot developments and allowed them to accumulate in the reader’s mind before bringing them to fruition in long, shocking, amusing scenes. For example, in Irving’s novels, body parts tend to go missing: think of the tongue in Garp, the finger in Owen Meany. Those absences echo through the story. In Queen Esther, a major character loses an arm – but we only find out 30 pages before the end.Esther returns late in the novel, but only with a last-minute sense of wrapping things up. We never do find out the full story of her life in Palestine and Israel. Queen Esther is a disappointment from a writer who once gave such joy. That’s the bad news. The good news is that The Cider House Rules – I reread it alongside this novel – still stands up beautifully, 40 years on. So read that instead: it’s twice as long as Queen Esther, but 12 times as good.Queen Esther by John Irving is published by Scribner (£22).

This was short-lived: Microsoft backtracked barely a month later, and kept it at the standard £60/$70. While The Outer Worlds 2 is technically bigger than its2019 predecessor, that decision was smart: this is not a £70 game.It is, however, a thoroughly enjoyable adventure that can easily suck up hours of your time, and one that improves upon the original game in meaningful ways. With far better combat and deeper role-playing mechanics, The Outer Worlds 2 smartly expands without spreading itself too thin – even if its story fails to delight.You don’t need to have played the first installmentto understand the sequel’s broad strokes: you’re an agent of an obtusely “benevolent” space police force known as the Earth Directorate, tasked with bringing order to a galaxy known as Arcadia. Like the original game’s Halcyon, Arcadia is fractured and frayed as a result of rampant capitalism, and you have unfettered power in your quest to forge new bonds or repair old ones between wildly different ideological groups, who are all armed to the teeth.You’re regularly pulled between warring factions, but there’s a bigger problem than the rifts between them: actual rifts in space. You’re introduced to these as the game starts, tasked with investigating engines invented by authoritarian collectivist group the Protectorate, who are causing these tears in the fabric of space. Upon arrival, you’re quickly double-crossed by a trusted associate and forced to spend a decade in suspended animation.View image in fullscreenColourful vendors … The Outer Worlds 2.Photograph: Obsidian EntertainmentWhen you awake 10 years later, Arcadia has changed dramatically and the rifts have continued to spread unabated. You have to cobble together a new crew to try to save the galaxy.Unfortunately for The Outer Worlds 2, nothing reaches the narrative peak of the game’s opening; a letdown you don’t fully comprehend until you’ve sunk around 30 hours into it. I kept expecting a character to shock me or storylines to unfold in unexpected ways, but found myself knowingly nodding at almost every turn. Though there are interesting characters to align yourself with – including a psychopathic cultist and a spy – I struggled to connect with this crew as much as I did in the first game.Despite there being three main factions that constantly vie for your attention and sympathy, there are few choices in The Outer Worlds 2 that feel impactful. Thorny conversations with narrow-minded capitalists force you to reckon with your own participation in the real-world economic system, but the characters’ two-dimensional takes elicit more eye rolls than eye-opening moments.If you have a high enough “speech” skill, you can talk your way in and out of most situations. This feels especially incongruous when a blind Protectorate devotee does a complete 180 after you select a specific voice line, though it can be smugly satisfying when you talk your way out of a boss fight. Yet, at the end of nearly every one of these major moments of conflict, you’re left feeling kind of like nothing you did really mattered – although maybe that’s the point.View image in fullscreenElemental firepower … The Outer Worlds 2.Photograph: Obsidian EntertainmentBecause of this, I found myself struggling to connect with the story. My companions may have had strong opinions, but they never seem to actually get mad at me, even when my choices flout their beliefs. There’s a lack of conviction in The Outer Worlds 2, which is especially disheartening because its whip-smart humor so often elicits a chuckle, but is so rarely used to make a sufficiently barbed ideological statement.The game offers impressive depth with its combat and its role-playing systems, which are drastically improved upon from the original. While firefights still have tedious and frustrating moments, the sheer variety of weapons and how that affects each encounter is thrilling: elemental damage has varying degrees of impact against enemies and each requires different ammunition. If you run out in the midst of a gruelling encounter, you’ll be forced to get creative. I’d often go into a fight with a rotation of weapons in mind, only to run out of ammo faster than expected, and be forced to try something I’ve never used before. I thoroughly enjoyed having to think and swap on the fly.Building your character is even more thoughtful than the original game, introducing “flaws”, a system that tracks your behaviours and occasionally offers you to accept a trait, often with both negative and positive effects. For instance, my reliance on crafting items results in the “Hermit” flaw, doubling vendor prices but adding a 25% chance of double items when breaking down junk. This was obviously helpful in my craftier moments, but a problem when I was low on junk and needed to rely on vendors: a fun little predicament that made me readjust my play style.Developer Obsidian has had a big year, releasing fantasy adventureAvowedand the insect-heavy survival game Grounded 2. All three are testaments to the studio’s ability to craft wildly different worlds that bend and shift to the player’s will.Even if The Outer Worlds 2 rarely blows my mind, and suffers from direct comparisons to Avowed, the smaller scope of which resulted in a tighter experience overall, there is inherent value in a role-playing game that so effectively sucks you in for hours upon hours. It’s not breaking the mould, but improving its structure: offering you something satisfying and solid that rarely surprises, but still manages to regularly delight.The Outer Worlds 2 is available now; £59.99/$69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPCAction gamesRole playing gamesAdventure gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The focus of his ire was Mortal Kombat, Midway’s bloody fighting game, recently released on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System after a successful run in the arcades. “Blood splatters from the contestants’ heads,” he told the room. “The game narrator instructs the player to finish his opponent. That player may choose a method of murder ranging from ripping a heart out or pulling off the head of the opponent, with spinal cord attached.”Lieberman’s aim with the congressional hearing had been to force the US games industry into creating a formal ratings system, preventing minors from buying violent titles. He succeeded in that – the Entertainment Software Rating Board was established as a result of the hearing – but he also boosted a moral panic that had quietly begun with the launch of the Mortal Kombat arcade game in 1992. This then took on more urgency following the high-profile home console release on 13 September 1993 – a global simultaneous launch Midway named Mortal Monday. US news networks weresending reporters to arcades, interrogating teens as they enthusiastically dismembered each other’s fighters. Newspapers were interviewing alarmed child psychologists. The BBC responded byfeaturing the gameon its late-night news magazine programme The Late Show, calling in author Will Self to play live in the studio.View image in fullscreenCharmingly jerky … Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection.Photograph: AtariIt’s interesting now to watch those hearings and then look at the game they were describing. Released this week, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is an anthology of the first four titles in the series, in arcade and various home console forms, as well as an array of spin-offs for the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation. The original titles are almost quaint relics of 1990s teen culture. The digitised visuals, created by filming actors performing martial arts moves then converting that footage into 2D sprite animations, are charmingly jerky and low-resolution, the controversial fatalities more bloodily amusing than horrifying. Brilliantly, the Kollection comes with a Fatality Trainer allowing you to easily access and practise the viscera-splattered death moves from each title. If this mode had been available at the time, it’s probably the only thing I’d have played.Playing again now, the game is obviously a product of twenty-something guys brought up on 80s horror films. Midway had originally assembled a four-man team including coder Ed Boon and John Tobias to produce a combat action game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, when that deal fell through, Boon and Tobias imagined a competitor to hugely successful Capcom hit Street Fighter II, inspired by the wave of popular hyperviolent martial arts flicks such as Bloodsport and Best of the Best. Boon’s elevator pitch was “the MTV version of Street Fighter”, and the fatalities emerged throughout the development process, the team pulling in ideas from their favourite movies: RoboCop, Terminator and Enter the Dragon. Straight away, the company knew that blood and guts would mean notoriety and no one was fazed.Talking to Polygon in 2022, Boon said, “If there was something that we would even say, ‘Is this going too far?’ our CEO was like, ‘No, go even further.’ Plus we had [Midway game designer] Eugene Jarvis as our mentor […] he had just done Narc, which was a pretty violent game in its own right. So if anything, we were encouraged to goevenfurther.”In effect, the moral panic over Mortal Kombat was to the early 1990s what the video nasty controversy was to the early 1980s. It was about the fear of new entertainment technologies entering family homes unchecked and poisoning the minds of children. It also ensured the success of the series. Mortal Kombat became the biggest-selling game of the Christmas season and beyond, shifting six million copies across multiple machines. What the Kollection shows is how adaptable the games have been, taking the original arcade concept on to handheld platforms and then into the 32-bit console era where spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces expanded into the action-adventure genre.For the industry itself, the Mortal Kombat panic simply became a new front on which to fight the console wars. Sega courted the controversy, allowing Mega Drive owners to access the full gore of the arcade version by inputting a “secret” code. By contrast, Nintendo sought to bolster its family-friendly image by removing fatalities and turning the game’s blood into grey “sweat”. Unsurprisingly, it was the Sega version that sold best.View image in fullscreenSo real it hurts … An original press ad for Mortal Kombat.Photograph: MidwayThere have been many media panics since this one. Doom remained a tabloid fixture for the entire 1990s, becominginextricably linkedwith the Columbine school shooting due to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold’s interest in the game. Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty were regular targets throughout the 2010s, and more recently Fortnite has been accused of leading a generation of schoolchildreninto addiction. But the sight of Joe Lieberman in that wood-panelled senate room describing gruesome images from Mortal Kombat – as well as Night Trap and Lethal Enforcers – retains its unique fascination.This was a turning point for the games business – it was the era in which the focus shifted from children to teens, from abstract puzzlers and platformers to graphically rich shooters, bloody fighting games and adult-oriented action adventures. Midway set out to discover exactly what it could get away with. The answer shaped the entire industry.Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is out now on PC, PS5, Switch and Xbox.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He wrote 39 plays, 26 novels and a huge amount of nonfiction and was dismissed by Virginia Woolf, with characteristic snootiness, as “one of the tradesmen of letters”. But, in art as in life, tradespeople are invaluable and with one of Priestley’s most popular plays, When We Are Married, about to be revived at London’s Donmar Warehouse, it is worth asking what the qualities are that make him a durable dramatist.It makes sense to start with An Inspector Calls, which was famously revived by Stephen Daldry in 1992 in a production that has lasted for more than 30 years. What Daldry and hisdesigner, Ian MacNeil, did was to cut through the play’s schematic outline and treat it as an expressionist fable about a family poised on the edge of self-destruction.But I am convinced that the reason for the play’s survival lies in the pertinence of the Inspector’s final warning: “We don’t live alone. We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other.” Whether in 1946 under a hard-pressed Labour government, in the post-Thatcherite world of 1992 or in today’s brutally polarised society, that message carries a timeless resonance.View image in fullscreenHumane socialism … Lydia Leonard, Hattie Morahan, Francesca Annis and Lisa Jackson  in Time and the Conways at the National Theatre, London, in 2009.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRereading many of Priestley’s plays, I am struck by the endless reiteration of the plea for social justice, allied to a romantic mysticism. The year 1937 saw the simultaneous production of two of Priestley’s plays about time: Time and the Conways based on JW Dunne’s ideas about the co-existence of past, present and future, and I’ve Been Here Before, about Ouspensky’s notion of lives recurring in an endless spiral. But, while the time motif is fascinating, both plays are underpinned by Priestley’s humane socialism.The most moving moment in the first play is a female teacher’s idealistic dream of “a free, happy prosperous people all enjoying equal opportunities, living at peace with the whole world”. The words are spoken in 1919 and acquire a pungent irony when the action shifts to 1937. There is an equally heart-stopping moment in the second play when an industrialist counters working-class hostility to a German refugee with: “All over this rotten world now, they’re slamming doors in the faces of good men. But we’ve still a door or two open here.” I can imagine that getting a warm response if heard on a British stage today.View image in fullscreenA romantic mysticism … JB Priestley in 1949.Photograph: Jane Bown/The ObserverMy own favourite among Priestley’s plays is The Linden Tree. Written during the freezing, crisis-ridden month of January 1947 when the country was virtually at a standstill, and memorably revived by Christopher Morahanat the Orange Tree in 2006, this is a forerunner of the state-of-the nation plays we now associate with David Hare and James Graham. In essence, Priestley hits two targets. Since the play is about the enforced retirement of an idealistic history professor at the age of 65, it pinpoints society’s disregard of age and experience. But the heart of the play lies in the prof’s confrontation with a daughter who has fled England to lead a life of expatriate grandeur in France.While acknowledging the drab austerity of modern Britain, Linden asks his daughter to recognise that the country is trying to do something as extraordinary as it is difficult: “to have a revolution for once without the Terror, without looting mobs and secret police, sudden arrests, mass suicides and executions, without setting in motion the vast pendulum of violence which can decimate three generations before it comes to a standstill.” You could hardly have a more pointed attack on tyranny or a more vigorous defence of the postwar Attlee government.In the same year as The Linden Tree, Priestley published a passionately polemical book,TheatreOutlook, which applies socialist principles to a reactionary industry. He attacks fat-cat theatre owners, philistine politicians, hidebound playgoers, and even has a swipe at celebrity casting. But he argues forcefully for increased subsidy, tours by national companies and a chain of civic theatres reflecting local character and outlook.View image in fullscreenIdealist dreams … Tom Grace and Helen Keeley in Summer Day’s Dream by JB Priestley at the Finborough theatre, London, in 2013.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSome of what Priestley wished for has come to pass: it is his vision of a flourishing network of regional repertory companies with their own distinct identity that has been eroded by time and underfunding. But Priestley was always an idealist with an edge of mysticism. You see that in a play such as Summer Day’s Dream, written in 1949 and set on the Sussex Downs in 1975.Taking place in the aftermath of a nuclear catastrophe, it shows an American industrialist, a Russian bureaucrat and an Indian research chemist being enriched by their encounters with the Shakespearean and Kiplingesque magic of rural England. When I saw the play revivedat the Finborough in 2013, it struck me as wildly fanciful but visible proof that inside Priestley the visionary socialist there was always a mystic romantic struggling to get out.When We Are Married is at theDonmar Warehouse, London, 6 December-7 FeburaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreJB PriestleyOrange Tree theatreFinborough theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Moments earlier, I had been watching the Lithuanian soprano rehearse Leoš Janáček’s opera The Makropulos Case, which theRoyal Opera is staging for the first time this autumn, in a new production by Katie Mitchell. Stundyte takes the work’s central role – and Mitchell is a director famous for her explicitly feminist approach.Stundyte, it turns out, has also surprised herself. A few days after we speak, she emails a clarification: she isn’t against women’s rights. But it bothers her, she explains, when “women see men as the problem and themselves as victims. When you put yourself in the role of a victim, you give away your own power.”This is unexpectedly relevant. Stundyte and I meet in the immediate aftermath of Mitchell tellingthe Times: “I’m bringing my work in opera to a close because of the misogyny.” As the industry’s social media feeds churn, Stundyte is impassive. I ask if she agrees that misogyny remains a problem in opera. “My personal feeling is that nowadays, especially after #MeToo, women have a very nice environment to live and work in. I personally have only good experiences.”My type is not the happy, sweet, blonde, jumping, sexy ladyThe atmosphere in that morning’s rehearsal, certainly, seemed a far cry from the systemic sexism that Mitchell reported suffering. Here, in fact, was an alternative model of rehearsal room power dynamics. Conductor Jakub Hrůša was in the pit, but Mitchell was unequivocally in charge. Her interventions were mainly periodic questions – “Jakub, was that OK for you with the vomiting?” – and cheerful encouragement. Jokes and compliments were scattered amid subtle adjustments made to technical minutiae and the timing of action on stage while Mitchell’s own references switch fluently between dramatic and musical cues.Stundyte spent some of the rehearsal stretched out on a double bed in her character’s bedroom while a problem elsewhere was sorted out. “It’s a bit boring polishing the details,” she admits. “A lot of repeating and less artistic input. But I’m totally relaxed, and you know you have to sweat it out.”There were no such painstaking preparations ahead of Stundyte’s Royal Opera debut in January 2024, when she stepped into the title role of Strauss’s Elektra at very short notice, replacing the indisposed starNina Stemme. Stundyte was at home in Belgium on the fifth day of a week-long fast – “you could not plan worse” – when she got the call asking her to come to London. “I started eating,” she reassures me, and adds that at least because she hadn’t been expecting anything like this, she’d had a good night’s sleep before going on stage as one of opera’s most complex and challenging characters.View image in fullscreen‘If I have to sing beautifully [but] cut acting – that is, for me, torture’ Ausrine StundytePhotograph: Petra BaratovaThe Guardian’s Tim Ashley was among those impressed by Stundyte’s“remarkable” performance. Intensity burned off her even in that morning’s Janáček rehearsal. Stundyte has always admired singing actors over those who sing beautifully but don’t act. “If you want really to sing perfectly, it’s impossible to also act well, so you have to make compromises. But for me, acting is always something much more interesting. If I have to sing beautifully and I have to cut acting – that is, for me, torture.”I suggest that Stundyte’s role inThe Makropulos Casemust pose particular challenges for her in terms of acting: Emilia Marty is over 300 years old and has effectively lived multiple lives, thanks to an elixir of immortality administered by her father in the 16th century. Stundyte is unfazed. “I don’t know how it is with you, but when I turned 30, it was a crisis. When I got to 40, it was crisis. Now I’m soon hitting 50, it’s again crisis. This time it’s a crisis because I fulfilled basically all my dreams. I’m really so, so grateful for life and destiny that I have everything what I wanted ever, but now I’m, like, empty. Like a little jellyfish.” A jellyfish? “All this harmony and peace and happiness is wonderful, but I kind of miss those adrenaline kicks because they were giving some massive extra power.”She has no patience with anyone chasing immortality in real life today. “How is your life that fantastic that you can’t stop it? People are just afraid of death, you know. But I’m not. I’m quite sure that it will be wonderful. I’ve known this since I was a child.”View image in fullscreenDaniel Matoušek, Heather Engebretson and Ausrine Stundyte in rehearsal for The Makropulos Case at the Royal Opera House.Photograph: © Camilla GreenwellStundyte’s existential optimism provides a stark contrast to her operatic roles. “My type is not the happy, sweet, blonde, jumping, sexy lady,” she says, grinning. No indeed: from Strauss’s Elektra and Salome to Katerina Izmailova in Shostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, Janáček’s Kát’a Kabanová and beyond, Stundyte specialises in opera’s most heavyweight, grim soprano characters. “I was very depressed and very unhappy, especially around the teenager period. This incredible pain – I still remember it.” She pauses. “Probably this is still somewhere in me, and I can reconnect and recall it very easy. So I’m good at doing pain.”Does she actually find these roles cathartic? “I wish theatre therapy would be something more widespread,” she says with sudden enthusiasm. “But being in this profession, you are forced to work with your own stuff. So I think I’m now quite good! I clean myself of a lot of baggage.” And yet Stundyte insists on the value of her own difficult past. “If you never experienced danger, if you never experienced pain, if you were never really hurt, how can you make opera believable?”The Makropolus Case is at the Royal Ballet and Opera, London, from 4-21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicKatie MitchellLeoš JanáčekRoyal Opera HousefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The film came out ahead ofPillion, adapted from Adam Mars-Jones’s coming-of-age relationship story, which got 10 nominations, and biopicI Swear, which got nine.My Father’s Shadow, which stars Sope Dirisu and is Davies’s debut feature as a director, premiered at the Cannes film festival to admiring reviews.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described itas “a transparently personal project and a coming-of-age film in its (traumatised) way, a moving account of how, just for one day, two young boys glimpse the real life and real history of their father who has been mostly absent for much of their lives”. The film is yet to be released in the UK, but has already come out in Nigeria.Pillion, likewise, had a successful premiere at Cannes in May, with Bradshaw calling it “an intensely English story of romance, devotion and loss from first-time feature director Harry Lighton, who has created something funny and touching and alarming – like a cross between Alan Bennett and Tom of Finland with perhaps a tiny smidgen of what could be called a BDSM Wallace and Gromit”. Due for UK release later in November, it is up for best British independent film, best director for Lighton and best lead performance for Harry Melling.I Swear is already in cinemas, having been released in October. A life story of Tourette syndrome activist John Davidson, the film is likewise up for best British indepependent film, best director for Kirk Jones, and best lead performance for Robert Aramayo.The nominations also include, for the first time, an award for cinema of the year, which is voted on by the public. The contenders include the Depot in Lewes, the Magic Lantern in Tywyn, Montrose Playhouse, Queen’s Film Theatre in Belfast and the Watershed in Bristol.The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on 30 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmAwards and prizesFilm adaptationsDrama filmsRomance filmsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Notably, there was a paucity of putative blockbusters, with the only large-scale effects movie on release being Tron: Ares, which took $67m in North America, as part of a disappointing $133m worldwide gross againstits $180m reported budget.Also disappointing was the performance of so-called “awards season” films, with Dwayne Johnson wrestling movie The Smashing Machine, Julia Roberts #MeToo drama After the Hunt, and music biopic Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere all grossing less than expected.The end of October customarily delivers a boost from horror movies, but with the date of Halloween falling on a Friday, when a large section of the intended audience would be otherwise occupied, box office receipts for the weekend of 31 October to 2 November were the lowest of the year,with a total of $48.3m. Also contributing to the disappointment was the absence of any successful horror releases: the leading horror release of the season, Black Phone 2, managed $8m over the Halloween weekend, while theputatively buzzy Shelby Oaks performed poorly, taking just $770,000 from its relatively significant release in more than 1,700 theatres.Cinemagoing over the Halloween weekend in North America was also affected by the climax of baseball’s World Series,which finished in the early morning of 2 November.Box office analyst Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations told Variety: “The major releases this month failed to deliver. Simple as that.”He added: “Apart from the moderately successful Black Phone 2, there just weren’t enough horror films to entice moviegoers. That should be a no-brainer.”The news wasn’t all bad though: Taylor Swift’s The Official Release Party of a Showgirl saw huge activity on its only weekend in cinemas,taking $34m between 3 and 5 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryHorror booksScience fiction and fantasy filmsDrama filmsFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

By an accident of topography, the 50 inhabitants of Mödlareuth, a hamlet surrounded by pine forests, meadows and spectacular vistas, found themselves at the heart of the cold war. They had the misfortune to straddle Bavaria, in WestGermany, and Thuringia in the East, a border that was demarcated first by a fence and then by a wall. American soldiers called it Little Berlin.Months after their own wall was breached, and even before their country had reunified in 1990, a group of local people set about memorialising their history. The work is about to come to fruition: on 9 November, the 36th anniversary of the fall of the (big) Berlin Wall, the German-German Museum Mödlareuth will open. It was officially inaugurated by the federal president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in early October, but the exhibition wasn’t quite ready. Addressing the villagers who lived through the old days, Steinmeier said: “You were witnesses of an inhuman division, which ripped families apart and turned neighbours into aliens.”View image in fullscreenThe Tannbach river demarcation line between Mödlareuth-West in the American occupation zone and Mödlareuth-East in the Soviet occupation zone, July 1949.Photograph: Otto Donath/Bundesarchiv BildEven at its founding in 1810, the village cut across the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Principality of Reuss, a princely house best known for giving all its male members the name Heinrich and numbering them sequentially by birth. As Steinmeier told the audience, the quirk never stood in the way of the inhabitants drinking in the same pub, attending the same church and sending their children to the same school.Then came the second world war. As soon as they arrived, the Russians erected wooden posts by the stream. For a year they took over the entire village, establishing their command in a house on the Bavarian side, adorning it with a picture of Stalin and a red star. The Americans convinced them to withdraw back over the brook. For a while, villagers could still hop over, though as restrictions tightened they were required to show ID, even though everyone knew who they were, and to return at night.View image in fullscreenThe construction of the 700-metre concrete barrier wall across the village in 1966.Photograph: Bundesgrenzschutz/Museum MödlareuthThen, in 1952, came barbed wire and the formal closing of the border. In 1966, as in Berlin five years earlier, a wall was built, with mines, tank traps and guard posts. The villagers could still see each other by climbing hills, but on the eastern side waving and shouting were prohibited. One woman was put on a Stasi watch list for responding “same to you” to a (Bavarian) villager who wished her “happy new year”.I was told stories such as these by Robert Lebegern, the museum’s director, who has spent much of his working life creating it. Villagers were consulted early on about how much wall they wanted to preserve. They chose a stretch on the western fringe, close to where one of their own managed to escape in the dead of night with a ladder, after which the border was heavily reinforced.View image in fullscreenA Stasi reconstruction of the only known escape over the Mödlareuth wall on 25 May 1973.Photograph: DDR-Grenztruppen / Staatssicherheit/Bundesarchiv / Militärarchiv FreiburgTwo watchtowers are preserved alongside a series of tableaux depicting the most dramatic dates in the village’s history. As we walk, Lebergen lists the regulations: nobody could come within 5km of the border. Farmers needed special permission to tend to their crops; the husband or wife could work the combine harvester but never both, in case they tried to make a run for it. Armed guards stood watch.The border between West Germany and the GDR stretched 1,400km, from the Baltic Sea in the north to here in the south. Berlin is remembered and memorialised the most, but more than twice as many people (well over 300) died trying to cross it in rural areas than in the big city. Lebegern reminds me that 95% of escape attempts failed.Most of Mödlareuth’s villagers were farmers or craftsmen, who adjusted to living in the grey zone between two ideological spheres by keeping their heads down and looking after their fields. They neither supported the communist regime nor resisted it, Lebegern explains.For visitors, however, the hamlet became a kind of pilgrimage. About 15,000 came to visit every year, binoculars in hand, to gawp – and then quickly leave. In 1983, the US vice-president, George Bush, was shown around by the German defence minister.Twenty five years after reunification, Tannbach, a TV series about a fictional village resembling Mödlareuth, led to renewed interest.View image in fullscreenPilgrimage site: the open air museum in Mödlareuth today.Photograph: Sina Ettmer/AlamyThe opening of the new museum – with a cafe, shop, cinema room and large car park – is likely to provide a further boost. Will it change the village? It is, in any case, changing all the time. Some of the original inhabitants on both sides have died; others have left. Newcomers have moved in, including a man from Leicestershire called Darren. His German wife, Kathrin, is a traffic cop for the Bavarian police. They live up a hill, past a chicken coop, on the Thuringia side.The village is still divided, administratively at least, with different car number plates and postcodes. When Steinmeier visited, he was accompanied by the state premiers of both Bavaria and Thuringia. And when his foot crossed the brook, he was formally handed over by one police force to the other. History has moved on; the border has not.This article was amended on 3 November 2025. George Bush was vice-president, not president, when he visited in 1983.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsGermanyCold warEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its status raises complex questions about the identity of its inhabitants – Ukrainians, Russians, Moldovans and Bulgarians – in a land searching for direction and lacking a clearly defined national identityByPjotr Sauer; Photographs by Didier BizetMon 3 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 03.34 ESTShareAmid the ongoing war inUkraineand between the fragile borders that crisscross the former Soviet Union, the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, which broke away from Moldova more than 30 years ago after a brief but bloody conflict, remains locked in deep political and diplomatic isolation.Transnistria mapHome to about 450,000 people, Transnistria is a narrow strip of land wedged betweenMoldovaand Ukraine, along the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Its de facto capital, Tiraspol, lies less than 60 miles from the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. Though small in size – about 125 miles long – the region holds outsized strategic importance, sitting on a key corridor between the Black Sea and central Europe.View image in fullscreenTanks on display in the streets of Tiraspol come from the Dniester war, also known as the Transnistrian war or Moldovan civil war. This post-Soviet conflict in 1992 pitted the Transnistrian army (supported by Russia) against the Moldovan armed forces on the banks of the Dniester River. The conflict caused about 1,000 deaths.View image in fullscreenMaria, 35, and her daughter Miroslava, who live in Tiraspol.This separatist region has its own institutions and government but is not officially recognised as a nation by any UN member state – not even by Russia, which maintains about 1,500 troops in the territory, nominally as “peacekeepers” but in practice as a means of projecting influence over Moldova.View image in fullscreenSimon, like many young people, comes to this hill along the Dniester. During the war against Moldova, snipers were positioned on this hill and held the future border.This lack of recognition leaves Transnistria in a grey zone of international law, cut off from global organisations and trapped in its post-Soviet legacy. While other former Soviet republics have integrated into international structures and forged new political paths, Transnistria has remained firmly rooted in a bygone Soviet past.View image in fullscreenIn many Transnistrian villages, monuments to the civil war between Moldavia and Transnistria, and to the victory over Nazism, are regularly decorated with flowers.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: a young mother walks past the Aviators’ Monument, located in the 60 Years of October Square in the eastern suburbs of the de facto capital.

Right: a Moldovan well dating from the Soviet era in the countrysideAcross the territory of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, the name used by Transnistria, Soviet symbols still dominate the landscape, reflecting a persistent nostalgia for a vanished political order. This attachment has left Transnistrians particularly vulnerable, reinforcing the perception that they are orphans of history, frozen in a moment that no longer exists.View image in fullscreenVarvara Dobish, 84, lives in the village of Slobodezia.

This ambiguity deepens their sense of abandonment, as they officially belong to no clearly defined nation.View image in fullscreenAnna Vernichesco, 29 years old, lives in Bendery.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Yulia, 31, is seven months pregnant. Right: teenagers who have escaped from a wedding play on a Russian CY 06-71 steam locomotive dating from the revolution, which serves as an often-closed museum.Because of its murky legal status and lack of international oversight, Transnistria quickly became a haven for smuggling and organised crime in the 1990s. Its “grey zone” position allowed illicit trade – from weapons and fuel to cigarettes and alcohol – to flourish, turning the region into one of post-Soviet Europe’s most notorious black markets.Over time, much of the local economy fell under the control of Sheriff, a powerful and shadowy conglomerate that dominates everything from supermarkets and petrol stations to the media and a football club. Today, Sheriff’s influence is so pervasive that many residents say the company wields more authority than the government itself.View image in fullscreenThe only boat in Tiraspol that allows for navigation on the Dniester and visits around the city is often docked due to a lack of visitors. It sets sail only when the 20-passenger minimum is reached. Generally during the week the boat remains docked, waiting for passengers.View image in fullscreenThe boat’s owner waits for passengers.View image in fullscreenVitaliy, 40, Natasha, 43, Vlad, 17, and Bogdan, 11, a family living in Tiraspol.Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 brought a new level of insecurity to Transnistria, plunging the already fragile region into a fresh political and economic crisis. For decades, Transnistria survived on virtually free gas supplied by Russia through pipelines running across Ukraine. After the invasion, those flows were severely disrupted, forcing the closure of almost all industrial enterprises.View image in fullscreenA diner watches old Soviet TV programmes in the Stolobka restaurant in Tiraspol. This USSR canteen welcomes locals and the odd tourist.The Russian military presence in Transnistria has fuelled nervousness in Moldova, where officials fear Moscow could use the enclave to open a new front in its war against the west. Since coming to power in 2020, Moldova’s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, has vowed to steer the country firmly away from Russia’s influence – a stance that has deepened friction with the pro-Russian authorities in Transnistria, long seen as a thorn in the side of Moldova’s bid to join the European Union.View image in fullscreenA new Sheriff supermarket in the town of Rîbnița.

Traditional clothing holds significant importance in Slavic culture.Still, there are signs of a growing appetite among ordinary Transnistrians to distance themselves from the Kremlin, and increasing discussion in Moldova about a possible future reunification with its restive neighbour. In September parliamentary elections, a record one-third of Transnistrians cast their ballots for Moldova’s pro-EU PAS party, as deepening economic hardship has driven many to seek greater stability and a return to some sense of normality.View image in fullscreenLudmila, Luba and Svetlana live in the village of Rogi, on the Moldovan border.

You really do love this stuff – and as someone who believes beans on toast to be the perfect meal, I heartily approve.Morphy Richards’ nifty microwave toastie maker so impressed our writer Joanne Gould that it was her product of the year in ourFilter anniversaryroundup, where she admitted it had to be “prised out of my cold, dead hands” (how very Halloween) to donate to charity. Hang on, though – microwave toast? The Mico’s metal plates slot inside a silicone case for “toasting” croissants, bagels, toasted sandwiches or plain old toast, explained Joanne in ourguide to the best toastie makers. A genuinely ingenious gadget for less than £30.The ultimate toasterView image in fullscreenDualit four-slice classic toaster£220 at John LewisDualit’s achingly handsome four-slice model was the most expensive in ourguide to the best toasters, but it proved to be your favourite – and not just because it looks so good. “There are few things that can go wrong” with this UK-made classic, wrote Rachel Ogden, “and if they do, every part can be replaced”. You can heat up as few or as many of its four slots as you need, and lift slices easily to check progress. Ultimately, declared Rachel, it’s “everything you could ask for in a toaster”.The Velcro rollers making wavesView image in fullscreenSelf-grip rollers£12 at HershesonsThe popularity of Velcro rollers gladdens the heart of our beauty columnist, Sali Hughes, and sees £50 premium sets sell out regularly, she wrote inher recent column. Little wonder that her own favourite set, a snip at £12 from Hershesons, scored a win with you too. The self-grip rollers “work wonders in lifting roots and adding movement to lank, flattened hair” and cause “less hair damage than other styling tools”. Lank, flattened hair, you say?

Bobbly woollens are easy to fix, though. A depiller (AKA fabric shaver) does for your jumpers what a depilator does for your legs, but more cheaply and much less painfully. Russell Hobbs’ depiller was nestled right at the bottom of ourwomen’s autumn fashion updates, but you loved it more than anything else on the list.The heated throw you’ll want all to yourselfView image in fullscreenDunelm fleece electric throw£32 at DunelmElectric blankets used to be sturdy, wired underblankets that never reached your feet and always made you worry you’d burn the house down overnight. Today’sbest electric blanketsspan a far broader (and safer) range, from heated double duvets to king-size throws with timers and different heat settings for each side of the bed. Seems you’d rather have a whole blanket to yourself, though, because your favourite was a smooth fleece throw that writer Emily Peck judged great value and “perfect for one person”.The Dior-alike rugby shirtView image in fullscreenCotton rugby shirt£45 at John LewisAfter spotting a solid, no-stripe, white collar rugby shirt on new Dior designer Jonathan Anderson’s Instagram, Jess Cartner-Morley “instantly wanted to find a rugby shirt to wear like that,” she wrote in herguide to October’s style essentials. So did you, judging by how many of you snapped up John Lewis’s £45 lookalike. “This is so chic and preppy but not in an annoying way,” wrote Jess. “It’s menswear, so size down.” (Unless you’re a man, of course.)The chic wireless table lampView image in fullscreenRechargeable LED lamp£24 at DuskThe big light is the enemy of comfy cocooning. Ourguide to getting cosyoffers many ways to bathe in the softer glow of table lamps, including models with light temperature options, remote controls and custom lampshades.

The list was packed with stylish ways to get your serotonin-boosting kicks as the nights draw in, from Nordic knitwear to jazzy slippers, but Uniqlo’s slouchy, pocket-filled bag was your favourite accessory.

This Lookfantastic calendar offers 17 full-size products and 11 minis for much less than the items are worth individually. Sarah loved its “balance of indulgent skincare, body care essentials, universally useful makeup, hair care and accessories”, and picked out highlights including the Medik8 Hydr8 B5 Intense serum, ideal for winter-stressed skin, and a Ren Clean Skincare Radiance eye cream that’s “perfect for mornings when you’ve burned the candle at both ends”.The 10-minute DIY manicure that worksView image in fullscreenMylee gel nail wraps£13.99 at Mylee£13.99 at SuperdrugThe product that finally ended Jess Cartner-Morley’s run of terrible luck with Instagram buys, these flexible, nail-shaped stickers of shiny gel polish were another of your favourites from herOctober style essentials. They come in all manner of finishes – “solid colours, ombre, squiggles, whatever your little heart desires” – and you simply press them on to your nails and trim to match the length, no UV lamp required. “On me, these last a week, rather than the fortnight it claims on the packet, but I’m thrilled with that,” wrote Jess.The Ninja slow cookerView image in fullscreenNinja Foodi 8-in-1 slow cooker£149 at Ninja£149 at John LewisSometimes, when it’s really miserable out and you’re really miserable in, a slice of toast won’t cut it. You need “anything from pie and pancakes to slow-cooked roasts”, as rustled up by Ninja’s multi-skilled machine. In ourguide to the best slow cookers, Joanne Gould declared the Ninja to be “a triumph of function, style and value – particularly if you can pick one up at a discounted price”, although a healthy (and hungry) number of you opted to snap it up at full price rather than hang around forBlack Friday.The LED maskView image in fullscreenShark CryoGlow£269.99 at John Lewis£299.99 at SharkLED masks don’t come cheap, but these light therapy devices have flown off the shelves thanks to their purported power to smooth skin, improve elasticity and reduce blemishes. In ourguide to the best LED masks, Sarah Matthews put 10 to the test and found the Shark CryoGlow – yes, from the vacuum cleaner people – to be the most effective for targeting multiple skin concerns. “The blemish mode did a brilliant job of calming spots and redness with sustained use,” she wrote. “I also liked using the skin sustain mode for a quick pick-me-up to brighten my skin before a night out.”For more, readhow to get cosy this autumn: 42 small, snuggly updatesExplore more on these topicsAutumnThe Filter UK newsletterFoodWinterInteriorsnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Now it’s what I reach for at the end of a hard day, rather than a glass of wineKelly Rose BradfordMon 3 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 10.55 ESTShareI’m like a coiled spring after work. Shoulders tense, breath fast and shallow. Usually the sound of my laptop lid slamming shut would be followed by the squeak of a cork pulled from a bottle of red, the wine hastily sploshed into a glass, that first mouthful putting a much-needed full stop on the working day.Then, a few months ago, I came across my now-adult son’s old school recorder in the attic. I idly blew into it, immediately transported back to the days it was the bane of my life – his daily practice a violent assault on my eardrums, the piercing shriek still reverberating through my head hours after he had gone to bed.But rather than consigning it to the bin, I brought it downstairs, along with a book – Very Easy Recorder Tunes. Growing up, I was the least musical child ever. I’d had recorder lessons at infant school, but never had the opportunity to learn other instruments.Googling “how to play the recorder”, I watched dozens of YouTube videos aimed at children, and printed out a fingering chart. I searched “easiest recorder tunes” and was thrilled when I managed to knock out a passable Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.Yes, it was something your average five-year-old could master before first break, but as a tone deaf, impatient and stressed 51-year-old, it felt like a huge achievement.My son asked what the hell I was doing (and please could I stop), but I persevered – I liked the way the recorder made me feel. My inability to remember anything meant I had to concentrate on the sheet of paper in front of me and painstakingly copy the finger positions. My breathing slowed down, I was focused, and once I’d mastered that first faltering tune, I felt euphoric. I could play an instrument.Now, several months later, I can “play” other nursery rhymes and a passable Ode to Joy. Yes, my timing is rubbish, and I still need to write the names of the notes down, but for me, it’s not about being skilled or a “musician” – it is simply about the pleasure it brings and the fact I can’t think of anything else when I am playing.I read that only one in six children learn to play the recorder now, which was no doubt music to parents’ ears, but it made me a little sad and nostalgic for my own school days, as well as my son’s.I try to pick up my recorder every evening after work before I do anything else, and in those 20 or so minutes, I am in my own little world. And afterwards, I feel totally energised and uplifted.My friends think it’s hilarious, but one very wise therapist friend told me I was not only lowering my stress levels, but improving my cognitive skills, such as memory and auditory processing, which is invaluable at my time of life. And in terms of my day-to-day wellbeing, it’s a real “ode to joy” indeed.Explore more on these topicsHobbiesThe one change that workedFamilyHealth & wellbeingMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This leek-laced version feels comfortingly autumnal, and a bit special, too. If I have friends coming over, I’ll make the leek and bechamel base in advance, then fill the sandwiches just before baking and serve them with a bitter leaf salad.Leek and comté croquesPrep10 minCook40 minServes42 leeks(about 300g), trimmed and finely sliced2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced60g unsalted butter, plus extra for butteringSea salt andblack pepper60g plain flour300ml whole milk1 heaped tsp English mustard100g comté, finely grated60g mature cheddar, finely grated8 slicesbreadPut the sliced leeks, garlic and butter in a medium saucepan on a medium-low heat, season well, then saute, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes, until the leeks have cooked down and turned sticky.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Stir the flour into the leek mix and cook for a minute or so, until it becomes a biscuity roux. Pour in the milk, turn up the heat a little and whisk until the sauce is smooth. Keep whisking for a minute, until the sauce thickens, then take off the heat. Whisk in the mustard and two-thirds of the grated comté and cheddar, and put to one side.Toast the bread (in batches, if need be), then butter one side of each slice. Lay four slices of toast buttered side down on a lined baking sheet. Spread each one with a generous amount of the leek bechamel, then top with a second slice of toast, this time buttered side up. Finish each sandwich with a layer of the remaining leek bechamel, then top with the remaining grated cheese. Bake for 10-14 minutes, until the croques are golden, bubbling and oozy.Serve straight away, with a dressed salad on the side, if you like.Explore more on these topicsBrunchQuick and easyFoodSandwichesCheeseVegetablesFrench food and drinkSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

Then I tasted a spoonful of rich, wine-dark paste from an unmarked jar that arrived on my doorstep from brothers Mansour and Karim Arem. They were on the verge of launchingZwïta, a company focused on celebrating their Tunisian heritage. Whereas western cooks and food writers are familiar with many of the food traditions of nearby Morocco, we’ve largely neglected to learn anything about Tunisia or its culinary history. And, judging by the Arem brothers’ harissa, that’s entirely to our detriment.Made with mild, sun-dried chillies, the traditional Tunisian version of this pepper paste is layered with garlic, caraway and coriander. Multidimensional in flavour and distinctly thick, it will be a revelation to anyone who has only ever encountered the stuff squeezed from a tube (or any other version similarly doctored with tomato products, hydrated chilli powder or fresh peppers). Once I tasted their harissa, I began to incorporate it into my everyday cooking, stirring it into garlic and herb labneh and drizzling it over roast vegetables. One of my favourite ways to use it is as a rub or marinade for chicken.Chicken braised with apricots and harissa (pictured top)Every time I’ve made this for friends, there hasn’t been a morsel left. Since I use mild harissa, even the most spice-averse kids lap up every sip of braising juice and eat every bite of chicken off the bone. It’s a winner if there ever was one. I recommend serving this with steamed couscous, because it absorbs the braising juices as you eat, ensuring that you’ll get to enjoy every last drop.Prep10 minMarinateOvernightCook2 hr 15 minServes4-8For the tebil2tbsp ground coriander1¼tsp turmeric½tsp caraway seeds, ground¼tsp freshly ground black pepperFor the chicken8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs(about 1.4kg)Flaky sea salt2tbsp mild harissa paste3tbspghee, or extra-virgin olive oil1 brown onion, peeled and thinly sliced2 carrots, peeled and cut into 2cm pieces8 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole245g crushed tomatoes(tinned or fresh)240ml chicken stock, or water2 bay leaves1 small handfulcoriander stalks, leaves reserved for serving160g dried apricots, halved1tsp ground cuminTo serveCoriander leaves and tender stalksSteamed couscous, or giant couscous, or riceGarlic andherblabnehGreen sauceTo make the tebil, in a small bowl, stir the coriander, turmeric, caraway and pepper.The day before you plan to cook, season the chicken generously on both sides with salt. In a medium bowl, mash the harissa with half the dried spice blend. Add the chicken and rub evenly all over with the spiced harissa paste. Cover and refrigerate overnight; bring to room temperature before cooking.With an oven rack in the middle of the oven, heat it to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Set a large, nonreactive frying pan on a medium-high heat and add the ghee. When the fat shimmers, add the onion, carrots and garlic, and season lightly with salt and the remaining spice blend. Turn down the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender, translucent and just beginning to take on some colour – about 12 minutes.Add the tomatoes and stock, stir to deglaze, then let the mixture return to a boil. Transfer the mixture to a 23cm × 33cm baking dish and lay the bay leaves and coriander stalks on top.Arrange the chicken skin side down on the bed of aromatics, then nestle the apricots around the chicken. The braising liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the chicken, so if you’re at all short, add a splash more stock or water to make up the difference. Lay a sheet of greaseproof paper over the chicken, then cover and seal tightly with foil. Transfer to the oven and cook until the chicken is completely tender and shows no resistance when pierced with a sharp knife – about an hour and 30 minutes.When the chicken is completely tender, move the oven rack to the top of the oven and turn up the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Lift off the foil and paper and flip over the chicken thighs so they sit skin side up. Sprinkle the cumin into the braising liquid, then return the baking dish to the oven and cook until the liquid has reduced and the skins are crisp and golden brown – 18-20 minutes.Use tongs to arrange the chicken in a rimmed serving dish or shallow bowl. Discard the bay leaves and coriander stalks, taste and adjust the seasoning of the braising juices with salt as needed, then spoon the apricots and juices all over the chicken. Garnish with coriander, then serve with steamed couscous, garlic and herb labneh and green sauce. Refrigerate any leftovers in a covered container for up to three or four days, or freeze for up to three months. Reheat thoroughly before serving.Stewy harissa chickpeas with squashView image in fullscreenSamin Nosrat’s stewy harissa chickpeas with winter squash.Feel free to leave out the squash, but, if you do, consider folding in 35g golden raisins instead.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4-61 onion, peeled and finely dicedSaltExtra-virgin olive oil3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced2 tbsp tomato puree2-3 tbsp mild harissa paste1 tsp ground cumin¾ tsp ground ginger¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper1 pinch ground cinnamon560g cooked and drained chickpeas680g peeled, seededhoneynutsquash, or other winter squash, cut into 2½cm cubes540ml chicken stock1 bay leaf1 tbsp aged sherry vinegar1 lemonChopped coriander, or dill or parsleyTo serve (all optional)Pitta, or crusty breadMarinated feta, or goat’s cheeseLabnehIn a medium casserole on a medium heat, soften the onion with a pinch of salt in three tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes.

My accountant and I have written toHMRC explaining that my tax account is fully paid up, but have received no reply. I’ve since been chased by a debt collector.EF,LondonHMRC told me that back in January, it had received a phone call requesting a payment of overpaid tax in your self-assessment account.It blithely paid the money as directed by the caller, then later realised that the call was from a fraudster who had impersonated you and pocketed the money.That resulted in your tax account falling into arrears – hence the demands for the £2,500 that HMRC had handed over.HMRC was at pains to say that the said fraudster had used personal information “obtained elsewhere”.This is an extraordinary state of affairs for so many reasons: that repayments can be activated over the phone; that HMRC,notorious for its diabolical communications, even answered the phone; that the cheque appears to have been sent to the scammer rather than to your address; and that it was able to establish after the event that the call was fraudulent, which suggests anomalies were present and missed. And it never thought to inform you that you had been scammed.In June, HMRC announced that criminals had stolen £47m by accessing the tax accounts of 100,000 individuals in order to make bogus repayment claims.It wasrebuked by the Treasury committeefor not informing parliament or the public. I haverepeatedly highlightedthe ease with which bogus rebates can be made and paid on behalf of unwitting taxpayers.HMRC denied your experience was related to the £47m heist. You use an accountancy firm to manage your tax affairs. It turns out 13 of the firm’s other clients are also being pursued after £2,500 repayments were similarly fraudulently claimed. The firm informed HMRC of your case in March but only received a bland holding reply.It seems possible that scammers hacked into the company’s computer system or gained sensitive data via phishing emails.You only heard from HMRC after I intervened. It explained that your tax account was showing a credit for five days in January between you making your first payment on account for the last tax year and your account being finalised. Into that tiny window leapt the scammer and made off with £2,500 of that credit, which left you with a shortfall.In its letter to you, HMRC linked your experience to the wider issue of repayment fraud that it had identified, despite having assured me it was unrelated.A spokesperson told me: “We’ve contacted EF and his agent to apologise, and confirm we’ve updated his record to show he doesn’t owe this money.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.They are a replacement for running glasses, open-ear headphones and a head-mounted action cam all in one, and are the latest product of Meta’s partnership with the sunglasses conglomerateEssilorLuxottica, the owner of Ray-Ban, Oakley and many other top brands.But where the popular Ray-BanMetaWayfarer camera-equipped AI smart glasses are designed for general leisure, the Vanguard are unashamedly sports glasses designed to go fast and capture your efforts as you do it.That makes them some of the most expensive screenless AI glasses you can get, starting at a not insignificant £499 (€549/$499/A$789), sitting above the £399 Oakley Meta HSTN and £379 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer.View image in fullscreenThe glasses come with three sizes of silicone nose pads to adjust the fit, which is secure and well balanced.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Vanguard don’t look like your standard smart glasses. It is clear Meta brought the technology but Oakley brought the design, fit and finish. The huge wraparound visor, arms and three-point fit system mimic the excellentOakley Sephara sport glasses, which keeps their 66g frame glued to your head no matter how hard you shake them or how sweaty you get, and they fit under helmets.There are two frame colours and four contrast-enhancing lenses to choose from, but no option for prescription lenses. A small button on the left arm near the hinge allows you to turn the glasses on and off so you can use them just as sunglasses.View image in fullscreenThe speaker is next to the large camera button and smaller action button, which can be set to a range of different functions in the Meta AI app.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianA speaker is hidden in each arm that points towards your ear for listening to music, calls or Meta’s AI chatbot. They are some of the best-sounding open-ear speakers you can get and are more than loud enough to be heard over road or wind noise. They can’t match a set of earbuds for bass but for music while running or just out walking they are great. The five beamforming mics also do a very good job of cutting out background noise, even on busy roads, for calls or talking to AI.The right arm has a touch panel for controlling playback and volume manually. The music pauses when you take the glasses off, and the volume automatically adjusts to the level of background noise, which works really well while running around roads.SpecificationsDimensions:136 x 120 x 59mmWeight:66g (258g case)Water resistance:IP67Camera:12MP/3K ultrawideSpeakers:stereo open earMics:5-mic arrayBattery life:6h music playback (30h with case)Connectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 6Storage:32GBHey Meta, take a photoView image in fullscreenThe ultra-wide camera is mounted squarely between your eyes, which you can’t see when wearing them, with an LED directly above that lights when the camera is active.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe central camera shoots 12-megapixel photos of reasonable quality and really good stabilised video up to 3K resolution for up to five minutes at a time. It can also shoot hyperlapses, which are a series of action shots stitched together into one sped-up clip, or slo-mo videos at up to 120 frames a second at 720p.The camera can’t match a high-end phone but is very good for capturing the action as it happens, similar to the typical mid-range action cameras people strap to themselves. Press the camera button for photos or press and hold for videos, or you can ask Meta AI to take a photo or capture a video hands-free.All these features, including music, auto volume and basic voice controls for volume, playback and the camera, work when connected to any Bluetooth device, such as a running watch. But for more advanced AI features the glasses need to be connected to an Android or iPhone running theMeta AI app.View image in fullscreenThe Meta AI app handles settings for the glasses and syncs media, shows language translations and transcriptions of your conversations with the chatbot.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianYou can ask Meta AI questions like any other chatbot, including what you are looking at using the camera. It can identify plants, translate text and generally interrogate the world around you. It is extremely handy for converting distances and paces between metric and imperial mid-run but isn’t quite as capable as Google’s Gemini on a phone.You can also message, send photos and call friends hands-free from the glasses via your phone or with one of Meta’s apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram.Hey Meta, what’s my pace?Vanguard’s killer feature is excellentintegration with modern Garminrunning watches and bike computers. A free Meta AI app on your Garmin links to the Meta AI app on your phone so you can interrogate your stats in real time mid-activity simply by asking.View image in fullscreenA little LED flashes next to your right eye to tell you when the AI is listening, interacting, or a photo is being taken.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe AI can tell you any of your individual metrics, such as pace, distance, heart rate, cadence and others, or the lot by asking for “my stats”, all pulled directly from your Garmin at that moment. It will also read out the pace or other metrics for each lap, mile or kilometre andcan use the little LEDto the right of your eye to show if you are on target during a pace or heart rate zone workout, turning red when you are outside your zone.The Garmin integration also enables the camera toautomatically captureyour walking, hiking, running or riding workouts. It shoots five-second videos for every kilometre or mile, or when you hit certain milestones such as a burst of pace for a sprint finish or when your heart rate ramps up on a steep incline. Once you have finished, the Meta AI app then stitches the videos together with any you took manually into a highlights reel when you get back. You can then overlay stats from the workout, such as distance, pace, elevation, time, heart rate and power, and send it to Meta’s apps or Strava to automatically add to your existing workout post.View image in fullscreenThe Meta AI app shows workout summaries and processes your auto-capture videos from the glasses.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe whole thing works fantastically, and while you’re not going to want to create videos for every run, automatically capturing highlights from a race without you having to do anything is a great bonus.Capturing all this video dents the battery life. On an hour-long run listening to music and talking to Meta AI lots of times, with 14 five-second videos auto-captured and 13 minutes of 1080p/30fps video and 14 photos taken manually, the glasses ended the run with 25% battery left.They should last for a full marathon with auto-capture turned on, but you may have to be careful with extended shooting to make the full 42km distance.For those who don’t use a Garmin, the Meta AI app can integrate with Apple Health, Google Health Connect or Strava to pull data from other watches or bike computers after the fact, including the Apple Watch and Coros devices. But the metrics overlaid on videos are more limited, and you get none of the auto-capture or mid-run stats.View image in fullscreenThe glasses last for up to six hours of continuous music listening and are stored in a chunky Oakley case, which offers four additional charges and will automatically transfer your photos and videos to the cloud while charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSustainabilityThe battery in the glasses will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full-charge cycles. Replacement lenses (£69), charging cases (£139) and nose pads (£10) will be available but the glasses are not repairable and the batteries not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. The glasses do not contain recycled material and Meta does not operate trade-in schemes or publish environmental impact reports for the glasses.PriceThe Oakley Meta Vanguard cost£499(€549/$499/A$789).For comparison, the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (gen 2) cost from£379, the Oakley Meta HSTN cost from£399, the Oakley Sphaera cost£191and theShokz OpenRun Pro 2cost£169.VerdictThe Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses for sport I’ve ever tested. They are extremely expensive but it’s very clear they are designed for runners and sports by people who actually run.By concentrating on things runners, cyclists and adventure sports people want, such as a fit that won’t quit, lenses that actually block the wind from your eyes, proper water resistance, loud open-ear audio, long battery life and good controls, they would be great without more of the fancy features.The nose-mounted camera is very good and could easily replace an action cam for many. The mics continue to work at pace and Meta’s built-in AI is useful for answering those mid-run questions that always pop into your head.But the killer feature it is the integration with Garmin, for stats mid-run and for automatic highlights reels of your routes from the camera. It’s just so easy but requires carrying your phone on a run, which is a bit of a drag. Strava and other fitness app links offer something for non-Garmin users.If you ditch the phone and use them directly with a running watch for music, the auto-volume and basic voice commands for volume, playback and the camera still work.The very high price is hard to swallow but the biggest issue is the irreplaceable battery: you can swap the lenses and nose pads but like most earbuds and other smart glasses they are unrepairable,losing them a star.Pros:big and great lenses, secure fit, well balanced, loud open-ear speakers, noise-mounted camera, IP67 water resistance, long battery life, good case, excellent Garmin integration, good Strava and other fitness app links, swappable lenses and nose pads.Cons:very expensive, unrepairable, needs phone for most advanced features, overkill for just audio on runs.View image in fullscreenThe Oakley logo forms part of the touchpad for controlling music playback and volume.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsMetaWearable technologyGadgetsGarminRunningreviewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it’s best if you don’tExams, dating, parenting … whatever life throws our way, there will be uncertainty and surprises. The sooner we accept that, the happier we will beMoya SarnerMon 3 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTShareIf we want to build a better life, we have to be able to not know. Does that sound confusing? Perhaps you don’t know what I’m talking about? Good! That’s great practice.If you cannot tolerate not knowing, you run the risk of arranging your life so you can know everything (or at least try to), and you may end up sapping your existence of any spontaneity and joy. You don’t ever have the experience of exploring a new place and discovering something exciting, because you’ve already Googled it. And you don’t give a new relationship a chance to develop because you’ve already written that person off. You plan the life out of your life, and your only enjoyment comes from things working out exactly as you knew they would.Being able to not know, for the poet John Keats (and the psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion who quoted him), means being “capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason”. It gives rise to a state of mind in which your thoughts can wander and wonder, you can be curious, have feelings, and out of those feelings can grow thoughts, and you can dream and test out ideas and explore.It sounds good, like a profound internal freedom. But that is not how it feels to me.I hate not knowing. I’ve always been more inclined to irritably reach after fact and reason. It is bad enough when I don’t know something that I will eventually know: waiting for exam results, or to hear back from a job interview, setting a timer for a pregnancy test – each of these experiences is excruciating for me. I used to tie myself into all sorts of knots, convincing myself that I knew the result would be the bad one, to protect myself from the not knowing and the potential for disappointment.But even worse is the kind of not knowing where there is no correct answer, where it is a question of judgment and balancing different difficult outcomes – where no one can tell you what to do. The only way to survive and grow through this is to get better at not knowing.I learned this through the experience of becoming a mother. I remember my good friend telling me that I had to learn to let go of knowing what’s going to happen in pregnancy and learn to ride the wave, because this was one case where I really couldn’t know. (This, by the way, is the worst for me – when someone knows something I don’t know.)My third trimester and my daughter’s birth were peppered with emergencies that turned out not to be emergencies, and then some actual, terrifying emergencies. One doctor would tell us that the baby had to come outright now– only for another doctor to tell us we could wait. It was extremely anxiety-provoking and bad for my already high blood pressure. However, what disturbed me the most was one expert seeming to know, only for another expert to seem to know the exact opposite.My knowingness was not a valuable character trait, but a defensive strategy – and a very poor one at thatI hated not knowing and not being able to trust the people who were supposed to know – not understanding why nobody seemed to know. But one thoughtful clinician explained to me that, for my particular case of pre-eclampsia, doctors knew that before 34 weeks gestation, if possible it was generally better to keep the baby in; and after 37 weeks gestation it was generally safer to take the baby out – but between 34 and 37 the evidence was hotly debated, and every doctor would form a different view based on their clinical experience, their personal risk tolerance and their own judgment. So nobody knew. It helped me when I understood that.Before training to become a psychodynamic psychotherapist, I didn’t even know I couldn’t not know. Even though my husband told me again and again (and continues to do so) how irritating it is that I always have to know everything and that I act like I do, I thought it was his problem that he didn’t appreciate and value my marvellous breadth of knowledge.But when I began training as a psychotherapist, and I also became a patient in psychoanalysis, it very soon became clear that my knowingness was not a valuable character trait, but a defensive strategy, and a very poor one at that. I knew things – I planned for things, I learned things, I got good at things – to avoid not knowing things. I thought I knew – but, in reality, I didn’t understand.Feel like your mind and body are separate? Here’s how life changes when we become wholeRead moreThe problem with knowing everything as a defensive strategy is that it is extremely ineffective. As well as being impossible, it actually makes you feel much worse. If you think it is your job to know everything, then when reality hits, you find yourself feeling like a failure. “If only I’d known!” Ha. No. If only you’d been able not to know.So I remain in a process of developing a capacity not to know. It has been years but it’s still early days. I still find it agonising, I still hate it, but I am better able to tolerate it – at moments. I’ve had to get better at it because it is the most valuable thing I can offer my patients – my ability to bear not knowing and to be interested.It’s the most important capacity to grow for my child, because I don’t know so much and she needs me to survive that. It is crucial for being in contact with reality, for building a better life, and a freer mind. It is unfortunate, but I have had to concede that this was one rare occasion on which my husband was right.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodExplore more on these topicsMental healthHow to build a better lifeHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The white path ahead of me meanders skyward through forests of larch and pine, their boughs glittering with snow. When I look back, I can see for miles – an icily beautiful panorama of crags and peaks.I’m in the Lower Engadine, in remote south-east Switzerland, thanks to a tip shared by my Swiss friend Kaspar, when I was pondering a winter walking holiday away from the crowds. Over two weeks I’ll be exploring this fairytale landscape alone, following well-marked trails.View image in fullscreenThe Lower Engadine contains few ski slopes, even fewer tourists and Switzerland’s only national park, a fiercely protected 170 sq km of wilderness now inhabited by 36 species of mammal and more than 100 species of bird, including bearded vultures, eagles, wolves, ibex, mountain hares and marmots.The national park is closed to visitors during the winter, but several Engadine walking trails are close to its borders, meaning anyone can – with luck – spot some of its rare wildlife. The Engadine’s inhabitants speak Romansh (an official Swiss language spoken by less than 1% of the population) and follow a way of life that has barely changed – farmers, shepherds, cheese-makers and, more recently, artists attracted by the extraordinary beauty of this hidden valley.The Engadine’s inhabitants speak Romansh and follow a way of life that has barely changedWithout a developed ski scene, it’s all about “slow” tourism here, with small family-run hotels, guided walks and visits to artisanal food producers. “This is a place where Swiss families come to reconnect with nature,” says Kaspar, who has been holidaying here for more than two decades. “In winter that means hiking, snow-shoeing, sledging, travelling in horse-drawn carts, bird-watching and cross country skiing. We come here for peace and quiet, for a reminder of wilderness.”I base myself in Scuol, the end of the railway line and the largest of the 15 villages in the valley, reached via two connecting trains from Zurich. It is indeed a winter walker’s paradise, with more than 160km (100 miles) of trails kept safely walkable by an army of invisible labourers who spread sawdust on icy tracks and clear paths with snow ploughs while the rest of us sleep.View image in fullscreenMany of the region’s houses are decorated with sgraffito scratching.Photograph: Sibylle Kirchen/AlamyThese routes (known as Winter-Wanderwege) are marked on a free map, available from Scuol’s tourist office (also downloadable to your phone). They’re easy to follow, thanks to an efficient system of numbers, signposts and coloured poles, and can be accessed by regular trains and buses.I decide to tackle the Engadine Way, a 77km route that runs from one end of the valley (Zernez) to the other (Martina on the Austrian border) and can be completed, comfortably, on a series of day hikes. Each morning I take a bus or train (free with a guest travel pass handed out by hotels) up or down the valley and follow one of the routes to the next bus or train stop to head home, walking between five and 16km a day. I give myself a couple of days to “warm up” by following easy paths beside the River Inn that runs through the valley and cuts through Scuol. I need to get used to walking in crampons, with snow baskets on my walking poles, and prepare for the ascents and descents to come.I’m delighted to discover that every village contains something to astonish the unsuspecting ambler. In Zernez it’s theNational Park Centre, which tells me everything I need to know about the wildlife, geography and geology of the area. In Susch it’s the Museum Susch, an old monastery converted into a stunning art gallery dedicated to female artists (Tracey Emin has her own room), while its chic bistro makes a welcome pit stop for mountain-herb tea andEngadinerNusstorte– pastry stuffed with caramelised walnuts.View image in fullscreenAuthor nnabel Abbs on the Engadin Way.In the villages of Lavin and Tschlin it’s the tiny, gloriously painted churches, while in Guarda it’s a surprise French patisserie (Garde Manger) and a collection of richly decorated houses. In fact, most of the valley’s traditional Engadine houses are flamboyantly decorated – sundials, flowers, animals – using a “scratching” technique known assgraffito. Several still home cattle and goats in the basement, while the farming families live above, and their chickens roam the streets.There’s something meditative about walking through snow: it clears the mind like no other landscapeBut the walks that leave me the most ecstatic are those that wind deep into the unpeopled mountains – to frozen lakes (Lai Nair and Alp Laisch), or deserted hamlets (Griosch), or remote bistros serving hot chocolate, beer and dumplings (Zuort and Avrona). On these walks, I pass very few people. Deer tracks run ahead of me as my path – neither gritted nor sawdusted – winds through steeply sided forests, past waterfalls to snow-capped pinnacles and crests where bearded vultures and eagles soar in the clear blue sky.There’s something meditative about walking through snow: it clears the mind like no other landscape. The all-encompassing whiteness absorbs any nagging concerns, leaving me calm and collected. Its luminosity lifts the spirits, its silence allows me to hear every flurry of falling snow, every bird call. Each day I return feeling mentally and emotionally spring cleaned, purged of all brain clutter.When I need a break from walking, I visit the Tarasp Castle (a 12-minute bus ride from Scuol) with its contemporary art collection, including Picasso and Warhol. I watch a film in a tiny cinema at the Lavin railway station (all films are in English), visit the abandoned bath houses and springs of Nairs – one of which is now a cultural centre (Fundaziun Nairs) – and theice sculpture parkat Sur En.View image in fullscreenEngadine has more than 160km of trails.Photograph: Colin FreiOn one overcast day I take the Bernina Express up to the frozen Lago Bianco – a winter wonderland of such brilliant pristine white it makes my eyes ache. I could have done more: the tourist office organises guided snow-shoeing tours, tobogganing trips, visits to knife-making workshops, cheese farms and local breweries. And for skiers, Scuol’s handful of conveniently situated pistes – behind the station – are “dream runs”, says my friend. There’s also Scuol’s legendary mineral baths – six indoor and outdoor pools including a brine pool – but I’m saving that for next time. (If you visit on 1 March, you’ll experience “Chalandamarz”, a Romansh tradition of chasing out winter when village children parade the streets in costume, singing, ringing cowbells and cracking whips.)Scuol is without any of the usual hotel chains. Instead, this “slow” town has an immaculateyouth hostel(double rooms with private bathroom from 120 swiss francs/£112, dorm beds from £41) and several family-run guest houses. I enjoyed delicious meals on the sunlit terrace of the adult-onlyHotel Arnica(where architect-designed double rooms start at around £200 B&B) and creamy hot chocolates in the bar of the Scuol Palace hotel, once frequented by European royalty and luminaries such as the artist Paul Klee and writer Robert Musil.Today’s royalty and celebrities make for Klosters or St Moritz, leaving quiet, sleepy Scuol and its network of glittering, snow-carpeted trails to the likes of ... well, me. Or anyone else wanting a convenient, tranquil and friendly town in which to rest weary limbs after a day in the wintry wonderland of the Engadine.Annabel Abbs travelled independently, with a travel pass courtesy of Travel Switzerland.

But is there any scientific proof that sugar sends us into overdrive? Not yet, says Amanda Avery, an associate professor in nutrition and dietetics at the University of Nottingham.She says there are theories linking sugar to behavioural changes. One stems from how sugar activates the body’s reward system, triggering a burst of dopamine – the “feelgood” neurotransmitter. “Increases in dopamine levels can be linked to behavioural changes, which can include periods of hyperactivity,” says Avery.Another theory focuses on how eating lots of sugar can cause blood glucose levels to spike and then drop quickly, which is known as reactive hypoglycaemia. This can cause behavioural changes, some of which could be interpreted as hyperactivity.Hyperactivity is subjective: what one parent might call hyperactive, another might just see as energeticIs it true that … cutting out carbs helps you lose weight?Read moreThere’s little evidence to prove these theories though. Not least because hyperactivity – outside its clinical context as a symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – is subjective: “What one parent might call hyperactive, another might just see as energetic.”Researchhas so far found onlylimited linksbetween sugar intake and hyperactive behaviour, mostly among children already diagnosed with ADHD. The strongest links appear with sweetened drinks containing seven or eight teaspoons of sugar in one serving, which also contain additives and caffeine, making it hard to isolate sugar as the culprit. Some studies on animals – but not humans – have shown that thosefed high-sugar dietsearly in life were more likely to show hyperactivity later on.So, does sugar make us hyper? So far, it hasn’t been proved to. Still, Avery says, most of us eat more sugar than is healthy and we should try to cut back.Explore more on these topicsFoodIs it true that …NutritionHealth & wellbeingHealthSugarfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Princess Mombi’s macabre wardrobe of disembodied heads; the psychopathic laughter of the “wheelers”, with all four limbs ending in squeaky wheels; Nicol Williamson’s sinister, vicious Nome King – all are permanent fixtures in my unconscious hall of famous terrors. And Fairuza Balk’s Dorothy is eerie to match, a perfect uncanny heroine for a truly twisted “children’s” film.gradeoneironyJawsI remember seeing it at the cinema with a gaggle of kids sitting on the seats in front of me. I think it was supposed to be some kind of birthday treat for them, but when the head came bobbing out of the sunken boat the screaming, wailing youngsters had to be ushered quickly out of the theatre as several were clearly traumatised to the point of needing professional help.marcus60The Blair Witch ProjectWas fortunate to stumble into it before it became an overhyped cliche but I was a MESS for hours afterwards. Simple premise, no fancy cinema tricks or CGI or gore. You barely saw anything.cavelier5People seem to either love it or hate it, but I found The Blair Witch Project truly unsettling. I’m one of those people who findssuggestionfar more scary than explicitness, and that movie has it in spades.JackanapesWolf CreekView image in fullscreenA still from Wolf Creek (2005).Photograph: Dimension Films/Sportsphoto/AllstarOh dear god, I still have PTSD from watching Wolf Creek nearly 20 years ago. It is brilliantly awful. “You’re just a head on a stick” has to be one of the best horror one-liners of all time.soultrumpetThere’s a really unwholesome feel to it. As someone who used to hitchhike in those parts of the world, it certainly put the wind up me. You are far beyond any help in these incredibly remote places.StrangeBrewA Nightmare on Elm StreetIt terrified me for years. I was already a very anxious child, as I didn’t know then I had ADHD. I was too scared to tell my parents for fear of getting in trouble. I remember months of lying in bed, heart pounding, thinking Freddy Krueger was under my bed. I forced myself to watch it again when I was 13, and “cured” myself, although there are still times now, at 47, when I wake up for a wee in the night and get an irrational fear on the way back to bed. I do like watching and reading stuff that terrifies me – must be the dopamine hit afterwards!GrumblebucketAngel HeartThe “twist”, if intended as such, is clearly signposted from the start. But what troubles me about it is the drip-drip of information about the ritual that led to the current state of Mickey Rourke’s character. The closest we ever get to seeing it is a slow pan to a hotel room window and the muffled sounds on the other side, but we’re given just enough to imagine how terrible what’s happening in there must be.GliderHellraiserSaw it when I was a kid and was disturbing on so many levels, not least the weird American dubbing. But a horror movie will live or die based on the villain and there has never been anything before or since like Hellraiser. I cannot even bring myself to call him by his colloquial name lest it earn his disapproval. Horrifying yet magnificent and the very opposite of the bland or cartoonish monsters populating the genre in the 80s. He never needed the cheap exploitative so-called jumpscares where a startle response gets passed off as something frightening. He need not even step out of the shadows. It is enough to hear that voice.KarisFraMauroCandymanWatched it at far too young an age and it properly scared me. Didn’t look in a mirror unless someone was with me for weeks, maybe months after.DrabWillyHalloweenView image in fullscreenA still from Halloween (1978), featuring the character Michael Myers.Photograph: Kim Gottlieb/Falcon International/Allstar‘Extreme heebie-jeebies’: writers on their scariest movies of all timeRead moreIt’s that combination of the music (still creeps me out just imagining it) and the way the masked Michael Myers seems to just appear silently as if from nowhere.

But why does Laurie go back inside and hide, trapping herself in a closet rather than stay outside? This film is like a microcosm of 1970s America and its values … the nuclear family’s dark side, and Laurie is the emerging retreat from that culture: the clever, rational young woman who outplays it.bruyereSinisterProperly unsettling throughout and has some really disturbing scenes that leave just about enough to the imagination.11LFO11Dead of NightWatching Dead of Night as a kid (when I really should have been in bed) frightened the bejesus out of me – the ventriloquist’s doll story is utterly terrifying.

The Janjaweed evolved into the RSF. “It’s history repeating and it becomes worse every time a place is taken over by the other party,” she told Reuters.Blood spilled in Sudan can be seen from space. Nobody can feign ignorance about what’s going on | Nesrine MalikRead moreProsecutors at the international criminal court (ICC) on Monday said they werecollecting evidence of alleged mass killings, rapes and other crimes in El Fasher. Witnesses have reported RSF fighters going house to house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults. According to the World Health Organization, gunmen killed at least 460 people at a hospital and abducted doctors and nurses.“Within the ongoing investigation, the office is taking immediate steps regarding the alleged crimes in [El Fashir] to preserve and collect relevant evidence for its use in future prosecutions,” the prosecutors said in a statement.The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on hunger crises, on Monday meanwhile said famine had been detected in El Fasher and Kadugli in South Kordofan. Twenty other areas in Darfur and Kordofan were also at risk of famine, it said.People in North Kordofan on Monday reported a surge in RSF and army presence across towns and villages in the state.Both forces are vying for El Obeid, the North Kordofan state capital and an important logistics and command hub that links Darfur to Khartoum, where there is also an airport.MapIn a video shared late on Sunday, an RSF member said: “Today, all our forces have converged on the Bara front here,”, referring to a city north of El Obeid. RSF claimed control of Bara last week.Suleiman Babiker, who lives in Um Smeima, west of El Obeid, told Agence France-Presse that the number of RSF vehicles had increased since the group’s capture of El Fasher. “We stopped going to our farms, afraid of clashes,” he said.Another resident, requesting anonymity for security reasons, said “there has been a big increase in army vehicles and weapons west and south of El Obeid” over the past two weeks.Martha Pobee, the assistant UN secretary general forAfrica, raised the alarm last week about “large-scale atrocities” and “ethnically motivated reprisals” by RSF in Bara.She warned of patterns echoing those in Darfur, where RSF fighters have been accused of mass killings, sexual violence and abductions against non-Arab ethnic groups after the fall of El Fasher.The fighting in Sudan has created what the UN has described asone of the worst humanitarian crisesof the 21st century.More than 150,000 peoplehave been killed andmore than 14 milliondisplaced from their homes.During Pope Leo’s weekly Angelus address in St Peter’s Square on Sunday, he appealed for an immediate ceasefire and the opening of humanitarian corridors in Sudan, saying attacks on civilians and hindrances to humanitarian aid “are causing unacceptable suffering”.Spoljaric said tens of thousands of people had fled El Fashir after RSF seized the city and it was likely that tens of thousands more were trapped there without access to food, water or medical assistance.She said ICRC staff in Tawila had heard reports that people fleeing were “sometimes collapsing and even dying out of exhaustion or because of their wounds,” calling the situation “absolutely beyond what we can consider acceptable.”The ICRC head said the world was living through a “decade of war,” with armed conflicts doubling in the past 15 years to approximately 130, and urged parties to conflicts from the Gaza Strip to Ukraine to uphold the rules of war.Sudan’s ambassador to Egypt, Imadeldin Mustafa Adawi, accused RSF of carrying out war crimes in El Fasher. He said the Sudanese government would not negotiate with the paramilitary group and urged the international community to designate it as a terrorist organisation.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Monday urged the Muslim world to end the violence in Sudan. “No one with a heart ... can accept the recent massacres targeting civilians in El-Fasher. We cannot remain silent,” he told delegates at a gathering of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanDarfurAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The film came out ahead ofPillion, adapted from Adam Mars-Jones’s coming-of-age relationship story, which got 10 nominations, and biopicI Swear, which got nine.My Father’s Shadow, which stars Sope Dirisu and is Davies’s debut feature as a director, premiered at the Cannes film festival to admiring reviews.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described itas “a transparently personal project and a coming-of-age film in its (traumatised) way, a moving account of how, just for one day, two young boys glimpse the real life and real history of their father who has been mostly absent for much of their lives”. The film is yet to be released in the UK, but has already come out in Nigeria.Pillion, likewise, had a successful premiere at Cannes in May, with Bradshaw calling it “an intensely English story of romance, devotion and loss from first-time feature director Harry Lighton, who has created something funny and touching and alarming – like a cross between Alan Bennett and Tom of Finland with perhaps a tiny smidgen of what could be called a BDSM Wallace and Gromit”. Due for UK release later in November, it is up for best British independent film, best director for Lighton and best lead performance for Harry Melling.I Swear is already in cinemas, having been released in October. A life story of Tourette syndrome activist John Davidson, the film is likewise up for best British indepependent film, best director for Kirk Jones, and best lead performance for Robert Aramayo.The nominations also include, for the first time, an award for cinema of the year, which is voted on by the public. The contenders include the Depot in Lewes, the Magic Lantern in Tywyn, Montrose Playhouse, Queen’s Film Theatre in Belfast and the Watershed in Bristol.The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on 30 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmAwards and prizesFilm adaptationsDrama filmsRomance filmsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Places will be decided according to security criteria, not privilege … this is a step further in the direction of a more democratic Chile, which is more respectful of human dignity.”According to Chile’s prison service, 141 men are held at Punta Peuco with an average age of about 80. Most are former members of Pinochet’s intelligence service and secret police.Among them is Miguel Krassnoff, who is serving a sentence of more than 1,000 years for human rights crimes.The prison service cited security concerns when declining to comment on whether current inmates will be moved away from Punta Peuco or integrated into a common prison population.The far-right presidential candidate José Antonio Kast, who has visited Krasnoff at Punta Peuco and previously refused to rule out freeing the prison’s human rights criminals, criticised Boric’s decision and accused the president of seeking to build a legacy in the final months of his mandate.The communist candidate Jeannette Jara, another frontrunner ahead of the 16 November election, praised the decision to turn Punta Peuco into a common jail, which she said it “should always have been”.Operation Condor: the cold war conspiracy that terrorised South AmericaRead moreThe bespoke prison was opened in 1995 to house Gen Manuel Contreras, the head of Pinochet’s intelligence service, and Brig Pedro Espinoza, who alongside Contreras was convicted ofthe 1976 murder of former foreign minister Orlando Letelier in a car bomb attack in Washington DC.There have been several attempts to close Punta Peuco over the years.In the final hours of former president Michelle Bachelet’s second term in March 2018, she attempted to have an order signed for the prison to be closed, but as midnight ticked by, her justice minister decided against signing the order.In 2013, rightwing president Sebastián Piñera surprised many by closing Penal Cordillera, another comfortable prison which held former service members convicted of human rights abuses. It had an outdoor patio area and its 10 inmates lived quietly in five cabins.Boric confirmed that structural works were already under way inside Punta Peuco, and an office and surveillance post were being built on one of its former sports pitches.New inmates will be brought to Punta Peuco as early as the beginning of next year, when the facility will become known as Tiltil Penitentiary.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But with opposition parties signalling they won’t support the fiscal plans of the prime minister,Mark Carney, a failed parliamentary vote on the budget could plunge the country into another federal election in the coming weeks.The country’s finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, will on Tuesday unveil a spending plan his government has signalled will include both steep deficits and spending cuts. Few details have leaked ahead of the announcement, which will mark the first substantive look at how Carney plans to avoid a recession while locked in a trade war with the US, Canada’s biggest economic partner.In recent months, aggressive protectionist measures from the White House have battered Canada’s automotive, metals and forestry industries. To blunt the effects, Ottawa has turned to tax cuts and larger defence and infrastructure spending to help struggling companies, pushing the country towards a more challenging fiscal position.The president who cried tariffs: will the US supreme court challenge Trump’s trade war?Read moreIn Canada, a federal budget is a confidence vote, meaning once it is tabled as legislation, a lost vote would probably trigger the collapse of the minority Liberal government and plunge the country into its second federal election in less than 12 months.The Liberals hold 169 seats and need to find another party, or at least three other lawmakers, to vote with them to pass the budget. Alternatively, six lawmakers could choose to abstain, lowering the threshold needed for the budget to pass. But those MPs would have to answer to constituents why there were voluntarily absent from a crucial vote over the country’s economic future.Opposition parties have expressed skepticism towards the budget, variously suggesting it goes too far in its spending, or falls short of the investment needed.In a speech to students at the University of Ottawa last month, Carney warned that “we won’t transform our economy overnight – it will take sacrifice and time,” adding his government would “work relentlessly to cut waste, improve efficiency, and make thoughtful, transparent decisions”.“We won’t play games. We won’t waste time. We’ll play to win – by betting on Canada and Canadians,” he said.The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, pounced on the address, calling it a “sacrifice speech” and claiming that the Liberals were attempting to get Canadians to accept “a permanent reduction in our quality of life”.The Liberals have spent recent weeks accusing opposition parties of demanding fiscal and policy concessions and warning the party, which holds a strong parliamentary minority, will not support any ultimatums in exchange for votes.In late October, the government house leader, Steven MacKinnon, said Poilievre was trying to engineer a “Christmas election” in order to distract from questions within the Tories about Poilievre’s future.Carney, a former central banker of both Canada and the UK but a political novice, has met with the leaders of the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois, New Democratic and Green parties to lay out his government’s priorities and coax out support. None have issued any public support for the Liberals.In a post on social media on Monday, Carney said his “number one focus is to put Canadians back in control” by reducing reliance on the US and doubling exports to other nations – a move that will require citizens to make “difficult” and “responsible” choices.Champagne will introduce the budget in the House of Commons just after 4pm ET on Tuesday. Four days of debate will after the budget announcement, with a vote scheduled for 17 November.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyTrump tariffsTariffsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyber espionage.The leaders’ conversation,capturedby TV cameras, generated huge media interest in South Korea as Xi rarely cracks jokes, especially on a subject as sensitive as espionage.“Xi bursts into laughter after Lee jokes about security of Xiaomi Phones,” a headline in the Seoul Shinmun newspaper said on Monday.The interaction was a particularly rare glimpse of Xi unfiltered. One of the only other times in recent memory was in September at a Chinese military parade in Beijing, whena hot mic caught a conversationbetween Xi and probably the world’s two other most secretive leaders – North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin – discussing organ transplants and immortality.A state media live feed of the trio walking into Tiananmen Square caught Putin’s interpreter saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”“Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and even achieve immortality,” he added.​Off camera, Xi​ responded: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”Clips of the Xi-Lee exchange in Gyeongju have attracted online interest, with one YouTube user comparing the encounter to “martial arts masters trading lines in a duel”.Lee’s spokesperson, Kim Nam-joon, said the moment of levity was proof that the two leaders had bonded during several meetings at the two-day summit.“From welcoming ceremonies and gift exchanges to a banquet and cultural performances, both leaders had multiple opportunities to engage and build personal chemistry,” Kim said. “If it weren’t for such chemistry, that kind of joke would not have been possible.”Xi did not leave empty-handed. Lee gave him a hand-carvedGoboard and a mother-of-pearl tray, among other gifts.Xi, who like Lee is a keen player of the ancient strategy board game, described the board as “exquisite”, according to South Korean media.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsXi JinpingChinaLee Jae MyungSouth KoreaAsia PacificSmartphonesEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

Locally known as Kalmaegi, the storm is strengthening quickly and could reach typhoon status before making landfall early this week, which would make it the 20th tropical cyclone to hit the country this year.The weather system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Sunday, with sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and 65mph gusts. The storm is tracking westward and is expected to intensify into a typhoon within the next 24 hours, before making landfall over Caraga or Eastern Visayas by Tuesday morning.Interaction between Tino and the north-east monsoon is expected to bring 50-100mm of rainfall to eastern provinces, triggering flash flooding and landslides in vulnerable areas. Strong winds and heavy downpours are likely to batter much of Visayas and Mindanao, where residents are braced for the storm’s full force.Sea travel has been suspended in Surigao del Norte and nearby islands as waves grow dangerously rough. The authorities have also closed schools and businesses, while coastal communities were encouraged to evacuate to safer ground. After crossing the Philippines, Tino is forecast to re-emerge over the West Philippine Sea, continuing its westward journey toward Vietnam later in the week.View image in fullscreenHail damage in Queensland.Photograph: Richard Manley/PR ImageMeanwhile, south-eastQueenslandwas rocked by a supercell on Saturday that left a trail of destruction. The storm unleashed hailstones the size of tennis balls, with some measuring up to 90mm (3.5in). The impact shattered windows, dented cars and tore holes through roofs, while several people reported injuries.The storm also brought torrential rain, intense lightning and destructive winds that toppled trees and downed power lines in several suburbs. In Sydney, the same weather system dumped about 50mm of rain, adding to the widespread disruption across the region.The supercell formed under a perfect mix of atmospheric ingredients. A low-pressure trough triggered powerful updrafts as converging winds collided, while a northerly airflow off the Coral Sea fed the system with warm, moisture-laden air that fuelled towering storm clouds.A clash between warm surface air and colder air aloft created extreme instability, with strong wind shear also adding to the intensity of the thunderstorms.This week, more stormy weather is expected, with further rain sweeping across the Northern Territory and tropical Queensland, extending down to Tasmania.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesWeather trackerAsia PacificQueenslandanalysisShareReuse this content"

Her research, and that of colleagues at the HKC, has been cited widely by western governments and the UN, and has helped to shape policies designed to root out goods made by forced labour from international supply chains. The Chinese government rejects accusations of forced labour, and says that Uyghur work programmes are for poverty alleviation.In February, Murphy was told that her work on China,describedpreviously by the university as “groundbreaking”, had to stop. The website for the Forced Labour Lab, Murphy’s small team of researchers at the HKC, was taken down – although several of the reports remain available in other, less visible parts of the university archive.In October, the university said it was lifting the ban on Murphy’s work on China and forced labour, and apologised.But the eight-month stoppage – and the abandonment of previous research – reveals the chilling effect that pressure from the Chinese authorities can have on UK universities.“My first response was confusion,” Murphy said. The university told her that a combination of administrative issues meant they could no longer support her work. But further inquiries suggested the university was “explicitly trading my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market,” Murphy said, which was “really shocking”. The university denies that the decision was based on commercial interests.The instruction for Murphy to halt her research came six months after the university decided to abandon a planned report on the risk of Uyghur forced labour in the critical minerals supply chain, and return the funding associated with that research to the original grantor, Global Rights Compliance (GRC), a non-profit law foundation based in The Hague. GRC eventually published the research in June this year.“It is a problem that Sheffield Hallam is no longer publishing this research,” said Lara Strangways, the head of business and human rights at Global Rights Compliance. “There were obviously going to then be questions raised about why we ended up publishing it.”In October, after threats of legal action from Murphy for violating her academic freedom, Sheffield Hallam lifted restrictions. But Murphy said she remained “cautious”.“I’m unclear at this point whether the university is prepared to be as supportive as it used to be,” she said.The decision to halt Murphy’s research appeared to come from a number of factors. Officially, the university gave two reasons: concern about the safety of staff in China, and the fact that, after being sued by a Chinese company named in one of the HKC’s reports, the university’s insurance provider said it would no longer cover work produced by the HKC for defamation risk. That lawsuit is ongoing.View image in fullscreenSheffield Hallam University.Photograph: Alan Curtis/AlamyThe UK’s newly updated higher education law places a higher burden on universities to protect free speech. Emails seen by the Guardian suggest that commercial factors were a consideration in placing limits on Murphy’s work.For years, the university has faced a backlash in China, and falling student numbers. In the summer of 2022, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian called the HKC – whose namesake, Lady Kennedy, has herself beenhit with sanctionsby Beijing because of her criticisms of China’s human rights record – a “vanguard for anti-China forces”. Around the same time, Sheffield Hallam’s websites were blocked in China. “This undoubtedly had a negative impact on recruitment in 23/24,” a university employee wrote in July 2024.The person also wrote: “Attempting to retain the business in China and publication of the [HKC] research are now untenable bedfellows.”Sheffield Hallam said internal emails did not represent university policy and noted that the university did not have significant commercial interests in China. In the 2024-25 academic year, Sheffield Hallam had 73 students from China, accounting for 1.7% of the international student population.James Murray, a partner at Doyle Clayton law firm and a specialist in academic freedom issues, said a university banning research because of a perceived legal risk was “a highly pernicious practice which is a serious threat to academic freedom”.On the issue of concerns about staff safety, Murray said: “To jump straight to a ban on the research seems excessive.”A spokesperson for Sheffield Hallam said the decision to halt Murphy’s work was “based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance.“Following a review, we have since approved Prof Murphy’s latest research and are committed to supporting her to undertake and disseminate this important work.“We have apologised to Prof Murphy and wish to make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law.”As early as 2022, Murphy’s work was identified as a risk. In an email about the foreign ministry’s attacks, Sir Chris Husbands, then the university’s vice-chancellor, wrote of taking “perverse satisfaction in being singled out” by the Chinese government, despite “some evidence that this may be impacting on our Chinese direct recruitment”.Another concern came from the fact that in April 2024, Sheffield Hallam’s Beijing office was visited by three state security officers. An employee was questioned for two hours regarding the HKC. According to an internal summary of the meeting seen by the Guardian, “the tone was threatening and [the] message to cease the research activity was made clear”.The April interrogation set off a chain of events that would lead to the university ultimately complying with the Chinese authorities’ request. “There was this general sense that they were … intimidated into not publishing,” said Strangways.Emails seen by the Guardian show staff grappling with how to manage the relationship with China. In September 2024, the university informed Chinese state security that it would not be publishing a final phase of research on forced labour in China. “Immediately, relations improved,” an administrator wrote.A spokesperson for the Office for Students, the regulator for the higher education sector, declined to comment on a specific institution, but said: “Suppression of research because of the disapproval of a foreign (or domestic) government is unacceptable in practically any circumstances.”Claire Powell, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which represents Murphy, said: “This is an extremely serious and troubling case that raises wider concerns about the academic freedom of staff and students at universities across the UK.”While these discussions were taking place, Murphy was on leave, working for the US government to implement legislation that blocks the import of goods from Xinjiang because of concerns about forced labour. While preparing to return to the university at the start of this year, she was told she would not be able to continue with research on China. The person who delivered the news was Prof Sital Dhillon, the director of the HKC.In 2021, Dhillon had written to Murphy: “We are all exceptionally proud of this body of work, which rightly shines light on the blatant abuse of Uyghur [rights] in China.”A UK government spokesperson said: “Any attempt by a foreign state to intimidate, harass or harm individuals in the UK will not be tolerated, and the government has made this clear to Beijing after learning of this case.“The government has robust measures in place to prevent this activity, including updated powers and offences through the National Security Act.”Additional research by Lillian YangQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

More than that, they had all been good to you and your children over many years, as you acknowledged in your testimony.“Not only did you cut short three lives and cause lasting damage to Ian Wilkinson’s health, thereby devastating the extended Patterson and Wilkinson families, you inflicted untold suffering on your own children whom you robbed of their beloved grandparents.”Edney confirmed Patterson would appeal during a short hearingon 1 October.

Chants of “shame”, “long live Gaza” and “hands off the West Bank” rang out.Thomas, who has undergone multiple rounds of surgery, told Guardian Australia the defence conference warranted the protest. “That event is fucked,” she said.In a statement,New South Walespolice confirmed it had arrested 13 people.“The safety and security of delegates at the venue and the wider community is paramount,” NSW police said.“Police will continue to have a presence at the assemblies and will work with protesters to ensure there is minimal impact to the community.”NSW police said a group of protesters “allegedly left the designated area, failing to comply with police direction and attempted to access a restricted area”. Later, “a group of protesters in the designated area allegedly advanced towards police and attempted to breach the police containment line”.Of those arrested, at least two were later released without charge.Supt Paul Dunstan said officers would remain in the area throughout the day and anyone breaching the peace would “be arrested and dealt with accordingly”.An Australian subsidiary of Israel’s largest weapons company, Elbit Systems, and the state-owned company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, are showcasing weapons to buyers in Sydney.Before the expo, Chris Sidoti, a former member of the UN commission of inquiry thatfound Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, alleged the two companies were “key enablers” of war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people. He criticised the Australian defence department’s involvement with the expo as a “key stakeholder”.“Clearly, it shouldn’t be happening,” Sidoti said in late October. “[Defence’s] involvement constitutes failing to act to prevent genocide, failing to act to ensure respect for the fourth Geneva convention and aiding and assisting the perpetuation of Israeli unlawful acts.”The state Labor MLC Cameron Murphy, a long-term supporter of Palestine, said before the event that he was “appalled we are hosting companies that are complicit in genocide to exhibit in Sydney”.The City of Sydney council also condemned the event, with the lord mayor, Clover Moore, urging the NSW premier,Chris Minns, to “support the course of peace, not violence”.Elbit Systems, Rafael and the Australian defence department were contacted for comment at the time.When asked on Tuesday about Rafael’s presence at the expo and links to alleged war crimes by Israel’s military inGaza, a company spokesperson said: “We don’t deal with politics.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The five-year average spend, according to Racing Victoria figures, remains $220m.The amount of money being gambled on horse racing in Australia overall has fallen sharply, however, presenting a challenge to the long-term sustainability of the industry.At least 174 racehorses died from racing or training injuries in past 12 months in Australia, report findsRead moreInVictoria, the amount of money gambled on horse racing fell by 10.2% last financial year. This followed a 4% drop a year earlier. Wagering turnover dropped from $9.1bn in 2022 to $7.9bn last financial year, according to Racing Victoria.Rather than blaming declining interest, Racing Victoria has cited cost-of-living pressures, higher interest rates, a trend towards gambling on other sports, a “reduction in advertising and customer promotions” and more regulation.Similar declines have been reported in New South Wales, where wagering revenue has dropped by 9.6% in two years. In 2023, Racing NSW reported gambling turnover of $335m. Last year, it dropped to $302m.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBut theMelbourneCup continues to encourage gambling from people who have little if any interest in horse racing beyond the day.Charles Livingstone, a gambling researcher at Monash University, said the cup was “an event for people who don’t know anything about horses” and a money-spinner for bookmakers.“This is like the grand final – it’s a great marketing opportunity,” Livingstone said. “It gives the gambling companies an opportunity to persuade people who wouldn’t usually bet to download their app.“If you’re a young bloke who downloads it for the cup, they’ll probably understand you like sport and start giving you incentives to gamble on the AFL, cricket and tennis.”Racing Victoria and Racing NSW have blamed a decline in overall revenue on bookmakers offering fewer “free bet” promotions. The tactic wascondemned by a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harmmore than two years ago.In Victoria, the number of “free bets” offered on horse racing fell by almost 10% between July and November last year. This reduced the amount of money wagered on free bets from $184.6m to $166.7m.Despite this, the margins of bookmakers increased last year from 14.2% to 15.4%. Racing Victoria attributed this to fewer favourites winning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company’s financial report said the broader sports market – including AFL and NRL – had shown “continued growth”.Flutter’s statement to theUS Securities and Exchange Commissionsaid Sportsbet had reduced the money it spent on promotional offers, but made them more targeted. It referred to the change as “optimised generosity”.Gambling giant Entain also reported “continuing softness in the underlying market” in Australia, where its subsidiary brands Neds and Ladbrokes reported a 7% drop in growth during six months to June 2025.Racing bodies have invested significant time and money into appealing to a younger audience to revitalise spring carnivals.

He was acquitted over the alleged theft because of a lack of proof, Duffau said on Monday.TheForeign, Commonwealth and Development Officesaid at the time that Lammy and his spouse were victims in the case and denied that the Labour MP for Tottenham had refused to pay the driver.Lammy and Mimun both filed complaints but only the justice secretary’s was deemed substantial and the Frenchman wascharged with “theft of cash and personal belongings”.The driver had claimed to French media that Lammy became “aggressive” when asked to pay €700 (£590) of the €1,550 bill, the remainder of which was to be paid by the booking service.The fee was paid upfront to the transfer service but Mimun insisted he was owed money on arrival and that he needed to be paid in cash, a source said at the time.The MP and his wife had been in Italy tojoin King Charles on a state visitbefore heading to the French Alps for a private holiday.Lammy was foreign secretary at the time of the incident and wasnamed justice secretary and deputy prime minister in Septemberas part of Keir Starmer’s reshuffle.Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyFranceEuropeForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

I believe that if the mission conflicts with the principles and policies of the countries that will send troops, it will be difficult for these countries to send troops.”Other issues under discussion include a leadership role for the US, a deconfliction mechanism for disputes with Israel, and whether a timetable for Israel’s full withdrawal fromGazashould be scheduled, or contingent on the disarmament of Hamas.Fidan repeated thatTurkeywas willing to provide a troop contingent, something Israel has rejected because of Turkey’s support for Hamas.The meeting was attended by the foreign ministers of Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, as well as representatives of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar. Egypt, often seen as a potential force leader, was absent.Jordan has said that while it will not provide troops, it is prepared to train a vetted Palestinian police force that would be responsible for maintaining law and order in Gaza, but questions remain over the interaction between the two forces, and their respective responsibilities.Meanwhile, continued violence in Gaza has raised fears for the fragile truce as 115 people were killed and 352 injured on Tuesday. It was the deadliest day in the territory since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October.‘We don’t feel safe’: after week of bombings, people in Gaza are losing faith in ceasefireRead moreAt the weekend the German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said: “We really have to speed up. My fear is that we are running out of time. The ceasefire is good. That was very necessary. We needed a surge of humanitarian aid. But we really need to fill the vacuum within the Gaza Strip for security, for administration.”Fidan complained that “Israel is regularly violating the ceasefire and preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid at the required level. We have now reached an extremely critical stage.”View image in fullscreenMakeshift tents among the destruction in Gaza City.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockOne western diplomat said he did not detect any resistance to the US being in the lead in the stabilisation force without needing boots on the ground. He said: “I don’t think any of the countries will participate unless the Americans are heavily involved in a leadership role because otherwise people will think there is no constraint on the Israelis, frankly.”Muslim leaders do not want their troops to be seen in a peace enforcement, as opposed to peace keeping, role, he said.It is expected the stabilisation force will ultimately be run separately from the new US civil military coordination centre that focuses on humanitarian work.The sources also suggested candidates to join a new committee of Palestinian technocrats to administer the territory had been selected, and were being vetted to ensure they are credible with civic society in Gaza.On the disarmament of Hamas the diplomat said there was still a lot to be worked out. “The only Hamas stipulation is they are not going to disarm in circumstances where they are going to be get killed by the Israelis.”The US has not agreed with Israel that Hamas is deliberately delaying the return of Israeli bodies, and it is expected that some will never be discovered in the rubble of Gaza.Pressure for progress is growing among Arab states concerned about a security vacuum. The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said: “It is imperative that we have a timeline for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel cannot stay in 53% of Gaza and then expect security to be achieved.”Safadi said it was imperative to establish a deconfliction mechanism, adding: “You cannot have the International Stabilization Force doing the policing of the Palestinian community.”He added the apolitical “technocratic commission somehow has to be linked to the Palestinian Authority because this was the means to ensure that Gaza remains part of the occupied Palestinian territory”.Another western diplomat accepted that the failure to improve Palestinians’ lives since the ceasefire was deeply worrying, but denied there was a US plan to let Israel split Gaza. But they added: “Most people do not give this a huge chance of success to be honest, but things are moving along much better than anticipated.“What Gazans want is an international element being in support of a Palestinian government in Gaza, rather than it being taken over by internationals. On the other hand without an international element around security and governance then the Israelis will never treat the thing seriously and therefore Gaza will never get the space and capacity to be rebuilt as people want.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warTurkeyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There are about 23 million Shein customers in France, one of its biggest European markets.But with vast banners forSheindraped across the building, the brand’s arrival has sparked outrage over the promotion of fast fashion.The office of the French minister for small businesses said Shein’s Paris presence sent “a bad signal that should be avoided”. Several leading independent French fashion brands have pulled their products from the BHV store in protest.“There would be no sense being sold in the same shop as Shein,” Guillaume Alcan, a co-founder of the French ethical footwear brand Odaje, told Le Monde.Disneyland Paris abandoned plans to open a Christmas pop-up store in BHV and pulled out of creating themed window displays for the end-of-year holidays, saying “conditions were no longer in place” to “calmly hold Christmas events” at the location.View image in fullscreenShein branding on the outside the department store building.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersAfter Shein’s arrival was announced, aFrench state-owned bank pulled out of talks with the operator of the department store to buy the building. Paris city hall blocked plans for a Paris rugby stadium to carry the BHV logo.BHV staff have staged strikes and street protests in recent weeks.Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj, Paris’s Communist deputy mayor in charge of commerce, said of Shein’s arrival: “We are totally against this. It is the complete opposite of Paris’s policy to develop independent shops and support products that are made inFrance.”Ian Brossat, a Communist party senator in Paris, said: “Shein coming to BHV is a real provocation, particularly since the national assembly and senate recently approved a law to restrictultra-fast fashion.”Shein, which has defended its labour and environmental policies, has said its presence in France will attract younger shoppers and boost other high street businesses. It will also open permanent shops in the French cities of Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges inside Galeries Lafayette department stores, which are operated by the same group that manages Paris’s BHV.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

France’s anti-fraud unit reported the presence of the dolls on Shein’s e-commerce site this weekend.“These horrible items are illegal,” Lescure told the BFM TV channel, promising a judicial investigation. Shein told Reuters: “The products in question were immediately removed from the platform as soon as we became aware of these major shortcomings.”In a statement on Monday, Shein announced it was imposing a “total ban on sex-doll-type products” and had deleted all listings and images linked to them.France has already fined Shein three times in 2025 for a total of €191m (£167m). The biggest fine, of €150m, was imposed for failing to comply with online cookie legislation. The company is contesting this. Other fines were issued for false advertising, misleading information and not declaring the presence of plastic microfibres in its products.The European Commission is investigating Shein over risks linked to illegal products. Shein said at the start of the investigation earlier this year that it welcomed “efforts that enhance trust and safety for European consumers when shopping online”. In May, the company said it had “intensified its product safety and quality controls”.Explore more on these topicsSheinFranceParisFashion industryEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The victim was hospitalised with injuries including broken ribs, a punctured lung and rectal damage, according to the indictment, and Tomer-Yerushalmi launched an investigation.The government and far-right politicians and pundits have accused her of damaging Israel’s global standing by pursing the case and releasing the video, in effect casting her efforts to prosecute extreme violence as a project to undermine the state.“The incident in Sde Teiman caused immense damage to the image of the state of Israel and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a statement on Sunday. “This is perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the state of Israel has experienced since its establishment.”After the first detentions of soldiers in the case in summer 2024, a far-right mob gathered outside Sde Teiman calling for the investigation to be dropped. Some of the protesters – including a minister and two members of the Knesset –broke into the base.Tomer-Yerushalmi leaked the video in August 2024 after the protests, saying in her resignation letter that it was “an attempt to debunk false propaganda against army law enforcement bodies”.Days later, five soldiers were charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm. They have not been named and arecurrently not in custody or under any legal restrictions, Israeli media reported.Tomer-Yerushalemi subsequently refused to open or advance investigations into other cases of possible war crimes by the Israeli military, because of the pressure of public attacks over the case, Haaretzreported.There has been only oneconvictionof an Israeli soldier for assaulting Palestinians in detention during the war, althoughwidespread torture and abusehave been documented in Israel’s jail system, and dozens of Palestinians have died in captivity.No soldiers have been charged for killing civilians in Gaza, even after high-profile attacks that prompted international outrage, including the killing ofparamedicsand strikes on ateamfrom the World Central Kitchen charity. Tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians in Gaza have been killed in attacks and airstrikes over two years.Attacks on Tomer-Yerushalemi over the Sde Teiman affair intensified in recent days amid reports that she was responsible for leaking the video. There were official demands for her to step down and personal threats online, even after she announced her resignation.The campaign briefly halted on Sunday afternoon amid fears for her life, after her partner reported her missing to the police and her car was found empty at a beach in the Tel Aviv area with a note inside, Israeli media reported.Then she was found, and within minutes the attacks resumed. The far-right commentator Yinon Magal posted on X, “we can proceed with the lynching”, adding a winking emoji.Soon after, protesters had gathered outside her house, Israeli media reported, shouting slogans including “we will give you no peace”. The defence minister, Israel Katz, later accused her of “spreading blood libels”.Traditionally Israel’s government and military have considered the existence of an independent judiciary a crucial barrier to international legal tribunals investigating Israel for alleged abuses against Palestinians.Where there is a robust national legal system willing and able to investigate and prosecute crimes, international courts are less likely to have jurisdiction to intervene.“Don’t they understand we had no choice? That the only way to address the wave of international legal proceedings is by proving we can investigate ourselves?” the investigative reporter Ronen Bergman quoted the advocate general telling colleagues six weeks ago, in a report for Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.In recent decades many Israelis have seen the role of the military advocate general “as protecting soldiers from prosecution abroad”, said Prof Yagil Levy, head of the Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at Israel’s Open University.“In other words, the law is not upheld as a value in itself, but as a defence against international tribunals.”Now even such legal pragmatism is under attack by the political right, whose influence can be seen in the lack of legal accountability for soldiers’ conduct in Gaza over the past two years, Levy added.“During the war, the advocate general gave the army a free hand in Gaza, for example, regarding the unprecedented collateral damage from airstrikes,” he said.“This reflects a far weaker commitment to international law, with some on the right claiming that Israel is exempt from respecting it, and even providing religious justifications for this view.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

After Sunday’s handover, the bodies of eight Israelis and other nationals remain in Gaza.Hamas have released one or two bodies every few days and have said that the massive destruction of Gaza has hindered the search for further remains. Israel has accused the group of deliberately slowing the handovers.Gaza’s health system has been largely destroyed during the two-year conflict and authorities there have struggled to identify remains returned by Israel without DNA kits or other specialist equipment.Only 75 of the bodies transferred since the ceasefire began have been identified, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which has posted online photos of remains in the hope relatives will recognise them. Some families hoping to bury loved ones are trying to identify them by fragments of clothes.It is unclear if the Palestinians whose remains have been returned by Israel were killed inside Israel during the Hamas-led attack in 2023 that triggered the war, died in Israeli custody as detainees, or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.Thedisputes over the recovery and handover of bodies of hostageshas been one of the many challenges facing Donald Trump’s plan to definitively end the conflict.Significant obstacles still lie ahead, including the future administration of Gaza and the demand for Hamas to disarm.Trump’s 20-point plan includes the formation of aninternational stabilisation forceof Arab and other partners that would work with Egypt and Jordan on securing Gaza’s borders and ensure the ceasefire is respected.Turkey is hosting top diplomats from the Islamic world on Monday to try to drive forward reconstruction efforts.‘We don’t feel safe’: after week of bombings, people in Gaza are losing faith in ceasefireRead moreBoth sides have accused the other of violating the deal. Israel has launched waves of lethal air strikes, killing more than 100 Palestinians, and Hamas militants have attacked Israel troops.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday “there are still pockets of Hamas” in parts of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces. “There are actually two in Rafah and Khan Younis, and they will be eliminated.”Thefamilies of the hostagescontinue to rally in Israel every week. On Saturday night, Moran Harari, a friend of the late Carmel Gat, urged restraint.“This cursed war has taken so many lives of dear people on both sides of the fence. This time, we must not fall into it again,” Harari said during a rally in Jerusalem.On Sunday, Trump welcomed the return of the remains of the Israeli-American, Omer Neutra. Neutra, who travelled to Israel and volunteered to serve in its military, was 21 when he was killed.“I spoke to [Neutra’s] parents … They’re thrilled in one sense, but in another sense, obviously, they’re not too great. But we’re very happy because we’ve got three bodies back today,” Trump said.About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas-led attack in 2023 and 251 people were taken hostage. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 68,600 Palestinians, mostly civilians, in Gaza, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and reduced much of the territory to rubble.Israel, which has denied accusations by a UN commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry’s figures without providing a contradicting toll.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

A rescue helicopter attempted to reach the site but bad weather forced it to turn back. Thapa said it would try again on Tuesday at dawn.Mount Yalung Ri is a 5,600-metre peak. It is considered a mountain for beginners with no previous experience in climbing high mountains.Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 14 tallest mountains, including Mount Everest. Spring is the most popular climbing season, when weather is favourable on those tall peaks.However, hundreds of foreign climbers come to climb smaller peaks during the autumn months between the rainy monsoon months and winter.Explore more on these topicsNepalMountaineeringSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Health officials said the numbers could rise.The US Geological Survey said the quake’s epicentre was located 22km (14 miles) south-west of the town of Khulm, and that it struck at 12.59am at a depth of 28km (17 miles).In August, an earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed more than 2,200 people.The impoverished country often faces difficulty in responding to such natural disasters, especially in remote regions. Buildings tend to be low-rise constructions, mostly of concrete and brick, with homes in rural and outlying areas made from mud bricks and wood, many poorly built.Monday’s earthquake was also felt in Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of the northern Balkh province, Afghan officials said, where footage on social media showed slight damage to the historic Blue Mosque. Several bricks fell from the walls but the mosque remained intact. The centuries-old site, one of Afghanistan’s most revered religious landmarks, is a major gathering place during Islamic and cultural festivals.View image in fullscreenThe Blue Mosque of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan was slightly damaged in the latest earthquake to hit the country.Photograph: Olivier Matthys/EPAThe deputy spokesperson for Afghanistan’s national disaster management authority, Qari Taj Mohammad Hemat, said the earthquake had struck Balkh, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul, and Kunduz provinces and had left 20 people dead and 643 others injured, 25 in critical condition.Earlier, Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the ministry of public health, said the dead and more than 500 of the injured had been brought to hospitals in Balkh and Samangan provinces. Rescuers were on the scene and the figures were changing, he added.In the nearby province of Badakhshan, the quake partly or completely destroyed 800 houses in one village in the Shahr-e-Bozorg district, said Ihsanullah Kamgar, spokesperson for the provincial police headquarters. But with a lack of internet in the remote area, there were still no accurate casualty figures, he added.Yousaf Hammad, a spokesperson for Afghanistan’s disaster management agency, said most of the injured sustained minor wounds and were discharged after treatment.map showing epicentre of the earthquakeIn Khulm, near the epicentre, people dug through the rubble of collapsed mud brick homes with shovels and picked through debris to salvage what belongings they could.“It was one o’clock in the morning, and there was a strong earthquake. When I came out, the houses were destroyed and the air was very polluted,” said Ahmad Zia, a local resident. “We were busy rescuing the injured. We pulled the bodies of two people from the rubble, and their funerals will be held today.”Another resident, Abdul Mubin, said he had been sleeping in his shop when the earthquake struck. “I saw that everything was destroyed. People had suffered a lot of financial losses,” he said. “Many people’s houses were destroyed and their household goods were under the rubble.”In the Afghan capital, Kabul, the defence ministry announced that rescue and emergency teams had reached the quake areas in Balkh and Samangan, which suffered the most damage. The teams were transporting the injured and assisting others, it said.View image in fullscreenA rescuer searches through rubble after the latest earthquake in Afghanistan.Photograph: Afghan Red Crescent/ReutersThe Taliban government’s chief spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, posted on X that the earthquake had caused casualties and financial loss. He said government organisations were working to get the help needed.The quake was also felt in Kabul and several other provinces. The defence ministry said a rockslide briefly blocked a main mountain highway linking Kabul with Mazar-i-Sharif, but the road was later reopened. It said some people who were injured and trapped along the highway were transported to hospital.In Islamabad, Pakistan’s president, Asif Ali Zardari, expressed his sorrow and grief over the loss of lives. He offered condolences to the families of the victims, prayed for the swift recovery of the injured, and said Pakistan stood with the Afghan people at this difficult time.The two countries are engaged in rounds of peace talks amid heightened tension afterdeadly clashes on the frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistanleft dozens of soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Pakistan accuses the Taliban government of sheltering members of the Pakistani Taliban and failing to curb cross-border attacks. Afghan officials reject the allegations, saying they seek good relations. Another round of peace talks is scheduled for this week in Istanbul, Turkey.The UN in Afghanistan said on X that its teams were on the ground assessing needs and delivering urgent aid. “We stand with the affected communities and will provide the necessary support,” the post said.Amagnitude 6 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan on 31 Augustnear the border with Pakistan, killing more than 2,200 people.

Though it often leaves no visible injury, oxygen deprivation, even for very short moments, causes changes to the fragile structures of the brain.Multiple studies have specifically shown brain changes in women who have been repeatedly “choked” during sex,including markers for brain damageanddisruptions in brain hemispheres linked to depression and anxiety.Due to these dangers, non-fatal strangulation and non-fatal suffocation were made a criminal offence as part of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021, after concerns that perpetrators would often avoid punishment because they leave no visible marks.Under the new amendment, platforms will be required to take proactive steps to prevent users from seeing illegal strangulation and suffocation content.The choking ban is set to become a priority offence, meaning porn sites and tech platforms will have a legal requirement to ensure UK users do not see this material.The Ministry of Justice said this could include companies using automated systems to pre-emptively detect and hide images, moderation tools or stricter content policies to prevent abusive content from circulating.Those who fail to take action will be subject to fines of up to £18m from Ofcom.Bernie Ryan, chief executive of the Institute For Addressing Strangulation, said the organisation welcomed the ban. “While consenting adults have the right to explore their sexuality safely and freely, we must recognise the serious risks posed by unregulated online content, especially to children and young people.“Strangulation is a serious form of violence, often used in domestic abuse to control, silence, or terrify. When it’s portrayed in pornography, particularly without context, it can send confusing and harmful messages to young people about what is normal or acceptable in intimate relationships. Our research shows there is no safe way to strangle.”Minister for Victims and Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls, Alex Davies-Jones said online misogyny had “devastating real-life consequences for all of us”. Every day, women and girls have their lives turned upside down by cowards who hide behind screens to abuse and exploit them.“This government will not stand by whilst women are violated online and victimised by violent pornography which is allowed to normalise harm.“We are sending a strong message that dangerous and sexist behaviour will not be tolerated.”It follows a UK government-commissioned review in 2020 that highlighted “substantial evidence ofan association between the use of pornography and harmful sexual attitudes and behaviours towards women”.A separate survey of children the same year found that most of them had come across violent or aggressive pornography that they found upsetting or disturbing, with some of them copying the behaviour they had seen online. Children who watched porn were between three and six times more likely to have “potentially dangerous behaviour” around consent,the research by the British Board of Film Classification found.Explore more on these topicsPornographyViolence against women and girlsOnline abusenewsShareReuse this content"

It said it was a crucial tool to influence policy, though the group hassince changed its tactics to stop high-profile stunts.Dan Jarvis, the security minister, said the level of abuse faced by politicians was “truly shocking – it’s a threat to our democracy. People should be able to participate in our politics without fearing for their own or their family’s safety.“When good people choose not to put themselves forward, communities lose out and the country is poorer for it.”Jarvis said the measure was “a serious but necessary and proportionate step. Targeting public office holders at their homes crosses a line – it’s intimidation, not protest, and we’re putting a stop to it.”The change has been backed by the Jo Cox Foundation, set up in the name of the murdered Labour MP who was attacked outside her constituency surgery by a far-right terrorist.“Protest and robust debate are important to our democracy, and there are many ways that people can make their voices heard without crossing the line into intimidation at someone’s home,” the organisation said.Starmer was understood to have been furious about Gaza protests outside his north London home byYouth Demandwhen he was leader of the opposition. The group placed children’s shoes outside his door while demanding further opposition from Labour to arms sales to Israel.Three people were charged under section 42 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which already covers harassment at a home address. Protesters were also arrested for targeting the constituency home of Rishi Sunak.Home Office sources said the amendment would expand the scope of police powers to cover a wider range of behaviours and to give clarity to officers.Some MPs have previously complained that police have taken a laxer approach to protests outside their family homes, including when children were present. The former chair of the defence select committee Tobias Ellwood was targeted by dozens of pro-Gaza protesters at his home in Bournemouth, calling him complicit in genocide.The former Conservative MP Mike Freer said last year he was stepping down as an MPbecause of the repeated targeting of his constituency office, including in an arson attack.The Labour MP Stella Creasy has also condemned the targeting of MPs at their homes, having beenthe target of anti-abortion protestersin her Walthamstow constituency.Youth Demand recently staged a protest with body bags outside the home of David Lammy, when he was the foreign secretary. They said the government was “allowing Israel to murder children en masse”.The amendment excludes official residences – so would allow protests outside Downing Street or grace-and-favour homes for the prime minister or other ministers such as Chequers or Dorneywood.Explore more on these topicsProtestEnglandWalesActivismnewsShareReuse this content"

Banks died of complications from renal neoplasm, or kidney cancer, said Montgomery county coroner Dr Janine Darby.Banks had been in prison since 1982 after shooting 14 people, and killing 13, including his own children, during a rampage in Wilkes-Barre. At time, it was considered one of the worst mass murders in American history. He was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and one count of third-degree murder.Banks had been drinking at a party late at night before using an AR-15 rifle to start the rampage at his home.Five victims were his children, ages one to six. Four more were the mothers of his children. Other victims were bystanders, including an 11-year-old child who sometimes stayed with his family, a seven-year-old child and a teenager who saw Banks leaving his home armed with the rifle and recognized him.Banks killed three women and five children at his home, authorities say. Then, dressed in green army fatigues with an ammunition bandolier around his chest and shoulders, Banks left, when he saw four teenagers walking to their car from a nearby friend’s house. He shot one fatally, and another, who survived, authorities say.He stole a car and went to the Heather Highlands trailer park, where police found the bodies of Banks’s son and the child’s mother, as well as her mother and her nephew.From there, Banks went to his mother’s house, who told police that Banks told her: “I killed them. I killed them all,” court records say.Banks eventually surrendered after a four-hour standoff at a friend’s house after police tried to convince him that his victims had survived.Eventually, state courts prevented his execution, saying he wasn’t mentally competent. That left Banks with a sentence of life imprisonment.The teenager who survived being shot by Banks, Jim Olson, later expressed frustration in 2012 that Banks had not been executed, saying: “What is the sense of having a death penalty if you don’t use it or enforce it?″Defense lawyers had argued that Banks was insane when he went on the shooting spree.After his arrest, Banks, who is biracial, claimed he had killed his children to save them from the pain of growing up in a racist society. During his trial, he overruled his lawyer on strategic decisions, and argued instead that prosecutors, the judge and the mayor of Wilkes-Barre were conspiring against him.Banks also showed the jury gory pictures of his victims, even after his lawyer had successfully gotten the photos barred on the grounds that they were gruesome and prejudicial.Explore more on these topicsUS crimePennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

A federal judge last week prevented the US Department of Agriculture fromsuspending Snap altogether, but the Trump administration now says enrolleeswill receive only halfof their usual benefits.The Guardian wanted to know how important Snap was to the approximately 42 million people enrolled in the program. Many of those who responded to our callout were elderly, or out of the workforce because of significant mental of physical health issues, and worried that a cutoff of the benefit would send their lives into a tailspin.“I am housebound because I need a couple of spinal cord surgeries so this is really gonna hurt me because I cannot work, and thereby earn money to put food on the table,” said Taras Stratelak, a retiree in southern California.Trump administration will provide half of usual funds to Snap recipients in NovemberRead moreReferencinga refrainof Trump and the GOP as they have downsized federal aid programs, Stratelak wrote: “I guess I’m lazy, or maybe I’m waste, fraud and abuse.”Wisconsin resident Betty Standridge, 56, said she had been hospitalized for a month, and was relying on Snap to afford pricier groceries that she now would have to go without.“Losing my Snap benefits means I will not be able to replenish my food for the month, therefore I will do without things like fresh produce, milk, eggs,” she said.Donna Lynn, a disabled veteran in Missouri, said a cutoff of benefits would force her into making tough choices.“It comes down to paying for my medications and my bills or buying food for myself and for my animals. So I pay for my medications and bills and get what food I can for my animals, Aad if I have money left over, then I will eat,” Lynn said.“This is how the government treats their veterans – it’s very sad.”Zachariah Kushner, a disabled 36-year-old living in Charleston, West Virginia, put the consequences of a benefit cut succinctly: “I won’t be able to buy food! What do you expect?”The government shutdown began on the first day of October, after Democrats andRepublicansin Congress failed to agree on spending legislation to continue funding. While the GOP has demanded passage of a bill to fund the government through 21 November, Senate Democrats have refused to provide the votes needed for the legislation to make it through that chamber, insisting that Trump extend tax cuts that have lowered the monthly premiums of Affordable Care Act plans.While the USDA claims that it must cut off Snap because it no longer has money to fund it,experts disagreed, and a federal judge last week sided with two dozen states who sued to keep it paying out funds.A NBC News polls released on Sunday found 52% blamed Trump and his allies for the shutdown, as opposed to 42% who fault the Democrats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now it means no milk, no eggs, no vegetables, and definitely no meat,” he said.Referring to theclimactic second world war battle, he said: “It’s like the siege of Stalingrad, but from your own government.”Twenty-eight-year-old Thomas, an unemployed Philadelphia resident, felt similarly let down.“I’ve paid an awful lot of taxes over the years, I don’t feel bad about getting something back for it in my time of need,” he said.Grand Rapids, Michigan resident Bill predicted he “will have to go without many things that I ordinarily purchase” and borrow money from his family.“How do I feel about it? I curseDonald Trumpand his entire party of sycophants and lickspittles to the seven[th] circle of hell, now and for all time,” the 71-year-old said.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsTrump administrationUS federal government shutdown 2025Donald TrumpRepublicansUS economyUS federal government shutdownsnewsShareReuse this content"

This translated to a gain of $8.35m per household for the top 1% of households, compared with $83,000 for the average household during that 33-year period.America’s super-rich are running down the planet’s safe climate spaces, says OxfamRead moreMeanwhile, over 40% of the US population, including nearly 50% of children, are considered low-income, with family earnings that are less than 200% of the national poverty line.When reviewing the 10 countries with the largest economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US has the highest rate of relative poverty, second-highest rate of child poverty and infant mortality, and the second-lowest life expectancy rate.“Inequality is a policy choice,” said Rebecca Riddell, senior policy lead for economic justice at Oxfam America. “These comparisons show us that we can make very different choices when it comes to poverty and inequality in our society.”The report outlines the way that systems in the US, including the tax code, social safety nets, and worker’s rights and protections, have been slowly dismantled, allowing concentrated wealth to turn into concentrated power.Donald Trump’s“one big, beautiful bill”, passed by Congress in May, has been one of the “single largest transfers of wealth upwards in decades”, according to the report, by cutting tax for the wealthy and corporations.But over the last few decades, Republicans have not acted alone.“Policymakers have been choosing inequality, and those choices have had bipartisan support,” Riddell said. “Policy reforms over the last 40 years, from cuts to taxes and the social safety net, to labor issues and beyond, really had the backing of both parties.”Policy recommendations outlined in the report fall into four categories: rebalancing power through campaign finance reform and antitrust policy; using the tax system to reduce inequality through taxes on the wealthy and corporations; strengthening the social safety net; and protecting unions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The report refers to the concept of the “welfare queen” popularized during Ronald Reagan’s presidency in the 1980s, while taxation has always been seen as repressive for all rather than as a tool for addressing inequality.“What’s really needed is a different kind of politics,” Riddell said. “One that’s focused on delivering for ordinary people by really rapidly reducing inequality. There are sensible, proven reforms that could go a long way to reversing the really troubling trends we see.”The report features interviews with community leaders who are actively working to reduce inequality, even as progress has seemingly stalled on the national stage. In one interview in the report, activists with United Workers Maryland said the current moment seems ripe with opportunity because many Americans are starting to see how the current set-up isn’t working for them, but only for the people at the very top.“I think it’s brilliant that they see this as an opportunity,” Riddell said. “I love thinking about this moment as an opportunity to look around us and realize our broader power.”This article was amended on 3 November 2025.

Afull transcript of the interviewwas later published, along with a 73-minute-longextended version online.While 60 Minutes traditionally cuts down interviews, these edits are particularly notable because, exactly one year before Trump was interviewed by O’Donnell at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday he had suedCBSover the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, then the vice-president, which he alleged had been deceptively edited to help her chances in the presidential election.Many legal experts widely dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment, but CBS settled with Trump for $16m in July. As part of the settlement, the network had agreed that it would release transcripts of future interviews of presidential candidates.At the beginning of Sunday’s show, O’Donnell reminded viewers that Paramountsettled Trump’s lawsuit, but noted that “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing”.During the interview, in a clip that did not air on the broadcast, Trump needled CBS over the settlement and repeated his claims against the network.“Actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not,” Trump said. “But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening.”During another un-aired portion of the interview, Trump praised the sale of CBS to the Ellison family and said the network’s new editor-in-chief,Bari Weiss, was a “great new leader”.The US president said he didn’t know Weiss, but told O’Donnell: “I hear she’s a great person.“I think you have a great new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise, is a great – from what I know,” he said.Who will Bari Weiss pick as the next anchor of CBS Evening News?Read moreTrump was particularly effusive in praising David Ellison and his father, Larry, the new owner of CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, through their company Skydance Media.“I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership,” Trump said. “I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”O’Donnell did not directly respond to the president’s comments about Weiss and the Ellisons.Among Trump’s many answers that were edited out were several comments questioning the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, which he said “was rigged and stolen”.At one point in the interview, in a segment that was not aired on the broadcast, Trump tried to get O’Donnell to acknowledge that crime was down in Washington DC, where she lives.“You live here. You know that too,” Trump said, asking O’Donnell: “Do you see a difference?”“I think I’ve been working too hard,” O’Donnell responded. “I haven’t been out and about that much … I get in my car and go to work and I go home.”Trump said “that’s not a fair answer” and insisted that O’Donnell noticed a difference.The president then seemed to suggest that the back-and-forth didn’t need to be aired on the show.“You don’t have to use that one,” he said. “Don’t worry, don’t worry, I don’t want to embarrass her.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCBSTrump administrationUS television industryTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Its shares jumped 17% on Monday morning, while Kimberly-Clark dropped 12% in New York.“We are excited to bring together two iconic companies to create a global health and wellness leader,” Mike Hsu, Kimberly-Clark chairman and CEO, said in a statement. Larry Merlo, Kenvue’s chairman, claimed the deal would create a “uniquely positioned global leader in consumer health with a broader range of new growth opportunities ahead”.Last week, the US health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, acknowledged that there was no evidence proving Tylenol causes autism, but repeated his view that signs of a link between the two were “very suggestive”.Apart from certain looming litigations against Tylenol, Kenvue is also facing lawsuits over claims that its baby powder products caused cancer, dampening investor sentiment.Still, Kimberly-Clark said itexpected about $2.1bn in annual cost savings from the acquisition, which it expects to close in the second half of 2026.Kenvue has tried to push back hard against the Trump administration’s claims about acetaminophen, usually branded as Tylenol.“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,” the firm said in a statement following Trump and Kennedy’s first announcement in September. “We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.”Alongside Monday’s announcement, Kenvue reported that its net sales fell 3.5% in the last quarter, and warned they would fall by the low single digits over the course of the year.Kimberly-Clark, based in Irving, Texas, which owns toilet paper brands including Andrex and Cottonelle, is also navigating a consumer goods environment increasingly fraught with a more value-seeking shopper, forcing companies, including sector bellwether Procter & Gamble to invest in smaller pack sizes, and trim underperforming business units. Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy has also heightened challenges for the wider industry.Kimberly-Clark sold a majority stake in its international tissue business to the Brazilian pulp maker Suzano as part of a restructuring, proceeds from which are expected to help the Kenvue buyout, the company said on Monday.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsBusinessJohnson & JohnsonTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Although Daniels throws with his right arm, the injury has left his season in doubt. The injury was serious enough that the television broadcast did not show replays and several players turned away as Daniels was treated my medical staff.The Chiefs-Bills rivalry is incapable of producing a bad gameRead moreQuinn came under criticism as many believed Daniels should not have been on the field in the first place. The injury occurred in the fourth quarter with the Commanders trailing 38-7, making a comeback unlikely. It is common in such situations for teams to put in their backup quarterback to avoid injuries to their starter.“I get that. I’ve been thinking about it nonstop, too, and, man, I missed it,” Quinn said of his decision to leave Daniels in the game. “That is 100% on me.”Marcus Mariota will be the Commanders’ starting quarterback going forward, but he will lead a team in disarray. After reaching the NFC championship game last season behind Daniels’s brilliance, the team have struggled this season. They also lost cornerback Marshon Lattimore (torn ACL) and wide receiver Luke McCaffrey (broken collarbone) on Sunday, and have a host of other starters on injured reserve. The Commanders are 3-6 on the season, and it would take a huge turnaround for the team to reach the playoffs.Explore more on these topicsWashington CommandersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But they know that the playoffs are another matter altogetherMelissa JacobsMon 3 Nov 2025 03.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 10.34 ESTShareOf course Josh Allen didn’t take a breath in the final seconds of the latest Chiefs-Bills classic. “You never know with Pat [Mahomes],” Allen told reporters after Buffalo eked out a 28-21 win on Sunday. Bills kicker Matt Prater had earlier missed a 52-yard field goal with 27 seconds remaining that would have sealed the win for Buffalo. Even the miss was dramatic, with Prater doinking his kick off the right upright. Allen wasn’t alone in thinking Mahomes could lead the Chiefs 58 yards down the field with 22 seconds left and no time outs. One Chiefs fan in Buffalo certainlyreminded the home crowdof Buffalo’s 2021 divisional round collapse in which Mahomes hit Tyreek Hill and then Travis Kelce with 13 seconds remaining to set up a game-tying field goal and eventual overtime win.Are these two teams capable of a producing a boring contest when they meet? Sunday had looked like it would go down that route, given the statement made by Buffalo’s defense, before the Chiefs threatened a comeback in the fourth quarter. The Bills had responded to questions about their depleted defense by stymying Mahomes for most of the game. Thissandwich sackby Greg Rousseau and Michael Hoecht showed the tenacity of Buffalo’s defensive line. They needed it: Mahomes converted on fourth and 17 at the beginning of the fourth quarter, a reminder that no matter the situation, he is always capable of tormenting the Bills.Allen was spectacular, completing 23 of 26 passes for 273 yards and three touchdowns (two via his legs). The two rushing touchdowns made Allen the firstNFLquarterback in history with at least six rushing touchdowns in each of his first eight seasons. James Cook also slashed the Chiefs for 114 yards on 27 carries, becoming the first 100-yard rusher allowed by Kansas City in 27 games.Buffalo are now 5-1 against Kansas City when Allen and Mahomes meet in the regular season. And the Chiefs enter the bye with numerous issues. They have no pass rush beyond Chris Jones. They need Josh Simmons back to shore up the offensive line. And they need more consistency and cohesion on offense. The current makeup does not appear like a group that has played together for long.Still, the Bills, like the rest of us, recognize the elephant in the room. Since 2020, Kansas City hold a 4-0 playoff record over Buffalo. If they meet again in the playoffs this season, we know it will be close, and that is ultimately the beauty of this rivalry. Since the 2021 divisional win in overtime, the Chiefs won both the 2023 divisional game and 2024 NFC Championship over Buffalo by a mere six points combined. 2023’s divisional loss was particularly painful given it was in Buffalo, Tyler Bass missed a game-tying 44-yard field goal, and the Chiefs went on to win the Super Bowl.As rivalries go, Bills-Chiefs is friendly. For the most part, it is rooted in mutual respect and quality matchups. A rematch this postseason is far from guaranteed. Neither the 6-2 Bills, nor the 5-4 Chiefs are leading their respective division as we head to the back half of the season. Even if both make the playoffs, who knows how the postseason schedule will shake out. But if the stars do align, let the streak of classics continue.MVP(s) of the weekView image in fullscreenTJ Watt and the rest of the Steelers defense were excellent on Sunday.Photograph: Joe Sargent/Getty ImagesThe Steelers defense. Pittsburgh’s defense had been so disastrous in recent weeks that fans held amock funeraloutside Acrisure Stadium, while Rex Ryan called the group “absolutely atrocious”. The unit entered Sunday ranked 30th in the league. With the 7-1 Colts coming to town, expectations were, unsurprisingly, low.But on Sunday they absolutely manhandled the NFL’s top offense, forcingsixturnovers in the Steelers’ 27-20 win. TJ Watt’s second-quarter strip sack of Daniel Jones felt like a weight had been lifted from the maligned group. Line pressure was relentless throughout, defenders hit their gaps, and mistakes were minimal. The Steelers defense held the Colts brilliant running back, Jonathan Taylor, to just 57 total yards from scrimmage, diminishing his MVP hopes.Provided this week wasn’t an outlier, this defensive performance puts the Steelers’ Super Bowl chances in a new light.Video of the week#PanthersRB Rico Dowdle got flagged for this TD celebration (even though it was only 2 pumps).It was a costly penalty. The XP attempt was pushed back and the Panthers missed, keeping it a 7-point game.pic.twitter.com/01w4F6HmKI— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate)November 2, 2025How many hip pumps constitute an excessive celebration? It’s hard to imagine this topic being discussed in offseason meetings. Yet NFL officials, who are clearly not Key and Peele connoisseurs, decided two was enough. Panthers running back Rico Dowdle drew a taunting penalty foremulating the duo’s famous McCringleberry celebrationafter his touchdown, even though he intentionally stopped at two. It’s supposed to take three pumps to draw the flag. Not only was the penalty over-the-top, but it almost cost Carolina the game. Because of the flag, the Panthers missed the very long extra point and had to rely on a 49-yard Ryan Fitzgerald field goal as time expired to secure their 16-13 upset win over Green Bay.Whether Dowdle’s celebration was over-the-top is debatable. What’s not debatable is that most of the NFL is frustrated by officiating perceived as subjective, biased, or unfair. Beyond Dowdle, this week’s top roughing-the-passer controversy came ona Jack Campbell sack of JJ McCarthy, which was flagged for “body weight.” As with so many of these calls, this one raises the question: what else was Campbell supposed to do?No matter where you stand, we can all agree that NFL officiating is a way too prominent discussion point.Stat of the weekView image in fullscreenCincinnati Bengals running back Chase Brown did his best but even he could not save his team on Sunday.Photograph: Kareem Elgazzar/AP80. That’s the number of points the Cincinnati Bengals have scored in the last two games – and still managed to lost both of them. Last week, their defense coughed up 23 points in the fourth quarter in a 39-38 loss to the New York Jets. On Sunday, they held a 42-41 lead over the Chicago Bears with 49 seconds to go … and lost 47-42. The Bengals defense have given up more than 500 yards in each of those losses. Rather charmingly, Bengals quarterback Joe Flacco – who threw for four touchdowns and a 470 yards on Sunday – refused to blame his hapless defense. “It’s one team,” Flacco said. “You need to focus on yourself and do your job. I get it, it can be emotional. I go to those guys and have good conversations about going to work and taking pride in what you do. If you do that, you don’t have time to get mad at people you shouldn’t get mad at. You can’t be worried about anyone else.” Bengals fans may not be so forgiving.Elsewhere around the leagueView image in fullscreenMac Jones was perfect in the first-half for the 49ers.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty Images-- If Week 9 was Mac Jones’s last game as the 49ers’ starting quarterback, he can take a bow after leading San Francisco to a 34-24 win over the Giants. Jones was literally perfect in the first half, completing all 14 of his pass attempts and tossing two touchdowns. Christian McCaffrey continued to carry the majority of the offense, rushing for 106 yards and leading the team in receiving with 67 yards on five catches. McCaffrey’s 61 receptions this season is the most by any player other than Ja’Marr Chase. That the 49ers are 6-3 and in playoff contention considering their entire defense and half their offense have visited the infirmary is remarkable. Brock Purdy may return this week (although that’s the same story as each of the past few weeks). If he doesn’t, the 49ers are in good hands with Jones.CAM LITTLE JUST KICKED THE LONGEST FG IN NFL HISTORY! 68 YARDS!pic.twitter.com/WGZb6O9xhX— NFL (@NFL)November 2, 2025-- NFL history! Jags kicker Cam Little nailed a league record 68-yard field goal as time expired in the first half of Jacksonville’s win over the Raiders. An incredible moment that also felt inevitable given the slew of 60+ yard field goals we’ve seen across the league this season. Sixty has become the new 50, and 70 becoming the new 60 is just around the corner. Little, by the way, has hit from 70 yards before, butthat came in a preseason gameso it doesn’t count as an official record.-- Sam Darnold was excellent in the Seahawks’ 38-14 win over the Commanders, throwing for 330 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. But the game was marred by a serious injury to Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels’s non-throwing arm. Some will question why Daniels was still on the field when the injury occurred in the fourth quarter – the Commanders were 38-7 down at the time with little chance of mounting a comeback. “Obviously like the hindsight, you don’t want to think that way, where an injury could take place,” Washington head coach Dan Quinn said after the game. “Obviously we’re more conservative in that spot to run and hand off and not have reads to go, but just the end result – obviously, I’m bummed.”-- McCarthy silenced his doubters and remained undefeated in the state of Michigan after the Vikings’ dramatic 27-24 road win over the Detroit Lions. In just his third NFL start, McCarthy endeared himself to Vikings fans by winning his second divisional game on the road. McCarthy’s modest stat line doesn’t tell the story. The kid is a gamer. It was McCarthy’s clutch deep strike to Jalen Nailor on third down with 1:41 left that sealed the statement win. The defense was also sensational, frustrating Detroit’s high-octane offense with a litany of blitz packages. Brian Flores’s crew walked away with five sacks of Jared Goff sacks (two by Eric Wilson). Will Flores get a serious head coach look this go-around?-- The Patriots extended their win streak to six after edging the Falcons 24-23. Atlanta received the ball with 3:30 left but their momentum was stalled after New England allegedlysimulated the snap count, forcing Falcons QB Michael Penix Jr into an intentional grounding. It’s a move Falcons head coach Raheem Morris called illegal but rarely enforced.-- Welcome to the MVP conversation, Matthew Stafford. He put on a passing masterclass in the Rams’ 34-10 win over the Saints. Stafford threw for four touchdowns, and now has nine TDs and zero interceptions over the past two weeks. Rams head coach Sean McVaycalled Stafford’s performance“just another game where he’s in total command.” The 37-year-old Stafford seems to be getting better with age.-- Has there ever been a more promising 3-5 team than the 2025 Baltimore Ravens? Lamar Jackson shined in his return, tossing four touchdowns in a 28-6 rout of the Dolphins on Thursday night. The Ravens’ defense is on the rise, and the upcoming schedule – Vikings, Jets, Browns, and Bengals – is relatively soft. Despite still sitting two games behind the Steelers in the AFC North, there’s a lot to like about the Ravens’ postseason chances.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsKansas City ChiefsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gauff had struggled in the first set of their opening match at theWTA Finalsin Riyadh on Sunday, but then she dug deep and slowly turned the match around. The American reached set point on her serve at 6-5 in the second set.Gauff then proceeded to hit three double faults in a row, which allowed Pegula to retrieve the break without touching the ball. Not a single attempt was even close.That sequence illustrated perfectly Gauff’s struggles at the end of a curious season. On one hand, things are going supremely well in her career overall. She won her second grand slam titleat the French Openin June by outsmarting the world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, a win that showed Gauff and the rest of the tour that her first slam victory was no fluke. It was reasonable to assume that such a win would allow her to build even greater momentum.From burnout to brilliance: Amanda Anisimova on how honesty sparked her remarkable revivalRead moreInstead, aside from her title runat the Wuhan Openlast month, the past five months have been some of the most challenging of her career. Those struggles can be attributed largely to one shot: Gauff’s second serve.While she has always been prone to double faults, over the past two seasons her serve has fallen apart.According to Tennis Abstract, Gauff’s double‑fault rate, the amount of service points that end in a double fault, is by far the worst of all top 50 players this year at 9.9%. The next worst performer inside the top 10 is Amanda Anisimova, who has a double‑fault rate of 6.2%. In a sport of narrow margins where matches are decided usually by a few points, Gauff freely hands over a tenth of her service points.On the court, she possesses many assets. Her defensive skills and athleticism are peerless, her two-handed backhand is sublime and her intelligence on the court is complemented by a well-rounded game. While her forehand can be inconsistent, all evidence suggests that the quality of her second serve will probably determine just how far she can go in her career. Gauff leads the tour for success in return games, winning 46.8% of her return games this year, and she has won a respectable 68.6% of first‑serve points, which places her at No 12 in the top 50.The problems begin with her second serve. Gauff is the sixth-worst performer in the top 50 for second‑serve points won this year. Excluding double faults, however, she has won the second‑highest proportion of second‑serve points on the tour. If she can lower her double‑fault count, her results will improve significantly.After an excruciating series of serving performances from Gauff during the summer, including 23 double faults against Danielle Collins in Montreal, she finally took drastic action. Days before the US Open, the American parted ways with her coach Matt Daly in favour of hiring the tennis biomechanics expert Gavin MacMillan. They immediately made significant changes to her “hitchy” service technique, particularly on her knee bend and tendency to throw her head down, in her attempts to generate racket head speed which often leads to an off‑balance landing.A top player making such a significant coaching change days before a grand slam tournament is practically unheard of and it made for a miserable week in New York. After crying on court during her second‑round win against Donna Vekic and feeling put under pressure by all the scrutiny she received,Gauff lost in the fourth roundagainst Naomi Osaka.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gauff is ranked No 3 and she has been competing at the highest level of professional tennis for half a decade. It can be hard to focus on future improvements when a player is expected to win nearly every match they play. However, she is still only 21 years old and she should still be focusing on her development as a player. She clearly understands this.Despite her defeat against Pegula, Gauff still has the chance to advance from the group stages of the WTA Finals, where she is the defending champion. However, how her game evolves in the coming years is far more important. An obvious point of reference is Sabalenka, whose serve was a disaster three years ago.On numerous occasions in 2022, unable to control her second serve, Sabalenka resorted to hitting underarm second serves. This year, her double‑fault rate of 3.1% is the third lowest inside the top 50. It will take some time for Gauff to see if her work with MacMillan will also yield long-term improvements but, if they are even half as successful as the best player in the world, there will be many more big titles to come.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffWTA FinalsTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they are still to mount a title challenge since the Public Investment Fund came knockingSign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson hereJonathan WilsonMon 3 Nov 2025 10.55 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 10.57 ESTShareEddie Howe is not a manager given to histrionics or grand public pronouncements. So by his standards, his press conference afterSunday’s 3-1 defeatto lowly West Ham counts as a furious tirade. His side took an early lead but West Ham were ahead by half-time, as well as hitting the post and having a penalty overturned by VAR, leading Howe to make a triple change at the break.“That was the frustrating thing about the first half,” Howe said. “I almost could have taken anyone off and I think that was a reflection of where we were in that moment in the game and it’s very, very rare for me to feel that way. In fact, I don’t think I have since I’ve been manager of Newcastle, so I felt the team needed some shaking up at half-time. That’s why I did what I did.”Anthony Gordon, Nick Woltemade and Emil Krafth all came off at half-time and Newcastle did stabilise to an extent in the second half, without ever really looking like they might get back into the game against a side that had won only one of their previous nine league matches. Givenhow packed the centre of the table is, with just three points separating third from 11th, and nine points between second and 17th, a run of 12 points from 10 games has not left Newcastle adrift but, equally, they cannot finish the season 13th.The problem to an extent is one of perception. In the Saudi Public Investment Fund, Newcastle have the richest owners in the world. The expectation when the PIFbought 80% of the club in 2021was that it would have a transformative effect, as Roman Abramovich had at Chelsea or Sheikh Mansour had at Manchester City. The difference is that both of those owners took over before the advent of financial fair play regulations (and the ongoing charges against City relate to whether they breached those regulations once they were in place).Profit and sustainability regulations restrict the capacity of owners, however rich, to spend money on their teams and so in that sense probably would have slowed any Saudi attempt to raise Newcastle to the level of City. But there is no need for Newcastle’s spending to have been quite as cautious as it has been; they could have spent more andremained within the threshold– or just accepted a relatively meagre Uefa fine given their big problem is more with the European than the Premier League regulation.Besides which, infrastructure spending is exempted from PSR calculations; the easiest way to raise income to create more PSR headroom would be to extend or redevelop the stadium. Given the location of St James’ Park, with listed buildings on two sides, in reality that probably means building an entirely new stadium. There was talk in March of potentially making the short move to Leazes Park –opposition from local groupscould surely have been overcome with a promise to build a new park on the current stadium site – but there has been no movement on that proposal. There has been significant retrenchment from the PIF on a range of projects as it refocuses on domestic affairs; the attitude to Newcastle seems entirely in keeping with that change of approach.The Alexander Isak sagawas born of that tension. A more confident management could have portrayed his sale as necessary to release capital for further investment; instead there was a vain attempt to keep him. That meant that Newcastle began the season amid a sense of frustration despite the signings of Woltemade, Yoane Wissa, Jacob Ramsey, Malick Thiaw and Anthony Elanga. The start was indifferent: one win in their first six games.But it seemed a corner had been turned. They had won five in six before Sunday, a run that included demolitions of Union Saint-Gilloise and Benfica in the Champions League. That’s why the performance against West Ham was such a shock. The problem perhaps is that Newcastle’s style is very aggressive, very high-octane; a slight drop-off in energy can have profound consequences. Perhaps the strain of Premier League, Champions League and Carabao Cup, five games in 15 days, had got to them. Woltemade started all five of those games and looked particularly weary.That’s the nature of modern football. Managers have to be prepared to rotate. Howe has been unfortunate that Wissa’s injury has left him short of attacking options but, no matter how valid the explanations, Sunday’s performance was inexcusable –especially after taking the lead at a ground primed to turn on its own side.Howe will hope it was just a blip, one of those days when everybody is off-colour simultaneously, but if Newcastle are to qualify for the Champions League next season, let alone one day mount an actual title challenge, they cannot be as inconsistent as this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They led Sporting 3-0 at half-time of the home leg, but conceded twice in the second half and won only 3-2.A strike meant it took them two days to fly to Lisbon for the second leg on 3 November 1971. Colin Stein twice cancelled out Portuguese goals and with three minutes remaining Rangers led 5-4 on aggregate. But they then conceded to Pedro Gomes. Ronnie McKinnon broke his leg but Willie Henderson’s strike in extra-time restored the Rangers lead. With five minutes remaining, though, Fernando Peres struck for Sporting: 6-6. Rangers collapsed in the shoot-out, missing four penalties out of four.Sporting were through. Or so it seemed, until a journalist pointed out that the Dutch referee, Lau van Ravens, had failed to apply the away goals rule, which had been introduced in the competition that season. Rangers had won. Reprieved, they went on to lift their only European title, beating Dinamo Moscow in Barcelona in a game that ended in rioting.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

But it was sweet while it lastedColin HorganMon 3 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 05.02 ESTShareThe first time the Blue Jays won aWorld Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday ina heartbreaking Game 7, missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.It would be too much to suggest that Canada needed the Jays to win in exactly the same way the country did in 1992. For one thing, there has since been another World Series win – the following year, capped by Joe Carter’s historic walk-off home run. And it’s only been six years sincethe Toronto Raptors won the NBA championship– another surprise Canadian franchise victory in a US-dominated sport. In other words, it wouldn’t have been the first time ‘Canada’s Team’ has pulled off a win.But some things never change. Canada’s national mood is perpetually fragile, after all, and its regional issues and economic tendencies are built-in. Sure, the country is not on the verge of splitting up, as it was in 1992, but there is a weird, and weirdly strong,separatist movement roiling in Alberta, pushing the province into unknown territory. Inflation is much lower, but other economic indicators are so-so. The national unemployment rate is lower now than it was in the early 90s – 7% now versus 11% then. But that depends on how old you are – youth unemployment in Canada is currently around 15%. Still, these are familiar, manageable issues.Tensions with the USare not.If the Dodgers are bad for baseball, why was the World Series so much fun?Read moreBack in 1992, Canada had just signed the first Nafta with the US and Mexico. At least at a political level, there was a sense of cross-continental camaraderie. After a US Marine unwittinglyunfurled the Canadian flag upside downduring a 1992 World Series game in Atlanta, the US president, George HW Bush, quickly issued a formal apology. Blue Jays fans responded with grace, singing the Star-Spangled Banner loudly at the next game in Toronto. “The Americans are still ignorant about us in some ways, but that doesn’t mean we hold it against them,” Greg Brown, a Toronto dentist who sang alongside everyone at that game,told the LA Times. “That’s not the kind of people we are.”So much for that. Last spring, Canadians, united behind the national men’s hockey team during the NHL’s Four Nations Cup,loudly booed the US anthemat every opportunity. These days, Nafta is dead. Its replacement deal sits in limbo amid an unhinged economic policy issued seemingly at random from Donald Trump’s White House. Occasionally, Trump hasmused about making Canada a US state– a kind of threat not heard since the 19th century. Canada’s victory at the Four Nations was more than satisfying; it was cathartic. But months have passed since then, and the relationship between Canada and the US has just become further strained and stranger.View image in fullscreenBlue Jays fans contemplate defeat after Game 7.Photograph: Ethan Cairns/APInto all this walked the Blue Jays, the only other team in Canada with even remotely the same national profile as the hockey team. And despite most of the Jays’ roster being composed of Americans, this October playoff run bolsteredthe same sense of nationalismas the Four Nations did. And a lot of Americans joined that bandwagon. Some of that was simply underdog support. The Dodgers, withtheir $700m superstarand Hollywood fans,make easy villains. But there was something more. For a certain type of American viewer, the Jays became a proxy for a different idea of power than what the US has embodied of late: something steadier, more powerful, and less loudly self-certain.In a widely-circulatedclipfrom his podcast, the American commentator Scott Galloway admitted that it was “strange” to find himself cheering for Toronto over his home team, the Dodgers. “Canada has never looked stronger,” he said. “The US strategy looks performative. Faux masculinity. Sclerotic. They’re dictating trade policybased on commercialsthat antagonize the president. Canada just looks more consistent and unafraid. I think this has bolstered the brand of Canada.” One online gambling site did a non-scientific scrape of geotagged data and fan hashtags on X,concludingthat support was higher for the Jays than the Dodgers in every state other than California, Nevada, and Utah.All of this, on its face, is about baseball. But it’s also about how sports become metaphors, whether we like it or not. The Jays 2025 playoff run was another moment for Canada to express its sense of itself and to project that against the world at a time when national identities are in flux everywhere. It was a chance to make the collective memories that come to shape and define a country’s personality.Henderson scores.Touch ‘em all, Joe.The Golden Goal.Connor McDavid for Canada. Blue Jays … well, almost got there.Admittedly, the loss stings for another reason. For decades, Canadian hockey fans have watched US teams parade the Stanley Cup through American cities, the country’s most cherished sporting symbol becoming steadily less Canadian. But the Jays were winning in America’s pastime, in America’s stadiums, against America’s richest club. This time, the story ran the other way. Victory would have felt very good. Turning the tables would have felt even better.But ultimately, this was another story of recognition. The Jays, even in their defeat, gaveCanadaanother chance to see itself more clearly, more coherently. That vision will fade, as it always does. The other day-to-day issues will come back. The economy. The regionalism. The tariffs. One baseball win was never going to bind the nation for ever. But this was a nice reminder that the connecting threads are still there, that they still hold.Explore more on these topicsToronto Blue JaysWorld SeriesCanadaMLBBaseballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Back then, the club were on a downward slope. Now, things are on the up.Régis Le Bris’s side moved up to fourth place ahead of Saturday’s home game against thePremier Leagueleaders, Arsenal, after a 1-1 draw against Moyes’s Everton. A deflected strike from the impressive Granit Xhaka cancelled out Iliman Ndiaye’s brilliant opening goal.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreEverton had dominated much of the first half, and were unfortunate not to be further ahead at the break. It was a different story in the second half, as Sunderland laid siege to theEvertongoal. “We didn’t start well,” said Le Bris. “They were better than us, they were dominant.”Asked if his main emotion was disappointment, Le Bris said: “Not really, because this league is so tough. It’s a good reminder how hard it is to win a single point. We started [the season] really well, so we might forget that we still are a promoted team. It’s a good point.”Moyes took charge of Sunderland at short notice in the summer of 2016 for what would prove to be a long and troubled season after Sam Allardyce left to manage England. Moyes would last longer at the Stadium of Light than Allardyce would at the Football Association, but the injury-ravaged campaign did not end well. Sunderland bought badly, and the season ended badly. The team went down with just 24 points –and Moyes resigned.Another relegation followed and, in the dark days of Sunderland’s four-year stay in League One, it would have been hard for fans to imagine the club competing in the upper echelons of the Premier League given they were struggling to compete where they were in the pyramid. Ahead of the game, Moyes said thathe had a “good time”on Wearside, despite suffering the only relegation of his managerial career. Fans remember the campaign less fondly.Le Bris named an unchanged team, while Moyes fielded Thierno Barry up front rather than Beto after his side had gone two games without a goal.A goal was not long in coming for Everton, however, and Barry played his part. Ndiaye took the ball on the right with the help of Barry and raced towards the box. He superbly evaded three challenges before getting the ball on to his left foot and opening the scoring with a shot which stunned Robin Roefs, who has kept a lot out of Sunderland’s goal so far this season.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Iliman Ndiaye fires in a spectacular opener after 15 minutes.Photograph: Richard Lee/ShutterstockJack Grealish, a threat from the left, struck a post from 20 yards during a dominant spell for Everton. Sunderland struggled to get hold of the ball for the first 30 minutes, but they rallied late in the half, and Everton scrambled the ball away after Dan Ballard headed a ball from Nordi Mukiele towards goal. Even so, the former Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, making his first appearance at the stadium since leaving the same summer as Moyes, did not face a first-half shot on target.Sunderland, though, do not give up. The slogan of last season’s Championship playoff run was “Til the end”, and they were back level a minute after the restart. Pickford was helpless after James Tarkowski inadvertently diverted a shot from Xhaka past him after Enzo Le Fée teed up Sunderland’s captain on the edge of the box.Pickford did well to stop a strike from Le Fée which bounced off Wilson Isidor.

The visitors somehow did not come unstuck. Mukiele headed over from close range.“I think after 30 minutes, I’d have been disappointed to be only going home with a point,” said Moyes. “After 90 minutes I was quite pleased with a point.”He was asked after the game if Sunderland felt like a different club to the one he managed. “Absolutely,” said Moyes. “They’ve done amazingly to bring themselves back round. Maybe they’ve been away longer than they hoped to be, but it’s great to see them back. They’re doing a brilliant job.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Vítor Pereira could be excused for having a drink on Sunday afterhis departure from Wolves, with the silver lining for the Portuguese being a decent payout. It is the fourth mid-season dismissal this campaign – there have never been more permanent sackings in Premier League history at this stage of the year (3 November). And while Evangelos Marinakis might have something to answer for, trigger-happy owners and directors are becoming increasingly erratic: that Pereira lasted just 45 days into a new three-year contract reflects as badly on the Wolves board as on the manager, just asErik ten Hag’s sacking this time last year, coming less than three months after his own contract extension, reflected badly on the Manchester United hierarchy. Backing a manager and then pulling the rug so quickly is baffling, while a board’s desire for a “new manager bounce” so early in the season stinks of desperation and should be seen as an admission of guilt.Michael ButlerMatch report:Fulham 3-0 WolvesView image in fullscreenVítor Pereira’s time is up at Wolves after picking up two points from 10 league games.Photograph: Wolves/Getty Images2Gunners aiming to match ancient recordArsenal have won their past seven matches in all competitions without conceding a goal. If they keep another clean sheet at Slavia Prague on Tuesday, it will match a 122-year club record. David Raya may currently have one of the easiest jobs in professional sport, able to enjoy all the fine defensive work in front of him asBurnleywere kept at arm’s length. The Spain goalkeeper had next to nothing to do at Turf Moor apart from taking the odd goal-kick and watching a late free-kick hit the post. “It’s incredible,” Raya said of the record. “Not just the defence, I think it’s a collective achievement, if you want to put it that way. It starts from the striker, finishing with the goalkeeper. So, it’s just incredible to have that work rate from everyone, trying to shut teams down and not concede anything. And that’s just credit to everyone.”Will UnwinMatch report:Burnley 0-2 Arsenal3Dyche not banking on magic dust to fix ForestThe cornerstone of Nottingham Forest’s success last season was defensive solidity but it is now 18 top-flight matches since they kept a clean sheet – against Manchester United on 1 April. Forest lost their ruthlessness under Nuno Espírito Santo and Ange Postecoglou failed to resolve their vulnerabilities. Forest beat Porto 2-0 in Sean Dyche’s first game but conceded two more goals from corners in the draw with United on Saturday. No team in the division has shipped more goals from set pieces this season. Everybody expects Dyche to remedy these issues but, as he told the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, it is not that straightforward. “We haven’t got any magic wand or magic dust, and we know that it’s a big job to change things,” said Dyche, Forest’s third head coach of the season. “Forest had a brilliant season last year – fantastic for this club – but towards the end it was drifting a bit. They hardly scored a goal in pre-season either, so we’ve got a number of things to address.”Ben FisherMatch report:Nottingham Forest 2-2 Manchester United4Watkins risks World Cup snub with poor formFor all the heartwarming talk of Danny Welbeck potentially earning an England recall, little positive has been said about the man the Brighton striker would likely replace. That is partly because Ollie Watkins has not given headline writers much to get excited about this season. One goal in 14 appearances in all competitions is not the form that gets you a place in a World Cup squad, with the caveat that we are still a long way from Thomas Tuchel naming his final submissions to get a plane ticket. AgainstLiverpool, Watkins was limited to just 18 touches and zero shots in 73 minutes. The forward’s expected goals per 90 minutes is down from 0.53 last season to 0.20 this campaign. Villa are creating chances at a similar level to last season (1.28 xG v 1.32 xG) and after a sticky start had been playing well before the visit to Anfield. If Unai Emery’s system is not working for Watkins but is working for the team generally, then it falls to the player to figure out a solution.Tom BassamMatch report:Liverpool 2-0 Aston VillaView image in fullscreenOllie Watkins failed to make an impact for Aston Villa at Anfield.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPA5Silva’s squad brimming with potentialWith all the focus on the fate of his Portuguese compatriot Vítor Pereira after Wolves sank to yet another defeat, Marco Silva was not expecting that much credit forFulhamending their run of four successive league losses. But while Emmanuel Agbadou’s red card was required to allow the hosts control despite being handed an early lead, there were signs of greater fluency in Fulham’s attack as the new club-record signing, Kevin, was a constant threat. An impressive late cameo from Samuel Chukwueze – the Nigeria winger who joined on loan from Milan with an option to make the deal permanent next year – shows that Silva has options despite his complaints over a lack of investment in the summer. “Now is not a moment to talk about what we missed or not last summer,” he said. “We have to focus on the squad that we have and keep ourselves together. What we need is much more availability from our senior players, because I looked at the bench today and I saw players ready to make an impact.”Ed Aarons6Frank plays down team tensionsThe icy look from Thomas Frank said it all. The Tottenham manager did not look pleased when it appeared he was snubbed by Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence after full time againstChelsea. When he has asked about the incident, though, Frank sought to played it down. “I think that is one of the small issues,” the Dane said. “They perform very well so far this season and everyone is frustrated. I don’t think it is a big problem.” The optics were not great, though. Spurs were dreadful against Chelsea, mustering an xG of 0.05, and Frank’s authority seemed to be called into question. Should he have been tougher about it in public? Was the conflict avoidance evidence of a manager still not entirely comfortable in his new surroundings? Perhaps it will be dealt with behind closed doors. Frank will hope his way is enough to maintain respect.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Tottenham 0-1 Chelsea7Pressure mounts on Nelson to performA small footnote to Brentford’s defeat atCrystal Palacewas a first league appearance of the season for Reiss Nelson. When the Arsenal loanee signed for the Bees on deadline day, he said he “wanted to go to a club where I know I’m going to play regularly” but form and fitness have meant only two Brentford appearances in the Carabao Cup going into this weekend. Nelson did score in midweek against Grimsby, with Keith Andrews describing him as “dynamic and positive in every action” and that the 25-year-old “showed real moments of quality” when he came off the bench at Selhurst Park. After an underwhelming loan at Fulham last season, the pressure is on for Nelson to prove himself. Should he fail to break into Andrews’ team regularly, the talented winger may not get another chance in the Premier League next year even if his Arsenal contract does extend to 2027.MBMatch report:Crystal Palace 2-0 BrentfordView image in fullscreenReiss Nelson picked up his first Premier League minutes for Brentford at Selhurst Park.Photograph: Jacques Feeney/Offside/Getty Images8Gómez shows Brighton patience paying offBrighton’s recruitment is admired globally, but a key part of its success is plain old patience. They recognise that young players unfamiliar with thePremier Leaguewill take time, and that progress may come in peaks and troughs. Mats Wieffer, who is now starring at right-back, had his struggles last season in midfield. He performs an important support role for Yankuba Minteh, the winger probably Fabian Hürzeler’s star man this season, adding consistency to the promise of last season. Diego Gómez, signed from Inter Miami in January, can play a variety of roles and, after the usual bedding-in spell, has begun to show a scoring touch that can break Brighton’s reliance on Danny Welbeck’s goals. The Paraguayan scored twice against Leeds and Hürzeler continues to be “very surprised how fast he adapted to the intensity, to the demands from the Premier League”. It is no surprise that Brighton have unearthed yet another player of high talent and rich promise.John BrewinMatch report:Brighton 3-0 Leeds9Howe’s rotation gamble fails to deliverEddie Howe was not happy with Newcastle’s performance against West Ham. The Magpies are without an away league win since April – the manager described this showing as the team’s worst in that run. It is hard to put a finger on precisely why, though a lack of focus appeared to play a part. Newcastle were perhaps lulled into a false sense of security after the opening stages suggested victory was there for the taking. West Ham fought back rather than rolling over, however, and Newcastle were disrupted easily, any early rhythm vanishing. Howe said any frailty reflected the challenge of getting a side competing in several competitions ready for every fixture. This match fell between an impressive Carabao Cup win against Tottenham and the visit of Athletic Bilbao in the Champions League. The question remains whether fighting on three or four fronts is possible with the current make-up of the Newcastle squad. The irony here is Howe rested many of his starters against Spurs in order to keep them fresh for the London Stadium, but sometimes rotation can be a gamble that doesn’t pay off.Paul MacInnesMatch report:West Ham 3-1 NewcastleView image in fullscreenEddie Howe was unimpressed as Newcastle suffered another disappointing away day.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images10City’s makeshift full-backs key to victoryConsidering the amount of moneyManchester Cityhave spent on defenders in recent years, it’s a surprise that Pep Guardiola has settled on two natural midfielders as his first-choice full-backs. Matheus Nunes and Nico O’Reilly are now potent weapons for City at both ends of the pitch: fast, powerful, tidy on the ball and increasingly impressive defensively. O’Reilly, 6ft 3in, scored against Bournemouth in an excellent performance but Nunes was quietly imperious on the right, as his physicality and positioning largely neutralised Antoine Semenyo, the Cherries’ biggest attacking threat. Guardiola’s coaching is obviously paying off, which means others with experience at full-back, such as Rayan Aït-Nouri, John Stones, Nathan Aké and Rico Lewis, have to settle for a place on the bench.MBMatch report:Manchester City 3-1 BournemouthPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1015252Man City1012193Liverpool104184AFC Bournemouth103185Tottenham Hotspur109176Chelsea107177Sunderland94178Man Utd101179Crystal Palace1051610Brighton1021511Aston Villa10-11512Brentford10-21313Newcastle10-11214Fulham10-21115Everton9-31116Leeds10-81117Burnley10-71018West Ham10-11719Nottm Forest10-12620Wolverhampton10-152Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballArsenalBournemouthLiverpoolTottenham HotspurChelseaSunderlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year has been spectacular as she has reached two grand slam finalsMon 3 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 06.08 ESTShareThere is an air of calm surrounding Amanda Anisimova when she speaks; a palpable sense of her comfort in her own skin.In a sport like tennis that can swing its protagonists from one emotional extreme to another, week in, week out, Anisimova has worked hard to value the highs, the lows, and the moments in between, all while staying true to herself.A former teen prodigy who turned pro at 15 and reached the French Open semi-finals at just 17, Anisimova stepped away from the professional circuit for eight months in 2023, citing burnout and mental health concerns.It was a bold decision, given how athletes are always encouraged to push through their struggles and stick to the grind; a decision that has ultimately paid off in more ways than one.Today she is No 4 in the world and is competing in the WTA Finals for the first time in her career on the back of a banner season that saw her reach the Wimbledon and US Open finals and clinch a pair of WTA 1000 crowns.Looking back at her 2025 campaign, Anisimova says the biggest lesson involved her mental approach.Women’s tennis thriving on the court as season wraps but WTA must catch upRead more“I would say the mindset that I go into tournaments and matches with. I think that’s been the most important thing for me this year,” the 24-year-old American told the Guardian on the sidelines of the WTA Finals in Riyadh.“It helps, obviously, when I’m done with the tournament, being able to look back and tell myself I’ve done everything I can. And I’m proud of the way I competed and carried myself on the court. And that’s definitely something that I’ve tried to do all year round.”There is a lot to admire when it comes to Anisimova, whether it’s her powerful brand of first-strike tennis, her devastating backhand, or her openness when discussing her vulnerability. But the moment that truly epitomised her strength of character came whenshe lost the Wimbledon final 6-0, 6-0to Iga Swiatek in July.Tennis hands the microphone to its athletes moments after a gut-wrenching defeat and expects them to give a wholesome speech. Fighting tears, Anisimova addressed the Wimbledon Centre Court crowd with heartfelt words towards Swiatek, the fans, and her mother Olga, who flew in that morning to watch her daughter compete in her first grand slam final.That speech resonated with countless people watching, including many of her peers.“I thought she did it with such grace, she handled it so well,” said world No 7 Madison Keys, who is also playing in Riyadh. “I know being in that position, it’s such a heartbreaking situation. I thought the way she carried herself through it with such grace, I was incredibly impressed by.”What Anisimova did next was just as impressive. A mere 53 days after her crushing loss to Swiatek, she flipped the script and defeated the Polish star en route to the US Open final. At the start of the Open, Anisimova said she was hoping for a rematch and she got her wish in the quarter-finals.Anisimova lost to Aryna Sabalenkain the final in New York but rebounded in spectacular fashion by winning the WTA 1000 title in Beijing just four weeks later.“Of course, it wasn’t easy,” said Anisimova, reflecting on her summer. “I had to really work on myself mentally and just put things in perspective and sit down with myself and think about how I’m going to bounce back or how I’m going to go into the next few tournaments, especially if I have to face her [Swiatek] again.“But I think everything kind of came naturally to me. I didn’t really overthink anything. Just kind of like it’s a new tournament, it’s a new day and a new match. That’s how I went about it, really.”View image in fullscreenAmanda Anisimova after her victory in Beijing this year.Photograph: Jessica Lee/EPAAnisimova has had to navigate several difficult circumstances from a young age. Besides struggling with the lifestyle and the stressors of being a teenager on tour, she lost her father Konstantin one week shy of her 18th birthday.Asked where she draws her strength from, Anisimova says: “Everything I’ve experienced in my life. I think having gone through certain situations and things and being able to have healed myself from that in a way and really work on myself. I think that’s where I get that kind of mentality. And I’m surrounded by very strong women as well. So, I think it’s a combination of things.”Anisimova is driven by the simple idea of wanting to be “the best athlete I can be”. She acknowledges nerves played a part in both finals she lost at the majors this year and is doing everything she can to address that issue. She’s also learned to keep an eye out for signs of burnout, and tries to take a short break, or plan for a longer one, whenever she feels extreme fatigue is setting in.“I think I’ve just done a really good job of balancing my time on and off the court this year,” she added.Anisimova has great chemistry with her team, and they all make sure they’re able to have fun together, on and off the court.Before the action in Riyadh kicked off, they went dune-bashing in the Saudi desert. She was the only one who opted out of the camel ride – “I felt so bad for them when I got there. We did it once. I normally wouldn’t support the animals being used like that,” she explains. She went for an ATV instead.Anisimova believes having the right people around her has been key, but more importantly, she believes young up-and-coming athletes should be encouraged to take ownership over their career decisions.“When you do so well at a young age, there’s obviously a lot of pressure and expectations,” she says. “And a lot of new things that you’ve never experienced before. And it’s a lot for a young kid who’s not developed fully, like not even close to fully. So it’s definitely a lot.“And I would say that the younger girls on tour right now are doing a great job of balancing and managing that. I think the one thing that I would say that’s important is the people you surround yourself with and the guidance and the advice.“I think it’s really important to let girls know, or boys, to make the right decisions for yourself and listen to yourself and not try and say yes to everything and feel like you have to do certain things.“I think that’s a big killer in certain ways, is just feeling like you have to do certain things and that can really lead to burnout. So that’s definitely something that I would have done differently.”Since she returned to the tour following her break, Anisimova has received scores of messages from people telling her how much they could relate to her struggles, and how they found her journey inspiring.She finds herself connecting the most to people who have shared their journeys, and she’s proud she can provide that for others as well.“Just being able to relate to certain people in that way is a special thing, even if you don’t really know them. So for me to be able to do that to other people has been one of the most special things for me this year, for sure,” she says.Showing there is strength in vulnerability is ultimately the message she hopes to convey to the world through her life as a professional tennis player.“I think me, just being myself this year, every kind of situation I’ve been in or where I’ve had to speak freely, and I really just try and be as authentic as I can,” says Anisimova. “And I think that really crossed over to a lot of people and it’s really shown you can be vulnerable and that’s OK. And I think that’s kind of been the most important thing for me this year is to just really be myself and speak honestly and freely. And that’s just what I try and do.”Explore more on these topicsTennisUS sportsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The England international would have exited on a free transfer but for Real paying an £8.5m fee to cancel his Liverpool contract early and include him in their squad for the Club World Cup.Slot insists Wirtz has ‘brought exactly what we expected’ before Real Madrid tieRead moreThe 27-year-old was part of a Real delegation that laid floral tributes to Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva outside Anfield on Monday night. The head coach and formerLiverpoolmidfielder Alonso, the defender Dean Huijsen and Real’s director of institutional relations, Emilio Butragueño, were also present. Alexander-Arnold laid his own floral tribute, with a message that read: “My mate Diogo, you are so missed but still so loved. Yours and André’s memories will always live on. I smile every time I think about you and will always remember the great times we shared. Miss you mate every day. Love Trent and family.”Alonso is guaranteed a warm reception from the Anfield crowd having graced Liverpool’s midfield between 2004 and 2009. He believes Alexander-Arnold should relish facing his boyhood team, if selected. “We haven’t spoken about that precisely [the reception that awaits Alexander-Arnold] but we have spoken about the team and the club,” the Real head coach said.“He has to have his own feelings and enjoy it his own way. So I am not going to say how he needs to feel it. For sure his history is different from mine, he was born and bred in Liverpool. I remember him from a young age in the academy and then coming to the first team and winning theChampions League. So he needs to enjoy the moment because it is nice to be back.”View image in fullscreenA tribute to Liverpool’s Diogo Jota left outside Anfield by Trent Alexander-Arnold of Real Madrid.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe former Liverpool defender’s move to Real has not gone to plan on the pitch having sustained a hamstring injury on hisChampions League debut for the clubagainst Marseille on 16 September. He has not played since and has been an unused substitute in Real’s last two games.But Alonso said: “He is good. He didn’t play [against Valencia on Saturday] because of the context of the game but he is available for any number of minutes. Tomorrow he may play and after the injury he had we need his qualities; he has great qualities. He is in a new stage for him – sporting, physically and mentally. We need to give him what he needs because he is an exceptional player that we have in our squad.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wolves, who visit Chelsea on Saturday, have placed their under-21s head coach, James Collins, and under-18s head coach, Richard Walker, in interim charge.Middlesbrough’s head coach, Rob Edwards, has longstanding admirers at Wolves, where he played and coached.He also had a short spell in caretaker charge in 2016, shortly after Fosun, Wolves’ owner, bought the club. Wolves would have to pay Boro compensation to extract Edwards from his contract. Previewing Boro’s Championship trip to Leicester on Tuesday, Edwards played down the interest.“I can understand it with my links to the club but my full focus is on this job here, which is a brilliant job, and trying to turn things around for a really big game,” Edwards said.The former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has been put forward by intermediaries, but is not thought to be under consideration.It is thought the super-agent Jorge Mendes could put forward candidates for the post. Four of Wolves’ previous five managers are part of Mendes’s Gestifute agency: Pereira, Bruno Lage, Julen Lopetegui and Nuno Espírito Santo.Explore more on these topicsWolverhampton WanderersnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked before the Champions League meeting with Slavia Prague on Tuesday night how he would prepare his side for such a scenario, the Arsenal manager said: “Hopefully then they will move our Premier League match because to play on this date doesn’t make any sense, obviously. So we will now decide the date. I leave that to the club. I think we’re very clear what was the best thing, the most logical date to play.“They bring a different date so I’m sure we’ll have to adapt to that. I’m sure we will apply the principles of first of all the players, then the supporters, and then the times that we need to have equality and the same chances for every club. So hopefully it will be fair.” The Premier League has declined to comment on Arsenal’s request.Arteta made 10 changes for Arsenal’swin against Brightonin the last round of the Carabao Cup but will be without Viktor Gyökeres for the game against Slavia after the Sweden striker sustained a muscle injuryagainst Burnley on Saturday. That leaves the Premier League leaders missing seven first-choice attackers and their manager believes the packed schedule is partly to blame.“I don’t know what depth we’re talking about now because we’re missing a lot of players, a lot of front players,” he said. “If we continue to do that every three days … we want respecting. What we discussed previously [player welfare], that in our opinion it’s the most important part.”The EFL statement said it shared Arsenal’s and Palace’s frustrations in what was described as an “unavoidable” situation because of both sides’ European commitments.“To continue making endless concessions only serves to undermine the reputation of the EFL Cup – a competition which delivers vital revenue to EFL clubs and provides millions of supporters with the opportunity to back their team on the road to Wembley each season,” it read.“It also challenges the traditional scheduling of the English football calendar and strength of our domestic game, which relies upon teams having the necessary time for preparation and ability to field their strongest lineups, in order to entertain their supporters and progress through the competition.”View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Viktor Gyökeres scored against Burnley but sustained an undefined muscle injury.Photograph: Simon Davies/ProSports/ShutterstockArteta would not reveal which muscle Gyökeres injured after scoring his first domestic goal for almost two months against Burnley, with Mikel Merino expected to fill in for the Sweden striker. But, with Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus still sidelined, he admitted it was a far from ideal situation to be without the player signed for £64m in the summer.“I am concerned because he hasn’t had many muscular issues and he had to do the pitch and he was feeling something,” Arteta said. “That’s obviously never a good sign, especially for a player that is very explosive. So we are digging in a little bit more to understand where we are in terms of the injury and we’ll announce the moment we know. He was very disappointed after the match with what he felt, but this is part of football.“At the end, if you expect a linear line, everything going up, it’s not going to happen. And if he’s got something, he’s going to have to deal with it. We will help him to do that. As you said, he was in a really good moment, in a really good form. He’s very important for the team.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

The defenders stormed past Frank towards the tunnel, ignoring their manager’s attempts to get them to acknowledge the supporters in the South Stand – a bad look at the end of another bad Premier League day at the stadium.Why Saudi money hasn’t transformed Newcastle into title contendersRead moreTottenham have won only once in five games there under Frank in the competition, losing three, which has continued a worrying trend. The team have three victories and 12 defeats in 19 home league matches and have lost 41 times at the stadium since it opened in 2019. It hurts the Spurs fanbase to realise that their fiercest rivals, Arsenal, have lost 48 league games at the Emirates Stadium – and that opened in 2006.Frank was happy to provide the detail of how Van de Ven and Spence had been to see him separately on Sunday to say sorry as they began preparations for theChampions Leaguegame at home against Copenhagen on Tuesday night.Frank is acutely aware ofhow poor his team wereagainst Chelsea – they offered nothing in attacking terms – and he accepted that the jeers could come after the final whistle. But he was also clear that there needed to be greater positivity from the stands during the game. There were boos, for example, towards the end against Chelsea when the goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario played a sideways pass rather than something more forward-thinking.“I want to get the point across that the fans were fantastic in the first 30 minutes,” Frank said. “It seems there was a little bit of a turning point when we conceded the goal, where we all get a little bit frustrated, which is natural.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank believes the Spurs fans can act as the turning point in matches.Photograph: John Walton/PA“After the game, if we perform badly and on top of that we lose, it’s more than fair enough that they boo us. We are in the performance business and if we can’t deal with the pressure, the negativity or the criticism, we shouldn’t sit here. But during the game, we need a little bit of help. And especially when it’s not going the right way.“They [the fans] can be the turning point. We were 1-0 down in the last 15 minutes … imagine they carry us over the line and we got a little bit of an unfair 1-1. What a feeling! That point can be the difference in a long season.”Vicario was seen after the match pushing his young teammate Lucas Bergvall away from a confrontation with an irate supporter. The goalkeeper pointed at his own eyes and then at the fan as though to say he was watching him.“In every environment there are very good people and some bad people,” Vicario said. “Probably [Bergvall] got contact with one bad person. That doesn’t necessarily say that everyone are bad people. But there are some bad people in every environment and I had to protect him because he was a little bit emotional in that time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In some moments during the game, probably when we are chasing, we need a little more cool heads and if we have a little bit more help in some situations coming from the stands it could be, of course, better.”On the Van de Ven and Spence situation, Frank said: “They came into my office yesterday, unprompted, and just said: ‘Want to say sorry for the situation.’ They didn’t want it to look bad or disrespectful or all of the kind of perceptions you can get in this beautiful media world. That was not the intention at all towards me or the team or the club. They were just frustrated with the performance, the loss and the booing during the game.“Of course, I’m happy [they apologised] because I knew the question would come today and it means that they care. They care about the team, the club and, in this case, me.”Frank, who reported that Bergvall was observing the 12-day concussion protocol after his withdrawal againstChelseaand would miss the games against Copenhagen and Manchester United on Saturday, also made a gentle plea for perspective. Despite Spurs’ difficulties at home, they have been excellent on their travels – a contrast to the domestic horrors of last season when they finished 17th. They are also unbeaten in their three Champions League matches.“If anyone would have said that we would have 17 points after 10 games, fifth place [beforeSunderland 1-1 Everton] and unbeaten in the Champions League … everything’s definitely not perfect but there’s a decent foundation and it’s up to us to add layers,” Frank said. “I think everyone would have taken where we are now [after] 22 [league] defeats last season and finishing 17th. The Europa League [victory last season] was fantastic, wow. But the Champions League is different.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankFC CopenhagenChampions LeagueEuropean club footballChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

Having had 37 years in football I’m enjoying finding other areas where I think I might be able to make a difference.”Speaking before his book Dear England: Lessons in Leadership is published on Thursday, Southgate said he is “very passionate” about providing role models for young people, extending the lessons he learned as the manager of England’s men’s football side between September 2016 and July 2024 and as a parent.Southgate believes his experience of coaching England, where the national team went from being loathed to beloved, can be applied more broadly. “We had a huge disconnect with the public when we started,” he said. “People saw us as high-ego players but we were able to turn that around. I saw the power that the team had to bring people together of every community.”As a parent, Southgate observed: “You want to give your kids the best possible start, but there is a point when they don’t want to listen to parents any more. I experienced that in my house in the same way everybody else will … but I do think this is an important space for us.“There’s a negative narrative around our country at the moment and we’ve got to give young people hope, we’ve got to give them guidance. We’ve got incredible talent but we need to them to find the right role models, the right friendship groups because those decisions have such a big impact on the rest of their lives.”Southgate insisted “there is more that unites us [in the UK] than divides us” but that the focus in the culture was on division. “It’s understandable why people are disaffected,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wet, wild and absolutely wellied. In the rain, the chaos and added time, the fifth of an epic fight perfectly imperfect: a first attempt scuffed, a second smashed in from six yards, sending teammates diving out of the way and supporters into each other’s arms. And scored by the footballer from the frontier, born on the border with Bizkaia, another Gipuzkoan and another academy product playing his first derby. Jon Gorrotxategi hit it with his shin; he also hit it with his “soul”, he said, the day ending with Real Sociedad’s players standing before their fans, singing together.It had started there too, their big blue bus edging its way towards the Reale Arena, circling round past the velodrome and the mini stadium, thousands of fans lining the route, fireworks going off, scarves and flags swirling. Pulling up before the gates, the brakes went on, the doors opened and Sergio Francisco, their manager, said: “This incredible energy was let in.” The players got out and walked the final stretch to the stadium, feeling their way through the smoke, passing fans with their palms out, all high fives and hope. Stopping in a line, looking over the endless faces, listening to them sing, they joined in, clapping out the beat. And then they disappeared inside and defeated Athletic Club 3-2.Failed signings, fan fury and resignations: how Fiorentina became a crisis club | Nicky BandiniRead moreThere was something in that scene at the start and how they celebrated at the end that showed how Real Sociedad had needed this, and not just because it’s the derby or even because they had become the first of these great rivals to ever win one in stoppage time, although that is reason enough. This is a fixture like no other,preceded by poetry, striped shirts in blueandred mixed in the old town and in the stands. A match where they drink together, sit together and kick together, lumps taken out of each other’s legs; where everyone knowsexactlywhat it means, 22 of the 30 players from the Basque Country (including Navarre), 24 of them academy graduates; and where for all the friendliness, which shouldn’t fool you, it is ferocious. Which is also what makes it fun.On Saturday especially, something about this derby just felt, well, like a derby. Right, somehow. It felt right that it rained, right that what made it good was not so much the quality as the commitment, right that it went from 1-0 to 1-1, 2-1 to 2-2, and right that the winner should come in the dying, desperate minutes the way it did, nothing quite happening the way it was supposed to, the ball bouncing about in the area until Gorrotxategi belted it and blew everything to bits. It felt right that it should be him, one of six la Real players from their home province of Gipuzkoa, the smallest in Spain. And right that if the winner was the derby distilled, the previous four goals weren’t far off either.View image in fullscreenAnder Barrenetxea (left) played through the pain to provide the opener.Photograph: Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty ImagesIf it had ended that way, the way it had started fit, too: in fact, the moment with which it all began was even better, possibly even the best thing you’re going to see all year. They had been playing for 35 minutes and not a lot had happened when off the ball Ander Barrenetxea went down, the 23-year-old winger lying face in his hands. Medical staff came dashing on, bandaged him up and helped him hobble off, applauded all the way, barely able to move but not finished yet. He had one last thing he had to do. So, despite standing there, hopping from foot to foot, grimacing every time he touched the floor, pain hidden behind his palms, the doctor gazing at him with a look of pity, he went back out.Where the ball came straight to him.Barrenetxea couldn’t walk but he ran. The first two steps he lurched forwards, left foot first and left foot second too, painful just to watch. Limping up the left, he took one touch to control with his right, one touch to cross with his left, the thigh hurting too much to continue. As he pulled up, the ball came off Mikel Oyarzabal and reached Brais Méndez, who at the second attempt scored, the ball bouncing back off Unai Simón. Barrenetxea couldn’t move, couldn’t join the celebration, but he had provided the opener. He had been on the pitch for eight seconds.Barrenetxea’s derby was over; everyone else’s had just begun. Amid the frenzy, Real Sociedad were just about the better side but Athletic kept coming back at them, the ball bouncing about for Gorka Guruzeta to sweep in the first equaliser. Gonçalo Guedes scored a lovely second for la Real just after half-time – the only one of the five that wasn’t veryderby– but with 11 minutes left Athletic equalised again and this time it was very, very derby. A long delivery, two looping headers, a half save, the ball coming down off the bar, bringing a rain shower with it, somehow kept in by Alejandro Rego, and Robert Navarro bundling it past the players falling in front of him and over the line. Seven touches, and Athletic had equalised. Via a former la Real player.View image in fullscreenAthletic equalised twice in a frenzied derby.Photograph: Juan Herrero/EPAThe rain came down and the tensions went up. Ernesto Valverde, the Athletic manager, was on his haunches in a mac, hood up, gazing across the pitch like a fisher looking out at storm when the ball dropped near the edge of Athletic’s area on 91.41 and there was Gorrotxategi. “All I wanted to do was shoot, because I could see that the game was ending, slipping away from us,” he said. “But I hit it terribly.” Swiping, more than a dozen men in front of him, his shot scuffed and somehow bounced through the bodies to Oyarzabal, who pulled it back. And there, thundering in to follow his first fluffed attempt, invited by fate to have another go, was Gorrotxategi. On the edge of the six-yard box, Jon Martín throwing himself out the way, Gorrotxategi hit it as hard as he could, an‘ave thatof a finish ripping into the net; 37,685 people exploded and a couple more fireworks did, too – a tradition that tells those out in the Bay of Biscay that la Realhave scored a goal.Not just any goal, either. One local reporter was quoting Eduardo Galeano, who claimed the goal was the only orgasm left in modern times. The earth had moved, Marta Gonzalo said. “If you could measure the feeling on this on the Richter scale, this was a quake,” she wrote in AS, “and Gorro was the epicentre.” For the first time in 178 derbies, someone had won in added time. They had deserved it too, AS said: “The derby is all about who has the most heart, and la Real are 11 cardiologists.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a solitary win in nine weeks and new coach Francisco on edge, a side too good to struggle slipping towards the relegation zone, la Real had now won two league games in a row, the paper describing the goal as “a shout that came with the strength of all Gipuzkoa and said: ‘This is different now.’” As Mikel Recalde put it in Noticias de Gipuzkoa: “La Real are alive. They have soul. They feel their colours. They love their people. And, once in a while, they make them happy like they did tonight. Life can be wonderful.”Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowGetafe 2-1 GironaVillarreal 4-0 Rayo VallecanoAtlético Madrid 3-0 SevillaReal Sociedad 3-2 Athletic BilbaoReal Madrid 4-0 ValenciaLevante 1-2 Celta VigoAlavés 2-1 EspanyolBarcelona 3-1 ElcheReal Betis 3-0 Real MallorcaMonday's fixture:Real Oviedo v OsasunaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Gorrotxategi had been Górriz and Zamora in one, everyone seemed to be saying. Alberto Górriz is the man whose scuffed attempt on goal accidentally set up Jesús María Zamora to win Real Sociedad the league in 1981, later saying: “My worst shot was my best pass.” Now Gorro had gone and played both roles. “I hit it with all my soul, all the more so seeing the minute we were in. The feeling of happiness is incredible,” he said. “This goal is incredible: for the situation, the game, the moment. I’ll watch it back loads of times. The players were laughing at me saying I never score; I told them I was saving it up. This is the fans’ goal: they backed us to the end and the feeling is incredible. I think something has clicked. We’re in a different dynamic now. There are things we need to improve in footballing terms but every game we go to war now.”At the whistle, once they had got the fight out the way, players briefly piling in, la Real lined up before their supporters for the second time, full-back Aihen Muñoz taking the mic as they sang. The communion was complete, the day finishing the way it had started, a way that felt right, like a derby should. Watching them, their coach felt proud; this was his first derby, too. “It outdid all expectations,” Francisco said. “If we could have written it, it would have been something like this.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid1116302Barcelona1115253Villarreal1112234Atletico Madrid1111225Real Betis116196Espanyol112187Getafe11-1178Alaves111159Elche11-11410Rayo Vallecano11-21411Athletic Bilbao11-21412Celta Vigo11-11313Sevilla11-21314Real Sociedad11-31215Osasuna10-31016Levante11-5917Mallorca11-7918Valencia11-10919Oviedo10-12720Girona11-147Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ll keep training’ and it was just not the right plan and the right play.“So for me, it was something that really needed to happen for me to, like I said, find my best, and I said it from the start before the first game, ‘if I’m playing at my best, I don’t need to worry about anything else’.”Marnus Labuschagne’s Test averageWhen asked if he was in the form of his life, Labuschagne said: “The only one I can think of is probably 2019 at Glamorgan as a period of time.

Slot attributed that barren run to bad luck and said the Germany international will justify Liverpool’s then-record investment once he adapts to the intensity of English football.“You can say he’s started one of the last four [two of the last four] but you can also say he’s started 10 already this season,” said theLiverpoolhead coach, who will again be without the injured Alexander Isak, Alisson and Jeremie Frimpong against Real.“I’ve said this quite a lot, not as an excuse but just how it is; many times we have to play three games in seven days with only two days’ rest in between. For a player who comes from a different league, which is a very good league by the way, nine out of 10 people would agree the Premier League is a bit more intense in all the games. If you look at that then he already played a lot. He has had his impact in a lot of games but has been unlucky with the end product either by himself or his teammates.“For me, he brought exactly what we expected, a player who created a lot for the team. He will have his goals but I don’t think it comes as a surprise to anyone that if you’re 22 or 23 and come to a different league that you might need some time to adjust to that intensity if you play every three days. Ryan Gravenberch was sitting here before and it took him a while to adjust to the intensity, maybe even longer than it is going to take Florian.”View image in fullscreenFlorian Wirtz provided two assists during Liverpool’s victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League.Photograph: Andre Weening/Orange Pictures/ShutterstockWirtz earned his move to Anfield, for an initial £100m plus £16m in add-ons, having shone for Alonso at Bayer Leverkusen. Together they helped end Bayern Munich’s run of 11 consecutive Bundesliga titles in 2023-24 and Alonso credited Wirtz with his own rise to becoming Real coach. The former Liverpool midfielder echoed Slot’s belief that it is only a matter of time before the forward makes his mark at Anfield.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understood that he will not return to training until Thursday.With the full-backs George Furbank of Northampton and Elliot Daly of Saracens already ruled out, Steward’s setback may provide a chance for Smith.The Harlequins back shifted to No 15 last season to accommodate Fin Smith at fly-half but was left out against Australia. While he lacks the commanding aerial presence of Steward, he would offer more of a running threat against Fiji, who traditionally favour an offloading game. Henry Slade, Tom Roebuck or Henry Arundell could in theory play at full-back but Smith would be the natural choice.Tommy Freeman started at No 13 against Australia while the in-form centres Slade and Ollie Lawrence missed out, and Borthwick may look to experiment again before aiming to field a first-choice XV for the All Blacks a week on Saturday.View image in fullscreenBen Earl would relish the opportunity to slot in at inside centre for England.Photograph: Sandra Mailer/ShutterstockThe Saracens flanker Ben Earl, who raced under the posts for England’s first try against the Wallabies, is another player seen as capable of making a switch to midfield. Earl said he would love to play at No 12 and that there are several hybrid options available.“I am just trying to help the team any way I can,” he said. “We have got a lot of boys now who could do a good job anywhere. Henry [Pollock] could do a very good job on the wing, Ted Hill when he was involved was very, very fast. There are a few boys that could do it. It is going to be a strength of our team going forward.”Earl said of potentially being selected at No 12: “I would love it.

It’s no coincidence that Sam [Underhill] and I were there in that position because we trained a lot, we focused a lot on that, and you sort of work out where the ball’s going to go.”Earl also revealed that England have taken inspiration from the Last Dance, the Netflix documentary about the rise of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. “Dennis Rodman talks about it coming off the rim,” Earl said. “We spend a lot of time working on watching the balls come out of the hands, not to that same extent, but we talk a lot about where we think the ball’s going to go and gambling.“It was no coincidence that Henry scored that try, and that we [Earl and Underhill] had an opportunity to score ourselves.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamFiji rugby union teamRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

And the style of his win was equally memorable. Punters who backed the proven Group One form of Minnie Hauk and Rebel’s Romance might beg to differ, but it gladdened the heart to see anEbor Handicap winnerleave the pair of them standing with a stretch run for the ages.Gezora wins Breeders’ Cup 2025 after Ethical Diamond’s triumph for Willie MullinsRead moreMullins was, momentarily at least, lost for words after Ethical Diamond and Dylan Browne McMonagle powered across the line. “Wow,” he said. “Wow, wow, wow, wow.” But he recovered his composure in time for the post-race press conference, where Mullins explained that had it not been for the strict veterinary rules attached to runners in theMelbourne Cup, Ethical Diamond would not have been within a thousand miles of southern California.View image in fullscreenEthical Diamond wins the Breeders’ Cup Turf Del Mar.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/Shutterstock“It was only a very last-minute plan after winning the Ebor,” Mullins said, “when we knew we couldn’t get down to Australia with him, and we thought, let’s have a go at this race. David Casey, my assistant, came up with the plan. He said: ‘Look, the mile-and-a-half there, he’s good enough to run in and take a shot.’ You can’t win these races unless you’re in them. That’s always been my policy, have a go.”Ethical Diamond had a screw inserted into one of his legs earlier in his career to aid his recovery from an injury, which is far from uncommon. It is enough tostop him running in a Melbourne Cup, however, regardless of the fact that he has run multiple times since, on the Flat and over hurdles, and won demanding staying events such as the Ebor.View image in fullscreenHorses and jockeys make their way from the paddock to the track at Del Mar on Breeders’ Cup weekend.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APThe Australian rules were introduced after a series of fatal injuries in the Melbourne Cup, including an injury suffered by Anthony Van Dyck, the 2019 Derby winner, in the Cupa year later. It still feels odd, however, that one set of vets can effectively bar a horse from a race as the result of a procedure recommended by a different set of vets to aid the same horse’s recovery.Mullins was on a plane to Australia a few hours after Saturday’s race, and scheduled to arrive in Melbourne on Monday to see Absurde, who runs in the same colours as Ethical Diamond, line up for the Melbourne Cup the following day. Absurde is priced up at around 18-1 with the local bookies and has a decent draw in stall four so – assuming he passes the vets – an outrageous, unprecedented across-the-continents double is still a live possibility.Japan’s racing industry was the other big winner on Saturday, and perhaps not before time in the case of Forever Young, the first ever Japanese-trained winner of the Breeders’ Cup Classic. The four-year-old was leant on for much of the straight in the Kentucky Derby in 2024 and was still less than a quarter-length behind the winner, and he reversed the form of last year’s Classic, when he was third behind Sierra Leone and Fierceness, in convincing fashion.View image in fullscreenRyusei Sakai rides Forever Young (No 5) to victory in the Breeders’ Cup Classic.Photograph: Gregory Bull/APBetween them, Ethical Diamond and Forever Young were the key winners on Saturday, horses that deviated from the norm and set the crowd abuzz. Frankie Dettori’s farewell to the meeting, meanwhile, went largely unnoticed, because his rides – with the honourable exception of Khaadem in the Turf Sprint, who finished third – were not good enough. The one significant disappointment for the Europeans was the news on Sunday morning that She’s Quality, third home in the Prix de l’Abbaye in October, died overnight at a local equine hospital after suffering a pelvic injury in Saturday’s Turf Sprint.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last throw fell short of the end zone and was batted down by rookie Maxwell Hairston. The drive began at Kansas City’s 42 after Matt Prater’s 52-yard field goal attempt for the Bills struck the right upright.Buffalo improved to 6-2 and have won two straight since losing consecutive games. The Bills have defeated Kansas City in five straight regular-season meetings, but are 0-4 in playoff matchups dating to the 2020 postseason – including last season’s AFC title game.The Chiefs (5-4) had a three-game win streak snapped after winning five of their last six. Mahomes, who entered having passed for three touchdowns in each of his past three outings, finished 15 of 34 for 250 yards and no scores.Chicago Bears 47–42 Cincinnati BengalsCaleb Williams connected with Colston Loveland for a 58-yard touchdown with 17 seconds left, and the Chicago Bears beat theCincinnati Bengalsin a wild game that featured three touchdowns in the last two minutes and two lead changes in the final minute.After Joe Flacco put the Bengals ahead 42-41 with a nine-yard touchdown pass to Andrei Iosivas, Chicago took over on its own 28 with 54 seconds left. Four plays later, on first down from the 42, Williams found Loveland down the middle. The rookie tight end caught it at the Bengals 36, bounced off Cincinnati defensive backs Jordan Battle and Geno Stone and ran to the end zone to give Chicago its fifth win in six games.Williams passed for 280 yards and three touchdowns, and he also caught a TD pass from DJ Moore on a trick play for the Bears’ first score. He later hauled in a 20-yard pass from Tyson Bagent, becoming the first starting QB in nearly 82 years with multiple receptions in a game.The 40-year-old Flacco, who did not practice on Wednesday and Friday after injuring his throwing shoulder, was 30 of 44 for a career-high 470 yards and four TDs. But the Bengals scored at least 30 points and lost for the second straight week and sixth time dating to last season.Jacksonville Jaguars 30-29 Las Vegas Raiders (OT)CAM LITTLE JUST KICKED THE LONGEST FG IN NFL HISTORY! 68 YARDS!pic.twitter.com/WGZb6O9xhX— NFL (@NFL)November 2, 2025Trevor Lawrence scored on a quarterback sneak in overtime, and the Jacksonville Jaguars held on to beat the Las Vegas Raiders. Jaguars nose tackle DaVon Hamilton batted down Geno Smith’s pass to deny the Raiders a winning two-point conversion. Jacksonville’s Cam Little broke anNFLrecord with a 68-yard field goal at the end of the first half, and his 48-yarder with 16 seconds left sent the game to OT. Lawrence extended the ball over the goalline to give the Jaguars the lead. Smith responded by hitting Brock Bowers for a two-yard TD, but his throw on the two-point try was swatted away.Seattle Seahawks 38–14 Washington CommandersSam Darnold continued his excellent season for the Seattle Seahawks (6-2) as they beat the Washington Commanders (3-6) convincingly on Sunday Night Football. Darnold threw for 330 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. But his opposite number, Jayden Daniels, left the game for x-rays after suffering what appeared to be a serious arm injury in the fourth quarter.Minnesota Vikings 27–24 Detroit LionsJJ McCarthy threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score in his return from an ankle injury, leading the Minnesota Vikings (4-4) to victory over the Detroit Lions (5-3). McCarthy sealed the victory by throwing a 16-yard pass to Jalen Nailor on third-and-five from the Minnesota 28, a play that allowed them to run out the clock. McCarthy threw both of his scoring passes in the first quarter and his nine-yard run midway through the third gave the Vikings a 24-14 lead. Jared Goff threw a touchdown pass to Jameson Williams as the Lions tried to rally, but they kicked off and didn’t get the ball back.Indianapolis Colts 20–27 Pittsburgh SteelersJaylen Warren ran for two touchdowns and the Pittsburgh Steelers forced six turnovers in their victory over Indianapolis. The Steelers improved to 5-3 after snapping a two-game losing streak. Pittsburgh’s embattled defense sacked the Colts’ Daniel Jones five times and forced him into five giveaways. The Steelers converted three of the Colts’ turnovers into touchdowns. Aaron Rodgers threw for 203 yards and a touchdown for Pittsburgh. Indianapolis fell to 7-2 but remain atop the AFC South. The Steelers travel to the Los Angeles Chargers next week. The Colts face Atlanta in Germany.View image in fullscreenSteelers linebacker Alex Highsmith forces a fumble by Indianapolis quarterback Daniel Jones.Photograph: Gene J Puskar/APSan Francisco 49ers 34-24 New York GiantsChristian McCaffrey caught a touchdown pass from Mac Jones, rushed for another score and the San Francisco 49ers (6-3) got back on track by running all over the New York Giants on the way. McCaffrey accounted for 173 scrimmage yards – 106 on the ground on his 28 carries and 67 receiving on five catches. Many of the 49ers fans in attendance chanted “CMC! CMC!” after he got into the end zone past the midway point of the fourth quarter. The Giants lost their third game in a row to drop to 2-7.Carolina Panthers 16–13 Green Bay PackersRico Dowdle rushed for 130 yards and two touchdowns, and his big run in the final minute set up Ryan Fitzgerald’s last-second 49-yard field goal as the Carolina Panthers (5-4) beat Green Bay (5-2-1). The Packers’ three-game winning streak ended, and they lost star tight end Tucker Kraft to a knee injury in the third quarter. Dowdle had been splitting time with Chuba Hubbard, but Panthers coach Dave Canales said Dowdle would get the bulk of the carries, and the move paid off. He made one big mistake, getting flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct after a touchdown. But his 19-yard run got the Panthers in range for the winning kick.Denver Broncos 18–15 Houston TexansBo Nix threw two touchdown passes and Wil Lutz made a 34-yard field goal as time expired and the Denver Broncos (7-2) rallied to beat the Houston Texans (3-5) to extend their winning streak to six games. They improved to 4-0 this season in games where they trailed entering the fourth quarter. The Broncos had punted three times in a row before a 25-yard scramble by Nix got them to their 39 with less than a minute to go. JK Dobbins followed with a nine-yard scamper and a nine-yard run by Nix two plays after that set up the game-winning field goal.Atlanta Falcons 23–24 New England PatriotsDrake Maye threw for 259 yards and two touchdowns as the New England Patriots held on for victory over the visiting Atlanta Falcons. Maye also threw an interception, while Demario Douglas had 100 receiving yards and a score for the Patriots (7-2), who won their sixth straight. Atlanta (3-5) had a chance to tie the game with 4:40 left, but kicker Parker Romo missed wide right on an extra point. Michael Penix Jr threw for 221 yards and three touchdowns and Drake London had 118 receiving yards and three scores, as the Falcons dropped their third straight.Los Angeles Chargers 27–20 Tennessee TitansJustin Herbert threw for 250 yards and had a hand in all three Los Angeles Chargers touchdowns as they stopped the Tennessee Titans (1-8) in Nashville. Herbert, who completed 19 of 29 passes with two scores and an interception, capped a 15-play, nine-minute, 99-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run with 12:58 left in the game. It came after Tony Pollard was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-goal at the Los Angeles one-yard line to end Tennessee’s bid to take the lead. Joey Slye converted a 37-yard field goal with 4:19 remaining to get the Titans (1-8) within a score but they never saw the ball again. The Chargers (6-3) chewed up the remaining clock, picking up a trio of first downs to seal their third win in their past four games.New Orleans Saints 10-34 Los Angeles RamsMatthew Stafford threw for 281 yards and hit Davante Adams with two of his four touchdown passes in the Los Angeles Rams’ victory over the struggling New Orleans Saints. Puka Nacua had seven catches for 95 yards and a touchdown in his return from an ankle injury. The Rams (6-2) returned from their bye with 438 yards and another strong defensive effort, allowing only 224 yards in their third consecutive win. Tyler Shough passed for 176 yards in his first NFL start for the Saints (1-8), who are on their second four-game skid of the season. He threw his first career TD pass to Juwan Johnson seven seconds before halftime.Explore more on these topicsNFLCincinnati BengalsChicago BearsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The problem was, as Prof Evans discovered when he logged on to check his own entry, all these facts were false.It was part of a choppy start for humanity’s latest attempt to corral the sum of human knowledge or, as Musk put it, create a compendium of “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth” – all revealed through the magic of his Grok artificial intelligence model.When the multibillionaireswitchedon Grokipedia on Tuesday, he said it was “better than Wikipedia”, or “Wokepedia” as his supporters call it, reflecting a view that the dominant online encyclopedia often reflects leftwing talking points. One post on X caught the triumphant mood among Musk’s fans: “Elon just killed Wikipedia. Good riddance.”Elon Musk launches encyclopedia ‘fact-checked’ by AI and aligning with rightwing viewsRead moreBut users found Grokipedia lifted large chunks from the website it intended to usurp, contained numerous factual errors and seemed to promote Musk’s favoured rightwing talking points. In between posts on X promoting his creation, Musk this week declared “civil war in Britain is inevitable”, called for the English “to ally with the hard men” such as the far-right agitator Tommy Robinson, and said only the far-right AfD party could “save Germany”.Musk was so enamoured of his AI-encyclopedia he said he planned to one day etch the “comprehensive collection of all knowledge” into a stable oxide and “place copies … in orbit, the moon and Mars to preserve it for the future”.Evans, however, was discovering that Musk’s use of AI to weigh and check facts was suffering a more earth-bound problem. “Chatroom contributions are given equal status with serious academic work,” Evans, an expert on the Third Reich, told the Guardian, after being invited to test out Grokipedia. “AI just hoovers up everything.”View image in fullscreenRichard Evans said Grokipedia’s entry for Albert Speer (pictured on Hitler’s left) repeated lies and distortions spread by the Nazi munitions minister himself.Photograph: Picture libraryHe noted its entry for Albert Speer, Hitler’s architect and wartime munitions minister, repeated lies and distortions spread by Speer even though they had been corrected in a 2017 award-winning biography. The site’s entry on the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, whose biography Evans wrote, claimed wrongly he experienced German hyperinflation in 1923, that he was an officer in the Royal Corps of Signals and didn’t mention that he had been married twice, Evans said.The problem, said David Larsson Heidenblad, the deputy director of theLund Centre for the History of Knowledgein Sweden, was a clash of knowledge cultures.“We live in a moment where there is a growing belief that algorithmic aggregation is more trustworthy than human-to-human insight,” Heidenblad said. “The Silicon Valley mindset is very different from the traditional scholarly approach. Its knowledge culture is very iterative where making mistakes is a feature, not a bug. By contrast, the academic world is about building trust over time and scholarship over long periods during which the illusion that you know everything cracks. Those are real knowledge processes.”Grokipedia’s arrival continues a centuries-old encyclopedia tradition from the 15th-century Chinese Yongle scrolls to the Encyclopédie, an engine for spreading controversial enlightenment views in 18th-century France. These were followed by the anglophone-centric Encyclopedia Britannica and, since 2001, the crowd-sourcedWikipedia. But Grokipedia is the first to be largely created by AI and this week a question swirled: who controls the truth when AIs, steered by powerful individuals, are holding the pen?“If it’s Musk doing it then I am afraid of political manipulation,” said the cultural historian Peter Burke, emeritus professor at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, who in 2000 wroteA Social History of Knowledgesince the time of Johannes Gutenberg’s 15th-century printing press.“I am sure some of it will be overt to some readers, but the problem may be that other readers may miss it,” Burke said. The anonymity of many encyclopedia entries often gave them “an air of authority it shouldn’t have”, he added.Andrew Dudfield, the head of AI at Full Fact, a UK-based factchecking organisation, said: “We really have to consider whether an AI-generated encyclopedia – a facsimile of reality, run through a filter – is a better proposition than any of the previous things that we have. It doesn’t display the same transparency but it is asking for the same trust. It is not clear how far the human hand is involved, how far it is AI=generated and what content the AI was trained on. It is hard to place trust in something when you can’t see how those choices are made.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has a leaderboard topped by teams with names such as Achilles and Phoenix.View image in fullscreenThe Brave1 online store.Photograph: https://market-brave1.delta.mil.gov.ua/katalog/filter/icons=11;page=3;presence=1/“It’s become truly popular among units,” said Fedorov, of the system, which is a prime example of the increasing automation of warfare. “All the defence forces know about this and there’s competition for the points, for getting these drones, electronic warfare systems and other things to help them in warfighting. The more infantry you kill, the more drones you get to kill more infantry. This is becoming kind of a self-reinforcing cycle.”The number of Russian casualties in September is double the number from last October, in part because the Kyiv government doubled the rewards for killing Russian infantry from six to 12 points, reflecting changing battlefield priorities.Ukrainian intelligence suggests Russia may be developing its own gamified system to compete, he said.Ukraineis extending the points-for-kills approach to artillery units by awarding points for success that can be used to buy new arms. Reconnaissance units are also being awarded points for spotting enemy targets and logistics teams have started to earn points for using autonomous vehicles rather than humans to resupply the frontlines.Fedorov revealed the Ukrainian military is also incentivising the use of drones partly controlled by artificial intelligence that recommends target selection and controls the last moments of a drone’s trajectory to increase strike precision.Reconnaissance units get points for what they call “Uber targeting,” a reference to the global ride-hailing app.“You basically drop a pin on the map like you would drop yourself on a Uber map for a taxi, but instead of the taxi a drone from another unit hits the target,” he said.But the extension of the points-based system comes amid warnings that increasing reliance on drone warfare is not something Nato countries should follow because Russian defences against such unmanned aerial attacks have become formidable. Experts at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank recently urged arenewed focus on conventional artillery and aircraft.As well as doubling the score for killing infantry to reflect their increasing use by Russia, killing an enemy drone operator now earns 25 points and using a drone to capture a Russian soldier attracts 120 points, reflecting Ukraine’s need for prisoners-of-war to trade with the enemy. The points are agreed by the Ukrainian cabinet but Federov said they were now “pretty much emotionless” when putting a price on human lives.“We’re at war for four years in a row, and it is hard,” he said. “We’re just finding ways to be more effective. We’re thinking of this as just part of our everyday job. There’s little to no emotional reflection here. It feels like just technical work. Because if you don’t stop the enemy, he will kill your servicemen and after the servicemen are dead, he’s going to come to a city and he’s going to conquer, raze and kill civilians.”The Ukrainian drone operators are stationed sometimes as close as 250 metres from the frontline and at other times 3km away where they sit in hides before computer screens directing strikes, sometimes with video game controllers. Achilles is one of the top 10 most successful drone regiments, and operates in the eastern part of the Kharkiv region and the Donetsk region. Its commander, Yuriy Fedorenko, said the best pilots were not necessarily people who were adept at video games.“Disciplined people are the best pilots,” he said. “Of course, if you’re younger, you can stay awake longer, and you need less time to restore your strength. But if the person is disciplined, that’s a good drone operator.”He also played down the idea that it amounted to the “gamification” of war because sometimes orders were to destroy targets with low-points in order to support a short-term battle goal.“We need to fulfil the task, first of all, because this is war,” he said. That’s what we need to do, not chase points”.Another drone unit commander, Andriy Poltoratskyi, said: “The whole unit has a competition. The drone operators compete with each other. Groups of drone operators compete with other groups. Even the highest commanders compete with each other.”He characterised it as healthy competition rather than fun, and said that as soon as the Russians launch an offensive “the competition stops and everybody … works together” on whatever goal best protects Ukrainian lives, regardless of the points on offer.The points-for-kills system has provided Ukraine with considerable data that means it is “getting a better grasp of the mathematics of war”, Fedorov said.“Thanks to the points, we’re actually starting to understand more about what’s happening in the battlefield,” he said. “In order to get points [drone units] need to upload video confirmation. So we understand what targets are being hit, where they’re being hit in relation to the line of contact, what drones and other means are being used.“So we are seeing what’s more effective, what’s less effective. Everybody sees the leaderboard, so units are starting to go to each other to do some peer-to-peer learning. Leaders are starting to teach and pave the way for those who are still growing and developing … innovation goes from the ground up.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They are some of the best-sounding open-ear speakers you can get and are more than loud enough to be heard over road or wind noise. They can’t match a set of earbuds for bass but for music while running or just out walking they are great. The five beamforming mics also do a very good job of cutting out background noise, even on busy roads, for calls or talking to AI.The right arm has a touch panel for controlling playback and volume manually. The music pauses when you take the glasses off, and the volume automatically adjusts to the level of background noise, which works really well while running around roads.SpecificationsDimensions:136 x 120 x 59mmWeight:66g (258g case)Water resistance:IP67Camera:12MP/3K ultrawideSpeakers:stereo open earMics:5-mic arrayBattery life:6h music playback (30h with case)Connectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, wifi 6Storage:32GBHey Meta, take a photoView image in fullscreenThe ultra-wide camera is mounted squarely between your eyes, which you can’t see when wearing them, with an LED directly above that lights when the camera is active.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe central camera shoots 12-megapixel photos of reasonable quality and really good stabilised video up to 3K resolution for up to five minutes at a time.

It is extremely handy for converting distances and paces between metric and imperial mid-run but isn’t quite as capable as Google’s Gemini on a phone.You can also message, send photos and call friends hands-free from the glasses via your phone or with one of Meta’s apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram.Hey Meta, what’s my pace?Vanguard’s killer feature is excellentintegration with modern Garminrunning watches and bike computers. A free Meta AI app on your Garmin links to the Meta AI app on your phone so you can interrogate your stats in real time mid-activity simply by asking.View image in fullscreenA little LED flashes next to your right eye to tell you when the AI is listening, interacting, or a photo is being taken.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe AI can tell you any of your individual metrics, such as pace, distance, heart rate, cadence and others, or the lot by asking for “my stats”, all pulled directly from your Garmin at that moment. It will also read out the pace or other metrics for each lap, mile or kilometre andcan use the little LEDto the right of your eye to show if you are on target during a pace or heart rate zone workout, turning red when you are outside your zone.The Garmin integration also enables the camera toautomatically captureyour walking, hiking, running or riding workouts. It shoots five-second videos for every kilometre or mile, or when you hit certain milestones such as a burst of pace for a sprint finish or when your heart rate ramps up on a steep incline. Once you have finished, the Meta AI app then stitches the videos together with any you took manually into a highlights reel when you get back. You can then overlay stats from the workout, such as distance, pace, elevation, time, heart rate and power, and send it to Meta’s apps or Strava to automatically add to your existing workout post.View image in fullscreenThe Meta AI app shows workout summaries and processes your auto-capture videos from the glasses.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe whole thing works fantastically, and while you’re not going to want to create videos for every run, automatically capturing highlights from a race without you having to do anything is a great bonus.Capturing all this video dents the battery life. On an hour-long run listening to music and talking to Meta AI lots of times, with 14 five-second videos auto-captured and 13 minutes of 1080p/30fps video and 14 photos taken manually, the glasses ended the run with 25% battery left.They should last for a full marathon with auto-capture turned on, but you may have to be careful with extended shooting to make the full 42km distance.For those who don’t use a Garmin, the Meta AI app can integrate with Apple Health, Google Health Connect or Strava to pull data from other watches or bike computers after the fact, including the Apple Watch and Coros devices. But the metrics overlaid on videos are more limited, and you get none of the auto-capture or mid-run stats.View image in fullscreenThe glasses last for up to six hours of continuous music listening and are stored in a chunky Oakley case, which offers four additional charges and will automatically transfer your photos and videos to the cloud while charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSustainabilityThe battery in the glasses will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full-charge cycles. Replacement lenses (£69), charging cases (£139) and nose pads (£10) will be available but the glasses are not repairable and the batteries not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. The glasses do not contain recycled material and Meta does not operate trade-in schemes or publish environmental impact reports for the glasses.PriceThe Oakley Meta Vanguard cost£499(€549/$499/A$789).For comparison, the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer (gen 2) cost from£379, the Oakley Meta HSTN cost from£399, the Oakley Sphaera cost£191and theShokz OpenRun Pro 2cost£169.VerdictThe Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses for sport I’ve ever tested. They are extremely expensive but it’s very clear they are designed for runners and sports by people who actually run.By concentrating on things runners, cyclists and adventure sports people want, such as a fit that won’t quit, lenses that actually block the wind from your eyes, proper water resistance, loud open-ear audio, long battery life and good controls, they would be great without more of the fancy features.The nose-mounted camera is very good and could easily replace an action cam for many. The mics continue to work at pace and Meta’s built-in AI is useful for answering those mid-run questions that always pop into your head.But the killer feature it is the integration with Garmin, for stats mid-run and for automatic highlights reels of your routes from the camera. It’s just so easy but requires carrying your phone on a run, which is a bit of a drag. Strava and other fitness app links offer something for non-Garmin users.If you ditch the phone and use them directly with a running watch for music, the auto-volume and basic voice commands for volume, playback and the camera still work.The very high price is hard to swallow but the biggest issue is the irreplaceable battery: you can swap the lenses and nose pads but like most earbuds and other smart glasses they are unrepairable,losing them a star.Pros:big and great lenses, secure fit, well balanced, loud open-ear speakers, noise-mounted camera, IP67 water resistance, long battery life, good case, excellent Garmin integration, good Strava and other fitness app links, swappable lenses and nose pads.Cons:very expensive, unrepairable, needs phone for most advanced features, overkill for just audio on runs.View image in fullscreenThe Oakley logo forms part of the touchpad for controlling music playback and volume.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsMetaWearable technologyGadgetsGarminRunningreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a standard computer, information is represented through transistors being on or off: ones or zeros. In quantum mechanics, things can be in multiple places at the same time. A transistor can be on and off at the same time, in a phenomenon known as quantum superposition.The effect is to create such a massive increase in computing power that a single quantum computer could, in theory, take on a task that would require billions of the most powerful supercomputers. The science is not yet at a stage to prove useful on a widespread basis, but the potential for simulating molecular structures to create new materials and drugs is enormous. The value of quantum computing, when it arrives in a usable form, has beenestimatedat nearly $1.3tn alone to the chemicals, life sciences, automotive and finance industries.Fears centre on the potential for super-powerful quantum machines to break all encryption exposing national infrastructure to cyber-attacks.“The quantum era will arrive whether Britain leads it or not,” Blair and Hague said. “But history will not forgive us if we again fumble the chance to lead a transformative technology.”The warning comes after the Cambridge-educated Briton John Clarke won the 2025 Nobel prize in physics for his work into quantum computing science, and as UK quantum firms continue to be bought up by US companies.In June, a spinout quantum company from Oxford University, Oxford Ionics, was sold for $1.1bn to the US company IonQ. Meanwhile, PsiQuantum, a spinout from Bristol University and Imperial College London, grew mostly in California after finding investors there most enthusiastic, and its first large-scale quantum computerwill be builtin Brisbane, Australia.A report from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change critical of the UK’s current quantum strategy warns that not only are China and the US “racing ahead” but Germany, Australia, Finland and the Netherlands are also making big strides.A government spokesperson said: “Quantum is a gamechanging technology with the potential to overhaul everything from healthcare, to our access to affordable clean energy. The UK already ranks second globally for quantum investment, and we have world-leading strengths in the supply chain in areas such as photonics – but we are determined to go further.They said: “We have provided a first-of-its-kind 10-year funding commitment for the National QuantumComputingCentre. We will be setting out plans for other areas of our national programme in due course.”In June, Labour announced £670m to accelerate the application of quantum computing as part of its industrial strategy to create new drugs for incurable diseases and better carbon capture technologies.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Meditation is not a magical remedy for all that ails you, but there’s a reason that more and moreAmericans are flocking to it. It’s a free, easy-to-perform practice you can do almost anywhere to calm your mind, reduce stress, enable you to sleep better, and improve your focus.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.People have been practicing meditation for more than 5,000 years, but you don’t have to travel to a remote mountaintop in India and meet with a spiritual guru to get started. The best meditation apps can teach you the same techniques, plus provide guided meditations and related tools when and where they’re needed – no travel required.I tested dozens of meditation apps for both iOS and Android devices to compile this comprehensive roundup of the best options available in 2025. So, whether you’re an absolute beginner, or have experience with meditation, these are the high-quality apps that can help you get the most out of this potentially life-enhancing practice.Why you should trust meView image in fullscreenPhotograph: IsiMS/Getty ImagesI’ve covered consumer technology as a journalist for more than 30 years, and in 2016, I was trained in transcendental meditation by a certified instructor. I have been practicing this style of meditation on a daily basis ever since. By combining decades of experience writing about and reviewing smartphones and their apps with my intimate knowledge of meditation, I performed extensive hands-on testing to compile this roundup of the best meditation apps.How I tested the meditation appsThere are no benchmarks for successful meditation, which can be a deeply personal practice. With that in mind, I tried to take each app’s target user and their goals into account as I evaluated the app’s functions. The best apps have a diverse library of content with different instructors, styles of meditation, and lengths. Features like timers and soundscapes are a plus.I also used each app extensively, focusing on what’s unique about each of them, the overall user experience, the quality of the graphics, sound, and user interface, and which features, if any, they were lacking. I considered how useful different components of the apps were for me, along with built-in meditation tools and guided meditations.After using each app, I asked myself whether it helped me achieve my meditation objectives.Best overall meditation app:CalmView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CalmIdeal for first-time and experienced meditators alike, Calm is the most comprehensive, polished meditation app available. It offers introductory training for beginners, along with an ever-expanding selection of professionally produced guided meditations.You can select from courses designed specifically for relaxation, breathing, managing stress and anxiety, improving sleep, and more. The app also offers a library of soothing soundscapes, which combine music and sound effects designed for use during self-guided meditation sessions.Calm includes both video and audio-based training sessions, and guided meditations that range in length from three to 60 minutes. Everything can be done at your own pace, and the app makes it easy to track progress. Of all the meditation apps tested, this one offers the most comprehensive selection of high-quality content.Why we love it:There is something for everyone in here.It’s a shame that…A paid subscription unlocks so much content that choosing the right guided meditation or activity can be overwhelming.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: $16.99/month (paid month-to-month) or $79.99/year (prepaid).FreeBest free meditation app: Smiling Mind: Mental WellbeingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Smiling Mind: Mental WellbeingSmiling Mind is an Australian nonprofit that strives to help people achieve lifelong mental fitness and wellbeing. While the app and its content were created by mental health experts, including psychologists, researchers and content creators, it’s all available completely for free.The first time you use it, the app asks a series of questions, including what you’d like help with. Options include better sleep, managing stress, developing mindfulness, boosting mental fitness, fostering relationships, managing emotions, living meaningfully and enhancing focus. Your answers will provide a series of session recommendations and guided meditations to choose from. Most of the audio features the same person, who has a very calming voice with an Australian accent, providing the instruction and guidance.One handy feature is the app’s tool for creating a meditation routine, which is especially useful for beginners. It’s designed to keep you on-track and get you into the habit of meditating on an ongoing basis. I also like that there is a separate library of content offered exclusively for kids and teens.While the app lacks the fancy animations offered by other options, the core content and training approach are easy-to-understand and insightful. Shockingly, the production quality is as good as the instruction offered by the most expensive apps and in-person meditation classes and workshops.Why we love it:Smiling Mind offers more than 700 instructional lessons, soundscapes, and guided meditations, all completely free.It’s a shame that…there aren’t many video offerings, or many choices between different instructors.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: NoneFreeBest meditation timer: Meditation Time 2.0View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Meditation Time 2.0Since meditators are encouraged to close their eyes, clear their mind, and temporarily block out the outside world, many experienced meditators use a timer.Meditation Time 2.0 app offers enchanting sound effects, like gongs, singing bowls and instruments, that can be set to go off at a preset interval, with a different sound played at the end of the meditation session. Just choose the length of the meditation, the interval for other sounds, and tap start.Unlike other free meditation timers, this one includes a brief teaching module with brief articles that explain basic meditation techniques for beginners. It also includes a small selection of guided 30-minute meditations recorded by professional speakers, and a selection of relaxing background sounds.Why we love it:Advanced meditators will appreciate the app’s simple timer functionality, and beginners will still find a basic introduction and tools to get started.It’s a shame that…the stripped-down design offers little to help you define or achieve long-term meditation goals, or use meditation to address specific issues.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: NoneFreeBest meditation app for beginners: Headspace: Meditation & HealthView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of HeadspaceHeadspace has the usual guided meditations, courses, and programs designed to help users reduce stress, sleep better, and build resilience, with an AI twist.Ebb is an empathetic, AI-driven companion built into Headspace that lets you privately discuss your thoughts and feelings. Based on your conversations, the AI recommends specific content within the app, such as a relevant guided meditation.If you’d prefer a human touch, for an additional fee (which may be covered by your health insurance), the app can connect you with a licensed mental health coach or therapist via live video chats.After sharing with the app what you’re most interested in working on, you get a curated collection of instructional meditation courses, guided meditations, and soundscapes. If you’re experiencing stress, anxiety, or a related symptom, Headspace also offers quick exercises you can jump right into and quickly gain control over the situation.Like the Calm app, Headspace’s content is a combination of professionally produced video and audio content, mixed with calming soundscapes, interactive activities, and tutorials, which I found to be very easy to follow. I like that each activity can be completed in just two to 30 minutes.Why we love it:If you’re new to meditation, Headspace offers the smoothest path to get started, with short tutorials that teach the basics in minutes, not hours or days of training.It’s a shame that…most of the video content is animated, not live-action. But the lessons are still on-point and extremely useful.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: $12.99/month (billed monthly) or $69.99 per year (billed annually).Free 7-day trialBest of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Plum Village: Zen MeditationPlum Village: Zen MeditationFor a more spiritual approachPlum Village: Zen Meditation was created along with Thich Nhat Hanh, a Zen Buddhist master, with content that integrates more Buddhist practices and philosophies. Core lessons come directly from videotaped lectures and Q&A sessions he’s hosted.With so much content freely shared through this app, one of my favorite features is the ability to favorite videos and guided meditations, and then create a custom playlist of content that resonates the most with you, which can be downloaded for offline viewing or listening.Why we love it:Plum Village offers beginners a bridge to both meditation and Buddhist philosophy.It didn’t make the final cut because …content from just one teacher offers a narrower view than some other apps.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: NoneFreeInnerNow: Meditation & JoyFor broader self-careView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of InnerNowThis app integrates meditation techniques with holistic self-care. A questionnaire helps determine your unique “mind-body type”, then the app customizes an ongoing meditation program. In addition to quick relief from everyday stressors, it includes a comprehensive 21-day “journey to well-being” program, and self-care content like a personalized mind-body report.A paid subscription unlocks more than 1,000 guided meditations, plus recorded lessons from experts, including Dr Deepak Chopra. I appreciated the session limits that can be set as short as just five minutes, and that it can save details of your meditation to Apple Health. The Meditation 101 program includes five guided audio sessions, each lasting about 10 minutes.Why we love it:The self-care content and lessons go outside the scope of just meditation.It didn’t make the final cut because …it lacks flashy graphics, highly produced sound effects and video content.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: $69.99/year (prepaid).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next, select how much time you have available to meditation (between three and 30 minutes). Finally, press play to start.Medito’s introductory meditation and mindfulness course offers 10 modules, each with a handful of short (10 minutes or less) sessions.Why we love it:Medito offers a complete suite of meditation tools without a paid subscription requirement, multiple male and female meditation guides, and comes from reputable experts and sources, including UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center.It didn’t make the final cut because …the app features a selection of colorful artwork, but there’s no video-based content.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: None (donations accepted)FreeOpen: Breathwork + MeditationFor tracking progressView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Open: Breathwork + MeditationThis app bridges science and spirituality with the technology already built into your smartphone. It automatically tracks your progress, generates reminders, and can share data with the Apple Health app, so all of your health, fitness, meditation, and exercise data can be stored, viewed, and analyzed from one place. It also integrates with the Oura ring, to track how meditation improves your sleep.While anyone can use the app anywhere, the content ties in with optional in-person workshops and sessions taught at Open’s studio in Los Angeles.Why we love it:The app provides high-quality content, and integrates with other apps and hardware you may already own.It didn’t make the final cut because …except for a few introductory tutorials, a paid subscription is required to fully utilize the content and tools offered by this app.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: $20/month or $150/year (prepaid)Free 7-day trialUnplug MeditationFor more video coursesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Unplug MeditationThe paid version of Unplug includes more than 1,400 videos, with instruction from more than 130 teachers covering over 40 specialized topics – from enhancing your mood, to improving sleep, reducing anxiety and stress, and lowering blood pressure.As you’d expect, the app also includes a meditation timer, soundscapes for self-guided meditations, and meditation goal and session tracking. I also found the integrated gratitude journal and ambient sound library (featuring everything from ocean waves to birds chirping) to be nice additions.Why we love it:Unplugs offers the most complete and diverse collection of video content.It didn’t make the final cut because …the app doesn’t include a better way to match its incredible library with your meditation goals.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: $12.99/month, $69.99/year (prepaid)Free 7-day trialGongMaster: Meditation TimerFor no-frills meditatingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of GongMaster: Meditation TimerGongMaster: Meditation Time is a straightforward meditation timer without too many options; you just get a timer adjustable between one minute and 60 minutes, and a choice of one to three intermediate gongs. The gong sounds can be customized, along with the app’s background wallpaper, but that’s it.Why we love it:It’s simple to use, no internet access is required, and the singing bowl and gong sounds are robust and extremely relaxing.It’s a shame that…there are no meditation-friendly soundscapes.Appprice: FreeSubscriptionprice: NoneFreeWhat other meditation apps did The Guardian test?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy PhotoMeditation Timer ProSimple Habit Sleep, MeditationTranscendental Meditation (Official App)Balance: Meditation & SleepOak – Meditation & BreathingWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Justin Paget/Getty ImagesWhat is meditation?While there are many ways to practice meditation, it basically involves finding a quiet spot, getting into a comfortable position, focusing on a specific object or mantra, and then harnessing your breath and focusing your mind. Objectives can include achieving calmness, stress reduction, better sleep, improved mindfulness, gratitude or even inner peace.The trick is to find one meditation technique that works for you, and then engage in meditation sessions on a regular basis.How can a meditation app help me?The instruction and guided meditations offered by apps feature the same techniques you’d learn working with a spiritual guru or trained meditation instructor. Once you learn the basics of meditation, the same app can offer calming music, sound effects, abstract visuals, and a timer to help you achieve the best results and center your focus.Some people prefer guided meditations, which is when a meditation expert uses their voice to talk you through a meditation session with a specific goal in mind. Many apps featured in this roundup offer these, too.How much do meditation apps cost?Some meditation apps are free, but the majority charge an ongoing subscription fee for content, which is usually continually updated. You can often save money by prepaying for a month, six months, or a year in advance.Remember, the best meditation apps are not always the most expensive. Always use an app’s free trial period to determine if it teaches meditation techniques you relate to, and offers the tools you want.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: pocketlight/Getty ImagesWhen and where to use a meditation appIt’s important to find a quiet place to meditate. Some techniques recommend a comfortable chair, others instruct meditators to lie down. Find a location and body position you find calming and comfortable, which will make it easier to focus your mind and calm your body.A good app will recommend how often and how long you should meditate, but focus on a schedule that works best for you. When you’ve discovered meditation techniques you find useful, you can also meditate at specific times when you’re feeling extra anxious, highly stressed, or need to regain control over your emotions.Are meditation apps really effective?Yes, but installing a meditation app on your phone or mobile device is just an important first step. To get the most out of meditation, it’s necessary to practice consistently. While you may start to feel relaxed or more in control after just a handful of sessions, meditating on a regular schedule will yield the biggest benefits.Can a meditation app help me sleep better?Self-guided or guided meditation before bed can help calm your mind and relax your body. This in turn can help you fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly. Using a proper meditation technique can also help you reduce stress, tension, and anxiety, slow your heart rate and steady your breathing – all of which can contribute to better sleep.Can a meditation app eliminate all of my stress?Realistically, no app or practice can eliminate your stress or anxiety entirely. Instead, meditation can help you learn to identify the causes of that stress and anxiety, and then assist you in minimizing their impact.By learning how to achieve a calmer state of mind, you can better manage your stress, control your negative thoughts, and lower your heart rate to achieve a more peaceful existence.Mindfulness is rarely a replacement for prescription medications. Consult with a medical professional to learn how meditation can become a part of your overall treatment for handling the psychological or physical issues you’re dealing with.Based just outside Boston, Massachusetts, Jason RRich is an internationally recognized smartphone and consumer technology expert with over 30 years of experience.

This was short-lived: Microsoft backtracked barely a month later, and kept it at the standard £60/$70. While The Outer Worlds 2 is technically bigger than its2019 predecessor, that decision was smart: this is not a £70 game.It is, however, a thoroughly enjoyable adventure that can easily suck up hours of your time, and one that improves upon the original game in meaningful ways. With far better combat and deeper role-playing mechanics, The Outer Worlds 2 smartly expands without spreading itself too thin – even if its story fails to delight.You don’t need to have played the first installmentto understand the sequel’s broad strokes: you’re an agent of an obtusely “benevolent” space police force known as the Earth Directorate, tasked with bringing order to a galaxy known as Arcadia. Like the original game’s Halcyon, Arcadia is fractured and frayed as a result of rampant capitalism, and you have unfettered power in your quest to forge new bonds or repair old ones between wildly different ideological groups, who are all armed to the teeth.You’re regularly pulled between warring factions, but there’s a bigger problem than the rifts between them: actual rifts in space. You’re introduced to these as the game starts, tasked with investigating engines invented by authoritarian collectivist group the Protectorate, who are causing these tears in the fabric of space. Upon arrival, you’re quickly double-crossed by a trusted associate and forced to spend a decade in suspended animation.View image in fullscreenColourful vendors … The Outer Worlds 2.Photograph: Obsidian EntertainmentWhen you awake 10 years later, Arcadia has changed dramatically and the rifts have continued to spread unabated. You have to cobble together a new crew to try to save the galaxy.Unfortunately for The Outer Worlds 2, nothing reaches the narrative peak of the game’s opening; a letdown you don’t fully comprehend until you’ve sunk around 30 hours into it. I kept expecting a character to shock me or storylines to unfold in unexpected ways, but found myself knowingly nodding at almost every turn. Though there are interesting characters to align yourself with – including a psychopathic cultist and a spy – I struggled to connect with this crew as much as I did in the first game.Despite there being three main factions that constantly vie for your attention and sympathy, there are few choices in The Outer Worlds 2 that feel impactful. Thorny conversations with narrow-minded capitalists force you to reckon with your own participation in the real-world economic system, but the characters’ two-dimensional takes elicit more eye rolls than eye-opening moments.If you have a high enough “speech” skill, you can talk your way in and out of most situations. This feels especially incongruous when a blind Protectorate devotee does a complete 180 after you select a specific voice line, though it can be smugly satisfying when you talk your way out of a boss fight. Yet, at the end of nearly every one of these major moments of conflict, you’re left feeling kind of like nothing you did really mattered – although maybe that’s the point.View image in fullscreenElemental firepower … The Outer Worlds 2.Photograph: Obsidian EntertainmentBecause of this, I found myself struggling to connect with the story. My companions may have had strong opinions, but they never seem to actually get mad at me, even when my choices flout their beliefs. There’s a lack of conviction in The Outer Worlds 2, which is especially disheartening because its whip-smart humor so often elicits a chuckle, but is so rarely used to make a sufficiently barbed ideological statement.The game offers impressive depth with its combat and its role-playing systems, which are drastically improved upon from the original. While firefights still have tedious and frustrating moments, the sheer variety of weapons and how that affects each encounter is thrilling: elemental damage has varying degrees of impact against enemies and each requires different ammunition. If you run out in the midst of a gruelling encounter, you’ll be forced to get creative. I’d often go into a fight with a rotation of weapons in mind, only to run out of ammo faster than expected, and be forced to try something I’ve never used before. I thoroughly enjoyed having to think and swap on the fly.Building your character is even more thoughtful than the original game, introducing “flaws”, a system that tracks your behaviours and occasionally offers you to accept a trait, often with both negative and positive effects. For instance, my reliance on crafting items results in the “Hermit” flaw, doubling vendor prices but adding a 25% chance of double items when breaking down junk. This was obviously helpful in my craftier moments, but a problem when I was low on junk and needed to rely on vendors: a fun little predicament that made me readjust my play style.Developer Obsidian has had a big year, releasing fantasy adventureAvowedand the insect-heavy survival game Grounded 2. All three are testaments to the studio’s ability to craft wildly different worlds that bend and shift to the player’s will.Even if The Outer Worlds 2 rarely blows my mind, and suffers from direct comparisons to Avowed, the smaller scope of which resulted in a tighter experience overall, there is inherent value in a role-playing game that so effectively sucks you in for hours upon hours. It’s not breaking the mould, but improving its structure: offering you something satisfying and solid that rarely surprises, but still manages to regularly delight.The Outer Worlds 2 is available now; £59.99/$69.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPCAction gamesRole playing gamesAdventure gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

The focus of his ire was Mortal Kombat, Midway’s bloody fighting game, recently released on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System after a successful run in the arcades. “Blood splatters from the contestants’ heads,” he told the room. “The game narrator instructs the player to finish his opponent. That player may choose a method of murder ranging from ripping a heart out or pulling off the head of the opponent, with spinal cord attached.”Lieberman’s aim with the congressional hearing had been to force the US games industry into creating a formal ratings system, preventing minors from buying violent titles. He succeeded in that – the Entertainment Software Rating Board was established as a result of the hearing – but he also boosted a moral panic that had quietly begun with the launch of the Mortal Kombat arcade game in 1992. This then took on more urgency following the high-profile home console release on 13 September 1993 – a global simultaneous launch Midway named Mortal Monday. US news networks weresending reporters to arcades, interrogating teens as they enthusiastically dismembered each other’s fighters. Newspapers were interviewing alarmed child psychologists. The BBC responded byfeaturing the gameon its late-night news magazine programme The Late Show, calling in author Will Self to play live in the studio.View image in fullscreenCharmingly jerky … Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection.Photograph: AtariIt’s interesting now to watch those hearings and then look at the game they were describing. Released this week, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is an anthology of the first four titles in the series, in arcade and various home console forms, as well as an array of spin-offs for the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation. The original titles are almost quaint relics of 1990s teen culture. The digitised visuals, created by filming actors performing martial arts moves then converting that footage into 2D sprite animations, are charmingly jerky and low-resolution, the controversial fatalities more bloodily amusing than horrifying. Brilliantly, the Kollection comes with a Fatality Trainer allowing you to easily access and practise the viscera-splattered death moves from each title. If this mode had been available at the time, it’s probably the only thing I’d have played.Playing again now, the game is obviously a product of twenty-something guys brought up on 80s horror films. Midway had originally assembled a four-man team including coder Ed Boon and John Tobias to produce a combat action game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, when that deal fell through, Boon and Tobias imagined a competitor to hugely successful Capcom hit Street Fighter II, inspired by the wave of popular hyperviolent martial arts flicks such as Bloodsport and Best of the Best. Boon’s elevator pitch was “the MTV version of Street Fighter”, and the fatalities emerged throughout the development process, the team pulling in ideas from their favourite movies: RoboCop, Terminator and Enter the Dragon. Straight away, the company knew that blood and guts would mean notoriety and no one was fazed.Talking to Polygon in 2022, Boon said, “If there was something that we would even say, ‘Is this going too far?’ our CEO was like, ‘No, go even further.’ Plus we had [Midway game designer] Eugene Jarvis as our mentor […] he had just done Narc, which was a pretty violent game in its own right. So if anything, we were encouraged to goevenfurther.”In effect, the moral panic over Mortal Kombat was to the early 1990s what the video nasty controversy was to the early 1980s. It was about the fear of new entertainment technologies entering family homes unchecked and poisoning the minds of children. It also ensured the success of the series. Mortal Kombat became the biggest-selling game of the Christmas season and beyond, shifting six million copies across multiple machines. What the Kollection shows is how adaptable the games have been, taking the original arcade concept on to handheld platforms and then into the 32-bit console era where spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces expanded into the action-adventure genre.For the industry itself, the Mortal Kombat panic simply became a new front on which to fight the console wars. Sega courted the controversy, allowing Mega Drive owners to access the full gore of the arcade version by inputting a “secret” code. By contrast, Nintendo sought to bolster its family-friendly image by removing fatalities and turning the game’s blood into grey “sweat”. Unsurprisingly, it was the Sega version that sold best.View image in fullscreenSo real it hurts … An original press ad for Mortal Kombat.Photograph: MidwayThere have been many media panics since this one. Doom remained a tabloid fixture for the entire 1990s, becominginextricably linkedwith the Columbine school shooting due to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold’s interest in the game. Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty were regular targets throughout the 2010s, and more recently Fortnite has been accused of leading a generation of schoolchildreninto addiction. But the sight of Joe Lieberman in that wood-panelled senate room describing gruesome images from Mortal Kombat – as well as Night Trap and Lethal Enforcers – retains its unique fascination.This was a turning point for the games business – it was the era in which the focus shifted from children to teens, from abstract puzzlers and platformers to graphically rich shooters, bloody fighting games and adult-oriented action adventures. Midway set out to discover exactly what it could get away with. The answer shaped the entire industry.Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is out now on PC, PS5, Switch and Xbox.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s my plan to break the spellDave SchillingRules seem unlikely to help – kids will just rebel. Instead, try saying it all the time yourselfMon 3 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 08.19 ESTShareDon’t tell your kids, but “6-7” isDictionary.com’s “word of the year” for 2025. Of course, “6-7” is not a word in the strictest sense. It’s two random numbers strung together for the purposes of annoying parents around the world. What does it mean? Nothing. When can it be used? Pretty much whenever you want to piss off an old person. Such is the state of global linguistics. Having a purpose or meaning to what you’re articulating is cringe. The point is to troll, to frustrate, and to alienate. Isn’t that the whole reason the internet exists? To organize us into factions – the smartened up and the hapless?For the childless among us, “6-7” is just online gibberish that is easily ignored – the password into a nightclub you don’t want to actually enter. For people like me with a Gen Alpha boy obsessed with belonging, “6-7” is something like the Rosetta Stone for having even a passing verbal interaction with your spawn. About a month ago, my son started saying “6-7” at any lull in conversation. He’d start asking for the thermostat in our car to be turned down to 67 degrees even if it was 62 degrees outside. For his eighth birthday, I bought him a personalized Dodgers jersey with his name on the back. The number he chose was 67. I purchased a size big enough for him to grow into, but the rest of the jersey will probably age like an apple on the side of the freeway. “Why did I pick this number again?” he’ll ask in three years. “Because your brain wasn’t developed enough,” I’ll respond.I know there are parents out there who aren’t just perplexed by this phenomenon, but actively furious about it. Another sign of the end of the world. The gradual decay of the discourse. If a phrase (“6-7” is not a word, by the way. Someone tellDictionary.com) means nothing, what’s the point of saying it? Steve Johnson, director of lexicography for the Dictionary Media Group at IXL Learning, who helped select the word of the year,told CBS News: “It’s something that’s used to show, ‘I’m part of this generation. This is who I am.’ It’s kind of like an in-group joke.” In short, its only purpose is to disassociate from polite society. A middle finger or acrotch chopused to suffice, but it’s 2025. Am I so old now that I can’t tell an authority figure to “suck it” and get my point across? What a tragedy.“6-7” is so ubiquitous in Gen Alpha circles that my son’s teacher has banned the term from her class. Seems a bit harsh, I think. How does math class go when my child has to add 35 and 32? Should he run out of the room screaming? Should he voluntarily send himself to the principal’s office instead of solving the problem? I remember being 12 and laughing about the number 69 any time it came up in passing. At least that meant something rude. And if you don’t know what 69 means, don’t Google it right now. I’m not trying to get you fired in this economy.All we’re doing is giving these little goobers too much power. By banning a random coupling of numbers, we’re telling the prepubescent that they can make just about anything inappropriate with enough coordination. If every child in America started saying “Bazinga” from Big Bang Theory on the playground, should we banYoung Sheldon? I remember when my parents’ generation thought Bart Simpson telling an adult to “eat my shorts” was the end of western civilization. Looking around at the world today, maybe they were right. But was that really the tipping point, or was it The Apprentice? I’m not arrogant enough to say one way or the other.Nothing makes a stupid child want to say or do a thing more than banning it. My mother telling me I couldn’t watch MTV just made Mariah Carey music videos seem like free softcore pornography. Today’s kids say all manner of completely abhorrent things on social media, YouTube orRobloxbecause we’ve told them they can’t. This is not to imply that children should be given no rules or structure. Just that, when given that structure, they will inevitably rebel against it. That’s frustrating, but it’s also incredibly natural. Our job as parents isn’t just to create rules, but to give practical and clear reasons for why those rules exist in the first place.If “6-7” truly means nothing, then why are we, as adults, telling kids to stop saying it? Can you tell a child why they can’t say it without sounding like a complete buffoon? “Because it’s distracting” isn’t going to work, either. It’s like telling a dog to stop humping the air because you can’t focus on bingeing the latest season of Stranger Things. You could just, you know, learn to ignore it.If adults really want to squash the “6-7” phenomenon, then I recommend doing what I’ve been trying at my house. Say it. Say it all the time. Suggest a “6-7”-themed birthday party. Randomly scribble it on the walls in water-soluble ink. Scream it in the middle of your child’s soccer practice. When you pick them up, give them a hug and whisper “6-7” into their ear. Prank-call their friends’ parents and say it. On pizza night, arrange the pepperoni into a “6-7” formation and take tons of pictures that you tag them in on Instagram. Nothing in this world is lamer than adults understanding and appreciating youth slang. Stop fighting it. Stop acting like you are above such nonsense. What are you, your own parents?Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionLanguageFamilyChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

The ad doesn’t make clear precisely what the supposed disconnect is, but the tagline clearly is meant to give voters pause.“Never ran anything,” former New York state governorAndrew Cuomocharged, as he dissed his opponent on Fox News. “There’s no time for on-the-job training when any given morning, God forbid, you could have a mass murder or a terrorist attack.” Cuomo’s campaign yanked an ad that went further, using racist stereotypes to depict Mamdani supporters.And the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page has been on an anti-Mamdani run for many weeks, churning out opinion pieces like this one from conservative columnist Peggy Noonan: “New York, You’ve Been Warned.” Or this one from Journal editorial board member Joseph Sternberg: “Sorry Republicans, There’s No Silver Lining to a Mamdani Win.”Another Murdoch-controlled newspaper, the New York Post, has not confined its views to the opinion pages but rather shouted them on its tabloid front pages. “SCAMDANI”, read one cover story, with a subheading quoting Mayor Eric Adams calling the state assemblymember a “snake oil salesman”.The pro-Trump billionaire Bill Ackman has warned New Yorkers that Mamdani’s personality is a fraud. “The whole thing is an act,” Ackman posted on X after the mayoral debate last month. “After watching him recreate his fake smile, your skin will start to crawl.” Ackman gave $1m to the anti-Mamdani effort through the Super Pac Defend NYC, while former mayor Mike Bloomberg has contributed more than that to efforts to thwart Mamdani’s rise; Bloomberg gave $1.5m to a pro-Cuomo Super Pac, after spending millions to help Cuomo in June’s primary.But if you ignore the ads, the headlines and the social media posts, another story emerges, as researchers from the Harvard Institute of Politics found when they spoke to young people during the recent early-voting period.“I think my life could really improve if he wins,” enthused one young woman, quoted in an ABC News story about the Harvard focus group. Another respondent compared him in one respect to Donald Trump: “There’s no flip-flopping.”And another approvingly described Mamdani as “badass”.The democratic socialist holds a double-digit lead in the race and right now looks like a shoo-in.It certainly feels that way to this New Yorker. I live on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, an area that split its vote in the Democratic primary between Cuomo and Mamdani, and I also spend a lot of time on a university campus. What I’ve noticed is that Mamdani energizes people and while some of that reaction is skeptical, a lot of the people I encounter – from students to seniors – want to give the newcomer a chance.New York City, after all, isunaffordable for too many, so Mamdani’s relentless focus on the cost of rent and groceries has struck a nerve. Mamdani’s embrace of his Muslim faith, his advocacy for Gaza and his willingness to stand up for immigrants has solidified his appeal.There’s a clarity about it that stands in sharp contrast to most Democratic politicians, noted Astead Herndon, editorial director at Vox who wrote a recent New York Times magazine cover story titled The Improbable, Audacious and (So Far) Unstoppable Rise of Zohran Mamdani.“He works from the premise of his beliefs,” Herndon said on CNN. “A lot ofDemocrats… have mastered this triangulation dance … where it feels like sometimes, they’re trying to say nothing.” And what’s more, since the primary, his campaign has become more inclusive, as he reaches out to constituencies and powerful figures who have had serious doubts about him. He’s won at least some of them over.Others, of course, will never be won over, but are becoming resigned to the reality of a Mayor Mamdani.Governor Kathy Hochul, whose political instincts are well-honed and practical, endorsed Mamdani in mid-September despite significant policy differences. (At a rally in Queens, chants of “tax the rich” interrupted Hochul’s speech and the Times described the progressive crowd’s response to the centrist governor as “tepid”.)Hochul carried on, though, and got a better reaction when she praised the candidate for refusing to “get down in the gutter” with his many critics, especially those who try to weaponize his faith or ethnicity.Instead, Hochul said: “He rises up with grace and courage and grit.”Hochul is expected to run for re-election next year.She surely has calculated that it wouldn’t be a bad thing to have the Democratic mayor of New York City in her corner. And there is little doubt who that will be.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist covering US media, politics and culture.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionZohran MamdaniNew YorkDemocratsAndrew CuomoUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Here in my favourite north London cafe, among the bare lightbulbs and the £3.80 cinnamon buns, I take shelter from the screaming terrors of Sadiq Khan’s no-go hellscape. Toddlers in pushchairs scream for salvation. A Lime bike comes dangerously close to running a red light. Like the Roman, I see the Blackstock Road foaming with much blood, albeit from this distance it may actually be a discarded pastrami sandwich.“Welcome to London, don’t forget your stab vest,” reads a proposed tube billboard for a brand of vodka being promoted by the comedian Ricky Gervais. Gervais is furious that Transport for London has rejected his advertising slogan, and rightly so, because this is the sort of generational wit that deserves the widest possible audience. It is, of course, the most minor of inconveniences that the design was never actually submitted to TfL and only ever existed for the benefit of social media. Because when it comes to the nation’s metropole, you can say pretty much whatever you want and someone, somewhere will believe it.I have spent close to two decades travelling up and down the country covering football, and one of the most striking insights has been how openly disparaging people from outside London can be about it. London is perhaps the only place inEnglandwhere you can tell people where you’re from, and instantly they feel empowered to inform you what a terrible place it is. Occasionally, your interlocutor will deploy the pre-emptive qualifying phrase “it’s a great city, but …”, before launching into a tirade about the traffic, or the cost of West End theatre tickets, or a dog turd their aunt once stepped in 1998.Allied to this is the misguided idea that to be fromLondonis to partake of some sort of category privilege, a place where life is effortlessly gilded and indulged. I met a Newcastle fan who assured me that there were three motorways connecting the capital with Brighton. I have met multiple people labouring under the impression (“no, seriously, look it up”) that London buses are free. Here in Sadiq Khan’s no-go hellscape, everything is too expensive and yet everything is endlessly subsidised: a kind of practical joke at the expense of everyone else.And of course London condescension is a phenomenon as old as London itself. But in the social media age, where those with big platforms have long been able to create their own reality as they go along, this kind of myth-making has real-world consequences. It is whypollsters consistently findpeople saying London gets more than its fair share of public spending. It is why working-class Londoners, mostly clustered in safe Labour seats, are perhaps the most politically disenfranchised group of voters in Britain. And it is why Khan, one of the country’s mildest and most inoffensive politicians, is forced to travel with a similar level of 24-hour securityto the king.Witness the sheer desperation among rightwing agitators and certain parts of the media to fold Saturday’s horrific train attack in Cambridgeshire into a wider narrative. “Multiple stabbings on train north of London,” read a headline in the Financial Times (that was later changed). “I’ve had enough, Sadiq Khan and Keir Starmer,”fumes a presenteron TalkTV in response to an incident that took place closer to Lincolnshire than London.In this respect, London seems to be part of a broader urban obsession among the global right, one in which the city itself is recast as a malign, seditious entity, a cesspit of violence and vice. The Trump administration’s deployment of federal forces in Democratic-run cities has been billed as a war against “invasion from within”. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has made theStadtbild(cityscape) a major plank of hisstrategy of mass deportations, an intentionally vague phrase designed to evoke fear of immigrants without referencing them directly.And of course to the rightwing demagogue, the demonisation of the city is often little more than a convenient vehicle for airing baser, more impolite grievances. When Nigel Farage referred to London, Birmingham and Manchester in 2022 as “minority-white cities” –wrongly, as it turned out– he was simply saying out loud the part that the right has long been content to leave as subtext. Anti-urbanism has long been a first cousin of white supremacy, each feeding into the other, the idea that there is an “authentic” homeland – the bits outside the city – of which the city itself is a kind of betrayal.This is not an argument that can really be won with facts and figures. It makes no odds to point out that, according to the Office for National Statistics, knife crime in Londonrose by only 1%in the last year, compared with 19% in Dorset, 31% in North Yorkshire and 51% in Suffolk. Or that violent crime in Washington DC was at a30-year-lowwhen Trump chose to unleash the national guard, or that there is only one motorway to Brighton. What the anti-urbanites find distasteful about cities – often while living in those very same cities – is so rarely a genuine concern for economic inequality or law and order.Rather, it helps to see rightwing populism as an attempt to process an increasingly complex world in increasingly simple terms. Cities, by contrast, are messy places: places of fluidity and freedom and possibility, places of chaos and collaboration and conflict. And sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t, but we embrace them nonetheless because in their forced intimacy, in their inexorable flow of ideas and influences and cuisines, they are the fullest expression of what it is to be human.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But if he makes it to No 10, Labour will be to blameMon 3 Nov 2025 13.43 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 14.34 ESTShareIf you screw up your eyes and look four years into the future, can you imagine a Prime Minister Farage standing victorious on that No 10 doorstep? I’m afraid the answer is yes – just about. I can see that ghastly grin. If everything that can go wrong does go wrong, then it’s not inconceivable, and everyone had better believe it.The showman had on his serious face to talk about the economy in today’s speech. He had some pretty heavy lifting to do, heaving out impossible promises made only a short time ago. Gone washis £90bn tax cut bonanza. Public spending will be slashed instead: Reform has already put 100,000 civil servants “on notice”. Farage the chameleon now says his is both “the party of workers” and one that is “pro-business”. Reform had also briefly posed as the party of poor children with asuggestionthat it would end the two-child benefit cap, but Farage rapidly cut back eligibility: now it’s only for couples, only when both work, and onlyfor British nationals. He also promised spending cuts andbig cuts to the benefits bill.His mercurial shapeshifting comes under a little more scrutiny now he tops the polls, but not much. His will be the greatest party of “risk-takers”,plunging the country into cryptolike Donald Trump. (Might he, too, launchhis own token?) With undisguised glee he predicts an economic collapse in 2027, forcing an election to sweep him to power. He mentions “a self-induced act of financial stupidity”. At last! Among all his backflips and reversions, is this the confession we deserve from the man who instigated the great Brexit calamity? No, of course not. He is talking about the non-dom tax he would remove to lure back wealthy expats, including some of the quarter of a million Britons now in Dubai.On Brexit, since the popular mood has turned against it, all we get is a grumble that others have “squandered” the opportunity it provided to reduce regulation. Expect nothing on the thousands of extra civil servantshired to replicate tasks done in Brussels. Nothing either on£80bn in tax revenues lost annuallydue to Brexit, a costly price for “sovereignty”. How absurdly he poses as the friend of Brexit-stricken business. Labour has, at last, taken off itsself-imposed gag about Brexit. It needs to hammer home the damage this man did to the economy.The only reason we listen to Farage, and the only reason he tops the polls, is his prowess in pumpinganimosity towards immigrantsto the top of the political agenda. This one-man band has only his xenophobic dog whistle to signal his party’s course into government, the same one sweeping the right in across the democratic world. Without that, who would care about his views on anything else? He has pledged “net zero migration”. In a deeply angry country, other sources of discontent may well fill his sails, but however hard he tried to promote other policies today, immigration is his only proven winner. As he takes up the mantle of the next popular issue, he buries his own perverse political predilections: his choice of Putin as hismost admired leader, his fondness for Trump, and his frequent calls to replace the NHS with private health insurance. Despite all this, his only calling card with voters is a toxic loathing for foreigners.He may have reached his peak. The political scientist John Curtice tells me that having scooped up older, socially conservative voters, Farage is less popular among the young, especially female voters, who are “almost all socially liberal on diversity, graduates and non-graduates alike”. Nor will Reform’s record in its 10 county councils back up Farage’s national promises of vast efficiency.Farage answered every question after his speech, except one. The Guardian asked if he still adheres to his lifelong support for proportional representation. Silence. It’s become clear recently he has changed his mind, now that our wildly distorting first-past-the-post (FPTP) system is his only path to power. FPTP is becoming his “friend”, he recently told Sky News Australia.Shamefully, there is silence from Labour on this, too, despitemajority supportfor electoral reform. If Farage should win, it will not be because of any image transformation, but because Labour’s failure to reform our electoral system would give Reform victory onjust over a quarter of the vote. That, after all, is why PM Farage is in any way imaginable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our exchanges of ideas and points of view are making me a better personMon 3 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 18.04 ESTShareIt seems like intergenerational warfare is everywhere right now. Aside from the fact it’s the burden of every generation to feel misunderstood by those older than them, and to condescend to those younger, the current tension between baby boomers, gen X, millennials and gen Z does seem to run deeper.Those of us in the latter two categories blame everyone older than us for the dire state of the world today (a viewpoint that sometimes ignores the fact that the world has been getting worse since the big bang). And let’s face it, it’s impossible to not be bewildered and feel attacked by people younger than you when they automatically dismiss your life experiences, start speaking seemingly in code (I still don’t knowwhat “six-seven” means) and laugh at your idea of fashion.Moving house has never been so stressful. Which is why you need an elite squadron of helpers | Maddie ThomasRead moreBut all of this antagonism may result in a major loss of opportunity, because there is truly nothing as rewarding as a good intergenerational friendship. I have the benefit of having a number of friends who are both much younger than me, and somewhat older than me, and the exchanges we have of ideas, advice and points of view are undoubtedly making me a better person.Importantly, it’s through these friendships that I’ve been able to both question my own assumptions, push back against stereotypes about generational identities and also stay connected to emerging ideologies, pop culture and technology that I’ve “aged” out of.When I was a teenager, it was my friendships with older women that helped me develop my confidence in my thinking, to put my problems in perspective and to understand that I could learn from my elders without it meaning letting go of my emerging independence and agency.One of my close friends, Sally*, is only seven years older than me, which, when I was 18, seemed like a massive difference. Functionally, it meant she was firmly in a different stage of life when we became friends and this was immensely helpful to me. When I look back on my coming of age, Sally was an instrumental sounding board for so many of my major decisions; when I dropped out of the first university I attended and enrolled in another, she lent me a box set of the90s TV show Felicitywhere the eponymous protagonist did the same, and I remember her humour and grace while I worked through the big decisions of who and what I wanted to be as a “grown up”.As I have gotten older and we’ve stayed friends, the dynamic in our friendship has shifted and, although I’ve always felt respected and understood by her, now I feel as though our exchanges are deeper through more shared experiences. I hope I’ve been a useful source of wisdom over the years too, having gained so much from her.On the other side of the coin, I find myself in the privileged position these days of being connected to several incredible young women, including nieces and a few special friends I’ve made via hobbies and grown very close to. Recently, one young woman, Milly*, who I have known since she was in her early teens, and who has recently turned 18, turned to me as a friendly ear to listen to some emotional turmoil she was going through in her social life. I felt so moved – and humbled – to be seen not only as a trusted person to talk to, but as someone she felt could offer judgment-free wisdom.Too often Australians weaponise the word ‘mate’ to mean the opposite of friendship | Paul DaleyRead moreIn return, Milly keeps me supplied in excellent social media memes, is my cheer squad and support when needed, and is a useful source of insight when I come across yet another gen Z term I don’t understand.Chatting on the phone to her the other night, I found myself thinking of when I was her age and Sally was listening to me work through this or that friendship conflict over a coffee. I can’t wait to be sitting across a cafe table from Milly in 10 years’ time, with our age and life experience evened out, and hear about all the cool stuff she will no doubt be up to then.When I see the feuds unfolding between generations online –the recent spat between Emma Watson and JK Rowlingcomes to mind – I can’t help but feel we’ve got it wrong when it comes to socially understanding generational difference. Each generation ismeantto forge new social movements and ideological shifts to the ones before them. We’remeantto find some things baffling about each other, but we should also be able to recognise how crucial that diversity of experience and thought is, not just to society, but in our individual lives as well.* Names have been changedZoya Patel is a writer and editor based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsFriendshipOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

It is an uncontroversial example of how the ECHR, whichturns 75 this week, has found its way into everyday life across the UK.In Westminster, withdrawal from the ECHR has become a new rallying cry for the right, which claims it is the solution to unauthorised migration. In early October, Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives said they want totake the UK out of the conventionif they win the next election. Last week, MPs voted down a largely symbolic proposal by Reform’s Nigel Farage to do the same. The right’s hope is that it will become a wedge issue similar to Brexit. “We are not sovereign all the while we are part of the European convention on human rights,”Farage claimed.Public attitudes to the ECHR are more nuanced than you might think. Arecent pollby YouGov found that 46% of people oppose withdrawal, while 24% aren’t sure. The fact the right has managed to convince the remaining 29% of people their lives would be better off if we ditched a treaty that restrains the British state from murdering, torturing or otherwise abusing them is alarming, of course. But to formulate an effective response, there is no point sneering. Rather, it’s important to understand how and why far-right populists have been able to confect a belief that human rights exist only for the benefit of other, undeserving people.Conservatives would take UK out of ECHR, Badenoch confirmsRead moreThe ECHR partly realises the human rights principles agreed on by governments at the end of the second world war. Those principles, outlined in the1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, state that people have the right to freedom and dignity wherever they live. That implies economic and social rights – for instance, the right to a life free from poverty – as well as civil and political ones. But the ECHR focused mainly on the latter, specifying the right to life, liberty and a fair trial, among others.Indeed, that’s why in the first few decades at least, it was a favoured cause of the British centre-right. The safeguards on individual liberty were supposed to protect Europe from communist dictatorship and, perhaps, prevent any Labour government’s large-scale redistribution of wealth. Indeed,a proposal for a “bill of rights”that would incorporate the ECHR more fully into UK law (at first the convention was only enforced by a court in Strasbourg) appeared in Margaret Thatcher’s 1979 election manifesto.By the 1990s, however, the left had more enthusiastically taken up the cause – partly because it had seen how the UK’s relatively weak constitutional protections enabled the Thatcher government to crush organised labour. In 1998, Tony Blair’s government introduced theHuman Rights Act. This requires public bodies such as courts, police forces, hospitals and local councils to respect the rights set out by the ECHR and allows British citizens to seek redress in a British court if they believe their rights have been violated. Legislation drafted by the government also has to comply with these rights.According to the human rights expert Francesca Klug (in a 2016 bookreviewed for the Guardian, as it happens, by an ambitious new MP called Keir Starmer), Blair’s government failed to realise the potential of the ECHR. Under attack from the right, it dropped plans for a public awareness campaign that could have fostered a genuine popular sense of ownership. (The recent poll, which surveyed people in Great Britain, found that just under half knew little about the ECHR; contrast that with Northern Ireland, where it iswritten into the Good Friday agreement.)What’s more, NewLabourmissed an opportunity to broaden the scope of human rights to encompass economic and social protections. The UK, for instance, has never fully ratified the European social charter, a companion agreement to the ECHR first drawn up in the early 1960s, which covers issues such as housing, labour rights and employment. If we had, then perhaps Britain would not have worse income inequality and weaker trade union rights than many of its neighbours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If people in general are supported to flourish, then it is easier to make the argument that the especially vulnerable among us – a refugee seeking safety, for instance – might need extra forms of protection. If, however, people are pitted against one another in a winner-takes-all economy, then it becomes easier for a vicious politics of resentment to fester.That is precisely what has happened in the UK. Over the past 20 years, the populist right has blamed the ECHR, with increasing fervour, for endangering Britain through the basic protections it offers immigrants the state might otherwise wish to deport. To be sure, this draws heavily on racist stereotypes of “criminal” foreigners and entails a great deal of myth-making about the way human rights protections actually work. But beneath that, it’s doing something else.As many people in Britain have gotpoorer and sicker, or had towork harder for less, and thespaces and servicesthat sustain communal life have been allowed to decay, the right has been saying: “Look, here are some people who should be even worse off than you. Don’t you hate the fact we’re not allowed to do what we want to them?”After the past two summers, the dark place to which this leads does not need spelling out. But it won’t be avoided, as Labour currently believes, by meeting the right’s demands in the middle. Either the ECHR and the protection it offers us becomes part of a wider politics of equality – or we lose it.Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: The Rise of Britain’s Far RightExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionHuman rightsHuman Rights ActKeir StarmerLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

To be sure, the scandal over Rachel Reeves’shousing situationis no Watergate. Her failure to get the right licence for her south London property, which she began renting out once she moved to Downing Street – potentially putting her in breach of the law as well as the ministerial code – is a minor blip compared with the country’s multiple social crises. The prime minister said the affair was a“regrettable” but “inadvertent” error, while the Tories have called for the chancellor to resign. Yet neither party appears to have grasped its deeper political significance.Two other senior Labour figures have also recently been pushed out over housing troubles: former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner forunderpaying taxon her second home in Hove, and homelessness minister Rushanara Ali forevictingfour tenants from her London property and hiking the rent. Why has each of them been foiled by housing?The irony, of course, is that housing is an area in which Labour has made some progressive reforms. There is valid criticism over the party’s changes to planning legislation and its wrongheaded “build, baby, build” supply-side approach to solving the housing crisis, which will do little to lower prices. But there has also been some welcome funding and legislation. The party aims to spend £39bn building 300,000 affordable homes over a decade, 60% of which will be for social rent. And theRenters’ Rights Act, which recently received royal assent, will make the UK more closely aligned with European norms on rental regulation, protecting tenants from no-fault evictions and unreasonable costs. There are also rumours that the budget will involve some changes to property taxation, with theplanto put expensive houses in a higher council tax band. This is the least radical option for raising revenue from wealthy homeowners, but still a clear improvement on the present system.Still, such policies will not be felt immediately by the wider public – especially when it comes to building – and in the meantime, housing will continue to be a site of political theatre. For obvious reasons, it is a potential liability for ministers who have homes in both London and their constituencies, or are given grace-and-favour apartments, as in the case of the prime minister, chancellor and the foreign secretary. Reeves, of course, lives at No 11 and has access to a 21-roommansionin Buckinghamshire.Yet ministers are often more than accidental landlords. There are85landlords in total serving in parliament, and more than half of them in the Labour party. Reeves and her husband reportedly have another London flat in addition to their larger home, from which they make rental income. This surplus of property is not a good look at a time of public austerity – “iron-clad” constraints keep public investment at miserly levels, just enough to stop departments such as health and education from collapsing. Day-to-day administrative budgets are due to fall by16%on average. Benefits fordisabled peopleare set to be cut. The forthcomingbudgetpromises even more pain, with the government doubling down on its commitment to so-called fiscal credibility.Nor is Reeves’s error a good look in light of her previous record. While at Halifax Bank of Scotland she wasinvestigatedfor her allegedly “cavalier” approach to expenses, with a complaint claiming that she and other colleagues were using them to “fund a lifestyle”, and as a frontbench politician, shereceivedthousands of pounds in donations to spend on clothes, plus free tickets to a Sabrina Carpenter concert and the National Theatre – her late declaration of the latter was aviolationof parliamentary rules.As the party historically associated with workers,Labourcontinues to stake its credibility on serving “the people”, even though its current leadership is largely drawn from professional and political backgrounds rather than the labour movement. Even if the government is now taking small steps to lessen the housing crisis and make rental conditions more secure, this will not affect the legitimate impression among many of the public that Labour belongs to a political class whose interests are opposed to theirs. This chasm, in turn, makes the party prone to scandal – which can be easily exploited by forces to its right. Until people feel that their housing situation and lifestyle are improving too, any ministerial advantages will surely stick in the craw.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The city of El Fasher in the Darfur region of Sudan, besieged by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), fell to the militia group last week, and whathas followed is a catastrophe.Mass killings are under way. There are reports that in one maternity hospital alone almost 500 people – patients and their families –were killed. The few that managed to escape tell ofsummary executions of civilians. The RSF has embarked on a killing spree of civilians so severe that images of blood saturating the ground have beenpicked up by satellite. The speed and intensity of the killings in the immediate aftermath of the fall of El Fasher has already beencompared by war monitorsto the first 24 hours of the Rwandan genocide.This is the culmination of a campaign that had walled in the population of the city – hundreds of thousands of people – and reduced it to starvation. Those who attempted to fleerisked death and rape, and those that remained were bombed and surviving on nothing more thananimal feed.El Fasher was the Sudanese military’s last remaining stronghold inDarfur, and this past week marks a grave turning point in Sudan’s war. Now two and a half years long, the fight for control of the country between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF has been brutal and relentless.Previously partners in government, the two parties ruled in a tense coalition with civilians after a popular revolution overthrew president Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The parties then turned on the civilians, before turning on each other. When it came, their confrontation was explosive; a revelation of just how much the RSF (created by Bashir from the ranks of Janjaweed fighters to protect him and fight his wars in Darfur) had amassed power and resources in the shadows. The war that started in April 2023 was not between the military and an upstart militia, but two armies, both with arsenals, income streams, thousands of troops, and external supply lines.Since then, millions have been displaced, an estimated150,000 have been killed, and more than 30 million people now needurgent humanitarian assistance. These staggering statistics still do not fully tell the story of Sudan’s tragedy, the country’s rapid unravelling, the destruction of its infrastructure, or the particularly merciless way the RSF has conducted its campaign in Darfur.View image in fullscreenA satellite image released on 31 October shows smoke billowing from fires around El Fasher airport.Photograph: Satellite image ©2025 Vantor/AFP/Getty ImagesWith El Fasher’s capture, the RSF has consolidated its position in the west of the country. Having taken the capital city, Khartoum, in the early days of the war in 2023, the RSF then lost it to the military, and focused its efforts on Darfur. There, it has wreaked its vengeance on the non-Arab populations, ethnically targeting them in mass killings. Earlier this year, in an attack on Sudan’s largest displacement camp, the RSFslaughtered hundredsof civilians along ethnic lines. What further awaits El Fasher after its fall, a city that held out against the RSF for so long, is unthinkable. Thevideos emergingare of locals pleading with militiamen for their lives. One was told by a commander that none will be spared, before being shot. “I will never have mercy on you,” the commander said. “Our job is only killing.”The siege of Khartoum has lifted. Left behind are scenes of unimaginable horror | Nesrine MalikRead moreAnd it was all predicted and predictable.Warnings were being issuedfor months about the risk of mass slaughter and atrocities. A million displaced Darfuris, fleeing other flashpoints, had become concentrated in El Fasher. As fighting intensified, they then dispersed once again or became trapped. It is a scenario that not only recalls the first days of the Rwanda genocide, but past episodes of Darfur’s genocide 20 years ago, only this time more concentrated and intense. The RSF of today is the Janjaweed of yesteryear, except this time armed to the teeth, supported by powerful external allies, and with a renewed appetite to purge once more non-Arab populations it has been hostile to for decades. Todaythey comenot on camel or horseback, but on4x4 “technicals”armed with mounted machine guns andpowerful drones.That arsenal, and therefore the calamity in El Fasher and the wider Darfur region, is sponsored by the United Arab Emirates. A staunch historical ally of the RSF (whosetroops the UAE hiredto prosecute its war in Yemen), the Emirates haspumped fundsandweaponryinto the RSF’s hands and, in doing so, extended the life and intensity of Sudan’s war. It continues to deny its role,despite overwhelming evidence. In return, the UAE secures a foothold in a large, strategic, resource-rich country, and alreadyreceives the majority of goldmined in RSF-controlled areas. Other actorshave been drawn in, overlaying proxy agendas on a domestic conflict. The result is deadlock, quagmire and blood loss that seems impossible to stem, even as the crisis unravels in full view.Sudan’s war is described as forgotten, but in reality it is tolerated and relegated. Because to reckon with the horror in Sudan is to look into the abyss of regional and global politics. It is to see the growing imperialist role of some Gulf powers in Africa and beyond – and to acknowledge the fact that no meaningful pressure is applied to these powers, including the UAE, to cease and desist from supportinga genocidal militiabecause the UK, US and others are close allies with these states. As the RSF encircled El Fasher last year, sources told the Guardian that UK government officials were working to suppress criticism of the UAE among African diplomats. Last week it was revealed that British military equipment used by the RSFwas found on the battlefieldsin Sudan.In Sudan, there are two military parties that cannot decisively defeat each other. Globally, foreign policy that was once the result of a mixture of diplomatic pragmatism and parties amenable to moral pressure has now been reduced to the naked practice of powerful states pursuing business and political interests, however they see fit. The scale and clarity – crimes visible from space – of what is occurring in El Fasher and the wider Darfur region leaves no room for pretences of ignorance. It is a repeat of what we have seen before, and a new chapter in a war that has gone on for long enough for all to know what is on the cards. Those who have leverage over the UAE, and therefore the RSF, but allow the violence to pass without urgent action or pressure have blood on their hands. The majority of El Fasher’s population istrapped in a killing field. Every minute counts.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To illustrate, the confronting data on the prevalence of child abuse in the Australian Child Maltreatment Study received nothing like the media and political attention given to, for example, the issue of workplace sexual harassment.Australia must put politics aside and pass nature laws that benefit the economy and the environment. We owe it to our kids | Zoe DanielRead moreRisks to the safety of our most vulnerable children have long been regarded as state and territory responsibilities, with the commonwealth government remaining at “arm’s length”.It has become increasingly evident that this traditional “hands off” posture by the commonwealth government, saying “It’s not our responsibility – you should be speaking with the states and territories”, is not working.There is growing recognition that the old ways of working on child safety and wellbeing are not fit-for-purpose for the challenges we face today.We have witnessed the resulting policy paralysis in the shocking failure to implement child safety recommendations from a decade ago, which are now being fast-tracked by governments in response to the most recent crisis in the childcare sector.In other areas of policy we have gone backwards, such as in the Northern Territory youth justice system where spithoods, and restraint chairs for children in psychological distress, have been reinstated, and the age of criminal responsibility has been lowered back down to 10 years. These regressive policies have taken Australia right back to pre-2016, when the Dylan Voller case was exposed by ABC Four Corners, triggering the NT royal commission into the protection and detention of children.In a repeat of a bad movie that we have seen before, just yesterday the South Australian opposition promised to get tough on youth crime in the lead-up to the election in March 2026.The failure of state and territory governments to look at the evidence of what will prevent crime by children is astounding. The evidence is in our Help Way Earlier! report tabled in parliament last year,which explains that harsh punishment of young children does not make communities safer.View image in fullscreenThe former national children’s commissioner Anne Hollonds.Photograph: Carly Earl/The GuardianThat’s because crime by children is a symptom of unmet needs and underlying issues that we are failing to address because of systemic problems in health, education and human services. The younger that a child gets pulled into the criminal justice system, the more likely it is that they will go on to commit more crimes.The reportrecommends a national taskforce of governments across the federation to work on a reform roadmap to address the underlying issues causing crime by children. This taskforce should be convened by the commonwealth government.In 2025 we have seen a relentless series of devastating revelations about child abuse in the childcare system.As almost daily media reports emerged, we learnt the extent of the systemic failures. The complex mess of laws and policies, and the fragmented regulation of early childhood education across the country, has resulted in the adults being protected, not the children in their care.Despite what a thinktank bleats to the Coalition, heat deaths are in fact ‘a thing’ | Temperature CheckRead moreSome of the long-overdue child safety reforms are now being fast-tracked by governments but this year has shone a harsh light on serious accountability gaps that need to be fixed.Lack of knowledge is not our problem. We know what to do. So why did it take so long for governments to act on the evidence to improve child safety in the childcare sector?It’s because accountability for action was either absent or obscured by the fragmentation of responsibilities across the federation. Child safety and wellbeing is a responsibility shared by all governments but the commonwealth government has a critical leadership role to play.This crisis has highlighted the urgent need to make child safety, rights and wellbeing a national priority and to fix the accountability gaps.For five years I have been respectfully suggesting that a cabinet minister for children would help to improve accountability and national co-ordination, just as there are good reasons why we have a senior cabinet minister for women. We also have “women and women’s safety” listed as a key priority for national cabinet but child safety is not a priority. In fact, children are not even mentioned on the list.We get women’s budget statements each year. We similarly need a child wellbeing budget statement for accountability and transparency.In light of what’s been publicly revealed through the shocking childcare crises this year, these are not radical ideas. We need to step up our accountability for child safety and wellbeing, and transform old ways of working that are not fit-for-purpose for the policy challenges of today.Australia is a rich and smart democratic nation. We can do much better for our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.Anne Hollonds is the former national children’s commissionerExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionAustralian politicsIndigenous AustraliansYouth justicecommentShareReuse this content"

Those are his hands you see in the film. I could never have ripped my face off with the same joie de vivre’Interviews byChris BroughtonMon 3 Nov 2025 10.19 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 16.46 ESTShareJoBeth Williams, played Diane FreelingWhen my agent said, “We have a script called Poltergeist”, my response was: “Is it horror? I’m not interested.” Then he said: “Well,Steven Spielbergis producing.” So I read the script, which Spielberg had also written, and loved the family in it, and the fact that there were so many strong female characters: Diane, Dr Lesh, Tangina the psychic. Zelda Rubinstein, who played Tangina, was a dynamo. Spielberg was busy prepping ET, so even though he was often on set, Tobe Hooper, who made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, directed. I’d never seen that because when it comes to horror, I’m a nervous Nellie.We’d all do improv to give the sense of a real family life – sometimes they’d just roll a camera while we were chatting and telling jokes. Craig T Nelson, who played my husband, had been a standup. Where we’re smoking pot in the bedroom, he improvised the “before/after/before” routine with his stomach. Little Heather O’Rourke, who played my youngest daughter, Carol Anne, was just five at the time, but very intuitive. If I cried in a scene, she’d cry too. When we were covered in cold goop, she was shivering and shaking but never complained. She was such a trooper.Early in the film, the camera follows Diane across the kitchen after she’s juststraightened some chairs. When she turns back, they’ve been silently stacked on the table, impossibly fast. It was all done in one uninterrupted take, with crew members rushing on while out of shot to remove one set of chairs and put the pre-stacked tower in place. They were like a herd of elephants – the sound was re-dubbed afterwards. My biggest problem was trying to keep a straight face.Later, I get dragged across the bed, up the wall and across the ceiling by an invisible force. That was filmed on a rotating set called a gimbal, like the one that allowedFred Astaire to dance on the ceiling in Royal Wedding. The cameraman, Dennis, was strapped to the set and had to go round and round like he was on a ferris wheel. After a few takes, bless his heart, he had to get off, because he was nauseous.Theskeletonsthat surround Diane after she falls into the pool were all real – though I didn’t learn that until I ran into one of the special effects guys later. I’d have been even more disgusted had I realised they weren’t just props, but at the time I was more concerned about the lights and the huge fans creating the wind effect. I was terrified one would fall into the water and electrocute me. Spielberg actually waded in up to his waist and said: “If you get electrocuted, it’ll kill me, too.” That was reassuring.Martin Casella, played Dr Marty CaseyPoltergeist was my first movie and I got to act withBeatrice Straight, who I worshipped. She’s exquisite in the role of Dr Lesh, the parapsychologist who investigates the house. Richard Lawson and I played her assistants and I guess it’s because my character is the sceptical one that, as Tobe put it, the house hates me.The steak Marty sees crawling along a kitchen countertop like an inchworm was operated by a guy underneath poking a couple of chopsticks up through a track disguised as the grouting between the tiles. When Marty throws the chicken leg he’s eating on the floor in disgust and we see it covered in maggots, there were handlers on set to scoop them up and ensure none of them came to harm.They made a complete upper-body dummy of me for the moment Marty hallucinates clawing off his own face in the bathroom mirror. I asked how much it cost and they said: “Oh, the wig alone was $10,000.” Remember, this was 1981. This would be a one-take, unrepeatable shot, with me reaching up from under the dummy and tearing away its cheeks to release the semi-set jello and pockets of blood underneath. I thought: “There’s no way I can do this.” Steven lit up when I told him – those are his hands you see in the film! He’s just wearing my ring. I could never have ripped that face off with the same joie de vivre.Later, I had to go back to shoot some extra footage of me picking at my real face. By then I was acting in a play I’d written and my hair had been cut short – luckily they’d saved the wig from the dummy. It took three hours to rig my face up with prosthetics full of stage blood. It was only when I got to the sound stage that someone realised the makeup guy had been working from the image in the mirror and put everything on the wrong side.There was no PG-13 rating back then. That wasn’t introduced until the second Indiana Jones film a couple of years later. Poltergeist ended up rated PG but, until Steven talked the ratings board round, that scene meant they wanted to make it an R. Another scene of mine was cut, where Marty is lifted into the air and bitten by some gigantic ghost. They rigged me with explosive squibs full of liquid detergent, representing saliva, but the first time they tried it the effects guys were joking that it looked like ghost semen.That wasn’t the reason it had to go, though. Steven told me it interrupted the scene where Diane senses her daughter trapped on the other side and says: “She went through my soul.” It’s a testament to JoBeth’s wonderful performance that he just couldn’t cut away from that.JoBeth Williams’s new film Not Without Hope opens in cinemas on 12 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmHow we madeHorror filmsSteven SpielbergFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Best known as the inventor of auto-destructive art – a response, he said, to the destructive horrors of the Holocaust – Metzger had also, over the course of a long career, been an inspirational teacher to Pete Townshend of the Who and campaigned for numerous causes including nuclear disarmament and vegetarianism. Now, on a video message barely three minutes long, he was making one final plea.“I, Gustav Metzger, am asking for your participation in this worldwide call for a day of action to remember nature on November 4th, 2015,” he began, appealing to creatives to take a stand against the ongoing erasure of species. “Our task is to remind people of the richness and complexity in nature … and by doing so art will enter territories that are inherently creative.”And soRemember Naturewas born, a day in which artists across the country created responses to our unfolding climate catastrophe (the 89-year-old Metzger spent the day with students at Central Saint Martins in London who had been cutting out climate crisis stories from old issues of the Guardian).“There was a great sense of urgency for him at the end of his life,” says Jo Joelson, one of the original curators of Remember Nature, as well as being a neighbour and carer for Metzger in his final years. “I just said to him – let’s not mess around. Let’s not wait for funding or for anyone to green light this. Let’s just do it.”View image in fullscreen‘He had a great sense of urgency’ … Gustav Metzger with students from Central Saint Martins in 2015.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Serpentine GalleriesA decade on, Remember Nature might not have incited the mass movement across the arts that Metzger had wished for, but Joelson believes its ripples can still be felt in movements such asCulture DeclaresandExtinction Rebellion, as well as in the way artists approach the sustainability of their practices. That’s why she’s restaging it to mark its 10-year anniversary. Among the 18 lead artists involved this time areCornelia Parker,Yu-Chen Wang,A Man Called AdamandAnya Gallaccio. They have all designed posters, recorded their own Remember Nature calls to action and created artworks set to be unveiled on 4 November 2025.When I speak to Gallaccio she’s out in a field in Kent, helping plant apple trees that will grow to form a spiral-shaped orchard. Working with schoolchildren, her project is half artwork (the espalier trees will, in the future, look as if they’re holding hands with each other) and half educational workshop. As she tells me, the planning and planting sessions have already involved learning about maths (measuring out the spaces between trees), science (they discussed the apple’s DNA) and geography (tracing the stories of how different apples arrived in Britain).A lot of the apples were chosen because they’ve got funny names such as the Bloody Butcher or the Duck’s Bill. We have one apple that ‘bleeds’ red juice“A lot of the apples were chosen because they’ve got funny names such as the Bloody Butcher or the Duck’s Bill,” says Gallaccio. “We have one apple that ‘bleeds’ red juice. They all have stories behind them. The decio apple was introduced by the Romans. The Flower of Kent is the apple that fell from a tree and landed on Isaac Newton’s head.”Gallaccio wanted the children to be more actively aware of nature and the control we have over it. “For a lot of them, apples were just things you find in a supermarket, so I was encouraging them, next time they were out with whoever does the shopping, to look on the bag and see what they’re called and where they were grown. Hopefully it says Kent!”Next year Gallaccio intends for the children to return to the orchard to harvest and taste the different apples – and hopefully form a connection with the trees that endures over the 20-year period the field has been reserved for. She also sees the orchard as a “very good visual marker of climate change and global warming” in that there is evidence already that our warmer seasons are making trees confused about what time of year it actually is. “It will be interesting to see what that means in terms of how the trees adapt and when they fruit or don’t fruit.”View image in fullscreenSinging plants back to health … Some Kind of Love/Forest Choir by Uta Kögelsberger.Photograph: Courtesy the artistThe planting was filmed and a stream will be available to watch on 4 November, but of course Gallaccio’s project is just one of many. In London,Youngsook Choi’s Book of Losswill involve participants searching Tate Modern on a quest to find the seven major glaciers that have been lost in recent years. Each glacier will be drawn on the gallery’s windows and walls using ultraviolet markers. Whenever one is found, a bell will ring and a reading will be performed to commemorate that particular glacier.Meanwhile, up in Barrow-in-Furness,Maddi Nicholsonwill be putting on a free exhibition about our disconnection from the land, as well as hosting a communal feast, prepared with organic, local produce. Over in Newcastle,Uta Kögelsbergeris streaming her Some Kind of Love / Forest Choir, in which local singers embark on a mission to sing plants back to health in Newcastle’s Jesmond Dene.Like Gallaccio, Cornelia Parker will be working with schoolchildren – on the day itself she is aiming to cover Cambridge’s Kettle’s Yard in kids’ letters and drawings that document their hopes and fears for the future. “Children’s words and images are powerful because they’re not as trammelled as adults,” she says in her call to action video. “What children have to offer to the world is something quite unique and hopefully it will provoke a sense of responsibility from us all. Children are innocent. They have fears about the future. But this shouldn’t be about fear – it should be about hope and us ensuring that they get a future.”Paul Harfleet’s work also appeals to children. As a former drag queen, his Birds Can Fly project involves drawing birds and then dressing up as them – and for Remember Nature day he is planning to tackle Liverpool’s famous Liver bird. He is also staging a walking tour of the city, visiting various sites that have been part of hisPansy Projectover the last two decades. That ongoing series began when he was living in Manchester and endured three incidents of homophobic abuse on a single day. In response, Harfleet decided to plant a pansy at the site of each occurrence and photograph it – the project has since spiralled to include incidents experienced by other people across the world. “I leave the pansies there but they don’t often last very long,” says Harfleet. “Apparently pigeons like to eat them, so they’re a very temporary memorial.”View image in fullscreenTemporary memorial … Paul Harfleet’s Pansy Project.Photograph: Wen-Chi-Su 2014Harfleet chose the pansy not just for the obvious reason – it has long been a term of homophobic abuse – but also because its name derives from the French verb,penser, to think. “It became associated with a man who is thoughtful, and that, of course, is a terrible thing,” he says.The plan on 4 November is to plant pansies at new locations and also replant flowers in places he has previously memorialised, all the while talking to those on the walking tour about the incidents and his memories of them. “There’s been quite a few since I last planted,” he says sadly.Harfleet hopes his work – and that of other artists participating – will create conversations and spark debate, just like Metzger’s work. “I found it really moving the way he remained optimistic, even in old age,” he says.Joelson also cherishes Metzger’s positive nature, and says that’s what guided her to restage Remember Nature in the first place. “We wanted to offer something compelling and empowering rather than doomy and gloomy, which we’re bombarded with all the time,” she says. “We can’t live our lives in darkness, so let’s use his mantra instead: go forwards, with hope!”Remember Nature 2025 takes place on 4 November at 16 arts institutions across BritainExplore more on these topicsArt and designEnvironmental activismProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The drummer is talking about his favourite gig with the Smiths: the night in July 1986 when The Queen Is Dead tour hit Salford Maxwell Hall. “They weren’t taking ticket stubs off people coming in. So they were giving their tickets back out through the bog window.” The show ended up at double capacity. “They had to evacuate the bar downstairs because the sprung dancefloor was collapsing. Delirium! There were people crying their eyes out, strangers hugging each other – and that was before E!”Joyce, garrulously upbeat company, has just written a warm, engaging memoir, The Drums, celebrating the Smiths. It’s a “right place, right time” story of his memories as the great indie band tore down the boundaries of British guitar music, with Johnny Marr’s beautifully intricate playing merging immaculately with Morrissey’s words, resulting in devastating, romantic and witty vignettes that perfectly captured everyday life.Some guy opened the door and told me to fuck off“I wanted the book to be about the majesty of it,” says Joyce. “How it was wonderful and interesting and crazy and weird. Not the negatives.” That’s why The Drums stops just after the 1987 split, before Joyce went on to work with the likes of Sinéad O’Connor and Julian Cope, and before the Smiths’s infamously chequered legacy of court cases, spats and the ongoing drama of Morrissey’s controversial worldview. “From what I’ve gleaned, he’s certainly got very different politics to mine,” Joyce says. “But that’s his opinion. He just seems very angry about a lot of things. Of course I hear it – people saying, ‘I can’t listen to the Smiths. I can’t separate the art from the artist.’ If that’s how you feel, that’s fine.” Does that make sense to him? “Not to me. But I’m listening to it from a very different perspective.”Joyce was born in Manchester in 1963, into a “strongly Catholic” Irish immigrant family. “The fear of God was absolutely entrenched in our lives,” says the drummer, although he does still remember a “happy childhood full of love”. It was not without its traumas: Joyce spent six months in hospital after being hit by car outside his house, an undiagnosed ruptured spleen causing internal bleeding that nearly killed him. The seizures faded after a year.View image in fullscreen‘The majesty of it’ … the Smiths in 1984.Photograph: ITV/Rex FeaturesSeeing Buzzcocks live was his ground zero, John Maher’s drumming inspiring him to buy a kit. Joyce became so obsessed with the band, he once tracked down frontman Pete Shelley’s house. “Some guy opened the door,” he recalls, “and told me to fuck off.”In his teens, Joyce joined punk bands, first the Hoax and then Victim, before a friend who also knew Marr invited him to audition for the Smiths. Before he got there, he took mushrooms but “not a call-an-ambulance amount”. He played well enough to get the job, before he started to hallucinate. Band dynamics were already in place: Marr as MD (“I’d never heard anyone play guitar like that”) and Morrissey, then still plain old Steven from Stretford, an aloof presence. “He hardly spoke to me.”Joyce says he found it difficult to describe Morrissey in the book. “I don’t want it to sound like I didn’t like Morrissey. He was fucking great. Very funny bloke, cutting humour. But it was such an unusual relationship. There was a distance. I accepted we were just very different people.”I went to court because I wanted what was due to me – and what was rightHe’s more comfortable talking about his bandmates’ talents, in particular Marr’s inexhaustible productivity. “Every day, you’d go round the house and he’d play some riff sat having a spliff in his jimmy-jams. You’d be like, ‘That’s amazing. What’s that?’” Then there were Morrissey’s lyrics. “Unique. Nobody writes like that. The introduction of gruesome, handsome, vile, charming elements. A brilliant voice. Stage performance interesting, intriguing, incredibly skilled. It’s a potent brew.” Andy Rourke, a friend for life who Joyce writes about lovingly, was last to join on bass. “I’d heard bass played like that, but I’ve never seen it played like that.”It all left Joyce feeling slightly intimidated. “I struggled because Andy and Johnny were miles ahead of me.” But he says he never felt unappreciated as the Smiths quickly caught fire. In November 1983, the band played This Charming Man on Top of the Pops, the same night as a wild show at the Haçienda. But in 1984, Joyce was called into a meeting with the band’s accountant. He hadn’t paid too much heed when only Morrissey and Marr signed the contract as the band joined Rough Trade.View image in fullscreen‘We sound like the Smiths because of the four of us’ … Marr, Morrissey, Joyce and Rourke in 1985.Photograph: Icon and Image/Getty Images“I assumed it was on behalf of all of us,” he says. “I was wrong.” Now he and Rourke were being told they couldn’t expect recording royalties in perpetuity after the band split. “I just said, ‘That doesn’t sound right.’ It was never mentioned again.” In 1985, he took a call from Rough Trade employee Martha Defoe, who on Morrissey’s behalf suggested Joyce take a pay cut, from 25% to 15%, because he didn’t do interviews or create artwork. He refused point blank.Does he mean to imply, in the book, that they were being underhand? “You can call it that. I mean, that’s why I went to court.” Both Joyce and Rourke began a lawsuit against Morrissey and Marr in 1989, claiming a 25% equal share of performance and recording royalties – they had subsequently discovered they were paid 10%. Morrissey and Marr argued the band members were not equal partners, though that’s not how Joyce sees it. “I think it sounded like the Smiths because of the four of us.”Rourke settled out of court (under “a lot of duress”) but Joyce proceeded to trial in 1996. He says if he’d lost, he would have been ruined. “But I thought that if I didn’t, then nobody would ever know what happened. I just wanted what I thought was due to me, and what was right.” Despite calling him “unintellectual and not financially sophisticated”,Judge John Weeks ruled in Joyce’s favourafter a brutal seven-day hearing, awarding him £1m. Weeks famously stated he found Morrissey “devious, truculent and unreliable” and Marr “willing to embroider his evidence to a point where he became less credible”.The case caused a schism that is still playing out. Joyce says he regularly gets trolled by Morrissey fans on social media. “I wish you were dead, how dare you, all that stuff.” He says he last properly spoke to Morrissey in 1992 when they bumped into each other in Altrincham. Aside from occasional glances in the crowd at Manchester City matches, he had no contact with Marr until the memorial service forRourke, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2023 aged 59.“It was good to see him. Because it wasn’t about court cases or who did what. It was about Andy.” Is he still glad he went through with the case? “Yeah. I don’t regret it.” Even with the personal cost? “Yeah,” he says hesitantly. “But I didn’t take Julian Cope to court and I haven’t spoken to him for 30 years. To not be in touch with people you’ve been in bands with isn’t that strange.”Joyce, now 62, chooses to take a positive outlook, talking enthusiastically about his favourite Smiths moments, from the studio playback of debut single Hand in Glove, which was the first time they’d heard themselves recorded as a band, to the time a rendition of I Don’t You Owe Anything made him so emotional he started crying as he sat on his drum stool. “I’m getting goosebumps talking about it now,” he says. From 1985, he adds, Morrissey would record his vocals without the rest of the band knowing what he was about to do. “He never had any light in the studio. It would always be pitch black so we couldn’t see him.” Then he’d start singing. “Mindblowing,” says Joyce. “When he did I Know It’s Over for the first time? Tears.”‘The musty whiff of a yard sale’: why is Morrissey attempting to sell his share of the Smiths’ catalogue?Read moreThe Smiths’s split was sudden. Marr summoned them all to a fish and chip shop in Notting Hill, London, and told them he was leaving. Joyce was blindsided – “I thought we were going for chips” – and writes about feeling bereaved. Having been a radio DJ in Manchester, Joyce has just come out of a 21-year touring retirement to drum for Pete Doherty. Yet Smiths reunion rumours haven’t stopped. Last year, AEG offered a reported $25m for the band to tour. Joyce learned of this via the press and doubts he’d have been asked to join. “I think I forfeited that with the court case.”In September, there was another twist to the saga.Morrissey announced his intention to sell his business interests in the Smiths, inviting prospective buyers to send an email. “I’ve got no skin in the game,” says Joyce, referring to any business interests. “But I thought it was a strange thing to do.” The drummer was mentioned directly: naming “Marr, Rourke, Joyce”, Morrissey said he “would now like to live dissociated from those who wish me nothing but ill-will and destruction”. Does he wish that? “I don’t,” Joyce says. “I’ve been sat here talking candidly about how brilliant the man is. It’s very confusing.”Despite everything that’s happened, Joyce couldn’t be prouder of his time as a Smith. “I was in the coolest, best British band that’s ever been. In my life, I definitely rolled a seven.”The Drums by Mike Joyce (Putman Publishing, £25). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

He may have lived in California for decades but some Welshness remains, in his distinctive, mellifluous voice – perhaps a little hoarser than it once was – and his preoccupation with the climate. It’s a dark evening in London but a bright, sunny morning in Los Angeles, and Hopkins is equally bright in demeanour and attire, sporting a turquoise and green shirt. “I came here 50 years ago. Somebody said: ‘Are you selling out?’ I said: ‘No, I just like the climate and to get a suntan.’ But I like Los Angeles. I’ve had a great life here.”It hasn’t been all that great recently, actually. In January this year, Hopkins’ house inPacific Palisadeswas destroyed by the wildfires. “It was a bit of a calamity,” he says, with almost cheerful understatement. “We’re thankful that no one was hurt, and we got our cats and our little family into the clear.” He wasn’t there at the time; he and his wife, Stella, were in Saudi Arabia, where he was hosting a concert of his own music played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. They’re now in a rented house in the nearby neighbourhood of Brentwood. “We lost everything, but you think: ‘Oh well, at least we are alive.’ I feel sorry for the thousands of people who have been really affected. People who were way past retirement age, and had worked hard over the years and now … nothing.”Hopkins will be 88 this December, but clearly doesn’t consider himself past retirement age. As a two-time Oscar-winner, a knight of the realm, a fixture of pop culture and one of the most revered actors alive, he has an embarrassment of laurels to rest on, but there’s still plenty on his schedule. He’s just finished a movie with Guy Ritchie, for whom he has a newfound admiration – “He’s precise in what he wants to see” – and he’s coming back to Britain soon, he says, to make a new movie with Richard Eyre (The Housekeeper, about Daphne du Maurier), then another one inWales.Nor is he too old to move with the times. On a recent Instagram video, he put on one of Kim Kardashian’s much-ridiculed Skims face wraps and channelled Hannibal Lecter. “Hello, Kim. I’m already feeling 10 years younger,” he announces to the camera, followed by Lecter’s trademark sinister lisping-slurping action. “Fun, wasn’t it?” he says, laughing. Kardashian told him she thought it was hilarious, he says.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

His new memoir, We Did OK, Kid, is far from your stereotypical luvvie memoir, partly because Hopkins is far from your typical luvvie – even if he does cross paths with past greats such as Laurence Olivier, Peter O’Toole,Katharine Hepburnand Richard Burton – but mainly because he’s surprisingly upfront about his often troubled early life. When he describes his childhood in the Welsh town of Port Talbot, the only son of a family of bakers, it feels like a different planet. “My father had that attitude: stop whining, stop complaining, you don’t know what you’re talking about, stand up straight, get on with it!” His father was also prone to depression and anxiety, Hopkins says. It was wartime and postwar Britain; life was just like that.By his own account, the young Hopkins comes across as a bit of a loner and an oddball. He had few friends, was frequently bullied and wouldn’t even go to his own birthday parties. He showed so little promise at school, one teacher told him he was “a brainless carthorse”. “I was living in my imagination, my dream world, I suppose,” he says. “I couldn’t understand anything intellectually or academically and that drove me into a kind of loneliness and resentment.” He retreated behind a mask of insolence, “a tough stance and a cold remoteness”, and that became his identity. Perhaps, in a way, he was already acting?View image in fullscreenBehind the scenes on The Silence of the Lambs.Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock“Yes, yes, I think I was,” he says. “The only way I could protect myself was, if I got a slap across the head from a school teacher, I’d stare them out and I’d defy them. I wouldn’t react at all.” You can almost picture a young Hannibal Lecter doing the same.His despairing parents had all but written him off, but he told them: “One day, I’ll show you,” he says. “I discovered that I had one small gift: I could remember things.” He was an avid reader, and easily retained facts, figures, whole poems and speeches from plays.An early epiphany in terms of acting was seeing Olivier’s film adaptation of Hamlet at school in 1949, when he was 12. “I was shocked by my reaction,” he says. “I don’t know what it was about that, but it made such a punch in my head, hearing Shakespeare for the first time.” He started memorising speeches from Hamlet and Julius Caesar. His parents were amazed. (Decades later, his father, on his deathbed, asked Hopkins to recite Hamlet for him.)Hopkins even goes as far as wondering if he has Asperger’s or some other form of autism. As well as his memory, he details behaviour such as repeating words obsessively and a “lack of emotionality”. He has never sought a professional assessment. “My wife, Stella, she diagnosed me. She said: ‘Well, you’re obsessive. Everything has to be laid out perfectly.’ I have to have everything arranged. So that’s a little twist in the brain, I suppose. But I’m quite happy with whatever inner disturbance I have.”Hopkins’ memory is the foundation of his acting, he says. He reads his scripts 100 or 200 times, so every line is etched into his memory before he turns up on set. It started as a protection mechanism when he was a young actor, but it’s become his technique. “That was my gift, really: to know the part so well that I had no fear. Once you know the script, you have a relaxation to go on stage in rehearsal, so you can hear the other person. The art of acting, I think, is to be able to listen.”View image in fullscreenHopkins as Odin alongside Chris Hemsworth as Thor in Thor: The Dark World.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIn 1964, 15 years after being transfixed by Olivier’s Hamlet, Hopkins found himself auditioning in front of the man himself to join London’s NationalTheatre(cheekily, he did Othello, a role Olivier had recently made his own, albeit in blackface). He considers Olivier his mentor. “He gave me this huge break in my life. He seemed to admire my physical strength, because I had that in me, and I had this sense of Welsh danger, you know, quick-tempered.” He didn’t really get along with the English middle-class chumminess of the British theatre-world, though – the “kissy-smoochy-darling stuff”, as he puts it. “I’ve never felt comfortable with that.”One area where he did find common ground – far too much of it – was alcohol. “Drinking was a family tradition,” he says. It was a theatre tradition, too. This was the era of “angry young men” epitomised by John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger (Hopkins had been riveted seeing Peter O’Toole’s version in 1957), and of legendary, hard-drinking “hell-raisers” like O’Toole, Oliver Reed,Richard Burtonand Richard Harris. Did he fit that description?“Yes, yes, I did. I would not be trusted, and I would have fights and quarrel with, especially, directors. Looking back, it’s all paranoia. They were trying to do their job; I was trying to do mine, but I couldn’t take any … it wasn’t criticism, I couldn’t take any authoritative bullying. So I’d lash out.” He would often get into physical fights in pubs, too.The week before Hopkins’ first marriage, to fellow actor Petronella Barker in 1966, he impulsively quit the National because of one such director, declaring he was giving up acting. He recalls his colleagues getting sloshed at the wedding reception then heading off to perform in the afternoon matinee. He used to do the same. “Oh yeah, it was terrible. You used to be on stage and not know where you were or why you were there, adding 10 minutes to the play.”It was just the done thing, he says. “Yeah, we are rebels. We can fight. Who cares about the establishment? When you’re growing up, it’s healthy to want to punch out and be rebellious and survive. And it was a bit of fun, I thought. But I remember thinking one day: ‘Yeah, and it’s going to kill you as well.’”View image in fullscreenAs Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs.Photograph: Orion Pictures/AllstarIt certainly took many of his contemporaries. By the mid-70s, even as his career was going places, Hopkins’ drinking and heavy smoking were taking a toll on his health – and his relationships. In 1969, after two years of marriage marked by rows, depression and a lot of whisky, he walked out on Barker and their one-year-old daughter, Abigail. He describes it as “the saddest fact of my life, and my greatest regret, and yet I feel absolutely sure that it would have been much worse for everyone if I’d stayed”. He and Barker divorced in 1972.The real wake-up call came in December 1975, in LA. He woke up one morning to find his car missing, and called his agent to tell him. “Nobody stole it,” his agent replied. “We found you on the road.” Hopkins had driven all night from Arizona to Beverly Hills, about 500 miles, blackout drunk. “I was insane, I was nuts, I couldn’t remember half the journey,” he says. “And that’s a deadly way to live, because I didn’t care about myself. I could have taken out an entire family … I knew I needed help, I knew it was over.”The way he narrates it, a literal voice in his head asked him if he wanted to live or die. He replied: “‘I want to live,’ and the voice said, ‘It’s all over now. You can start living.’” He went straight to Alcoholics Anonymous. Afterwards, “I got out on the street, 11am, 29 December 1975, and everything looked different. Everything seemed sunnier, everything seemed more …benign. No threat in the air.”He doesn’t go as far as to claim it was God that spoke to him, but it was “a moment of clarity”, he says, “from deep inside here [he points to his head] or here [he points to his heart].” He has never craved a drink since. “We all have that power within us, and we choose our lives and navigate through that kind of … inspiration, I suppose it is.”By this stage Hopkins was living and working more and more in the US, and in cinema. “I just wanted some sunshine, and I didn’t want to be standing around in wrinkled tights holding a spear for the rest of my life,” he jokes. It was his hero O’Toole who had first coaxed him on to a movie set, in 1968. He knocked on Hopkins’ dressing room door at the National one day and said, “I want you to do a test for me,” Hopkins says. “He’d had a few jars, and we went to the pub afterwards.”View image in fullscreenHopkins in The Lion in Winter.Laurence Olivier gave me this huge break in my life.

It’s beyond my comprehension. And I mean this deeplyThe screen test was for the historical drama The Lion in Winter, starring O’Toole and Katharine Hepburn. As Richard the Lionheart, Hopkins looked and felt at home on screen. “I think that anger in me, or whatever it was, it gave me a strong presence. And I was cunning. I could listen to advice. Hepburn said to me: ‘You don’t actually need to act. You’ve got a good head, you’ve got good shoulders. Just speak the lines.’”By the 1980s he was building a solid, steady career as a character actor – all of which went out of the window, or at least up to a higher floor, with The Silence of the Lambs in 1991. Director Jonathan Demme had seen Hopkins in David Lynch’s The Elephant Man, playing a kindly Victorian doctor, and somehow thought he’d be perfect for the part of Hannibal Lecter – the psychiatrist turned cannibal serial killer. When his agent told him the title, Hopkins asked: “Is it a children’s film?”Hearing him talk about his most famous role, it’s clear how much Hopkins brought to the part himself. He instinctively knew how to play Lecter, he says – not as a monster but as the opposite: serene, precise, unblinking, “at once remote and awake”. Elements that went into the character, he’s said, included Hal from Kubrick’s 2001, Bela Lugosi’s Dracula, Katharine Hepburn and his old drama teacher at Rada, plus a soupçon of camp. The result was a character like no other; a new horror archetype, even.View image in fullscreenHopkins, aged 5, in 1943.Photograph: Courtesy Anthony Hopkins“I went to Pittsburgh for the initial wardrobe-fitting,” he says. “They wanted me to be in an orange jumpsuit. I said: ‘No, I want a slimline green suit. Lecter can employ anyone to make it, because he’s so smart, and he’ll kill if you don’t obey his orders.’” He thought hard about his first scene with Jodie Foster, when she visits his prison cell to ask for his help. “I remember Jonathan Demme saying: ‘How do you want to be discovered when Jodie first sees you? Would you be lying down or reading a book?’ I said: ‘No, standing.’ He said: ‘OK. Why?’ I said: ‘I can smell her coming down the corridor.’ He said: ‘You’re weird.’”Foster was also weirded out by him. She later admitted she avoided him as much as she could on set. On the last day of the shoot they had lunch together. Foster told him she was scared of him. “I was scared of you, too!” he replied.Such was the cultural reach of The Silence of the Lambs that on Oscars night 1992, host Billy Crystal was wheeled on to the stage strapped to a gurney in a Lecter mask. Hopkins still didn’t believe he’d win best actor (the movie won five Oscars that night, including his award). In his mid-50s, he was suddenly in the A-league and in demand, with some of his best (and certainly his most lucrative) work ahead of him. He seems to have thrown himself into it – big-budget epics, broad action thrillers, horror sequels (he played Lecter twice more) and period dramas, plus the occasional paycheck role (Transformers: The Last Knight, say).He has played a whole gallery of great men: Richard Nixon, Alfred Hitchcock, Pope Benedict, Sigmund Freud, Charles Dickens, Pablo Picasso, King Herod, King Lear, Methuselah, not to mention the Norse god Odin in Marvel’s Thor movies.But he is perhaps at his best playing the less-great ones. His outstanding turn as a repressed butler in Merchant Ivory’s The Remains of the Day, for example, who is tragically incapable of connecting with those around him, especially the housekeeper played by Emma Thompson. It’s another meticulously controlled character in the Lecter vein, which surely says something about the British class system. “James Ivory is one of those special directors,” says Hopkins, “because he lets you figure it out. He doesn’t direct but he’s got an artist’s eye. He knows about design. Everything was so perfectly arranged, you didn’t have to act.”It was as another relative nobody that Hopkins won his second Oscar in 2021, as an old man untethered from reality by dementia, in Florian Zeller’s The Father. The awards ceremony was one of the most awkward in history. As well as being delayed and curtailed by the Covid pandemic, the event was overshadowed by the recent death of Chadwick Boseman, who it was assumed was such a shoo-in for best actor that this was made the final award of the night rather than the traditional best picture. To everyone’s surprise, the Oscar went to Hopkins instead.View image in fullscreenAs Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone’s Nixon.Photograph: AlamyHopkins wasn’t there to pick up the award. He wasn’t even watching. “I was asleep!” he says. “I certainly did not expect it. God, where was I? I was in England, yes.” He was about to start shooting a film the next morning. “And so I didn’t show up and went to bed. Four o’clock in the morning, my agent’s voice: ‘You got the Oscar!’ I said: ‘What?’ It was a wonderful surprise, but the film itself was one of the easiest. I thought: ‘Well, I don’t have to act old. Iamold.’”Despite having been a Hollywood fixture for so long, and a latter-day Instagram star, Hopkins is not at all interested in celebrity. “I’ve never been one for the glamour side, the red carpet. I go along if I have to do one of those premiere things, and they’re pleasant and friendly and they’re OK, but I’d rather be at home playing the piano or reading a book,” he says. “It’s a necessary part of my professional life, to do publicity, but I don’t crave it.” His social circle is small: a few close friends, and his third wife and her family. He met Stella Arroyave in 2000, when she was running an antiques shop in Pacific Palisades, and they married in 2003. “She broke me wide open, helped me overcome the old feelings of regret and anxiety in a way that’s set me free,” he writes of her in his book.Even talking now, about his life, there’s the distinct impression that this is not Hopkins’ comfort zone. He is cordial but guarded, happier to offer an anecdote than an opinion. There are areas of his life he’s not keen to discuss: his daughter, for example, from whom he remains estranged. (He doesn’t dwell on it. “If you want to waste your life being in resentment … fine, go ahead. That’s not in my camp,” he said in a recent interview.) There’s also a line in his memoir about his second marriage, of nearly 30 years, to Jennifer Lynton, where he says: “It was only years later that she knew about my infidelities,” but he does not expand any further on that. He first met Lynton in 1969 when she was a production assistant – she picked him up from Heathrow after he’d missed a flight because of his drinking – and they married in 1973. She saw him through the worst of his alcoholism, he says, but she always preferred London to LA, and they drifted apart. “She deserved better than me,” he writes, regretfully.He is also reluctant to comment directly on politics or current affairs (he became an American citizen in 2000), although he sometimes does so obliquely, through the prism of one of his roles. When I ask about his repeated mentions in the book to having “a monster inside me”, for example, he references Nicholas Winton, the real-life hero he portrayed in 2023’s One Life, who rescued more than 600 children from the Nazis in eastern Europe and brought them to Britain.View image in fullscreenWith Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy“His only belief was, we must learn to be flexible, learn to be reasonable, learn to listen to the other guy, even if you don’t agree,” says Hopkins. “And stop being certain. Once you have certainty, no one can get into you. That’s deadly. That causes horrific problems in the world, once you think you’ve got the answer and nobody else. We’re living in it today: you’re wrong, I’m right; if you differ from me, I’ll have you killed or I’ll have you cancelled or unfollowed. I mean, what are we talking about? It’s rubbish. Changing the language to suit our own preconceived bigotry because somebody doesn’t agree with us, politically or philosophically or racially. What are we doing? We’re human beings, fragile animals.”There is nothing studied or strategic about Hopkins’ reticence, though. That’s just the way he is, and doubtless always has been. When he mentions the photograph of himself, aged four, on the back cover of his book, he says: “I still feel like that young kid.” At that age he was “too young to comprehend any meaning in existence”, he writes. So, as he approaches his 10th decade, has Hopkins come to any conclusions?“No. I know nothing,” he says, laughing. “I don’t think we know anything. I look around and I think: ‘How did I get this far?’ I have no idea how my particular life has moved from when I was in Port Talbot, a little boy lost, to here. It’s beyond my comprehension. And I mean this deeply.”He does, however, invoke that desire he had within him from a young age: to succeed, to show his parents and the world that he wasn’t “a complete dummy”. “I try to tell this to younger people, if they want to listen to me: really begin to believe that you have a power inside. You can do almost anything. Just tap into that trigger moment that will push you forward. Never give in. If you fall down, get up again. Don’t feel sorry for stuff, never be a victim and just get on with it. It’s a tough philosophy, but I think some of my younger friends have taken that advice.”Does he still have that desire to show the world?“Yes, I go on working,” he says. “They offer me work, and I do it and I enjoy it. I go over my script over and over and over, so that by the time I get there, I know it all, and that inspires confidence in people around you. You better show up and know your stuff, because otherwise you get left behind. I suppose the message is, live life as if this is your last day.”That’s exactly what he’s doing. “Now, at my age, I’ve accepted everything. I have no guarantees. I wake up in the morning, I say: ‘I’m still here. I’m strong, I’m fit, and a lot of my friends have gone.’ I look at my life and I think: Oh God, I’m so – and I mean this, really – I’m so lucky. I was gonna use the expletive, but I won’t.”It’s the Guardian, I say, you’re allowed to swear.“Fucking lucky!” he says.We Did OK, Kid by Anthony Hopkins is out now.

I had to pause and get up and leave the room several times because of the sheer scale of the wanton self-destruction I was witnessing. Rishi Ramdani is in deep shit at work and home – up to his eyeballs in debt to loan sharks because of his compulsive gambling, taking such risks with a bet on sterling which could lose his company millions. So of course, he goes on a gambling spree, does tons of drugs and drink and wins, loses, wins, gets beaten to a pulp. Every time you think it can’t get any worse, it does. There’s hope of redemption at the end of the episode but he squanders the opportunity, with horrifying consequences in the season finale.

It all ramps up once Jeremy and Mark find themselves having to lie about the dog they accidentally run over and subsequent attempts to dispose of it.

And if you watched it when it originally aired, you – at first – weren’t sure why. Tony’s enemies, real and imagined, were all vanquished. Surely this has the feel of the season one ending? “Remember the little things.” But the mood is bizarrely ominous. Almost Twin Peaks levels of terror. The family sit in a restaurant. Meadow parks. Tony sadly tells Carmela there’s trouble afoot with yet another of his crew working with the government. Meadow parks. Strange people enter the restaurant. Stare at Tony(?) Meadow parks. Tony puts a record on the jukebox. Meadow parks. The bell rings, someone enters the restaurant. Can’t be Meadow, she’s still parking. Tony looks up. Don’t stop. It stops.

Creator J Michael Straczynski originated the term “Wham Episode”, and this one delivers both in terms of building suspense when the opposing forces square off and at the end when the dust has settled you’re not left with a feeling of victory but instead the biggest “well what now?” of the show’s run. It gives me goosebumps even 30 years later.Greg, MerseysideThe Killing (Danish version) – episode 19 (2007)View image in fullscreenAn absolute masterpiece … Sofie Gråbøl in The Killing.Photograph: Nbc/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe first series of the The Killing (Danish version) is an absolute masterpiece, which spawned many a copycat and yet to be matched.

He wrote 39 plays, 26 novels and a huge amount of nonfiction and was dismissed by Virginia Woolf, with characteristic snootiness, as “one of the tradesmen of letters”. But, in art as in life, tradespeople are invaluable and with one of Priestley’s most popular plays, When We Are Married, about to be revived at London’s Donmar Warehouse, it is worth asking what the qualities are that make him a durable dramatist.It makes sense to start with An Inspector Calls, which was famously revived by Stephen Daldry in 1992 in a production that has lasted for more than 30 years. What Daldry and hisdesigner, Ian MacNeil, did was to cut through the play’s schematic outline and treat it as an expressionist fable about a family poised on the edge of self-destruction.But I am convinced that the reason for the play’s survival lies in the pertinence of the Inspector’s final warning: “We don’t live alone. We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other.” Whether in 1946 under a hard-pressed Labour government, in the post-Thatcherite world of 1992 or in today’s brutally polarised society, that message carries a timeless resonance.View image in fullscreenHumane socialism … Lydia Leonard, Hattie Morahan, Francesca Annis and Lisa Jackson  in Time and the Conways at the National Theatre, London, in 2009.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRereading many of Priestley’s plays, I am struck by the endless reiteration of the plea for social justice, allied to a romantic mysticism. The year 1937 saw the simultaneous production of two of Priestley’s plays about time: Time and the Conways based on JW Dunne’s ideas about the co-existence of past, present and future, and I’ve Been Here Before, about Ouspensky’s notion of lives recurring in an endless spiral. But, while the time motif is fascinating, both plays are underpinned by Priestley’s humane socialism.The most moving moment in the first play is a female teacher’s idealistic dream of “a free, happy prosperous people all enjoying equal opportunities, living at peace with the whole world”. The words are spoken in 1919 and acquire a pungent irony when the action shifts to 1937. There is an equally heart-stopping moment in the second play when an industrialist counters working-class hostility to a German refugee with: “All over this rotten world now, they’re slamming doors in the faces of good men. But we’ve still a door or two open here.” I can imagine that getting a warm response if heard on a British stage today.View image in fullscreenA romantic mysticism … JB Priestley in 1949.Photograph: Jane Bown/The ObserverMy own favourite among Priestley’s plays is The Linden Tree. Written during the freezing, crisis-ridden month of January 1947 when the country was virtually at a standstill, and memorably revived by Christopher Morahanat the Orange Tree in 2006, this is a forerunner of the state-of-the nation plays we now associate with David Hare and James Graham. In essence, Priestley hits two targets. Since the play is about the enforced retirement of an idealistic history professor at the age of 65, it pinpoints society’s disregard of age and experience. But the heart of the play lies in the prof’s confrontation with a daughter who has fled England to lead a life of expatriate grandeur in France.While acknowledging the drab austerity of modern Britain, Linden asks his daughter to recognise that the country is trying to do something as extraordinary as it is difficult: “to have a revolution for once without the Terror, without looting mobs and secret police, sudden arrests, mass suicides and executions, without setting in motion the vast pendulum of violence which can decimate three generations before it comes to a standstill.” You could hardly have a more pointed attack on tyranny or a more vigorous defence of the postwar Attlee government.In the same year as The Linden Tree, Priestley published a passionately polemical book,TheatreOutlook, which applies socialist principles to a reactionary industry. He attacks fat-cat theatre owners, philistine politicians, hidebound playgoers, and even has a swipe at celebrity casting. But he argues forcefully for increased subsidy, tours by national companies and a chain of civic theatres reflecting local character and outlook.View image in fullscreenIdealist dreams … Tom Grace and Helen Keeley in Summer Day’s Dream by JB Priestley at the Finborough theatre, London, in 2013.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianSome of what Priestley wished for has come to pass: it is his vision of a flourishing network of regional repertory companies with their own distinct identity that has been eroded by time and underfunding. But Priestley was always an idealist with an edge of mysticism. You see that in a play such as Summer Day’s Dream, written in 1949 and set on the Sussex Downs in 1975.Taking place in the aftermath of a nuclear catastrophe, it shows an American industrialist, a Russian bureaucrat and an Indian research chemist being enriched by their encounters with the Shakespearean and Kiplingesque magic of rural England. When I saw the play revivedat the Finborough in 2013, it struck me as wildly fanciful but visible proof that inside Priestley the visionary socialist there was always a mystic romantic struggling to get out.When We Are Married is at theDonmar Warehouse, London, 6 December-7 FeburaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreJB PriestleyOrange Tree theatreFinborough theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

By an accident of topography, the 50 inhabitants of Mödlareuth, a hamlet surrounded by pine forests, meadows and spectacular vistas, found themselves at the heart of the cold war. They had the misfortune to straddle Bavaria, in WestGermany, and Thuringia in the East, a border that was demarcated first by a fence and then by a wall. American soldiers called it Little Berlin.Months after their own wall was breached, and even before their country had reunified in 1990, a group of local people set about memorialising their history. The work is about to come to fruition: on 9 November, the 36th anniversary of the fall of the (big) Berlin Wall, the German-German Museum Mödlareuth will open. It was officially inaugurated by the federal president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, in early October, but the exhibition wasn’t quite ready. Addressing the villagers who lived through the old days, Steinmeier said: “You were witnesses of an inhuman division, which ripped families apart and turned neighbours into aliens.”View image in fullscreenThe Tannbach river demarcation line between Mödlareuth-West in the American occupation zone and Mödlareuth-East in the Soviet occupation zone, July 1949.Photograph: Otto Donath/Bundesarchiv BildEven at its founding in 1810, the village cut across the Kingdom of Bavaria and the Principality of Reuss, a princely house best known for giving all its male members the name Heinrich and numbering them sequentially by birth. As Steinmeier told the audience, the quirk never stood in the way of the inhabitants drinking in the same pub, attending the same church and sending their children to the same school.Then came the second world war. As soon as they arrived, the Russians erected wooden posts by the stream. For a year they took over the entire village, establishing their command in a house on the Bavarian side, adorning it with a picture of Stalin and a red star. The Americans convinced them to withdraw back over the brook. For a while, villagers could still hop over, though as restrictions tightened they were required to show ID, even though everyone knew who they were, and to return at night.View image in fullscreenThe construction of the 700-metre concrete barrier wall across the village in 1966.Photograph: Bundesgrenzschutz/Museum MödlareuthThen, in 1952, came barbed wire and the formal closing of the border. In 1966, as in Berlin five years earlier, a wall was built, with mines, tank traps and guard posts. The villagers could still see each other by climbing hills, but on the eastern side waving and shouting were prohibited. One woman was put on a Stasi watch list for responding “same to you” to a (Bavarian) villager who wished her “happy new year”.I was told stories such as these by Robert Lebegern, the museum’s director, who has spent much of his working life creating it. Villagers were consulted early on about how much wall they wanted to preserve. They chose a stretch on the western fringe, close to where one of their own managed to escape in the dead of night with a ladder, after which the border was heavily reinforced.View image in fullscreenA Stasi reconstruction of the only known escape over the Mödlareuth wall on 25 May 1973.Photograph: DDR-Grenztruppen / Staatssicherheit/Bundesarchiv / Militärarchiv FreiburgTwo watchtowers are preserved alongside a series of tableaux depicting the most dramatic dates in the village’s history. As we walk, Lebergen lists the regulations: nobody could come within 5km of the border. Farmers needed special permission to tend to their crops; the husband or wife could work the combine harvester but never both, in case they tried to make a run for it. Armed guards stood watch.The border between West Germany and the GDR stretched 1,400km, from the Baltic Sea in the north to here in the south. Berlin is remembered and memorialised the most, but more than twice as many people (well over 300) died trying to cross it in rural areas than in the big city. Lebegern reminds me that 95% of escape attempts failed.Most of Mödlareuth’s villagers were farmers or craftsmen, who adjusted to living in the grey zone between two ideological spheres by keeping their heads down and looking after their fields. They neither supported the communist regime nor resisted it, Lebegern explains.For visitors, however, the hamlet became a kind of pilgrimage. About 15,000 came to visit every year, binoculars in hand, to gawp – and then quickly leave. In 1983, the US vice-president, George Bush, was shown around by the German defence minister.Twenty five years after reunification, Tannbach, a TV series about a fictional village resembling Mödlareuth, led to renewed interest.View image in fullscreenPilgrimage site: the open air museum in Mödlareuth today.Photograph: Sina Ettmer/AlamyThe opening of the new museum – with a cafe, shop, cinema room and large car park – is likely to provide a further boost. Will it change the village? It is, in any case, changing all the time. Some of the original inhabitants on both sides have died; others have left. Newcomers have moved in, including a man from Leicestershire called Darren. His German wife, Kathrin, is a traffic cop for the Bavarian police. They live up a hill, past a chicken coop, on the Thuringia side.The village is still divided, administratively at least, with different car number plates and postcodes. When Steinmeier visited, he was accompanied by the state premiers of both Bavaria and Thuringia. And when his foot crossed the brook, he was formally handed over by one police force to the other. History has moved on; the border has not.This article was amended on 3 November 2025. George Bush was vice-president, not president, when he visited in 1983.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsGermanyCold warEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The actor and directortoldNBC’s Today that he was “donating my kidney in six weeks” but wasn’t entirely sure of his motivation.“I don’t know why,” he said. “I got bitten by the blood donation bug. I’m doing an altruistic donation [in] mid-December. I’m so excited to do it.”Eisenberg, 42, added that he had first had the idea of organ donation while still alive around a decade ago but only recently set the process in motion. “It’s essentially risk-free and so needed,” he said. “I think people will realise that it’s a no-brainer, if you have the time and the inclination.”He further explained the process of matching donors and recipients, saying: “Let’s say person X needs a kidney in Kansas City [and] their child or whoever was going to donate to them is, for whatever set of reasons, not a match, but somehow I am. That person can still get my kidney and hopefully that child of that person still donates their kidney, right?“But it goes to a bank where that person can find a match recipient, but it only works if there is basically an altruistic donor.”Celebrities who are known to have donated organs while still living are thin on the ground, although it is believed Natasha Richardson, Jerry Orbach and Dr Rajkumar became donors after their death. In 2017, the actor and singerSelena Gomez was the recipient of a kidneyfrom her friend, Francia Raisa. Tracy Morgan, George Lopez, Neil Simon and Tina Turner also received donor kidneys.More than 100,000 people are currently on the transplant list in the US, with around 12 people dying each day because of organ shortage. In the UK, 8,186 people – a record number – are currently on the list, with a further almost 4,000 temporarily suspended but still in need of a transplant. Meanwhile,donor numbers in the UK are falling, with living donors now accounting for around 40% of donations – primarily kidneys.Eisenberg has credited his wife, the teacher and charity worker Anna Strout, for much of his own idealism and activism. Her late mother ran a domestic violence shelter, of which Eisenberg and Strout have been energetic supporters.‘I gave my sister a kidney. I don’t know if I’ll ever do a better thing’Read moreEarlier this year, Eisenberg was Oscar-nominated for his screenplay for A Real Pain, which earned the best supporting actor award for Kieran Culkin. He is currently promoting the third in the Now You See Me magician heist series.Last week Eisenberg said his non-involvement in the sequel to The Social Network had “nothing to do” with the film’s script, which has been written by Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote the original. Jeremy Strong will take over the role of Mark Zuckerberg.Explore more on these topicsFilmJesse EisenbergHealthOrgan donationnewsShareReuse this content"

But as we’ve learned, election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for.“So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart.”Lawrence has previously been open about voting for both right and leftwing candidates for the presidency. Raised by conservative Republicans in Kentucky, she voted for John McCain in 2008 before joining the Democratic party and saying she realised during Obama’s administration that voting Republican was voting against her own rights as a woman.In 2015, she said Donald Trump’s election to the White Housewould be “the end of the world”and endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 election. In 2024, she lent her support to Kamala Harris, “because I think she’s an amazing candidate and I know that she will do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights”.Lawrence was joined by most of Hollywood in her rejection ofDonald Trumpas a candidate for re-election, but the lack of leverage stars have over the voting intentions of the public was highlighted by Trump’s victory.“The second term feels different,” said Lawrence of Trump’s presidency. “Because he said what he was going to do. We knew what he did for four years. He was very clear. And that’s what we chose.”Lawrence is promotingDie, My Love, Lynne Ramsay’s drama in which she plays a new mother who struggles with her mental health in rural Montana. Speaking at a press conference for the film in Venice, Lawrencesaid of Israel’s bombings in Gaza: “I’m terrified. It’s mortifying. What’s happening is no less than a genocide and it’s terrible.”View image in fullscreenJennifer Lawrence in Die My Love.She continued by saying that she was saddened by “the disrespect in the discourse of American politics right now and how that is going to be normalised to the kids right now. It’s going to be normal to them that politicians lie.”Lawrence sought to redirect anger about the conflict to decision-makers rather than actors and artists. “Stay focused on who is responsible,” she said, in what many took to be a reference to the then-recentpledgesigned by more than 4,000 entertainment industry figures to boycott Israeli film institutions.The actor, who won an Oscar aged 22 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, is attracting awards attention for her performance in Die, My Love. Although Ramsay has rejected the story being interpreted as one of postpartum depression and psychosis, Lawrence said that she did relate to elements of her character’s journey after the birth of her second son, soon after shooting ended.“It was fear about my child,” she said, “just picturing every worst-case scenario, and then doubting everything that I was doing. I was already in therapy, but I got on a drug called Zurzuvae and I took it for two weeks and it really helped.”The actor also spoke to the New York Times of the liberating necessity of completing nude scenes in the film while she was some months pregnant and unable to exercise.“It feels nice,” she said, of being forced to cast off vanity. “I mean, I do have moments where I’m like, What technically are the differences between me and a prostitute?

Notably, there was a paucity of putative blockbusters, with the only large-scale effects movie on release being Tron: Ares, which took $67m in North America, as part of a disappointing $133m worldwide gross againstits $180m reported budget.Also disappointing was the performance of so-called “awards season” films, with Dwayne Johnson wrestling movie The Smashing Machine, Julia Roberts #MeToo drama After the Hunt, and music biopic Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere all grossing less than expected.The end of October customarily delivers a boost from horror movies, but with the date of Halloween falling on a Friday, when a large section of the intended audience would be otherwise occupied, box office receipts for the weekend of 31 October to 2 November were the lowest of the year,with a total of $48.3m. Also contributing to the disappointment was the absence of any successful horror releases: the leading horror release of the season, Black Phone 2, managed $8m over the Halloween weekend, while theputatively buzzy Shelby Oaks performed poorly, taking just $770,000 from its relatively significant release in more than 1,700 theatres.Cinemagoing over the Halloween weekend in North America was also affected by the climax of baseball’s World Series,which finished in the early morning of 2 November.Box office analyst Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations told Variety: “The major releases this month failed to deliver. Simple as that.”He added: “Apart from the moderately successful Black Phone 2, there just weren’t enough horror films to entice moviegoers. That should be a no-brainer.”The news wasn’t all bad though: Taylor Swift’s The Official Release Party of a Showgirl saw huge activity on its only weekend in cinemas,taking $34m between 3 and 5 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryHorror booksScience fiction and fantasy filmsDrama filmsFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

The film came out ahead ofPillion, adapted from Adam Mars-Jones’s coming-of-age relationship story, which got 10 nominations, and biopicI Swear, which got nine.My Father’s Shadow, which stars Sope Dirisu and is Davies’s debut feature as a director, premiered at the Cannes film festival to admiring reviews.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described itas “a transparently personal project and a coming-of-age film in its (traumatised) way, a moving account of how, just for one day, two young boys glimpse the real life and real history of their father who has been mostly absent for much of their lives”. The film is yet to be released in the UK, but has already come out in Nigeria.Pillion, likewise, had a successful premiere at Cannes in May, with Bradshaw calling it “an intensely English story of romance, devotion and loss from first-time feature director Harry Lighton, who has created something funny and touching and alarming – like a cross between Alan Bennett and Tom of Finland with perhaps a tiny smidgen of what could be called a BDSM Wallace and Gromit”. Due for UK release later in November, it is up for best British independent film, best director for Lighton and best lead performance for Harry Melling.I Swear is already in cinemas, having been released in October. A life story of Tourette syndrome activist John Davidson, the film is likewise up for best British indepependent film, best director for Kirk Jones, and best lead performance for Robert Aramayo.The nominations also include, for the first time, an award for cinema of the year, which is voted on by the public. The contenders include the Depot in Lewes, the Magic Lantern in Tywyn, Montrose Playhouse, Queen’s Film Theatre in Belfast and the Watershed in Bristol.The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on 30 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmAwards and prizesFilm adaptationsDrama filmsRomance filmsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “Most people would say … this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD,” whose symptoms can include severe anxiety and intrusive memories. Yet he had managed to publish a 2024 memoir about the assault –Knife– and now had followed up withThe Eleventh Hour.The Eleventh Hour by Salman Rushdie – a haunting coda to a groundbreaking careerRead more“Well, I do have a therapist, and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD,” Rushdie replied, in his characteristically soft-spoken tone. “And I said, ‘But I don’t seem to be having those symptoms, so what’s wrong with me?’“And he said, ‘Well, it’s because you’re a badass – that’s the technical term.’”The attack on the Indian-born British American author occurred more than 35 years after he was first subjected to a death warrant, or fatwa, by Iranian religious leaders who were upset at his depiction of Islam in his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses.Rushdie was on stage lecturing at the Chautauqua Institution amphitheater when Hadi Matar – aiming to fulfill the fatwa – stabbed him in the head, neck, torso and left hand, resulting in critical injuries to his right eye, liver and intestines. The damage to Rushdie’s right eye was permanent and left him unable to see out of it, even as he substantially recovered from many of the other wounds.Matar wasfound guiltyin February of attempted murder and laterreceiveda 25-year prison sentence. He was also sentenced to seven years for wounding the moderator of Rushdie’s lecture, Ralph Henry Reese.On Sunday, Rushdie made clear that Matar’s actions did indeed change some aspects of his life. A notable one is that previously he had refused to read books on computer tablets – but does so now.“I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to … because there’s light” on their screens, Rushdie said. “I can adjust the size of the type. I never read a book on an iPad, but now I do.”He also said that “for public-facing things there has to be security in a way that there wasn’t” in the years before his stabbing by Matar.Rushdie has been a naturalized US citizen since 2016, the year Donald Trump won the first of his two presidencies. After Trump’s second presidency began in January, his administration has sought to deport as many immigrants from the US as possible.Teichner asked Rushdie if the feeling he had when he became an American citizen had “become fractured or altered based on what’s happened since, both in public life in the [US] and to you”.Rushdie acknowledged it was “a hard time in America” before adding: “If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.”Explore more on these topicsSalman RushdienewsShareReuse this content"

Its status raises complex questions about the identity of its inhabitants – Ukrainians, Russians, Moldovans and Bulgarians – in a land searching for direction and lacking a clearly defined national identityByPjotr Sauer; Photographs by Didier BizetMon 3 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 3 Nov 2025 03.34 ESTShareAmid the ongoing war inUkraineand between the fragile borders that crisscross the former Soviet Union, the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, which broke away from Moldova more than 30 years ago after a brief but bloody conflict, remains locked in deep political and diplomatic isolation.Transnistria mapHome to about 450,000 people, Transnistria is a narrow strip of land wedged betweenMoldovaand Ukraine, along the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Its de facto capital, Tiraspol, lies less than 60 miles from the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. Though small in size – about 125 miles long – the region holds outsized strategic importance, sitting on a key corridor between the Black Sea and central Europe.View image in fullscreenTanks on display in the streets of Tiraspol come from the Dniester war, also known as the Transnistrian war or Moldovan civil war. This post-Soviet conflict in 1992 pitted the Transnistrian army (supported by Russia) against the Moldovan armed forces on the banks of the Dniester River. The conflict caused about 1,000 deaths.View image in fullscreenMaria, 35, and her daughter Miroslava, who live in Tiraspol.This separatist region has its own institutions and government but is not officially recognised as a nation by any UN member state – not even by Russia, which maintains about 1,500 troops in the territory, nominally as “peacekeepers” but in practice as a means of projecting influence over Moldova.View image in fullscreenSimon, like many young people, comes to this hill along the Dniester. During the war against Moldova, snipers were positioned on this hill and held the future border.This lack of recognition leaves Transnistria in a grey zone of international law, cut off from global organisations and trapped in its post-Soviet legacy. While other former Soviet republics have integrated into international structures and forged new political paths, Transnistria has remained firmly rooted in a bygone Soviet past.View image in fullscreenIn many Transnistrian villages, monuments to the civil war between Moldavia and Transnistria, and to the victory over Nazism, are regularly decorated with flowers.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: a young mother walks past the Aviators’ Monument, located in the 60 Years of October Square in the eastern suburbs of the de facto capital.

Right: a Moldovan well dating from the Soviet era in the countrysideAcross the territory of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, the name used by Transnistria, Soviet symbols still dominate the landscape, reflecting a persistent nostalgia for a vanished political order. This attachment has left Transnistrians particularly vulnerable, reinforcing the perception that they are orphans of history, frozen in a moment that no longer exists.View image in fullscreenVarvara Dobish, 84, lives in the village of Slobodezia.

Right: teenagers who have escaped from a wedding play on a Russian CY 06-71 steam locomotive dating from the revolution, which serves as an often-closed museum.Because of its murky legal status and lack of international oversight, Transnistria quickly became a haven for smuggling and organised crime in the 1990s. Its “grey zone” position allowed illicit trade – from weapons and fuel to cigarettes and alcohol – to flourish, turning the region into one of post-Soviet Europe’s most notorious black markets.Over time, much of the local economy fell under the control of Sheriff, a powerful and shadowy conglomerate that dominates everything from supermarkets and petrol stations to the media and a football club. Today, Sheriff’s influence is so pervasive that many residents say the company wields more authority than the government itself.View image in fullscreenThe only boat in Tiraspol that allows for navigation on the Dniester and visits around the city is often docked due to a lack of visitors. It sets sail only when the 20-passenger minimum is reached. Generally during the week the boat remains docked, waiting for passengers.View image in fullscreenThe boat’s owner waits for passengers.View image in fullscreenVitaliy, 40, Natasha, 43, Vlad, 17, and Bogdan, 11, a family living in Tiraspol.Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 brought a new level of insecurity to Transnistria, plunging the already fragile region into a fresh political and economic crisis. For decades, Transnistria survived on virtually free gas supplied by Russia through pipelines running across Ukraine. After the invasion, those flows were severely disrupted, forcing the closure of almost all industrial enterprises.View image in fullscreenA diner watches old Soviet TV programmes in the Stolobka restaurant in Tiraspol. This USSR canteen welcomes locals and the odd tourist.The Russian military presence in Transnistria has fuelled nervousness in Moldova, where officials fear Moscow could use the enclave to open a new front in its war against the west. Since coming to power in 2020, Moldova’s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, has vowed to steer the country firmly away from Russia’s influence – a stance that has deepened friction with the pro-Russian authorities in Transnistria, long seen as a thorn in the side of Moldova’s bid to join the European Union.View image in fullscreenA new Sheriff supermarket in the town of Rîbnița.

In September parliamentary elections, a record one-third of Transnistrians cast their ballots for Moldova’s pro-EU PAS party, as deepening economic hardship has driven many to seek greater stability and a return to some sense of normality.View image in fullscreenLudmila, Luba and Svetlana live in the village of Rogi, on the Moldovan border.

Those were generous, funny, big-hearted books, tying characters he calls “outliers” to social issues from feminism to abortion.Since Owen Meany, it’s been diminishing returns, except in page length. His last novel, 2022’sThe Last Chairlift, was 900 pages of subjects Irving had explored better in earlier books (mutism, dwarfism, transgenderism), with a 200-page screenplay in the middle to pad it out – as if padding were needed.So we approach a new Irving with caution but still a small flame of hope, which burns hotter when we learn that Queen Esther – a mere 432 pages – “returns to the world of The Cider House Rules”. That 1985 novel is one of Irving’s very best, set largely in an orphanage in St Cloud’s, Maine, run by Dr Wilbur Larch and his protege Homer Wells.In The Cider House Rules, Irving wrote about abortion and belonging with colour, comedy and an all-encompassing empathy. And it was a significant work because it left behind the topics that were becoming tiresome tics in his books: wrestling, bears, Vienna, prostitution.Queen Esther opens in the fictional town of Penacook, New Hampshire in the early 20th century, where Thomas and Constance Winslow adopt 14-year-old orphan Esther from St Cloud’s. We are a few decades before the action of The Cider House Rules, yet Wilbur Larch remains recognisable: already addicted to ether, adored by his nurses, starting every speech with “Here in St Cloud’s …” But his appearance in Queen Esther is limited to these early scenes.Queen Esther is a disappointment from a writer who once gave such joyThe Winslows worry about raising Esther well: she’s Jewish, and “how could they help a young Jewish girl find herself?” To answer that, we flash forward to Esther’s adulthood in the 1920s. She will be part of the Jewish emigration to Palestine, where she will become part of Haganah, the Zionist paramilitary organisation whose “purpose was to protect Jewish settlements from Arab attacks” and which would later form the core of the Israeli Defense Forces.These are huge subjects to tackle, but having introduced them, Irving dodges out. Because if it’s disappointing that Queen Esther is not really about St Cloud’s and Dr Larch, it’s even more disappointing that it’s also not about Esther. For reasons that must relate to plot engineering, Esther becomes a surrogate mother for another of the Winslows’ daughters, and gives birth to a baby boy, Jimmy, in 1941 – and the bulk of this novel is Jimmy’s story.And here is where Irving’s obsessions come roaring back, both regular and specific. Jimmy moves to – where else? – Vienna; there’s discussion of dodging the Vietnam draft through self-mutilation (A Prayer for Owen Meany); a dog with a symbolic name (Hard Rain, meet Sorrow from The Hotel New Hampshire); as well as wrestling, prostitutes, writers and penises (Irvingspassim).Jimmy is a less interesting character than Esther promised to be, and the secondary players, such as students Claude and Jolanda, and Jimmy’s tutor Annelies Eissler, are flat too. There are some nice set pieces – Jimmy losing his virginity; a fight where a couple of thugs get battered with a crutch and a bicycle pump – but they’re here and gone.Irving has never been a subtle writer, but that is not the problem. He has always reiterated his points, foreshadowed plot developments and allowed them to accumulate in the reader’s mind before bringing them to fruition in long, shocking, amusing scenes. For example, in Irving’s novels, body parts tend to go missing: think of the tongue in Garp, the finger in Owen Meany. Those absences echo through the story. In Queen Esther, a major character loses an arm – but we only find out 30 pages before the end.Esther returns late in the novel, but only with a last-minute sense of wrapping things up. We never do find out the full story of her life in Palestine and Israel. Queen Esther is a disappointment from a writer who once gave such joy. That’s the bad news. The good news is that The Cider House Rules – I reread it alongside this novel – still stands up beautifully, 40 years on. So read that instead: it’s twice as long as Queen Esther, but 12 times as good.Queen Esther by John Irving is published by Scribner (£22).

But when film-maker Peter Watkins deployed them in the 1960s, they were revolutionary, and Watkins himself was revolutionary as well – an English revolutionary, in fact, alive to the cruelty and iniquity of kings but also to that of people bent on decapitation. His cinema persistently asked questions about those in power, and what will happen when their power goes catastrophically wrong. An artist dedicated to challenging and upsetting, Watkins came from the dissenter tradition of uncompromising radicalism on screen and stage – the same tradition as Edward Bond, Ken Loach and Dennis Potter.His enduringly brilliant and angry anti-nuclear dramaThe War Gamewas commissioned but then banned by the BBC in 1965. (It screened in cinemas, and was finally shown on television a couple of decades later.) It lasts just 47 minutes but viewers felt they had lived through a lifetime of fear. When I first saw it as a teenager at a CND meeting 15 years after it was made, it seemed as if I had entered a new era of disillusioned adulthood.View image in fullscreenDemonic genius … The War Game.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyMovie audiences knew about Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove, which had been released in 1964, and they may have known about Sidney Lumet’s Fail Safe from the same year, but The War Game was chillingly different. Strangelove and Fail Safe, in their different ways, were top-down dramas, dramatising the people in charge. The War Game is about the ordinary people on the ground: the chivvied, anxious, ordinary British people glumly submitting to the instructions of the increasingly dumbstruck low-level admin types, a few minutes before and then during and after a nuclear bomb blast. We saw that these GPs, police, soldiers and civil servants, whose authority and expertise had been developed for the needs of the second world war, were grotesquely inadequate.And the almost demonic genius of The War Game is that it is addressed to the viewer in the clipped, informative tone of aProtect and Survivepublic information film, a Reithian, Men-from-the-Ministry voice that would in other circumstances be deployed to bamboozle or soft-soap the public. Watkins uses it to reveal the awful truth. It is this voice that coolly comments as police constables execute irretrievably irradiated casualties in the street with specially issued revolvers, in an effort to prevent the health service from being overwhelmed.View image in fullscreenRadical style … Culloden (1964).Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThe film is all in the pseudo-documentary style, with the faces of shocked, wraithlike people looming up to the camera as they obediently answer the implacable narrator’s questions. The mockumentary form – so often used for irony, comedy and satire, and to undermine the status of media and television – is here deadly serious. Watkins used it to emphasise that this is real; what happens on screen in The War Game happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and indeed in non-nuclear theatres of war including Dresden, Hamburg and Tokyo. Perhaps we in the west had been encouraged not to think about these things; to think they applied only to the defeated Axis powers – and since the passing of the Cuban missile crisis, that the problem was in any case at an end. Watkins fiercely told us: “No – it could happen and is happening.” The unstable geopolitical negotiations were always wobbling.Barry Hines’s Threads, from 1984 was the obvious inheritor of The War Game on British television.Watkins’ mockumentary style was probably even more radical in his previous film: the 1964 BBC classicCulloden, in which a modern-day camera crew, like American photojournalists in Vietnam, have arrived to cover the Battle of Culloden in 1746, in which the Jacobite rebel forces of Charles Edward Stuart, “Bonnie Prince Charlie”, are decisively routed by the government army of the Duke of Cumberland, son of George II. There are no coy or arch shots of the ahistorical cameras or sound recordists; we just hear the calm, off-camera voice of the journalist “interviewing” the various foot soldiers, commanding officers and blue-blood leaders, with their faces crowding candidly up to Watkins’s camera in the same way.The rebel forces – exhausted, underfed and outnumbered, beset with Scottish clan divisions and badly led by their vain, petulant leader – are horribly defeated. But Watkins doesn’t leave it there. His camera shows us the aftermath, and what would now be called war crimes. Cumberland’s men, cruelly overexcited by their victory, follow the retreating forces on the road to Inverness, slaughtering combatants and civilians alike in the service of “pacifying” the Highlands. When Cumberland’s forces bayonet the Jacobite wounded on the field of battle it is worryingly like those police constables shooting casualties in The War Game. And Watkins always emphasises how much the leaders and men have in common: they are brothers, cousins, kinsmen. Their differences are a function of war.At the beginning of the 1970s, Watkins gave us a movie that is less well known than Culloden and The War Game, but is perhaps his masterpiece.Punishment Park, from 1971, is closer to the deadpan dystopian satire that was soon to be fashionable in Hollywood, but is absolutely characteristic of Watkins. Though it is set in the US, a crisp, received-pronunciation English voice introduces what is apparently to be a BBC-style documentary. The American government is getting tough with hippies, troublemakers and radicals, and makes them choose between 20 years in jail or a few days in the mysterious new “Punishment Park”. Of course most choose the Park, not knowing what is in store, and for once Watkins’ godlike narrator loses his cool at what is happening, eventually screaming in horror and disgust, as if Ludovic Kennedy or David Attenborough had been reduced to a nervous breakdown. It is an unforgettable moment.Watkins’ career continued in its own way, and included a conventional bread-and-circuses satire of pop culture in Privilege (1967); a Bergman-esque and much admired account of Edvard Munch from 1974; the epic 14-hour anti-nuclear documentary project The Journey (1987); and another historical docudrama in 2000, La Commune (Paris, 1871), about the Paris Commune. The cold, clear flame of passion burned until the end.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDocumentary filmsPeriod and historical filmsNuclear weaponsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Metaphor alert: Koya Kamura’s debut film also camps in a no man’s land of the soul, with Sooha, abandoned by her French father while she was still in utero, caught between two cultures. After the francophone hostess is forced to chaperone the enigmatic author, she loiters uncomfortably between tetchy friendship and Oedipal attraction.When she’s not digging into spectacular-looking seafood prepared by her fishmonger mother (Park Mi-hyeon), Sooha is lolling about with her boyfriend (Gong Do-yu), an aspiring model gunning for a move to Seoul. But this comfy routine is overturned when the foreigner settles in for a long-term stay. Initially conforming to her prejudices about rude French men, he turns out, on Googling him, to be critically lauded graphic novelist Yan Kerrand. Coming to Sokcho in search of inspiration, he manages to prise the story of Sooha’s absent parent from her. She spies on him through a vent – but it remains to be seen whether he’s a proxy father, or something else.Sooha’s subterranean feelings erupt in the bursts of clandestine, sinuous moments of bodily suffocation and liberation. We are privy to only her inner life, though; Yan remains a distant figure, insisting on his loner ethic and sparing with details of his past. His cipher status, as Sooha projects her needs on to him, is intentional – but this one-sidedness prevents Winter in Sokcho from fully opening up. Aesthetic expression – and control, with Sooha’s mother and boyfriend both pushing cosmetic surgery on her – is clearly a key theme for Kamura. But despite Yan’s vocation, it feels a bit adjacent to the main story, like the mysterious bandaged diner also in residence.The three focused performances at the centre – an almost hostile Zem, increasingly scattered Kim, and the self-involved Park – give Winter in Sokcho its solid centre, and if Kamura can’t quite thematically corral the wary faceoff between hotelier and guest, he is always on his toes emotionally speaking, often dipping into a tactile visual register. Fixating on absence, threatening to drown in internal sensations, Kamura musters an intriguing kind of modern ghost story.Winter in Sokcho is on Mubi from 7 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSouth KoreaFilm adaptationsAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

We see in flashback that, as a young child, she survived the horrific experience of her disturbed mother attempting to carry out a murder-suicide. Unluckily, one of her first jobs after returning to work is to respond to a call from a dilapidated nursing home in the middle of nowhere. The first sign that something is amiss when she and the crew rock up, is that nobody at the home will admit to having made the call in the first place. The place itself is also obviously trouble; it’s got the kind of damp in the walls that isn’t just a challenge for estate agents, but might also seep into your soul.The stage is thus set for Ana’s past and present day perils to collide. Of course, people with traumatic backgrounds are 10 a penny in the horror genre at the moment; gone are the days when terror and unease sprang from the fact that this gnarly stuff was happening to a normal family, a nice young girl or an average bunch of teens, and could therefore happen to you, too. Perhaps film-makers have cottoned on to the fact that nobody really perceives themselves as having lived an untroubled life. Everybody is vulnerable.A Mother’s Embrace turns out to be a minor but interestingly woozy and off-kilter entry into the canon of thoughtful trauma horror; its strongest suit is vibes and imagery, with the persistent queasy sensation that Ana has wandered into a bad dream. But is it her bad dream or someone else’s? The excellent and nightmarish production design suggests the answer doesn’t matter; she’s in trouble either way.A Mother’s Embrace is on digital platforms from 10 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersBrazilAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

At one juncture, the interviewer asked if she didn’t think that Lux was demanding a lot from her listeners: a not entirely unreasonable question, given that it features a song cycle in four “movements”, based on the lives of various female saints and involves the 33-year-old Catalan star singing in 13 different languages to the thunderous accompaniment of the London Symphony Orchestra; and that it sounds nothing whatsoever like its predecessor, 2022’s Motomami. “Absolutely,” she responded, framing Lux as a reaction to the quick-fix dopamine hit of idly scrolling social media: something you had to focus on.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Lux.Photograph: APDemanding a lot from her listeners didn’t seem like something Rosalía was terribly bothered about, which is, in a sense, surprising. Pop has seldom seemed more prone to user-friendliness, to demanding as little as it can from its audience, as if the convenience of its primary means of transmission has affected its sound: it occasionally feels as though streaming’s algorithms – always coming up with something new that’s similar to stuff you already know – have started to define the way artists prosecute their careers. Then again, Rosalía has form when it comes to challenging her fanbase: variously infused with reggaeton, hip-hop, dubstep, dembow and experimental electronica, Motomami represented a dramatic pivot away from her 2018 breakthrough, El Mal Querer, a pop overhaul of flamenco that – incredibly – began life as the singer’s college project. It seems oddly telling that the biggest guest star on Lux is Björk, whose distinctive tone appears during Berghain, somewhere in betweena resounding orchestral arrangement, Rosalía’s own operatic vocals and the sound of Yves Tumor reprising Mike Tyson’s “I’ll fuck you ‘til you love me” tirade over and over again. It’s hard not to suspect that Rosalía sees Björk as a kindred spirit or even a model, someone who has predicated a decades-long solo career on making artistic handbrake turns through a glossy aesthetic.Rosalía: Berghain – videoStill, the shift in sound between El Mal Querer and Motomami is nothing compared to the leap between the latter and what’s on offer here. Both of Lux’s predecessors were pop albums, albeit hugely adventurous and original ones. A debate is raging about whether or not the contents of Lux could be described as classical music, a question about which Rosalía herself seems undecided – on the waltz-time La Perla, a particularly dramatic swell of strings and brass is followed by the sound of the singer giggling, as if she’s keen to undercut any pretensions. But, whether you want to label it as such or not, Lux certainlysoundscloser to classical music than it does to anything in the charts. There are definitely pop elements to these songs: Auto-Tune amid the Bernard Herrmann-ish stabs of strings, roiling kettledrums and flamenco handclaps of Porcelana; rapping on Novia Robot; melodies that you can imagine transposed into a more familiar musical setting, most obviously on the lovely Sauvignon Blanc; the kind of sped-up vocal sample that’s regularly deployed by hip-hop or house producers but that here forms part of an authentically astonishing sonic barrage at the start of Focu ‘Ranni. But these elements never feel central to Lux’s sound. Quite the opposite: they seem like oddly spectral presences, drifting through an alien landscape.So Lux demands the listener abandon preconceptions and submit themselves to its author’s way of doing things. There’s no question that this is quite a big ask. Lux is a long album; whatever its overarching story may be, it seems almost impossible to follow even with the aid of a lyric sheet that translates the sudden leaps between Spanish, Mandarin, Ukrainian, Latin et al. That said, you get the sense that somewhere in the mix of stuff about God, Catholicism, beatification and transcendence lurks the more earthy theme of an ex-boyfriend getting it in the neck: “gold medal in being a motherfucker”, run some characteristic (Spanish-sung) lines in La Perla, “emotional terrorist … world class fuck-up”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

These are uniformly beautiful songs, filled with striking moments – the point in Reliquia where a Michael Nyman-ish string arrangement is suddenly joined by a frantic, glitchy rhythm that recalls Aphex Twin’s take on drum’n’ bass; the whirlpool of strings and wordless vocals at the end of Jeanne; the moment midway through De Madrugá where the orchestra dramatically surges and the song changes key. Rosalía’s vocal performances, meanwhile, are spectacular firework displays of talent: she seems just as comfortable in the presence of fado singers on La Rumba del Perdón as she does rapping or indeed belting as if she’s on stage at the Royal Opera House. Moreover, for all their facility, they’re possessed of an emotional rawness that negates the obvious charge you might level against Lux: that it’s an arid intellectual exercise. Whatever pains have been staked in its making – the learning of languages and the hiring of Pulitzer prize-winning classical composer Caroline Shaw to provide arrangements among them – Lux is too dramatic to feel just like the answer to a clever hypothesis.It may also be too different and challenging to gain the kind of mass acceptance afforded Motomami and El Mal Querer – although the position of Berghain in the global streaming chart suggests not, and there’s something genuinely buoying about that. In a world where listeners are increasingly encouraged to lean back and let the algorithm and AI do the work for them, it would be hugely encouraging to think that people might embrace an album that asks you to do the exact opposite. If you have to put effort in to appreciate Lux, the effort is repaid: there’s a lesson in there that’s worth taking note of.Explore more on these topicsRosalíaPop and rockBjörkClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tonight in Manchester, her kooky on-stage persona is mirrored by a surprisingly baby-faced group of misfits pressed against the barrier: a sea of trend-conscious twentysomethings in slouchy cargos and Y2K outfits desperate for a chance to brush against the singer’s hand. Supported by a guitarist, drummer and backing track, Lenae twirls on to the stage with the groove-heavy Sticky, and a lone wind machine whooshes her curls into the air.Some songs from her2024 album Bird’s Eyeland on eager ears. The new material takes a sweet yet sharp turn from her earlier work, bouncing from the fun, rocksteady dubby speaker rattles in Candy to the tender, heart-on-chest ballad Love Is Blind. She airs her ruptured romantic frustrations in plaintive pleas: “How do you love me if you leave me behind?” But feels such as the slower, sad-girl moments on the new record, including Pilot, struggle to maintain the same momentum. Her recent melancholy undoubtedly means a great deal to her: Lenae punctuates the set with warm reflections on her owngrowth as an artistand offers a healthy, relatable dose of sisterly love and guidance: “Stay the course. Time is a gift.”Mostly, OG tracks such as Free Room, doused with shuffly deep-house chords, and the glitchy drum machines of 4 Leaf Clover, still draw the biggest cheers. But then, Bird’s Eye’s hit track Love Me Not swings into the country revival with a delectable slice of western charm, and an earworm hook, “I wish you were right here”, that rings out long after the show is finished. Her word-for-word fans obviously adore her, but it still feels as though Lenae has untapped potential: maybe a heavier band – and less reliance on pre-recordings – as well as a sprinkle more pizazz would make her evident talent and ambition shine.Explore more on these topicsMusicR&BreviewsShareReuse this content"

The focus of his ire was Mortal Kombat, Midway’s bloody fighting game, recently released on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System after a successful run in the arcades. “Blood splatters from the contestants’ heads,” he told the room. “The game narrator instructs the player to finish his opponent. That player may choose a method of murder ranging from ripping a heart out or pulling off the head of the opponent, with spinal cord attached.”Lieberman’s aim with the congressional hearing had been to force the US games industry into creating a formal ratings system, preventing minors from buying violent titles. He succeeded in that – the Entertainment Software Rating Board was established as a result of the hearing – but he also boosted a moral panic that had quietly begun with the launch of the Mortal Kombat arcade game in 1992. This then took on more urgency following the high-profile home console release on 13 September 1993 – a global simultaneous launch Midway named Mortal Monday. US news networks weresending reporters to arcades, interrogating teens as they enthusiastically dismembered each other’s fighters. Newspapers were interviewing alarmed child psychologists. The BBC responded byfeaturing the gameon its late-night news magazine programme The Late Show, calling in author Will Self to play live in the studio.View image in fullscreenCharmingly jerky … Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection.Photograph: AtariIt’s interesting now to watch those hearings and then look at the game they were describing. Released this week, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is an anthology of the first four titles in the series, in arcade and various home console forms, as well as an array of spin-offs for the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation. The original titles are almost quaint relics of 1990s teen culture. The digitised visuals, created by filming actors performing martial arts moves then converting that footage into 2D sprite animations, are charmingly jerky and low-resolution, the controversial fatalities more bloodily amusing than horrifying. Brilliantly, the Kollection comes with a Fatality Trainer allowing you to easily access and practise the viscera-splattered death moves from each title. If this mode had been available at the time, it’s probably the only thing I’d have played.Playing again now, the game is obviously a product of twenty-something guys brought up on 80s horror films. Midway had originally assembled a four-man team including coder Ed Boon and John Tobias to produce a combat action game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, when that deal fell through, Boon and Tobias imagined a competitor to hugely successful Capcom hit Street Fighter II, inspired by the wave of popular hyperviolent martial arts flicks such as Bloodsport and Best of the Best. Boon’s elevator pitch was “the MTV version of Street Fighter”, and the fatalities emerged throughout the development process, the team pulling in ideas from their favourite movies: RoboCop, Terminator and Enter the Dragon. Straight away, the company knew that blood and guts would mean notoriety and no one was fazed.Talking to Polygon in 2022, Boon said, “If there was something that we would even say, ‘Is this going too far?’ our CEO was like, ‘No, go even further.’ Plus we had [Midway game designer] Eugene Jarvis as our mentor […] he had just done Narc, which was a pretty violent game in its own right. So if anything, we were encouraged to goevenfurther.”In effect, the moral panic over Mortal Kombat was to the early 1990s what the video nasty controversy was to the early 1980s. It was about the fear of new entertainment technologies entering family homes unchecked and poisoning the minds of children. It also ensured the success of the series. Mortal Kombat became the biggest-selling game of the Christmas season and beyond, shifting six million copies across multiple machines. What the Kollection shows is how adaptable the games have been, taking the original arcade concept on to handheld platforms and then into the 32-bit console era where spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces expanded into the action-adventure genre.For the industry itself, the Mortal Kombat panic simply became a new front on which to fight the console wars. Sega courted the controversy, allowing Mega Drive owners to access the full gore of the arcade version by inputting a “secret” code. By contrast, Nintendo sought to bolster its family-friendly image by removing fatalities and turning the game’s blood into grey “sweat”. Unsurprisingly, it was the Sega version that sold best.View image in fullscreenSo real it hurts … An original press ad for Mortal Kombat.Photograph: MidwayThere have been many media panics since this one. Doom remained a tabloid fixture for the entire 1990s, becominginextricably linkedwith the Columbine school shooting due to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold’s interest in the game. Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty were regular targets throughout the 2010s, and more recently Fortnite has been accused of leading a generation of schoolchildreninto addiction. But the sight of Joe Lieberman in that wood-panelled senate room describing gruesome images from Mortal Kombat – as well as Night Trap and Lethal Enforcers – retains its unique fascination.This was a turning point for the games business – it was the era in which the focus shifted from children to teens, from abstract puzzlers and platformers to graphically rich shooters, bloody fighting games and adult-oriented action adventures. Midway set out to discover exactly what it could get away with. The answer shaped the entire industry.Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is out now on PC, PS5, Switch and Xbox.Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is this what Roland Barthes meant when he wrote that “in order to see a photograph well, it is best to look away”?There is at least an exhibition outside – one of the 30 shows in the city’s community spaces, churches, colleges and pubs that are part of the festival this year. Michael Christopher Brown’s 90 Miles refers to the distance between Havana and Florida, a perilous stretch of ocean crossed by many Cubans fleeing the country on DIY boats – a record number between 2022 and 2023. Brown uses AI the way draftsmen created illustrations for newspapers before photography. He has collected eye witness accounts, news stories and historical reportage of Cuba’s history from Castro to today, and used them as prompts for the software. In one image, the figures positioned on and around a classically Cuban vintage car, strangely stranded in a turbulent ocean, have warped faces and limbs that melt and drip like a Francis Bacon painting. These aren’t real images – but they are truthful.View image in fullscreenNot real but truthful … an AI-generated image from 90 miles by Michael Christopher Brown.Photograph: © Michael Christopher BrownTruth is the theme of the festival, a perennial issue hanging over photography; the unresolved relationship between the reality of a picture and the truth it bears.Another host venue is locked – I’m told to wander down someone’s garden path and ring the bell. Inside a private home is a solo exhibition by Timon Benson, a young portraitist of Instagram-fame. Voice of Matter represents a more experimental approach to portraiture that is still new – and still feels tentative. Benson’s desire is to translate feeling into photography, and his pictures are soft-spoken, watery-eyed. In his pursuit of a more truthful image, Benson has also abandoned the camera completely to create luminograms, exposing paper directly to light. It doesn’t quite hold together yet but the sentiments are sincere.View image in fullscreenA tentative approach … Last Embrace by Timon Benson.Photograph: © Timon BensonEmotions amp up at Old Fire Station, with psychologically charged, rage-and-pain-fuelled works by Lydia Goldblatt, Jenny Lewis and Heather Agyepong. Goldblatt’s Fugue is a series of vignettes and poems about early motherhood, its loneliness and claustrophobia, combustible anger and bittersweet bliss, all intensified by sleeplessness and by being a body who is depended on.Lewis’s Unbecoming, meanwhile, describes in images interminable and invisible suffering – the artist has a hereditary autoimmune condition. Small, domestic, interior pictures of her bathroom and bedroom, bathed in a supernatural light, evoke the stifling confinement and discomfort of being physically restrained. Some are mounted on aluminium – reminiscent of the sharp, clinical coldness of surgical tools. It’s beautifully done. These are dovetailed with a beguiling triptych by Agyepong inspired by Jungian theories of the shadow self. Each self-portrait is layered to abstraction, achieved with double exposures: masterful effects of light and diaphanous fabrics in melancholic blue hues. It’s a tear-jerking slow-burn of a show that questions not only photography but the visual as an arbiter of truth.View image in fullscreenBittersweet bliss … Bone, from the series Fugue by Lydia Goldblatt.I go back to Maison Française – it’s now open (it turns out every venue has different and confounding opening times). Haley Morris-Cafiero’s What Does An Ideal Employee Look Like? is my reward for perseverance: six large, absurd, corporate-style headshots – pitch-perfect performances with a deadpan glazed stare at the camera. Morris-Cafiero is an acerbic self-portraitist, and for this new work, she dabbled with an AI software that purports to assess the employability of prospective candidates according to personality characteristics and physical appearance.Unsurprisingly, the algorithm favours classically “western features”, so the artist decided to dupe the machine by manipulating her face with sticky tape to mimic desirable facial structures. The pictures were taken when she achieved a peak score and looked like an ideal corporate employee, according to the algorithm. Except of course, even in her drab cardigan, she looks far from it. It’s a hilarious face-off with AI, but there is a sinister truth buried in the goofiness. She has also set up a laptop with a camera so you can be surveilled for hire yourself.View image in fullscreenIs this the face of an ideal employee? … a self-portrait by Haley Morris-Cafiero.Photo Oxford’s unforgettable show this year is to be found in the dank-smelling, sticky-floored basement room of the city’s renowned gay pub the Jolly Farmers. “I like dirt,” says Phil Polglaze, the 74-year-old photographer who is showing his work down here. His prints are still being stuck up on the wall with bits of Sellotape when I stumble in – all of them black and white photographs of public toilets in London.These aren’t bog-standard pictures of bogs, however. From 1979 until 1996, Polglaze worked with a criminal defence barrister to produce pictures that could be used in court to prove the innocence of men who were on trial for gross indecency after cottaging. Sometimes he would reconstruct the scenes or use his camera angles to show whether a witness would have seen the alleged crime or not. One reconstruction in Blackheath demonstrated that what police claimed they had seen was physically impossible – a man being masturbated by another man from the adjacent cubicle.Polglaze has exhibited these pictures only once before – in a pub in Cumbria. He hasn’t published or printed most of his archive and has no internet presence. In these lines of stinking urinals and grimy cubicles, there is a sense of danger – but also the poignant fact that for years, places like these were used by members of a community to reach out to one another – until that privacy was violated too. Polglaze says he wanted to remain neutral when he took the pictures, for the sake of the cases, but looking at them outside their legal context they read differently, as if he is reclaiming ownership of them, of the grime and all. What happened in these toilets is a key part of British culture and history that, thanks to Polglaze’s monumental archive, can’t be ignored.The British art world today is too slick and sleek – after two weeks of glamorous fairs and fancy balls, Photo Oxford is a refreshing dose of DIY, disorder and the downright uncommercial.Photo Oxfordruns until 16 NovemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyExhibitionsOxfordLGBTQ+ rightsArtificial intelligence (AI)reviewsShareReuse this content"

The white path ahead of me meanders skyward through forests of larch and pine, their boughs glittering with snow. When I look back, I can see for miles – an icily beautiful panorama of crags and peaks.I’m in the Lower Engadine, in remote south-east Switzerland, thanks to a tip shared by my Swiss friend Kaspar, when I was pondering a winter walking holiday away from the crowds. Over two weeks I’ll be exploring this fairytale landscape alone, following well-marked trails.View image in fullscreenThe Lower Engadine contains few ski slopes, even fewer tourists and Switzerland’s only national park, a fiercely protected 170 sq km of wilderness now inhabited by 36 species of mammal and more than 100 species of bird, including bearded vultures, eagles, wolves, ibex, mountain hares and marmots.The national park is closed to visitors during the winter, but several Engadine walking trails are close to its borders, meaning anyone can – with luck – spot some of its rare wildlife. The Engadine’s inhabitants speak Romansh (an official Swiss language spoken by less than 1% of the population) and follow a way of life that has barely changed – farmers, shepherds, cheese-makers and, more recently, artists attracted by the extraordinary beauty of this hidden valley.The Engadine’s inhabitants speak Romansh and follow a way of life that has barely changedWithout a developed ski scene, it’s all about “slow” tourism here, with small family-run hotels, guided walks and visits to artisanal food producers. “This is a place where Swiss families come to reconnect with nature,” says Kaspar, who has been holidaying here for more than two decades. “In winter that means hiking, snow-shoeing, sledging, travelling in horse-drawn carts, bird-watching and cross country skiing. We come here for peace and quiet, for a reminder of wilderness.”I base myself in Scuol, the end of the railway line and the largest of the 15 villages in the valley, reached via two connecting trains from Zurich. It is indeed a winter walker’s paradise, with more than 160km (100 miles) of trails kept safely walkable by an army of invisible labourers who spread sawdust on icy tracks and clear paths with snow ploughs while the rest of us sleep.View image in fullscreenMany of the region’s houses are decorated with sgraffito scratching.Photograph: Sibylle Kirchen/AlamyThese routes (known as Winter-Wanderwege) are marked on a free map, available from Scuol’s tourist office (also downloadable to your phone). They’re easy to follow, thanks to an efficient system of numbers, signposts and coloured poles, and can be accessed by regular trains and buses.I decide to tackle the Engadine Way, a 77km route that runs from one end of the valley (Zernez) to the other (Martina on the Austrian border) and can be completed, comfortably, on a series of day hikes. Each morning I take a bus or train (free with a guest travel pass handed out by hotels) up or down the valley and follow one of the routes to the next bus or train stop to head home, walking between five and 16km a day. I give myself a couple of days to “warm up” by following easy paths beside the River Inn that runs through the valley and cuts through Scuol. I need to get used to walking in crampons, with snow baskets on my walking poles, and prepare for the ascents and descents to come.I’m delighted to discover that every village contains something to astonish the unsuspecting ambler. In Zernez it’s theNational Park Centre, which tells me everything I need to know about the wildlife, geography and geology of the area. In Susch it’s the Museum Susch, an old monastery converted into a stunning art gallery dedicated to female artists (Tracey Emin has her own room), while its chic bistro makes a welcome pit stop for mountain-herb tea andEngadinerNusstorte– pastry stuffed with caramelised walnuts.View image in fullscreenAuthor nnabel Abbs on the Engadin Way.In the villages of Lavin and Tschlin it’s the tiny, gloriously painted churches, while in Guarda it’s a surprise French patisserie (Garde Manger) and a collection of richly decorated houses. In fact, most of the valley’s traditional Engadine houses are flamboyantly decorated – sundials, flowers, animals – using a “scratching” technique known assgraffito. Several still home cattle and goats in the basement, while the farming families live above, and their chickens roam the streets.There’s something meditative about walking through snow: it clears the mind like no other landscapeBut the walks that leave me the most ecstatic are those that wind deep into the unpeopled mountains – to frozen lakes (Lai Nair and Alp Laisch), or deserted hamlets (Griosch), or remote bistros serving hot chocolate, beer and dumplings (Zuort and Avrona). On these walks, I pass very few people. Deer tracks run ahead of me as my path – neither gritted nor sawdusted – winds through steeply sided forests, past waterfalls to snow-capped pinnacles and crests where bearded vultures and eagles soar in the clear blue sky.There’s something meditative about walking through snow: it clears the mind like no other landscape. The all-encompassing whiteness absorbs any nagging concerns, leaving me calm and collected. Its luminosity lifts the spirits, its silence allows me to hear every flurry of falling snow, every bird call. Each day I return feeling mentally and emotionally spring cleaned, purged of all brain clutter.When I need a break from walking, I visit the Tarasp Castle (a 12-minute bus ride from Scuol) with its contemporary art collection, including Picasso and Warhol. I watch a film in a tiny cinema at the Lavin railway station (all films are in English), visit the abandoned bath houses and springs of Nairs – one of which is now a cultural centre (Fundaziun Nairs) – and theice sculpture parkat Sur En.View image in fullscreenEngadine has more than 160km of trails.Photograph: Colin FreiOn one overcast day I take the Bernina Express up to the frozen Lago Bianco – a winter wonderland of such brilliant pristine white it makes my eyes ache. I could have done more: the tourist office organises guided snow-shoeing tours, tobogganing trips, visits to knife-making workshops, cheese farms and local breweries. And for skiers, Scuol’s handful of conveniently situated pistes – behind the station – are “dream runs”, says my friend. There’s also Scuol’s legendary mineral baths – six indoor and outdoor pools including a brine pool – but I’m saving that for next time. (If you visit on 1 March, you’ll experience “Chalandamarz”, a Romansh tradition of chasing out winter when village children parade the streets in costume, singing, ringing cowbells and cracking whips.)Scuol is without any of the usual hotel chains. Instead, this “slow” town has an immaculateyouth hostel(double rooms with private bathroom from 120 swiss francs/£112, dorm beds from £41) and several family-run guest houses. I enjoyed delicious meals on the sunlit terrace of the adult-onlyHotel Arnica(where architect-designed double rooms start at around £200 B&B) and creamy hot chocolates in the bar of the Scuol Palace hotel, once frequented by European royalty and luminaries such as the artist Paul Klee and writer Robert Musil.Today’s royalty and celebrities make for Klosters or St Moritz, leaving quiet, sleepy Scuol and its network of glittering, snow-carpeted trails to the likes of ... well, me. Or anyone else wanting a convenient, tranquil and friendly town in which to rest weary limbs after a day in the wintry wonderland of the Engadine.Annabel Abbs travelled independently, with a travel pass courtesy of Travel Switzerland.

This leek-laced version feels comfortingly autumnal, and a bit special, too. If I have friends coming over, I’ll make the leek and bechamel base in advance, then fill the sandwiches just before baking and serve them with a bitter leaf salad.Leek and comté croquesPrep10 minCook40 minServes42 leeks(about 300g), trimmed and finely sliced2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced60g unsalted butter, plus extra for butteringSea salt andblack pepper60g plain flour300ml whole milk1 heaped tsp English mustard100g comté, finely grated60g mature cheddar, finely grated8 slicesbreadPut the sliced leeks, garlic and butter in a medium saucepan on a medium-low heat, season well, then saute, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes, until the leeks have cooked down and turned sticky.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Stir the flour into the leek mix and cook for a minute or so, until it becomes a biscuity roux. Pour in the milk, turn up the heat a little and whisk until the sauce is smooth. Keep whisking for a minute, until the sauce thickens, then take off the heat. Whisk in the mustard and two-thirds of the grated comté and cheddar, and put to one side.Toast the bread (in batches, if need be), then butter one side of each slice. Lay four slices of toast buttered side down on a lined baking sheet. Spread each one with a generous amount of the leek bechamel, then top with a second slice of toast, this time buttered side up. Finish each sandwich with a layer of the remaining leek bechamel, then top with the remaining grated cheese. Bake for 10-14 minutes, until the croques are golden, bubbling and oozy.Serve straight away, with a dressed salad on the side, if you like.Explore more on these topicsBrunchQuick and easyFoodSandwichesCheeseVegetablesFrench food and drinkSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

Food assistant: Lucy Ellwood.FoodStewy chickpeas with squash and chicken braised with apricots: Samin Nosrat’s recipes for cooking with harissaFragrant with spices, this staple of north African cooking brings a welcome heat to stews and braisesSamin NosratMon 3 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareIthought I knew my harissa after nearly two decades of making it from scratch. Then I tasted a spoonful of rich, wine-dark paste from an unmarked jar that arrived on my doorstep from brothers Mansour and Karim Arem. They were on the verge of launchingZwïta, a company focused on celebrating their Tunisian heritage. Whereas western cooks and food writers are familiar with many of the food traditions of nearby Morocco, we’ve largely neglected to learn anything about Tunisia or its culinary history. And, judging by the Arem brothers’ harissa, that’s entirely to our detriment.Made with mild, sun-dried chillies, the traditional Tunisian version of this pepper paste is layered with garlic, caraway and coriander. Multidimensional in flavour and distinctly thick, it will be a revelation to anyone who has only ever encountered the stuff squeezed from a tube (or any other version similarly doctored with tomato products, hydrated chilli powder or fresh peppers). Once I tasted their harissa, I began to incorporate it into my everyday cooking, stirring it into garlic and herb labneh and drizzling it over roast vegetables. One of my favourite ways to use it is as a rub or marinade for chicken.Chicken braised with apricots and harissa (pictured top)Every time I’ve made this for friends, there hasn’t been a morsel left. Since I use mild harissa, even the most spice-averse kids lap up every sip of braising juice and eat every bite of chicken off the bone. It’s a winner if there ever was one. I recommend serving this with steamed couscous, because it absorbs the braising juices as you eat, ensuring that you’ll get to enjoy every last drop.Prep10 minMarinateOvernightCook2 hr 15 minServes4-8For the tebil2tbsp ground coriander1¼tsp turmeric½tsp caraway seeds, ground¼tsp freshly ground black pepperFor the chicken8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs(about 1.4kg)Flaky sea salt2tbsp mild harissa paste3tbspghee, or extra-virgin olive oil1 brown onion, peeled and thinly sliced2 carrots, peeled and cut into 2cm pieces8 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole245g crushed tomatoes(tinned or fresh)240ml chicken stock, or water2 bay leaves1 small handfulcoriander stalks, leaves reserved for serving160g dried apricots, halved1tsp ground cuminTo serveCoriander leaves and tender stalksSteamed couscous, or giant couscous, or riceGarlic andherblabnehGreen sauceTo make the tebil, in a small bowl, stir the coriander, turmeric, caraway and pepper.The day before you plan to cook, season the chicken generously on both sides with salt. In a medium bowl, mash the harissa with half the dried spice blend. Add the chicken and rub evenly all over with the spiced harissa paste. Cover and refrigerate overnight; bring to room temperature before cooking.With an oven rack in the middle of the oven, heat it to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Set a large, nonreactive frying pan on a medium-high heat and add the ghee. When the fat shimmers, add the onion, carrots and garlic, and season lightly with salt and the remaining spice blend. Turn down the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are tender, translucent and just beginning to take on some colour – about 12 minutes.Add the tomatoes and stock, stir to deglaze, then let the mixture return to a boil. Transfer the mixture to a 23cm × 33cm baking dish and lay the bay leaves and coriander stalks on top.Arrange the chicken skin side down on the bed of aromatics, then nestle the apricots around the chicken. The braising liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the chicken, so if you’re at all short, add a splash more stock or water to make up the difference. Lay a sheet of greaseproof paper over the chicken, then cover and seal tightly with foil. Transfer to the oven and cook until the chicken is completely tender and shows no resistance when pierced with a sharp knife – about an hour and 30 minutes.When the chicken is completely tender, move the oven rack to the top of the oven and turn up the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Lift off the foil and paper and flip over the chicken thighs so they sit skin side up. Sprinkle the cumin into the braising liquid, then return the baking dish to the oven and cook until the liquid has reduced and the skins are crisp and golden brown – 18-20 minutes.Use tongs to arrange the chicken in a rimmed serving dish or shallow bowl. Discard the bay leaves and coriander stalks, taste and adjust the seasoning of the braising juices with salt as needed, then spoon the apricots and juices all over the chicken. Garnish with coriander, then serve with steamed couscous, garlic and herb labneh and green sauce. Refrigerate any leftovers in a covered container for up to three or four days, or freeze for up to three months. Reheat thoroughly before serving.Stewy harissa chickpeas with squashView image in fullscreenSamin Nosrat’s stewy harissa chickpeas with winter squash.Feel free to leave out the squash, but, if you do, consider folding in 35g golden raisins instead.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4-61 onion, peeled and finely dicedSaltExtra-virgin olive oil3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced2 tbsp tomato puree2-3 tbsp mild harissa paste1 tsp ground cumin¾ tsp ground ginger¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper1 pinch ground cinnamon560g cooked and drained chickpeas680g peeled, seededhoneynutsquash, or other winter squash, cut into 2½cm cubes540ml chicken stock1 bay leaf1 tbsp aged sherry vinegar1 lemonChopped coriander, or dill or parsleyTo serve (all optional)Pitta, or crusty breadMarinated feta, or goat’s cheeseLabnehIn a medium casserole on a medium heat, soften the onion with a pinch of salt in three tablespoons of olive oil for about 10 minutes.
