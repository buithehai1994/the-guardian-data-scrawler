Then she stepped into a gym, picked up a barbell – and never looked back. She talks about self-confidence, her new book and the joy of eating like a ‘big beautiful horse’Sun 25 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareBefore Casey Johnston started weightlifting, she had assumed it was the preserve of “people who already had some sort of talent or need for it – like you’re a football player, a firefighter or in the military, and you need to be physically capable in that specific way”. Getting started seemed intimidating: the technique, the gym environment.Cardio, however, had always felt intuitive. “You go out the door and you run until you can’t run any more, and that’s it,” she says. As was the idea that it should be punishing. As a younger woman always obsessively trying to lose weight, she ran half-marathons in sub-zero temperatures and feared eating even the calories burned by any run in case it “undid” her hard work – never mind how cold her extremities and faint her head.After years on the exertion/deprivation treadmill, Johnston felt like a failure: “Like I’m doing this wrong, or my body is especially difficult to wrangle.” But as a science fiend and engineering graduate, something had started to smell off about the eternal glittering promise of diet and exercise. “If dieting works, where’s the evidence? That was a bit of a watershed moment for me. We’re all so used to taking out a lot of guilt [on ourselves] like, I’m not doing it right.”Then, in 2014, Johnston came across a Reddit post by a woman sharing how weightlifting had changed her life: that she felt strong – despite “only” doing five reps each of a few movements per gym session – and rested heaps and ate tons. Johnston was doubtful but, sick of the relentless misery of endless runs, found her local spit-and-sawdust gym and had a go. Hunger overwhelmed her: how much she immediately needed to eat to replenish her energy and repair her muscles, and how excited she was to do it all again. “I really did feel different very quickly,” she says.Working out didn’t have to be this horrible choreJohnston, who’s now 38 and lives in Los Angeles, is my equivalent of her Reddit woman. I also started lifting around then, so badly that Isoon slipped a disc from rubbish form. When Johnston started writing a column in 2016, for a now defunct website calledthe Hairpin, she was the font of good sense I needed, not just about technique, but also the importance of eating “like a big beautiful horse”, of disregarding wellness bullshit, self-punishment and pointless gym machines that only target one muscle at a time. She had a captivatingly funny, no-more-nonsense approach and a talent for accessibly interpreting scientific research. (Her canonical investigation on running without a sports bra convinced me to ditch mine, and I’ve never looked back.)Like many women who grew up in the 2000s, I’d had a purely poisonous relationship with my body since childhood: I have tried every restriction, had a destructive relationship with the MyFitnessPal food-monitoring app, exercised through injury. No one has had a more positive impact on that relationship than Johnston. So I feel a bit starstruck when she appears on my screen from her home office. In 2021 Johnston’s columns became a twice-weekly email newsletter, She’s a Beast. She self-published Liftoff, a pdf intro to lifting. Now her first proper book, A Physical Education, is a memoir of how lifting undid a lifetime not just of restrictive diet and exercise, but of her tendency towards self-diminishment from growing up with an alcoholic father and a mother who prized thinness: “Handling all these weights had taught me to know when I was handling too much,” she writes.Having read her authoritative, disruptive work for years, I was surprised to learn of her self-doubt, and that she had felt confident to start writing about her discoveries in spite of it. “I developed this compulsion to tell everyone about this thing I had found that changed so fast how I saw myself,” she says. “That working out could be totally different from how everyone talked about it as this horrible chore. While I was not super-confident in myself, I was very confident in the process.”Johnston grew up in upstate New York, and studied at Columbia University. She graduated in 2010, into the recession. She couldn’t get an engineering job and wound up in the media, writing about technology. Her affinity with “knowing how everything actually works” prompted her to investigate the mechanics behind the muscle. “There is so much beautiful science here that is not leveraged at all,” she says. “I felt like everything I’d heard [about my body] was about shame and guilt and reinforced the mystery of this destructive relationship. When I found out there could be something different, I was like, I gotta understand how all of this works.”The most immediate discovery was that the cravings Johnston had always thought were normal – and normal to suppress – disappeared once she started eating 50% more to fuel her workouts and recovery. “I could spend an entire day thinking: I want cookies, or I can’t have cookies. When can I have cookies? How will I acquire them? Which cookies will I get?” she says. “I thought that was a normal part of being an adult, to deny your cravings as a way of managing your weight, only to find out that it was a medical symptom of being malnourished from dieting for too long, and not even in a way that’s putting you on death’s door. There’s this middle ground where you’re substantially mentally and emotionally affected – rigid about rules, hyper-vigilant. Once I started eating more, those things went away without me having to be on my toes all the time. Everything about my mental state changed.”View image in fullscreenCasey Johnston: ‘I really did feel different very quickly.’Photograph: Courtesy of Casey JohnstonJohnston’s writing about the relative peace to be found in weightlifting hits hard because it was so hard won. In one painful chapter, she tries to introduce it to her mum, a “staunch exerciser” and “dedicated dieter”. She is resistant, especially to eating more than her minuscule calorific intake: “No one likes fat old women.”Johnston tells her there are plenty of fat old women that people love. Her mum replies: “But they wouldn’t loveme.”Even in the face of hard evidence to the contrary, it’s easy to perceive your unruly body as the exception to healthier approaches: that you alone must overexercise and undereat to avoid some perceived disaster. Johnston has been there.“When I was at a certain point with dieting, and I wanted to do whatever it takes to be not even hot, but physically acceptable, I didn’t care what anyone said I should or shouldn’t do,” she says. “As a woman, I felt that people judged my appearance before anything else, and I didn’t want that to be the main, valuable thing about myself. To get credit for anything else, I had to manage that first. So I completely understand this mentality of not feeling like you can trust anyone to appreciate you if you don’t manage your appearance. All we can do is help people understand they are worth caring for, which I didn’t understand about myself for a long time. I had no foundation other than suffering in this way, because that was my mom’s relationship to herself. It’s not a moral failing to struggle with this stuff, because so many of us do.”In a culture that remains fixated on women’s bodies, it’s barely possible not to. For a heartbeat around the turn of the 2020s, it looked as though strong might replace skinny as the new ideal; that body positivity or at least neutrality might become the norm. Then GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro swept in and once-buff celebs reverted to waif-like type, and denied that the drugs had anything to do with it. Will the body ideal always arc back towards skinniness? “If you look back through history, our aesthetic ideals have oscillated a lot,” says Johnston. “And a lot of times, tellingly, things switch up as soon as everyone gets comfortable or has stuff figured out.”The democratisation of strength training via Instagram and YouTube showed Johnston how happy thousands of people were eschewing thinness as an ideal: “They just didn’t, and still don’t, get the same visibility as the people who sow shame and guilt.” And she’s sceptical about appetite-suppressing drugs. “We have yet to see any pharmaceutical or medical ‘weight-loss’ method reliably bear out as effective, sustainable and lasting. I will be surprised if GLP-1s are the exception.”A Physical Education is a manifesto for learning to reconnect brain and body, to reclaim that relationship from the billion-dollar diet industry that profits from breaking it, keeping us hungry and insecure. “Lifting was constructive for me because of the atomic unit of it,” says Johnston. “You’re doing a rep or a set, you pause and go, how did that feel? Was that too heavy? Too light? How was my form? The practice of noticing how I felt was something I never had before, and learning to do that within lifting radiated outward into the rest of my life.”Writing the book allowed Johnston to examine why it’s so easy to lose body awareness to external forces. “The stew of our upbringings and cultural messaging can be very overwhelming, and the feedback loops between them are very difficult to see and challenge,” she says. “It requires having, or building, an immense amount of trust in yourself and in people who actually love and appreciate you, which is exactly what those forces work to destroy. But they wouldn’t be working to destroy it if it weren’t an immensely powerful thing to have. If there is anything that animates me, it’s defiance, so the idea that I’m taking something that many forces don’t want me to have only inspires me to fight harder.”You don’t need everyone to be doing the same thing  for you to be doing what’s right for youJohnston’s newsletter readers witnessed her defiance recently when she wrote about weightlifting through her first pregnancy, something women have historically been – incorrectly – uniformlyadvised against. “As someone who enjoys bullshit detection, cannot stand being talked down to and generally enjoys being angry and indignant, pregnancy is acres of rich, fertile soil to till,” she wrote at the outset. Her son is now five months old. “I heard from readers on both ends of the spectrum,” she says. “‘Good for you that you’re lifting’, and others who are like, ‘You’re actively killing your baby.’ I was excited to write about it and assert my experience, for people to know that I’m not speaking to this in an abstract way.”Johnston’s work feels to me of a piece with Miranda July’sAll Fours(her protagonist also takes up weightlifting) and Lucy Jones’s radical book on pregnancy and motherhood,Matrescence– startling prompts that have allowed many women to escape traditional gender scripts. At the same time, particularly in the US, there’s growing traditionalism around gender and aesthetic norms. It’s a striking schism. Johnston makes sense of it bynottrying to make sense of it.View image in fullscreenJohnston with her dog.Photograph: Jessica Pons/The Guardian“You don’t need everyone to be doing the same thing for you to be doing what’s right for you,” she says firmly. “So many people suffer for wanting coherence from these disparate groups who are never going to want the same things, but we’re still looking outward for the right answer. That answer is actually tolook ye inward. I really suffered for needing to make sense of what everyone is telling me and apply it all, without regard for myself. What I really needed was to develop that regard.”Johnston’s regard is powerful, and radiates outward. In A Physical Education, she writes about the importance of rest and that limits aren’t “something to be ashamed of”: her evangelism convinced me that I was still wildly overexercising – often 10 times a week – and prompted me to seriously pare back. She never does sponsored content and barely does social media – practically terminal for “building a brand”. After decades of having my brain scrambled by body positivity, Kayla Itsines and protein mania, Johnston’s work feels reassuringly steady, sound – and on your side.“There’s a lot of opportunities to pivot into courting virality,” she says. “But I understand the much less quantifiable if not more important aspect of feeling like you can trust somebody. I have built credibility by continuing to stay in this lane and say what I’m saying. I think my sheer stubbornness has won people over.”A Physical Education is published by Grand Central on 29 May.Explore more on these topicsWeightliftingWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)Diets and dietinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

Even in winter, I’ll return from a bike ride or run with a sheen of moisture on my forehead and damp patches in my pits. When the mercury rises, so do my levels of perspiration, and a sweat test last year confirmed what I’d always known: unlike Prince Andrew, I’m a heavy sweater.Sweat-wicking clothing can help. But where do you start?“Generally for sportswear, you’re looking for a knitted fabric with high, multi-dimensional stretch, primarily made from synthetic fibres such as polyester, nylon and acrylic,” says Dr Prabhuraj Venkatraman, senior lecturer in textile technology at Manchester Fashion Institute at Manchester Metropolitan University.These feature a fibre structure that has many internal channels, he says, giving the fabric a fine, porous construction. Excess sweat or moisture from the skin is transferred to the upper layer of the fabric through the numerous channels, where it evaporates.“Brands enhance that effect through design,” says sportswear designer Chantell Fenton. “Zoned mesh constructions, strategically engineered knits and seamless garments target areas of high perspiration, such as the back or underarms.”While ideal for sweat-wicking, synthetic fibres’ fossil fuel origins mean they aren’t great for the environment, and Fenton says that even recycled synthetics aren’t without their limitations. “These garments still release microfibres into waterways during washing, which are difficult to capture and contribute to marine pollution. While recycled synthetics are a crucial part of the shift toward sustainability, they’re not yet a fully circular solution.”Before you reach for a cotton T-shirt, the natural fibre has a high level of moisture absorption that will leave you with damp fabric directly on the skin that’ll soon make you cold. But there are some plant- and animal-based eco-friendly alternatives that are great for wicking away sweat.“Merino wool is a standout. It’s naturally thermoregulating, manages moisture by absorbing it into the fibre’s core without feeling wet, and offers built-in odour resistance. It’s especially effective in cold and long-duration activities, and recent innovations like non-woven merino constructions reduce production waste and carbon impact,” says Fenton.Bamboo viscose also offers moisture-wicking and antibacterial properties, while hemp combines low-input farming,durability and UV protection –studies showit’s incredibly effective at blocking UVA and UVB rays.“These materials may not manage moisture in exactly the same way as synthetics, but they perform well within their own context – and critically, many offer long-term sustainability benefits that traditional synthetics cannot, such as decomposing safely, reducing landfill pressure; aligning with circular design, including recycling and composting; and avoiding persistent microplastic pollution, with wool, lyocell, cotton and hemp microfibres breaking down in marine environments over time,” says Fenton.I asked some of the sweatiest experts in their fields, from a running coach to a mountaineering guide, for the kit they reach for when they want to stay dry, as well as putting some pieces through their paces myself.The best kit for sweat-wickingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mikkaphoto/Getty ImagesBest base layers for menView image in fullscreenThruDark Stealth seamless base top£115 at ThruDarkView image in fullscreenMontane DartT-shirt£30 at Montane£28.50 at Amazon“It’s important in terms of sustainability not to have different kit for different seasons. The base layer I wear most of the year is the Thrudark Stealth: it’s military tested, thin enough that I can wear it unless it’s a roasting hot day, and well built – I’ve had mine for years, worn it for hours and hours, and there’s still no fraying. If it’s really hot, I’ve got a secondary, lighter one by Montane: it’s airy, wicks well, and is a solid go-to top if you’re starting out.”Kris King, ultrarunner and co-owner ofBeyond the UltimateBest base layers for womenView image in fullscreenAsics base layer SS top£28 at AsicsView image in fullscreenOex Kelso merino long-sleeved topFrom £45 at Go Outdoors£52.25 at Amazon“I do a lot of running, and I need my base layer to be lightweight, easy to move in and not skin-hugging. I’m also quite a sweaty person, and the newer products on the market are so much better in terms of how they wash – you don’t get that staining or unpleasant sweaty aroma that comes back every time you put them on. I’ve recently got into merino wool layers – they’re lightweight, so you can wear them in the summer, and if it’s a day where it’s not particularly warm, it just gives you that little bit of extra insulation without feeling like it’s weighing you down.”Jo Wilkinson, former elite runner and coach atRunning Jo‘Ten minutes a day will make you significantly fitter’: personal trainers on the best home exercise kitRead moreBest sports underwear for menView image in fullscreenDavid Archy bamboo briefsFrom £23.99 for four at AmazonView image in fullscreenUniqlo Airism boxer briefs£12.90 at Uniqlo“The main things I need in a pair of underwear are that they’re quick drying and have stretchability, so I look for moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester, modal or mesh blends, and flat-lock or seamless designs to reduce irritation. Structure is also important – you don’t want them too high because they’ll ride up, which can become uncomfortable when running or cycling. In terms of sustainable materials, bamboo is really good – it has natural antibacterial abilities, it’s soft and is naturally breathable.”Michael Baah, personal trainer atMichael BaahBest sports underwear for womenView image in fullscreenLululemon WundermostNulu high-waist thong£25 at LululemonView image in fullscreenGoodmove ultimate support serious sports bra£28 at M&S“It’s super important to have sweat-wicking gym clothes that also look good, as I’m rarely just wearing them in the gym: I might be running to pick up my kids, on public transport, or meeting someone for a coffee, and I can’t always shower right after. They also need to keep their shape and colour after many washes. Lululemon underwear’s seamless fit is comfortable, gives good coverage and is high-waisted, which is great for working out – with the waistband practically sitting on the mid-stomach, it’s more likely to stay in place. Good Move by Marks & Spencer has shown how the high street can do sportswear that looks and performs high-end – for the price, the quality of its sports bras is great.”Rosie Stockley, fitness trainer and founder ofMamawellBest hiking base layers for menView image in fullscreenArc’teryx Cormac hoodie£80 at Arc’teryx£80 at Ellis BrighamView image in fullscreenPatagonia Capilene midweight crew neck£79.99 at SportsShoes£80 at Patagonia“For a summer base layer, I want something with SPF 40 and a hood to keep the sun off of my ears and neck. I also want freedom and range of movement, and length in the body so it doesn’t untuck from my harness when climbing. I prefer synthetic materials because they dry fast and last longer. The Arc’teryx Cormac hoodies are the gold standard, while Patagonia’s products are made from recycled materials, and some of the brand’s profitsare used to fight the climate crisis.”Tom Ripley,IFMGA mountain guideskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

For base layers, the main thing I look for is comfort. I love my Craft one – it’s affordable, I don’t feel restricted in it, it’s breathable on the uphills but keeps me warm on the downs, and it’s lightweight, which is handy if doing multi-day hikes and packing a bag. Chafing can be a problem with a rucksack and a sports bra, but I’ve never chafed when wearing it – its seamless design means there’s one less thing to rub against my skin. I’ve had it for years and it’s still going strong.

They’re preferably below ankle height or hidden, but with some heel support to avoid rubbing. Cotton is my go-to, but bamboo is a good, sustainable option, such as the ones by Naked Nation. My favourite pair are Lululemon Power Stride socks, but Under Armour Performance Tech no-show socks are more affordable and do the job too. If I were trying to get the most for my money, I’d happily use Primark socks, but they tend to get the odd hole when I run in them, whereas the first two options are more durable.”Louis Walcott, personal trainer and yoga teacherBest socks for hikingView image in fullscreenBridgedale Cool Comfort socks£22 a pair at Go OutdoorsFrom £14.08 a pair at AmazonView image in fullscreenSmartwool Hike Classic Edition cushion crew socks£22 a pair at Smartwool£22 a pair at Millets“Getting your socks right can make or break a walk, particularly when encountering tricky terrain or varied elevation. While something lightweight and breathable is a priority – particularly if wearing a waterproof boot that sacrifices some airflow – it’s important not to go too minimalist and be left with cold feet on exposed sections of trail. The Cool Comfort option from Bridgedale is my go-to for the warmest walks, while Smartwool’s merino wool-based Classic Hike is my preferred choice for every other occasion.

For most of my riding, the merino base layer from Rapha manages my temperature perfectly (and feels silky soft against the skin), while for all-out efforts or sweltering summer spins, the Summit from Pactimo ups the moisture-wicking ante.”CACharlie Allenby is ahealth and fitness journalist who puts running and cycling gear through its paces on increasingly ridiculous endurance challengesExplore more on these topicsFashionThe FilterFitnessHealth & wellbeingHobbiesMen's fashionMen's topsWomen's topsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Trump has a plan for dismantling themArjun AppaduraiSun 25 May 2025 09.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenThere is some mystery surroundingDonald Trump’s moves to dismantle many cherished principles of American history and its culture of governance: his globalization denialism; his romance with Russia; his demolition of universities; his contempt for European values and histories; his campaign to humiliate Canada. These are all known examples, but it can be hard to see across them to discern anything like a unified theory of Trumpism.There are two possibilities here. One is that there is no rhyme or reason to Trump’s actions. He is simply a randomizing generator of chaos. The other is that there is a method.I subscribe to the second possibility. I think Trump – and his advisers – know what they are doing.Other tinpot dictators – like NarendraModi, Recep Erdoğan, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Viktor Orbán – and their countries are distinct from the US in an important way. These autocrats around the world do not have comparable democratic institutions. They can capture, subvert or sabotage democratic traditions in their own countries, using their own means. In each of them, there are longstanding traditions of inequality (such as caste in India), vigorous and celebrated imperial histories (Turkey, Russia and China) and deep traditions of racial and religious nationalism (Hungary and India).[Trump] has hit upon an original formula: to reverse-engineer the liberal institutions designed as guardrails against people like himBut they do not have the special strengths of American democracy: a sturdy commitment to separation of church and state; the distribution of powers between legislature, judiciary and executive; and a deep antipathy towards tyrants, royal or otherwise.Trump thus comes to his dictatorship fantasy – evidenced by his compulsive impatience with advisers, media critics, political opponents or ordinary citizens who question him, and a bottomless appetite for praise and fealty – faced with a globally unmatched set of institutional powers that could theoretically stand in his way. To defeat them, he has hit upon an original formula: to reverse-engineer the liberal institutions designed as guardrails against people like him.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump takes a question from a reporter before boarding Marine One on the south lawn of the White House on 29 April 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThe institutions that require repurposing include the world’s most powerful judicial and legislative apparatus, which were designed to keep the executive restrained; a vast body of law and regulation; a massive federal bureaucracy to assure that federal policies are scrupulously enforced; and the world’s largest combination of military and police forces to help the state to assure domestic order and civility. Trump is turning these watchdogs into his personal pets.Trump’s scorched-earth approach to these institutions, their norms and powers, is not designed to improve the originals but to gut them, in part by turning their powers against themselves.The advanced civic infrastructure of the US could not easily be turned against itself. It required careful planning over the Joe Biden years by Trump-allied strategists, thinktanks, policy wonks andplanners. During this period, every ideological cough from Trump was turned by these adjunct players into a menu of detailed executive actions.Trump and his supporters, spread across a hefty network of rightwing thinktanks as highbrow as the Heritage Foundation and as lowbrow as Breitbart, have been busy for at least a decade laying the foundations of the greatest democratic rollback in US history, designing a newly minted form of jiu-jitsu to undo the grand American democratic tradition. This form of jiu-jitsu puts law against law, police forces against other police forces, court against court, media campaigns against other media campaigns, science against science, religion against religion, and deals against markets.ThusIceis ranged against more conventional police departments, the FBI has been internally polarized, pro-Israel evangelical Christians areturned againstmore liberal Christians,university trustees are turned againstfaculty,Robert F Kennedy’s lunatic scienceis turned against the scientific mainstream, and thesupreme court is pitched against the lower courtswilling to check Trump’s power.And of course there is Trump’s attack on US higher education, which has been widely dissected, turning universities into hostages of the federal government, andcivil rights law into a tool to attackcivil rights. It is precisely universities’ commitment to debate as a path to new knowledge that motivates Trump’s effort to take them apart.The very distinctive pillars of American democracy are being turned into fifth columns. Trump and his allies have created a massive autoimmune disorder – one in which the features of American democracy turn on themselves, re-engineering democracy to kill democracy.View image in fullscreenA new social orderIn the social science traditions of the west, the great thinker who built his entire sociology around the distinctive strengths of the western apparatus of government was Max Weber. He used his monumental knowledge of everything from Islamic law and Roman jurisprudence, to Mongol military genius and Puritan doctrines to show how a specific network of institutions came together in the modern west to combine economic, bureaucratic, scientific and governmental rationality.Weber’s ideas did not immunize him from many legitimate 20th century worries about how politics and science could lead to the death of the human spirit in the west. Detractors warned of the risk that science could be captured by the state; others of technological rationality turning into an iron cage that dilutes creativity and joy.But Weber did successfully demonstrate that it took many centuries to create the complex web of economic, political and scientific arrangements that persist today in liberal democracies. He was wrong about many things, such as the western monopoly over entrepreneurial capitalism, the special Puritan affinity for economic discipline, and the Hindu indifference to worldly wealth. But he was certainly right that Europe and the US (for which he had considerable admiration) were robust societies whose forms – during his lifetime – were the product of a long historical process that led to the creation of what we now understand as liberal modernity.American liberal democracy retained a remarkable commitment to representative government and to the separation of powersHowever, the west is not exempt from the truism that it is much easier to destroy institutions than to build them. The rise of the 20th century’s most powerful dictators, such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Benito Mussolini and Pol Pot, show us that massive propaganda combined with brute violence can destroy democratic institutions, however recent, fragile and fledgling.The Trump version of this story is built on the back of 260 years of complex liberal institution-building. To be sure, there are gaping aberrations in this story: a devastating civil war, the persistent enslavement and disenfranchisement of African Americans, racial campaigns against migrants of every stripe and background, paroxysms of rage against organized labor, and virulent anti-communism throughout the 20th century. Nor should we forget the decimation of Native Americans, the crushing of organized labor, the ruthless energy of the open frontier, the rise of robber barons and the cynical abuse of the “right to bear arms”.Still, American liberal democracy retained a remarkable commitment to representative government and to the separation of powers. It also saw a series of constitutional amendments that moved the needle on the right to vote, on race, on women’s rights, and more. Precisely because of abuses, exemptions and deviations from its constitutional ideals, the civil and political institutions of American democracy looked, until recently, as if they were too resilient to easily destroy. Even Europe, with its monarchs from Britain to Greece, and its 20th-century tyrants such as Hitler, Mussolini and Francisco Franco, cannot boast as resounding a liberal institutional apparatus as the US.But today, Trump and his army of followers are turning the strengths of American democracy against itself.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump signs a proclamation expanding fishing rights in the Pacific Islands in the Oval Office of the White House on 17 April 2025.Photograph: Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesConsider the orgy of recent executive orders, which clearlydiminish the scopeof the relevant constitutional provisions that give Congress the power to legislate. But they are the first in a series of dominos. The use of every kind of lawfare, every form of legal loophole, delay and workaround by Trump’s army of lawyers, takes energy from this initial domino to chip away at the principles of the rule of law, using the law as an autoimmune weapon against all forms of due process. The case of Kilmar Ábrego García, among a multitude of others, shows the president’s readiness to use specious interpretations of the law toplay chickenwith the supreme court.Much of this assault can be explained by Trump’s poor education, contempt for liberals, megalomania, personal greed and his unselfconscious vulgarity and lack of any discernible moral compass. But the assaults run deeper than that. Trump wants to produce a new social order as far as possible from the liberal democratic order as he can envision.View image in fullscreenMore car salesman than capitalistThis brings me to Immanuel Kant, whom I invoke in spite of my knowledge that Trump reads virtually nothing, much less old books or even books about old books. Kant is the key figure who made the connection between Enlightenment universalism and early European liberalism, built around his ideas of reason, autonomy and individuality. The basic Kantian argument is that any rational person who makes judgements as a free individual can see that all human beings deserve to be equally autonomous in order for the overall system to be fair and just. What makes Kant an indispensable post-Christian philosopher is his idea of the categorical imperative, which he explained as follows: “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.” In other words, obey those rules that you think should apply to anyone and everyone.From Kant in the 18th century to John Rawls in the 1970s, the idea that both justice and ethics require what Rawls called the “veil of ignorance” – the principle that a just society requires people to imagine fair social arrangements without any special knowledge of their individual circumstances – has become widely accepted as a foundation for liberal politics, economics and ethics, because it prohibits any individual from making his personal preferences the basis of a collective social policy.Trump’s ethics (if we can use such a phrase) are diametrically opposed to this principle. His entire view of the social contract is based on his idea of “the deal”. His long-standing attachment to his self-image as a deal-maker has misled many observers to see him as a crude capitalist, as a speculator, or as a conman. But as a deal-maker, Trump is more like the proverbial American car salesman.In our capitalist commonsense, deal-making is viewed as a direct expression of market ideology, an instance of financial actors making a transaction based on the perceived value of their products, with the agreed price creating a momentary equivalence between the two parties. But it is in fact more akin to barter, which is an evolutionary precursor of the market. It is a primitive form of trade, and when trade broke down in earlier societies, it often led to war. Barter does not require any social contract between the parties, and even less does it require supply and demand, pricing or the invisible hand. It is a face-to-face, immediate transaction, akin to a poker game or an episode of The Apprentice. Markets, on the other hand, are impersonal, abstract, unforgiving. They are not about winners and losers.This is exactly why Trump’s tariff war feels highly belligerent. It has the tricky logic of barter, where there is no general law of demand or supply, no external source of general price information. It depends on face-to-face relationships, often between parties who may have prior hostilities, major cultural differences, and no shared monetary mechanism to serve as a mediator of value. In this case, mistrust and misunderstanding are ever present during a barter transaction, and any breakdown in communication can lead to conflict, even to war. Trump’s current dealings with many countries have this tense overhang, through which open conflict could break out at any instant.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump presents his tariffs plan in the rose garden of the White House on 2 April 2025.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesTrump loves wealth, ostentation and deals, but he hates markets, not because of their imperfections but because they, in principle, rest on religious mysteries – of the “invisible hand”, of supply and demand, of the rationality of prices, all of which are safeguards against political fiat, personal greed and efforts to cook up macro outcomes for micro reasons.This hatred of markets unites all of today’s autocrats, because markets make their oligarchies unstable and their nationalist fiscal policies responsive to global finance. Hitler was an enemy of market forces both because they could impede state control of the economy, and because he hated Jews whom he saw as the biggest commercial actors behind the market. Stalin despised markets because they thwarted his central planning ambitions. Today, Modi, Erdoğan and Orbán seek to micromanage their economies and have installed loyalists as central bankers, since they fear the power of global financial markets to shake their national economic goals.It’s not that Trump cares that capitalism enhances inequality, that it is the enemy of planetary sustainability and the most stubborn opponent of economic nationalism of any type. What he disdains is the market – because it obeys no master other than its own rules of price, volume and scale. His weapon against it is tariffs, which he wields in the hopes of bringing it under his control.The market relies on the social contract, that agreement between individuals and government that is based in trust and predictability. Since Trump despises the market, he must dismantle the social contract, in all its forms and guises.Any attack on the social contract evokes atavistic fantasies, a return to Thomas Hobbes’s vision of the state of nature, in which human life is nasty, brutish and short. Or it evokes the Nazi version of a pre-contract world, built on racial purity, naturism, savage territorial expansion. Or Stalin’s special brand of paranoid planning, dictated science, and socialist realism in art and culture. Or Pol Pot’s insane literalism in trying to destroy cities, money and intellectuals. Or Mao’s astonishing Great Leap Forward, with its steel furnaces in every backyard and its youth militias wrecking all forms of the class enemy. Each of these regimes hated the social contract, in any of its many Euro-American versions.To resist Trump, we need to rewire democracy to revive democracyBut none of them could bring the full force of existing liberal institutions to bear on the pulverizing of the social contract, as Trump is doing today in the US. This is because the vast and interconnected force of law, bureaucracy, economy and state were simply not available in Germany, the Soviet Union, Cambodia and China when dictatorships took shape in these countries. And this was even truer of Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, whose young nations had barely achieved the rudiments of a durable liberal democracy when they were seized by autocrats.Trump’s twisted genius has enabled the reorganization of the core engineering of American liberal society, to turn its greatest protections against illiberal forces into the biggest weapons of illiberalism. His full-scale demolition of the American social order is based on a remarkable repurposing of the powers of the legislature, of the pesky independence of the courts and of the vaunted guardrails promised by the mass media to seduce many Americans into giving their consent to illiberalism.The jury is still out on the success of the judiciary in resisting Trump’s suborning of legal institutions, because the supreme court is playing its cards very cautiously. For now, a combination of Trump’s instincts and advisers continue to fuel a major assault on the American liberal democratic order by hot-wiring its basic components. The endgame is to repurpose them as carriers of a massive autoimmune disorder – whereby democracy destroys itself.Will Trump succeed? Are we doomed to an autocracy in democratic drag? Not necessarily. To resist Trump, we need to rewire democracy to revive democracy. This requires a move away from moral abstractions and liberal hand-wringing to local political campaigning, non-violent civil disobedience and active social mobilization. The clock is ticking and we must not allow the wrong man to be the last one standing.Arjun Appadurai, professor emeritus at New York University, is an anthropologist and former provost of the New School.Spot illustrations by Michael Haddad"

Later photograph: Chris Buck/The Guardian. Styling: Stephanie Tricola. Hair and makeup: Taisha Paquiot. Archive photograph: Tim Roney/Getty ImagesNew Yorkers Celeste Cruz and Karen “Daphne” DiConcetto auditioned to become a pop duo in 1998. Their career was short-lived but memorable – releasing Ooh Stick You, U.G.L.Y. and a cover version of Alice Cooper’s School’s Out!; they were also bottled off stage at the 2000 Reading festival. After getting dropped in 2001, Celeste pursued a career in acting, and Karen in screenwriting. They reunited in 2015, with the album Daphne & Celeste Save the World following in 2018. Karen lives in Brooklyn, and Celeste in New Jersey. They perform at theMighty Hoopla festivalin London on 31 May.DaphneBased on Celeste’s T-shirt, I would say this was taken during the promotion of U.G.L.Y. – her frosted blue eyeshadow is a clear indicator, too, as it was very much a thing back then. Someone should have told me to paint my nails. I also think we were getting bored with all of our normal poses. Boredom is the only reasonable explanation for that hand-to-mouth expression.One of the first things Celeste said to me was: “Hey, so, like, I’ve got pinkeye [conjunctivitis].” She wanted to get it out of the way at the start of the audition, so I wouldn’t think she had an eye that always looked like that, which I found endearing. My other memory is of us dancing to the instrumental to Ooh Stick You and us both saying: “What is this strange song?”When we arrived in England, I had just seen the movie Notting Hill, and, based on that alone, we decided we should live there. It was the 90s and labels had a lot of money, so they said: “Sure!”There was a deep sense of irony about everything we did, and the people who got the joke knew we were just having funBefore Daphne and Celeste, my ambition was to do Broadway. Pop wasn’t taking off as much in America as it was in the UK – the kind of music I liked was Lauryn Hill and Radiohead – but I soon became fully immersed. As well as British pop, we loved British TV. Once we saw Sid Owen from EastEnders and reacted as if he was the biggest star in the world. The same thing happened with Darren from the first season of Big Brother. Who knew some guy chasing chickens around a garden could ignite that kind of response?There was always a deep sense of irony about everything we did in Daphne and Celeste, and the people who got the joke knew we were just having fun. Richard and Judy were not those people. When we left the set after our interview the producers said: “Never come back.” I don’t even think they said please. What did we do? We were just being ourselves and maybe talking too much. They wanted us to be cheeky but not too cheeky, which we were. They took themselves very seriously and, while we didn’t want to be rude, we also thought: “This is really not that deep. Our lyrics are literally ‘Up your butt with a coconut.’”Being a pop band in that era was a whirlwind. We’d often be told we were doing something, such as an Asda supermarket tour, and we’d just agree to it. It never occurred to us to ask more questions about why the next three months of our lives would be spent in different Asda supermarkets. It was one of the weirder experiences we had, but actually pretty convenient as we could pick up food after the signings.Throughout those years, Celeste and I were stuck with each other. There were occasional moments when we needed space, but we had no other option but to figure it out. Learning how to work through problems like that in real time was an incredible skill to acquire at such a young age.Once the group got dropped, we went back to the States and took some time out from each other. A year later, we became roommates again, and we’ve been close ever since. As for the future, I’m not sure. We still have so much fun performing together. Mostly, I am just grateful to have Celeste as my friend.CelesteOur schedule during this period would often include 15 shoots in a day, so it’s impossible to pinpoint exactly where we were or what we were posing for. My eyebrows are Christina Aguilera levels of thin. It was the era to have almost no eyebrows at all. Someone should have told me to do a little less with my nails, and Daphne a little more. I think the expression we were going for was: “Gasp! Did you really just say that thing you shouldn’t have said?” People liked that type of sass from us.My first impression of Karen was that she had a striking bob. The audition itself was confusing, as I wasn’t entirely sure what it was for – apart from En Vogue, we didn’t have girl groups in the US at that time. Once I got to the UK I really started to understand the pop explosion that was happening – so much so that I bought multiple Steps records.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

This probably won’t last for ever.” But the pop world was incredibly earnest and people would often forget that we were 16 [Karen] and 18 [Celeste]. For example, when U.G.L.Y. charted at No 18, we were really excited – Top 20 was a huge thing for us – but the other groups we were on tour with responded as if something terrible had happened. In general, the pop scene found us tricky to place, and would sometimes be mean to us. There was very much a “sit at your own lunch table” vibe in response to us. But not S Club 7. They were so fun.We’ve been through the major life milestones together: weddings, pregnancies. Our bond is uniqueWhen Karen and I lived in London, our nextdoor neighbour was Brian Eno. We bumped into him one day and he said: “My daughters love you.” I did not know who this person was, which I now feel so embarrassed about. He invited us into his home and I remember looking around at all of his records and saying: “Wow, you must be such a huge U2 fan.” Thankfully, he was so humble and sweet, and didn’t let on he was the legend that he was.Edith Bowman and her mother look back: ‘My Scottish accent got me professional knockbacks, but I’m so glad I didn’t have elocution lessons’Read moreQuite quickly, mine and Karen’s friendship became like a sisterhood. As we were living and working together for 24 hours a day, there were moments when we would be at each other’s throats, but we had no choice but to learn how to take care of each other.When the group ended, we had a bit of space from each other. I definitely needed to gain back a bit of my identity: I was “on” for so long that I totally forgot who I was and what I really liked. At first I was restless and couldn’t stay static – I started following members of the Grateful Dead on tour. Then a year later, Karen and I were back in touch and we started hanging out again. Since then, we’ve been with each other for all of the major life milestones – we went to each other’s weddings, we got pregnant at the same time, and, as we both lived in Brooklyn, our children became besties. It’s really cute – they vibe similarly to how Karen and I do.I feel like the universe chooses who you go through life with, whether you intentionally pick someone or if you meet them at an audition. Karen and I love our husbands, but there is a bond between us that’s unique. She knows what it’s like to be in a pop group, to be a pandemic mum, to work five jobs in New York to get by. She gets me on all levels, and I can’t say that about anyone else.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFlashbackPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I didn’t expect to find hope in a book by a party leaderSun 25 May 2025 08.17 EDTLast modified on Sun 25 May 2025 11.45 EDTShareThe word “care” sits in a strange place in UK politics, somehow combining an increasing sense of urgency with a maddening and very British vagueness. Most of us know that there is a worsening care crisis. The reasons, we are told, are to do with demographics – more old people, put bluntly – and the seemingly eternal lack of money, or governments willing to spend enough on the kind of care most politicians fixate on: the sort that revolves around either residential settings or home visits, done by the anonymous mass of people we call “care workers”. This category of human being is now in the news as never before: a lot of them tend to come from abroad, something that Westminster has nowdecided is intolerable.What a mess this issue is, and how many other matters the debate about it omits – not least the care needs of hundreds of thousands of adults who are learning disabled. But by far the biggest gap in our understanding centres on about7 million unpaid carers, whose lives are explored in a new book. Strangely, it has been written by a frontline British politician; stranger still, the best bits are among the most compelling, moving pieces of political prose I have read in a very long time.The author ofWhy I Care: And Why Care Matters is the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey. Its first third focuses on his own life story: his experience of looking after the mother he lost to cancer when he was still in his teens, and the life he and hiswife, Emily– and their daughter, Ellie – share with his son, John, who was born with physical and intellectual disabilities.Like all parents, Davey experiences joy and worry, but at intense extremes. As theparent of a childwith special educational needs, I recognise his deep fears about the future that awaits his son after his parents have gone: “No one’s going to love him, and hold him, like Emily and I do.” And just about everything he says is full of a mixture of frustration and bafflement I completely relate to, mostly focused on our systems of government and politics, and the archaic workings of what remains of the welfare state.Pretty much by definition, what Davey calls family carers lead pressured, often sleepless, overburdened lives. Large numbers of them have to cope with mental health problems. More than 1 million are reckoned tolive in poverty. Attempts to calculate the monetary worth of what carers do, he says, have put the aggregate figure at about the same level as the UK’s annual spend on the NHS. But how often do we hear about any of this?Family care was part of the pre-political lives ofKeir StarmerandAngela Rayner; it was also there inDavid Cameron’s story. But what it demands of policymakers still seems too awkward: in a political culture that rarely sees issues as much more than debates about budgets, the needs of people who look after their close relatives seem too complex and messy to really grapple with. There is, moreover, a problem with Westminster’s prevailing conceptions about what makes life worthwhile: as politicians constantly describe the voters they worry about as “working people” who make up “hard-working families”, it’s pretty obvious who such thinking excludes.3:42Ed Davey releases personal campaign video for the Liberal Democrats – videoAs a result, omissions and oversights pile up. The UK has no system of paid leave for family carers: one study Davey quotes suggests that 40% of people who provide high-level family care have had togive up workcompletely. Huge injustices are woven into the lives of young carers – who have to start seeing to the needs of siblings and parents at pitifully young ages – and how little the education system makes allowances for what they have to do at home.As I read Davey’s book, Private Eye magazine gave this year’sPaul Foot awardfor investigative journalism to my Guardian colleagues Josh Halliday and Patrick Butler, for their work on a mind-boggling scandal: the story of how hundreds of people who received carer’s allowance (which is £83.30 a week) wereprosecuted for unwittingly breakingcruel earnings rules. Everything came down to a key facet of the benefits system that remains in place: the fact that earning a penny over a weekly threshold of £151 – nowraised to £196– meant that the entirety of someone’s carer’s allowance was summarily withdrawn; and if the relevant systems didn’t pick up any accidental exceeding of the earnings limit, “overpayments” could fester on for months, until people whose lives were already loaded with pressures and stresses were suddenly hit with impossible demands for payback.The government has announced an overhaul aimed atspotting overpaymentsmore quickly, but all this is surely the ultimate example of the institutionalised callousness displayed towards family carers: not just the miserly levels of benefits they receive, but the way the system seems to cast them as people prone to lie and cheat (witness one of manystark recent headlines: “Mother of autistic boy left with £10,000 debt after breaching DWP rules by £1.92 a week”). The way officialdom treats any combination of work and care, moreover, is reflected in rules about education: if you study for less than 21 hours a week, you remain eligible for carer’s allowance – but any more time spent on formal learning means you lose the benefit completely.‘I could never, ever not care for her’: how do carers know when to stop caring for those they love?Read moreAnd now there is another level of cruelty. The government’s plans to cut down millions of people’s entitlements to the personal independence payment will have knock-on effects for carers, depriving an estimated150,000 peopleof either carer’s allowance or the carer element of universal credit which means that many households will be hit twice over. Plainly, this is more proof of how devalued carers are.There may be one or two rays of light. Unpaid care was largely missing from most of thePR blurbthat launched the government’s independent inquiry into adult social care, but Louise Casey – the cross-bench peer leading its work – nonetheless made a point of beginning the process with conversations thatinvolved family carers. But the surrounding political context remains grim: Westminster’s musings about care still seem to myopically revolve around older people having to sell their houses to pay for places in homes, and whether a country that clearly needs as many care workers as possible should make recruiting them even more difficult.Towards the end of his book, Davey asks a handful of questions about very different subjects. “What would happen if we totted up unpaid carer hours and paid them the minimum wage?” he wonders. “What would happen if we looked at families whose real crisis is poor and unaffordable housing and fixed that first? What would happen if we took the concept of a good childhood – with a right to play, a right to education, a right to be carefree – and applied it to the thousands of child carers we know exist?”I have a couple more. As our society rapidly ages, what will happen when the majority of us start to experience life as family carers, and have to confront the fact that our responsibilities to some of our loved ones can no longer be entirely palmed off on other people? And what will that mean for an established model of politics and economics that holds that, unless we are in paid employment, we can be ignored? These will be two of the central questions of the next 10 years, and when they finally hit us, they will change everything. Davey, to his credit, seems to know that.

The remainder were either only partly implemented, often in symbolic, limited or inconsistent ways, or were too vague or difficult to measure.Labour MPs said the UK was trapped in “a performative cycle”, where a crisis prompted a report to be commissioned to “diffuse anger” and its recommendations were later quietly shelved.View image in fullscreenProf Ted Cantle, who led the Cantle review, said the UK is in a ‘doom loop’, where a riot or issue leads to a review, recommendations and then the process starts again.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianProf Ted Cantle, the former chief executive of Nottingham city council, led the community cohesion review team after 2001 riots in northern towns with predominantly white and Asian populations.Analysis by the Guardian has suggested that of his recommendations, an estimated 5% had been fully implemented, while more than a third had not been implemented at all. The rest had been partly implemented or were deemed not measurable for this analysis.Cantle said: “We’re in this doom loop where a riot happens or there’s an acknowledgment of some sort of issue, a review happens and the recommendations aren’t really taken up and then the process starts again.”After last year’s riots, Cantle renewed the call he first made in 2001 for a community cohesion strategy. “There is no doubt in my mind that there has to be, at the heart of government, an agency, a department, that is focused on developing cohesion and provides a national strategy, a national narrative, which is then implemented at the local level by the local government, by voluntary agencies.”Lord Victor Adebowale, the chair of the NHS Confederation, made 28 recommendations after his 2021 review of mental health and policing, which examined the disproportionate number of Black men dying in police custody.Analysis suggested an estimated 14% of his recommendations have been fully implemented, while around a quarter was ignored. “A healthy society is an equitable society,” he said. “It’s one that understands individuals, communities and the interactions between them in such a way that they can provide appropriate services.”Since the riots that broke out in the UK last summer, the rightwing Reform party has taken control of 10 councils, vowing to target equality, diversity and inclusion policies, while Keir Starmer has said the UK risked becoming “an island of strangers” without further controls on immigration.View image in fullscreenVictor Adebowale believes that some lives could have been saved if some of his recommendations had been put into place.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianAdebowale told the Guardian that while it has become easier to “pander to prejudice [than] to lead progressively”, stark racial inequalities remain as “successive governments, not just this one, fail to accept the systemic nature of race discrimination”.He said: “If you look at the stats, Black men are still disproportionately detained. If you pick any one of the major disease categories, you’ll find that Black people have a greater, worse experience and worse outcomes. You look at cancer, Black people are likely to discover they’ve got stage four in A&E. If you look at mental health, they have a worse experience and worse outcomes … on and on it goes.”Adebowale said if all of the 27 recommendations he made had been implemented, he was “pretty certain” that some deaths since “wouldn’t have occurred”.The Guardian’s analysis found that some recommendations made in official reports produced since 1981 were implemented initially but later dropped or significantly altered.Several recommendations from the 2001 Cantle report were introduced under the Blair and Brown governments – for example, the requirement for Ofsted to inspect and report on the public duty on schools to promote community cohesion, the expansion of Sure Start to support disadvantaged children early and prevent disengagement from education, and other youth outreach work such as Connexions Service.However, these programmes were substantially defunded during the coalition government’s austerity drive in the 2010s, and many were later dismantled entirely under the subsequent Conservative majority government.Some recommendations, such as Adebowale’s on developing safer models on restraint, come up again in later reports. The issue of deadly use of restraint, particularly those in the prone position, came up four years later in theAngiolini review in 2017, yet multiple individuals have died in custody while being restrained, including in prone-position holds.Many recommendations the Guardian assessed to have now been fully implemented were first made decades ago, resurfacing in two or even three subsequent reviews before finally being acted on – often after 10 or even 20 years.Others, such as the call for police forces and teaching staff to reflect the communities they serve, or for the curriculum to meaningfully reflect Britain’s racial diversity, have been repeatedly recommended but remain unmet.The Guardian’s snapshot analysis builds on earlier work by the Stuart Hall Foundation and the Centre for Public Data.While a majority of recommendations made over five decades have not led to policy changes in the public sector, David Tyler, who co-chaired the Parker review which made recommendations to the private sector, saidbig business has acted.The Parker reviewset FTSE 100 businesses a deadline of having one minority ethnic board member by 2021, and also said each FTSE 250 board should have at least one director of colour by 2024.The review’s yearly update earlier this year found that 95% of FTSE 100 companies now have one minority ethnic board member, while 86% of FTSE 200 companies could say the same.Tyler said: “Broadly, unless you’re talking about the very recent past, which has been influenced above all by Donald Trump and Maga, it’s moved in the right direction in terms of the attitude of business people to take the best possible talent from the ethnic minorities in the UK.”Nonetheless, the number of recommendations made to the state that have been “shelved” meant the UK was “trapped in a performative cycle” when it comes to racial inequality in the UK, the Labour MP Clive Lewis said.“This research sadly confirms what many of us have long suspected: when it comes to race equality in the UK, we are trapped in a performative cycle – crisis, commission, then conveniently shelved recommendations.“From Scarman to Macpherson to Lammy, we’ve seen inquiry after inquiry confirm what racialised communities already know: that systemic racism is real, it’s persistent, and it’s baked into the institutions that shape our lives. But instead of acting on those truths, successive governments have treated these reviews as fire blankets – designed to smother outrage, not spark change,” said Lewis.The Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy urged the government to act. She said: “Looking at the British state’s track record, you could be forgiven for thinking the main purpose of race inquiries past has been to diffuse anger around the many inequalities facing Black communities in our country and divert attention away from securing real change.”Explore more on these topicsRaceThe race reportBlack Lives Matter movementnewsShareReuse this content"

There were tears and celebrations. There was Bobby Robson and Johan Cruyff. There were tributes from colleagues, peers, friends and family and an invitation to “go gallivanting” from Gazza.“You don’t believe it but you will be missed,” said Pep Guardiola.The 64-year-old largely held it together as he was taken down memory lane and ushered towards the exit door of the BBC’s top sports programme after 26 years of hosting. Only a sniffle betrayed his deeper feelings as he signed off for the last time. “Rather like my football career, everyone else did the hard work and I got the plaudits”, he said. “It’s been utterly joyous.”Lineker has often described the opportunity to be a custodian of a programme he himself had grown up watching as “a privilege”. In truth, the former England captain’s stint as presenter dwarfs that of every other host. From David Coleman to Des Lynam, the host of Match of the Day has also been the face of the BBC’s sports programming and Lineker continued that tradition, but only his presence has been consistent across an entire generation.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker (right) joined Match of the Day in 1999, presenting alongside Trevor Brooking (left) and Alan Hansen (centre).Photograph: PA Images/AlamyAfter an initial stint as a pundit, Lineker’s presenting debut came on 7 August 1999. He introduced himself with a Lynam-esque moment of fourth-wall breaking. “Hey, tell you what, football’s back,” he said, before adding: “Any good? Did I get the job?”His first match was Chelsea at home to promoted Sunderland, a thrashing led by Gianfranco Zola; his punditry panel Alan Hansen and Trevor Brooking.Twenty-six years later and Lineker saw out his last 90 minutes of action and analysis in the company of Alan Shearer and Micah Richards. Both men are bigger, louder and snappier than their predecessors. They also work with Lineker all week long as part of The Rest Is Football, the hit podcast produced by Lineker’s Goalhanger studio. There, their personalities are given looser rein and banter gushes freely. The more mannered versions of the trio on MOTD can seem a little awkward by comparison.Over the years Lineker found a distinctive voice as a broadcaster, conveying his enthusiasm for the game while adopting an avuncular approach to the athletes he was watching. He also indulged his fondness for wordplay and made many deprecating references to the achievements of his career.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker presenting Match of the Day in 2000.Photograph: YoutubeHis boyish looks endured for decades, his ageing betrayed only by his whitening hair. In 2015 he agreed to present MOTD in “just my undies” if the team he had once played for and always supported, Leicester City, won the Premier League. The Foxes duly pulled off the miracle and Lineker half-honoured his commitment: the white bloomers were more shorts than pants.At that point in his career it was as close to controversy as Lineker had come. The player who never received a yellow card had become the good guy host, even-handed in his observations and gentle in his humour. But his pants pledge came via a post on Twitter and Lineker’s social media activity was to change the perception the public had of him.He used Twitter to articulate his personal political views. His support for refugees brought attacks from the press and strangers into his home. Two years ago, criticism of the previous government’s language on asylum led to debates over impartiality and a brief suspension, only for Lineker’s pundit peers to walk out in solidarity.Scrutiny of Lineker’s activity away from the studio has only grown since, at the same time as his independence from the BBC has deepened. The decision that Lineker would begin to step away from his BBC responsibilities was made last autumn, with the promise of a last dance at the men’s World Cup next summer. Lineker’s decision two weeks ago to repost content relating to the Gaza conflict that contained an antisemitic symbol then put an end to plans for an extended farewell.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker with Alan Shearer and Micah Richards during his last Match of the Day.Photograph: Match of the Day/PA“It wasn’t meant to end this way,” was how Lineker opened his final show, but there was to be no confessional. Of course it was a set up for a joke. “With the title race over, the Champions League was all we had left to talk about,” said Lineker as Richards grimaced keenly, but the camera didn’t linger.As ever with a show that is edited with military precision, the match action had to be cued up. “We’ll take it in table order,” Lineker said. The show rolled on.There were little chuckles at the prospect of free pints at Shearer’s Bar at St James’ Park and a recital of law 12 relating to the control of the ball in a goalkeeper’s hand. The Chelsea defender Levi Colwill was compared to a “prime Lineker in the box” by Richards and giggles were had over unrevealed remarks relating to Sunderland made by Shearer in the green room.There was a graphic that got the West Ham manager wrong and Lineker momentarily confused Brighton and Bournemouth. It was all as familiar and as comforting as a warm bath. Then, finally, the plug was pulled.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerMatch of the DayBBCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The youngest, Sayden, six months old, was still sleeping. And like every day, with war raging in Gaza and Israeli strikes landing just metres from her neighbourhood in Khan Younis, Najjar worried about leaving them at home without her.But Najjar, 35, had little choice. One of Gaza’s dwindling number of medics, a respected paediatrician at the Nasser medical complex, she had to go to work to care for injured babies who had barely survived Israeli attacks. She could never have imagined that that farewell to her family would be her last.A few hours later, the charred bodies of seven of her children, killed by an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis, arrived at her hospital. Two other bodies, including Sayden’s, remained under the rubble. Of her 10 children,only one had survived, along with their father, Hamdi al-Najjar, 40, also a doctor. Both are now in hospital.“It’s one of the most heartbreaking tragedies since the beginning of the conflict,” Mohammed Saqer, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital, said. “And it happened to a paediatrician who dedicated her life to saving children, only to have her own motherhood stolen in a moment of fire and deafening silence.”Footage shared by the director of Gaza’s health ministry and verified by the Guardian shows the burnt, dismembered bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of Najjar’s building near a petrol station as flames still engulfed what remained of the family’s home.Ali al-Najjar, 50, the older brother of Hamdi, Alaa’s husband, said: “When I heard the house was bombed, I instinctively rushed to my car and headed to the place as I knew my brother and his children were inside. When I arrived, I was shocked. I found my nephew Adam, who survived, lying on the road under the rubble. He was covered in soot, his clothes were almost torn, but his soul was still inside him. My brother was lying on the other side, bleeding heavily from his head and chest, and his arm was cut off. He was still breathing with difficulty.”Ali called the medical team and took the two survivors to the hospital. Then he began searching for his nine missing nieces and nephews.“The house was very difficult to clear because the ceiling was stacked on top of itself. I started searching around the house hoping to find any of the children because I assumed the bombing might have thrown them outside the house,” he said. “But then, sadly, the first burnt body appeared. After completely putting out the fire, we found the rest of them – some were mutilated and all were burnt.”Alaa al-Najjar rushed to the site of the explosion as rescuers pulled the body of her daughter Revan from the rubble. In tears, she begged the rescuers to let her hold her one last time.“Her [Revan’s] body was completely burnt from the upper part, nothing remained of her skin or flesh,” Ali said. “There are still two bodies of my brother’s children we could not find: the oldest, 12-year-old boy, Yahya, and the six-month-old girl, Sayden.”Najjar returned to the hospital to check on her son Adam, 11, and her husband. Sources at the Nasser hospital who transferred the children’s bodies one by one to the morgue said their mother was not able to identify them, so bad were the burns.The children’s names were Yahya, Rakan, Ruslan, Jubran, Eve, Revan, Sayden, Luqman and Sidra.View image in fullscreenEve and Rakan with their father, Dr Hamdi al-Najjar.Photograph: Reuters“Alaa went to the morgue, held her children in her arms, recited the Qur’an over them and prayed for them,” said Dr Ahmed al-Farra, 53, the director of the children’s building at the Nasser medical complex. “Other female doctors around her collapsed from grief and rage, but Dr Alaa remained composed. God sent peace upon her heart. After they were buried, she went directly to check on her husband and son and began caring for them.”Colleagues at the hospital described Najjar as a committed, polite and ethical doctor, capable of enduring immense pressure, treating dozens of children and patients daily, and at the same time caring for a large family.“She was in constant worry for her children when she was at the hospital. When she heard a house had been bombed in the Qizan al-Najjar neighbourhood, her mother’s heart sensed something was wrong,” Farra said.He said there were no words for her loss. “If anyone wants to share an opinion, let them first imagine it happening to them – to suddenly lose every person connected to you.”After saying goodbye for the last time to the lifeless bodies of her seven children, Alaa went to the ward where her surviving child was being treated.“Her husband was suffering from severe injuries – brain damage and fractures caused by shrapnel, along with shrapnel wounds and fractures in the chest. He was placed on a ventilator and fitted with medical tubes,” Farra said. ‘‘Her son’s condition was relatively better – his injuries ranged from moderate to severe.”View image in fullscreenDr Alaa al-Najjar (standing left) at her husband’s side in hospital.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesNajjar’s colleagues and friends said her children held Egyptian citizenship and that Alaa and Hamdi had been planning to leave for Egypt and enrol their children in Cairo’s Al-Azhar University.The Israel Defense Forces said: “Yesterday, an IDF aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis. The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety. The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”The Gaza health ministry says nearly 54,000 Palestinians, including 16,503 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks across the territory.Farra said: “My only hope is that those who were killed are not just names on paper. We were created just like every other human being in this world. And like every other human, we have the right to live.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The driver was security cleared, actually recommended by GCS, it was a contract that had been in place for about five years, and I renewed that contract.“A memo was sent by someone who was unfamiliar with the contract, asking about security concerns, and other civil servants said there were no security concerns, and that’s the end of the matter.”The Conservative party leader said it was “destructive” that someone would leak the memo out of context. “I’ve never, ever, ever put myself in a situation where security was reduced,” she said. “And also, it would not have been allowed in the first place. There is no way that the department would have allowed me to be carrying official secret documents in a car that wasn’t security cleared. It’s a nonsense story.”Labour said Badenoch had still failed to explain why she did not use the government car service like other ministers.“The Tory leader cannot just dismiss the security concerns that were raised at the time and hard-working families deserve to know how much this extravagant arrangement cost,” a party spokesperson said.The Guardianreported last yearthat Badenoch had asked officials to pay for a holiday flight to the US with taxpayers’ money while in government but was rebuffed by her former department’s top civil servant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The charity has also warned that melanoma cases are expected to rise again this year, with 21,300 cases.Michelle Mitchell, CRUK’s chief executive, said:“Improvements in skin cancer survival rates highlight the remarkable progress driven by our research. But the growing number of people diagnosed with melanoma is still concerning, especially when we can see that rates are rising faster in men.“If you notice anything different on your skin, like a new mole, a mole that’s changed in size, shape or colour, or any patch of skin that looks out of the ordinary – don’t ignore it, speak to your GP. We want to beat skin cancer for everyone, no matter who they are or where they’re from – early diagnosis is key and could make all the difference.”Fiona Osgun, head of health information at CRUK, said: “As the weather gets warmer, it’s really important to look after yourself in the sun. Getting sunburned just once every couple of years can triple your risk of melanoma skin cancer, compared with never being burned. And it’s not just the hot, sunny days you need to watch out for – UV rays can be strong enough to cause skin damage between mid-March and mid-October in the UK, even when it’s cloudy or cool.“That’s why we encourage people to take some simple steps to stay safe. Try to stick to the shade between 11am and 3pm when the sun is strongest, wear clothes that help cover up your skin, with a hat and sunglasses, and use a sunscreen with at least SPF30 and 4 or 5 stars.”Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: “Prevention is by far the best plan with skin cancer, so avoid the sun when it is at its hottest and ensure you use sunscreen. For skin cancer, as for any cancer, it is vital that you are seen and diagnosed as early as possible, so people should come forward if they are concerned about symptoms. Getting checked saves lives.”Explore more on these topicsSkin cancerCancerMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The force said the change meant officers were attending crimes such as robberies faster, but mental health groupssaid they feared it could result in deaths.May and two ex-health ministers, Syed Kamall and Frederick Curzon, have tabled amendments to the mental health bill going through parliament which, if passed, would lead to mental health nurses, psychiatrists or other doctors being called out to restrain and detain someone under the MentalHealthAct. Those professionals would each become an “authorised person” who is allowed to detain someone under the act.May took an active interest in mental health issues during her time as home secretary and in Downing Street. She helped ensure those detained under the act were no longer held in police cells and were instead taken to “places of safety”, usually at NHS facilities.But in a joint statement on Monday the eight groups said the risks posed by someone in a mental health crisis meant police officers must continue to always attend. The groups include the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association.At present, only police officers are permitted under the Mental Health Act to detain someone in a mental health crisis, for example because they are having a psychotic episode.The groups said: “Removing police involvement entirely has hugely dangerous implications, as entering someone’s home without permission is fraught with huge risks and is only currently done with the assistance of police intelligence. Without this, professionals may be entering homes without police help and therefore lacking crucial intelligence that could ensure their safety.”They added: “While we recognise the immense pressures faced by police services, we also acknowledge that mental health crises in the community are becoming increasingly acute and almost never occur without some level of risk.“The expertise, skills and equipment of the police remain essential for safely reaching individuals in crisis, especially where they may be in immediate danger to themselves, pose a risk to others or face a threat from others.”Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Detaining, and if necessary restraining, someone is essentially arresting them and to do this safely requires specialist skills and legal powers.“Expecting clinicians whose role is to provide therapeutic care to arrest people in the street or burst into their homes if they notice someone suffering a mental health crisis is simply inappropriate and indicates a lack of understanding of what health professionals do.”Chief constables are backing the change. They want to see responsibility for dealing with mental health crises become split between their officers and NHS staff.A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said: “We support the proposed amendments to the mental health bill, which will enable authorised medical professionals to effectively deal with some mental health incidents. This will ensure vulnerable people receive the most appropriate care without feeling criminalised because of their mental health issues.”They added: “We will always attend incidents where there is a risk of serious harm to the individual or attending professionals, or where criminality is involved.”The groups opposed to the plan also include the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, the College of Paramedics, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, the British Association of Social Workers and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services.The Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, the party’s former shadow cabinet minister for mental health who is also an A&E doctor, voiced unease about the plan.She said: “I am concerned that these amendments aim to turn practitioners into enforcers and could expose healthcare staff to increased danger. It runs the risk of eroding trust in dedicated and hard-working mental health staff by delegating police powers to them.”Ministers are also against the change. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Extending police powers to other professionals would represent a major shift in the roles, responsibilities and practice for health and care staff and would place additional resource on an already stretched NHS at a time where we are trying to rebuild a health service fit for the future.“It also raises questions around whether it is right for the health and social care professionals to have powers to use reasonable force, which could have implications for patient, public and staff safety, as well as potentially damaging the relationships clinicians have with patients.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthNHSHealthEnglandWalesMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

Our life was exciting, he was exciting.“He was curious, funny, annoying, late and creative in every cell of his body. But more than that, he was the kindest of men and a profoundly moral man. He leaves in his wake a trail of love a mile wide.”Alan Yentob: the last impresario | Sam KnightRead moreYentob joined the BBC as a trainee in 1968 and went on to hold a number of senior and influential positions, including controller of BBC One and BBC Two; director of television; head of music and arts; director of BBC drama, entertainment and children’s; and creative director.His commissions included Absolutely Fabulous, Have I Got News for You and the classic adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. He also launched CBBC and CBeebies.He made his name on the 70s BBC series Omnibus and Arena, and edited and presented the arts documentary series Imagine from 2003.The BBC director general, Tim Davie, called Yentob “a towering figure” in broadcasting and the arts and “one of the defining figures in the story of British culture”.“A creative force and a cultural visionary, he shaped decades of programming at the BBC and beyond, with a passion for storytelling and public service that leave a lasting legacy,” Davie said.“For nearly 60 years Alan championed originality, risk-taking and artistic ambition. From Arena to Imagine, from commissioning groundbreaking drama to giving emerging voices a platform, his influence is woven into the fabric of British cultural life.“He believed profoundly in the BBC’s role as a home for creativity, curiosity and the arts – accessible to all.”Davie paid tribute to Yentob’s “unforgettable presence”. “Engaging, witty and endlessly curious, he brought energy and warmth to every conversation. He was generous with his time, fierce in his convictions, and full of joy in the work of others.“To work with Alan was to be inspired and encouraged to think bigger. He had a rare gift for identifying talent and lifting others up – a mentor and champion to so many across the worlds of television, film and theatre.”Tributes were paid to Yentob from those who had worked with him. The actor and comedian Dawn French shared a picture of her and Jennifer Saunders with the late broadcaster on X, saying: “We’ve lost a tip top chap.”“Our advocate from the start,” she added.In a post on Bluesky, pop group Pet Shop Boys – who were the subject of one of Yentob’s Imagine documentaries – described him as “a legend in British TV, responsible for some of the BBC’s finest programmes”.And the comedian David Baddiel described him as a “king of TV”.In a video on Instagram, the BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Amol Rajan described Yentob as “such a unique and kind man: an improbable impresario from unlikely origins who became a towering figure in the culture of postwar Britain”.He added: “Modern art never had a more loyal ally. His shows were always brilliant, often masterpieces, sometimes seminal. So much of Britain’s best TV over five decades came via his desk. That was public Alan. In private, he was magnetic, zealous and very funny, with a mesmerising voice and mischievous chuckle. He oozed fortitude until the very last.“He had his foibles and failures, but Alan Yentob was one of the most generous, influential, singular, passionate, supportive, creative and loved men of his generation. I commend his spirit to the living.”Yentob was born in London in 1947 into an Iraqi Jewish family. He grew up in Didsbury, Greater Manchester, until he was 12 and studied law at the University of Leeds, where he became heavily involved in drama.When he joined the BBC World Service in 1968 he was the corporation’s only non-Oxbridge graduate of that year.Yentob profiled and interviewed a wide range of important cultural and creative figures over the years, including David Bowie, Charles Saatchi, Maya Angelou and Grayson Perry.His famous 1975 Omnibus feature, Cracked Actor, about Bowie, showed the drug-affected star opening up to him in the back of a limousine at an “intensely creative” but “fragile” time, Yentob later recalled.Yentobstepped down as BBC creative directorin 2015 after more than a decade in the position, after scrutiny over his role as chair of trustees of the charity Kids Company. He faced claims he tried to influence BBC coverage of the charity, but he always insisted there was no conflict of interest and he did not abuse his position.But in the years that followed, he continued to make many more programmes for the BBC, and was appointed a CBE in 2024 for services to the arts and media.Explore more on these topicsAlan YentobBBCTelevisionTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

This can mean providing everything from smaller things like IV drips for cancer patients, or Dyson fans for cancer patients, to the more advanced use of state-of-the-art mammogram machines.”Duffy added: “We are incredibly humbled by the sisterhood of Marilyns who gathered in Donabate this morning for women’s cancer care. Marilyn’s Mater Paddle may seem on the surface like just a fun, Hollywood-themed dip but it’s so much more. It’s a paddle with a purpose and every splash and every donation made is helping us support women on their cancer journey in the Mater hospital.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandMarilyn MonroeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Standing beside them, dressed in black, wasElon Musk, billionaire ally of Donald Trump and head of his government efficiency drive.“Elon is from South Africa – I don’t want to get Elon involved,” the US president told his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa,during a discussionabout crime against white farmers. “He actually came here on a different subject: sending rockets to Mars. He likes that better.”Musk’s silence during the fraught hour-long meeting was a small but telling reminder of his shift in Trump’s orbit. He remains close to the president and welcome in the West Wing. He also paid a second visit to the Pentagon this week. But a relationship that many forecast would end in anexplosive collision of egosseems instead to be undergoing an inexorable tapering off.On Monday, the Politico websitepublished an analysisunder the headline “Why has Elon Musk disappeared from the spotlight?” It found a sharp drop in the number of times that Trump posted about Musk on his Truth Social platform, from an average of four times a week in February and March to zero since the start of April.Move fast and destroy things: 100 chaotic days of Elon Musk in the White HouseRead moreIn February, Politico said, Trump’s fundraising operation invoked Musk in fundraising emails almost every day, with one message reading: “I love Elon Musk! The media wants to drive us apart, and it’s not working. He’s great.” But such mentions abruptly halted in early March, with the exception of one email in May advertising a “Gulf of America” hat that Musk had worn.In addition, White House officials no longer fill their social media feeds with Musk-related content. Reporters seldom ask about him at the White House press briefing. Members of Congress are giving his name a wide berth.Musk seems to be taking the hint. This week, the Tesla chief executive confirmed that he had reduced his role as the unofficial head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to just two days a week, and will alsocut his political spendingsubstantially – the latest public signal that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.It is a dramatic shift from the first weeks of Trump’s second term, when Musk attended the inauguration, was a constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, appeared alongside Trump in the Oval Office andgave a joint interviewon Fox News full of mutual admiration. Doge dominated media headlines as it took a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy.It seemed that Trump was dazzled by the world’s richest person, who sends rockets into space and spent at least $250m to support his election campaign last year. In March, the president even turned the White House south lawn into atemporary Tesla showroom, displaying five of the electric vehicles and promising to buy one himself.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and his son X Ã† leave the US Capitol in Washington DC on Wednesday.Photograph: Will Oliver/EPABut the polls told their own story. Last month,a national survey by Marquette University Law Schoolfound approval of how Musk is handling his work at Doge at 41% with disapproval at 58%. About 60% of those polled had an unfavourable view of Musk himself, compared with 38% who were favourably disposed to him.Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of Congress who has known Musk for more than a decade, commented: “As his numbers declined, so did Trump’s interest. Trump discards people when their ratings fall and it’s very transactional. It’s nothing more than an initial fascination and a sense of being discarded.”Khanna, whose congressional district sits in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, had predicted from the outset that Musk was not going to last more than four or five months: “I said he’s going to get frustrated, exhausted and Washington will win – not him – in terms of how the town works.”At that time, Khanna was hoping that Doge would make cuts at the Pentagon. Instead, it flouted the constitution to slash the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service and other targets.“I said there’s no way he’s going to get anywhere close to $2tn of cuts; he didn’t even get close to a trillion; it’s about $81bn. He learned the lesson that a lot of very successful business leaders learn, that democracy is much tougher than they imagine and doesn’t bend to their will,”Khanna said.Indeed, Musk continues to hit roadblocks. On Wednesday, the US Institute of Peaceretook control of its headquartersafter a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Doge was illegal. On Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco said Trump cannot restructure and downsize the US government without the consent of Congress and that she would probably extend her ruling blocking federal agencies from implementing mass layoffs.Even so, Doge has already enacted deep cuts to the workforce and spending and, in some cases, sought to shutter entire agencies, causing untold damage to the fabric of government.For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) “is not ready” for next month’s start of the hurricane season, according to an internal agency reviewreported by CNN. The disaster relief agency, which employs more than 20,000 workers, has lost roughly 30% of its full-time staff to layoffs and Doge buyouts.Khanna warned: “We’re going to be living with the consequences for years to come because unfortunately they’ve managed to totally destroy USAID, they’ve destroyed NIH [the National Institutes of Health], they’ve destroyed FDA [the Food and Drug Administration], they’ve destroyed EPA [the Environmental Protection Agency], they’ve hollowed out so much of the state department and it’s going to take a generation to rebuild.“I’m hoping that the damage will stop. We have to see what will continue but hopefully there’ll be no more sledgehammer to these institutions.”Even conservatives who believe in downsizing government share the concerns.Rick Tyler, a political strategist who has worked on Republican campaigns, said: “What they’re trying to do is make the government smaller, which I applaud, but they are not making it more efficient because there has been no vision, no plan to actually make the government operate with fewer people and less money.There is no redesign. This is just slash and burn.”Tesla, which is the major source of Musk’s wealth, has suffered significant brand damage and lost sales due to his political work, particularly with Trump. He has also expressed support for the far-right, anti-immigration AfD party in Germany. Tesla dealerships have become scenes of protest and vandalism in the US and beyond.It may be that Musk met his political Waterloo in Wisconsin. His spending of at least $3m helped make Wisconsin’s supreme court racethe most expensive of its kindin US history. He even made a personal appearance in Green Bay the weekend before the election wearing a cheesehead hat – popular with fans of the NFL’s Green Bay Packers – and personally handed out cheques for $1m to supporters.View image in fullscreenMusk speaks at a town hall on 30 March in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He spent $3m on a judicial election his favoured candidate lost by 10 points.Photograph: Jeffrey Phelps/APBut the candidate he backed lost by 10 percentage points. Democrats had used his intervention to successfully mobilise voters in an election dubbed “People vs Musk”.This week, Musk told Bloomberg’s Qatar Economic Forum in Doha: “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future.” The Wisconsin Democratic party chair, Ben Wikler,told the Associated Press: “The people have won. The biggest funder in Republican politics is taking his toys and going home.”Evidently, Musk and his chainsaw have become a political liability for Republicans seeking re-election in next year’s midterms. Democrats in races across the country are expected to use Musk asa political boogeyman in attack adson their opponents.Tyler observed: “The polling numbers, Trump suffering politically, which would hurt his party, which is going to hurt his agenda, caused enough strife that I’m sure he heard from enough members to say, could we just not talk about Elon Musk any more?”Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, added: “It was a trial balloon on how they would reduce federal employees. If it worked and people thought it was great, maybe they would keep going with or without Musk, but they used him as the front person for it and the punching bag. When it backfired, they cut him loose. Not surprising at all.“There is nobody that you can sincerely believeDonald Trumpthinks is important to his popularity or his standing in a positive way because he believes he generates all that himself. And I don’t think he’s wrong about that. But if you become a liability, you’re gone pretty quickly.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His next door neighbour and close friend Khobaib Hussain had already been working at Hero Couriers for a month. The name seemed appropriate. Therewassomething heroic about the work they did. Ali and Hussain were hired to drive around the country reuniting airline passengers with lost property. The pay was great, too – £100 a shift, cash in hand. It seemed too good to be true.So it proved.Hero Couriers was a frontfor Operation Pesage, an undercover police operation.When Ali arrived at Hero Couriers in Birmingham at about 7.15am in his Seat Leon, he discovered there were double yellow lines and nowhere to park. His manager Vincent told him he’d park the car for him in the lock-up, as he’d been doing for Hussain. Ali happily handed over his car keys.View image in fullscreen(Clockwise from top left) Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain, Tahir Aziz and Mohibur Rahman.Composite: undefined/Guardian Design; Supplied; hudiemm/Getty ImagesVincent, like the other two men working at Hero Couriers, was an undercover cop using an alias. At 8.45am, MI5 officers arrived to insert an audio bugging device into the car. They found a drawstring JD Sports bag sticking out under the driver’s seat. It contained a “partially constructed” pipe bomb – a section of narrow pipe half full of explosive powder bolted to live shotgun cartridges. And there was more: an unfired 9mm bullet; a magazine attached to an air pistol with tape; and a meat cleaver with the word “kafir” (unbeliever) scratched across it.A year later, in August 2017, four men, including Ali and Hussain,were jailed for life at the Old Baileyfor plotting a terrorist attack. The judge, Mr Justice Globe, said he was satisfied it was only because of the work of undercover police and the security services that a terrorist attack “involving a considerable loss of life” had been stopped.After the verdict, the renowned lawyerGareth Peirce, who represented Ali and Hussain, did something she’d never done before. She issued a public statement questioning the jury. “We register our unqualified respect for the system we have of trial by jury in this country,” she said. “But jurors can on occasion get things wrong.”Peirce is famous for successfully fighting miscarriage of justice cases, representing Gerry Conlon ofthe Guildford Four,and alsothe Birmingham Six, who had their terrorism convictions overturned in 1989 and 1991 respectively. She was appalled by the verdict in this case, saying it reminded her of the 1970s, when innocent Irish people were being framed for terrorism offences – only now it was Muslims. That’s when she started referring to the men as the Birmingham Four, a deliberate echo of the previous wrongful convictions.The trip to Pakistan and the courier jobIt all started six years earlier, in August 2011. That was when Hussain and Ali first got into trouble. After being radicalised by local Islamists in Birmingham, they decided to join a military training camp in Pakistan. Hussain was a 19-year-old law student; Ali a stuttering 23-year-old who had been on the special educational needs register at school.As soon as the boys arrived in Pakistan, they panicked. Their parents rang to ask where they were. They told them everything and said they wanted to come home. Their parents told them not to do anything stupid and arranged flights for them. Three days later, they were back in Birmingham. They seemed to have got away with it.Three months later, the police raided their homes and they were arrested. Mariam, the oldest of Hussain’s four sisters, says it was the most terrifying day of her life. “It was horrifying. We were so young, and we’d not got a criminal record, but we were all treated like criminals. It took a massive toll on us.” Hussain and Ali pleaded guilty to preparing for terrorist acts and were sentenced to 40 months in prison. The judge, Mr Justice Henriques, acknowledged the pair, “took the decision not to proceed with terror training and … realised what a shocking mistake you had made”.The two men were released in 2015. Mariam says Hussain was determined to rebuild his life, but it soon became clear what a struggle this would be. His conviction meant he couldn’t continue his law degree at the University of Wolverhampton. His bank account was closed. When prospective employers found out about his conviction, they wanted nothing to do with him. “You can’t live a normal civilian life,” Mariam says. “Every door was closing.”So when Hero Couriers got in touch, he couldn’t believe his luck. Hussain had put his CV online, saying he was looking for work and had a clean driving licence. For the first month, everything appeared to go well. But his sister’s car, which he drove to work, had been bugged. After four weeks, the police team appeared to get impatient. They were convinced Hussain was up to no good, but he had given nothing away.That is when Ali was invited to work for them, too. Remarkably, on his very first day the pipe bomb and weapons were discovered in his car. The two men were arrested and held in custody.Policebelieved they were in this together. After all, both men had travelled to the training camp in 2011 and been convicted.On the same day, two more men were arrested in Stoke. Mohibur Rahman had met Ali and Hussain in prison. Rahman had also beenconvicted of a terror offence in 2012after pleading guilty to the possession of an al-Qaida publication with terrorist content. The fourth man, Tahir Aziz, had only recently got to know Rahman. A large samurai-style sword was found by the side of the driver’s seat of his car. Police captured an image of the four men walking in a park five days before they were charged.Operation Pesage was created on a hunch, that Khobaib Hussain and Naweed Ali were a threat to public safety, having already been convicted of a terror offence. The other two, Rahman and Aziz, were identified by the police later as co-conspirators. If the men were rightfully convicted, Operation Pesage may have saved many lives. If they were wrongfully convicted, there may well be police officers who still feel it saved lives because Hussain and Ali had travelled to a training camp in Pakistan. But there was no suggestion in 2011 that the two men ever wanted to attack a British target. They say their dream was to help overthrow the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, because, as Hussain put it: “My view was, and is, that Assad has committed genocide by dropping chemical weapons on the population.”View image in fullscreenA police handout of an imitation handgun with an empty magazine taped to it that was found in Naweed Ali’s car.Photograph: West Midlands Police/PAThe trial began in March 2017 and lasted four and a half months. The jury was told about Hussain, Ali and Rahman’s previous terror convictions. The undercover officer Vincent was the main prosecution witness, giving evidence over 15 days behind a screen, including 12 days of cross-examination. The jury was introduced to the concept of “mindset evidence” – evidence based on the defendants’ state of mind, mainly derived from what was found on their devices. They heard how Ali, Hussain and Rahman often communicated with a larger group of about 30 people through the encrypted Telegram app. The prosecution showed that they shared content about violence across the Muslim world and hatred towards the west, praising men who had laid down their lives for Allah on foreign battlefields.It argued that this reflected a terrorist mindset, but the men said they bore no hostility to the west.The Three Musketeers and TelegramOn 11 August, 15 days before the JD Sports bag was found in Ali’s car, Hussain messaged him and said: “Make new group… me u n Mohib only.” The encrypted Telegram chat was called The Three Musketeers Group, represented by a cartoon of the characters from the 1993 Disney film. They spoke to each other about visions of heaven, how guilty they felt at having done so little while others made real sacrifices. Days before their arrest, Ali and Hussain made an overnight trip to Rahman’s home in Stoke. He messaged to tell them not to bring their phones, but to use pay-as-you-go handsets he had bought on eBay for the three of them. By now, the prosecution argued, the Musketeers were set on wreaking terrible damage.View image in fullscreenNaweed Ali and Khobaib Hussain.Composite: Guardian Design; Supplied;  hudiemm/Getty ImagesMuch of the mindset evidence hinged on phone messages sent the night before they were arrested. The men chatted by text about a National Geographic documentary called The Liquid Bomb Plot, about the surveillance operation that prevented a mass transatlantic terror attack in 2006. Rahman posted a link to the film; Ali’s browsing history showed he was searching “liquid bomb plot”. Ali posted to the group: “May Allah make it easy for us.” Rahman told his friends, “I feel so guilty. Look how weak I’ve become. I can’t even make a sacrifice as little as my PS4 [games console].” Hussain texted: “What are we doing, akhi [my brother]? Sitting here, working, and that’s it.” He added. “Nothing happening – we just talk. We gotta do something.” The prosecution argued that Tahir Aziz was brought into the plot right at the end by Rahman.There was no talk of a plot. Rather than being men of action, they appeared to be men of inactionBut the defence argued that the prosecution had joined unconnected dots to create a fake narrative. They said there was no evidencethat they would go on to do something. Or what that something could have been. There was no talk of a plot. No mention of bombs, guns or gunpowder. Rather than being men of action, they appeared to be men of inaction. In fact, many of the messages they sent each other suggested apathy and uselessness, and a comic self-awareness about it – they couldn’t even sacrifice their games console for Allah, while others sacrificed their lives. They even joked about their inadequacy, comparing Ali with one of the useless characters from the satirical film Four Lions.At the Old Bailey, the undercover police gave evidence behind screens. They described how the fake courier group was set up, how they bugged Hussain’s car, how MI5 arrived just in time to find the deadly bag of explosives and weapons in Ali’s car.The undercover officers insisted they had not been in touch with each other throughout the trial. But the prosecution was forced to disclose an astonishing trail of communication. The police initially insisted phone messages had been deleted. After the defence said they had access to experts who could recover them, the prosecution produced more than 1,000 “deleted” texts between Vincent, his fellow undercover officers Andy and Haji and their unit, going back to Hussain’s recruitment a month before the raid and continuing through the trial. Vincent texted his boss during the lunch break on the first day he was being cross-examined, but he insisted it was about a personal matter and not the evidence. Vincent and Andy also met at a service station and layby during the trial. The defence said that officers from the unit perjured themselves andfabricated evidence in court, alleging that Vincent had planted the incriminating evidence in Ali’s car. In his summing up, Justice Globe said: “Vincent said that he had an unblemished career in law enforcement. He said he had never been investigated, disciplined or prosecuted for any criminal offence in his career. He took exception to the allegation that he had committed the criminal offences of planting evidence, concocting evidence and committing perjury.”The police texts and DNA evidenceThe officers were old-timers working for the Counter Terrorism Unit of West Midlands Police, whose SeriousCrimeSquad had been disbanded in 1989 after a series of set-ups, cover-ups and forced confessions. The exchanges are brazen. Before giving evidence, Vincent texted his boss to say: “I’m even more determined to put in an Oscar performance when I get in that box.” In another message, he writes: “We are getting older … but not too old to twirl them and put them away for a long time,” signing off with a winking emoji.VINCENT: I’m even more determined to put in an Oscar performance when I get in that box.Vincent texts his fellow undercover officer Andy, who is about to retire, and says he hopes his leaving card gives him a laugh. Andy replies: “Not as much as reading your statement earlier!!! Joke joke joke …” In court, Stephen Kamlish KC, defending Ali, read out Vincent’s “farewell” text to Andy, in which he mentioned how much he was going to miss him as a colleague: “So you wanker … U leave me with a load of fucking wet wiped nob heads who don’t know how to put a job together wipe arses or cover tracks … Wanker … Miss you.”From the recovered messages, it appears Vincent has psychic powers. A month before the MI5 findings, he predicts something pertinent will be found in a car. Then, just before the MI5 officers arrive, he tells his boss “they will look and photograph anything”, even though there is no reason to anticipate finding anything. At 8.19am that day, he tells Haji, who is away from the depot, that there “has been a development” and he shouldn’t return immediately – but the MI5 officers hadn’t even arrived by then, never mind made their discovery.VINCENTWe are getting older … but not too old to twirl them and put them away for a long time.A major difficulty for the prosecution case appeared to be connecting the bag to the other three defendants. The police had suggested it was the same JD Sports bag Hussain had regularly taken to work, but it turned out his bag was black and white and this one was coloured. The prosecution had also hoped to show the jury evidence that Hussain’s DNA was on the weaponry in the bag. But this evidence was initially ruled out. Three months into the trial, a new ruling allowed the evidence to be put forward, and now the jury saw why it was so controversial.Among the messages that had been deleted by the police officers was an elliptical one from Vincent sent a month after the JD Sports bag had been found, saying: “It’s a sticky tape story – you were right.” It appeared to be a reference to sticky tape that was found binding the magazine to the gun, but its meaning was opaque. However, when the prosecution finally presented their DNA evidence, another reading became clear. Hussain’s DNA was found on the adhesive side of the sticky tape. But so, surprisingly, was that of his sister, Aisha, who owned the car he drove to work. In fact, most of the DNA evidence belonged to Aisha, who was never charged. The defence said there was a simple reason for this – that Hussain had been framed. It suggested that the DNA had been obtained by pressing the adhesive side of the tape to the steering wheel of the car owned by Aisha and driven by Hussain or to tissues (later found in the incriminating bag) from the glove compartment.VINCENTSo you wanker … U leave me with a load of fucking wet wiped nob heads who don’t know how to put a job together wipe arses or cover tracks … Wanker … Miss you.The defence waited for the case to be thrown out. But it wasn’t.What nobody could have anticipated was the febrile atmosphere in the country and in court. During the 2017 trial, four terrorist attacks occurred in England: five people were killed on Westminster Bridge on 22 March, the day the trial started; 22 people were killed and more than 200 injured in the Manchester Arena bombing on 22 May; eight people were killed on London Bridge on 3 June; and one person was killed and 12 others injured in Finsbury Park on 19 June. All but the final crime were committed by Muslims.The judge warned the jury to ignore what was happening in the outside world, but this was easier said than done. One day a jury member turned up late. She told the judge she had seen a man reading the Qur’an on her train into court, and feared he was a terrorist, so she got off and waited for the next train.At times, the trial resembled a farce. In July, a jury member was discharged after asking the court usher on more than one occasion to find out whether one of the police officers (who wasn’t undercover) was single, after another juror told her she found him attractive. The juror who had made it clear she was interested in the officer was not discharged, even though the defence argued this undermined the impartiality of the jury and that the entire jury should be discharged. Justice Globe said: “I have had to ask myself if it is so important that I should not allow you as a group to continue considering this case.” He did allow them to continue.Everything about the case was mired in controversy. Barristers for the defence, Kamlish and Rajiv Menon KC, defending Hussain, alleged that Justice Globe’s summing up of Vincent’s evidence was unfair. Menon told the judge: “In our submission, this deadly combination of bias, distortion and omission in this case crosses the line into what is impermissible comment on the evidence.” Justice Globe responded: “I reject all defence propositions. I dismiss the applications to discharge the jury or to alter the summing up in relation to Vincent’s evidence.”On 2 August 2017, the jury returned a guilty verdict, and all four men were given life sentences – Ali, Hussain and Rahman a minimum of 20 years in prison, Aziz a minimum of 15 years. Justice Globe said the men were gripped by a “long-standing, radical, violent ideology”. In his sentencing remarks, he said: “But for the intervention of the counter-terrorism unit of West Midlands police and the security services,” he believed there would have been, “terrorist acts in this country using at the very least the explosives and/or one or more bladed weapons.”The parallels with the Birmingham SixAt the top of a terraced building in Camden town is the office of Gareth Peirce. On the shelves are numerous files documenting many of the great miscarriages of justice and state scandals of the past half century – the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six;Orgreave miners beatenby south Yorkshire police; Jean Charles de Menezes killed by the Metropolitan police;Moazzam Begg,who was detained in Guantánamo Bay.She looks remarkably unchanged from how she appeared almost 36 years ago, when theGuildford Fourwere acquitted (Peirce was played by Emma Thompson in the 1993 film, In the Name of the Father). Same sea-blue eyes, bobbed hair, long black dress and boots. And the same grasp of detail.For Peirce, this case is personal. In many of her other battles, she became involved post-conviction to clear up the mess. With the Birmingham Four, she was there from the start. “This was our trial. It was on our watch. It’s our continuing responsibility, and they shouldn’t have been convicted.”Peirce says she realised she was dealing with a familiar pattern of behaviour when she discovered the officers had been using notebooks and had handwritten their notes. One text reveals that a week after the arrests, Vincent’s boss texted him to say: “We have agreed … that you will write your pocketbook for Pesage, not type, hope that helps.” This was years after West Midlands police had computerised their notes. Kamlish pointed out in court that Vincent and Andy were the only two undercover officers in the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit to have used them since January 2015.She’d seen this before, when the same police force investigated theBirmingham Sixin the 1970s. “I said: ‘I know this!’” She raps her fingers on the desk. “I’m saying to our team: ‘Look at this,look at this, we’ve seen it before.’ The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad used notebooks to record alleged contemporaneous interviews and what led to their downfall was the elementary concept of, if you write something and rip out that page, there’s an indent of what you originally wrote.” She rips out an imaginary page. “That’s what ended the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four in the end.” The final page of Vincent’s notebook was missing. “He was told, ‘It’s OK to write up your notebook now a week later’, but his evidence is that his notebook had been created day by day as a log. Yet it was all in the same ink, continuous. It was complete nonsense. And then he got the date wrong. So he had one entry the day before it actually happened!’’Mariam listens as Peirce talks. I ask Mariam why Hussain and Ali went out to Pakistan in the first place. “There was a lot of unrest in the Muslim community about Syria,” she says, “similar to what we’ve just experienced with Palestine. If you’re practising and you’re from the religion of Islam, it doesn’t matter if you’re not blood related, you’re cast as one nation, and you feel that empathy for one another. But when that trial concluded, the judge said these were young men who made the wrong decision and were influenced by older people.”She says the trouble is that so many people seem to believe that, even if the police operation was a set-up, it’s acceptable, because her brother and Ali had gone out to Pakistan in the first place. “Everyone makes mistakes, everyone’s human. They were really young at the time. It feels like double standards – Muslims aren’t given a second chance.”Did they get to the training camp? “They got to the first stop and then one of them rang home, and they fell apart,” Peirce says. “The grandfather of one of them had to bring them back because they were so frightened and had got themselves in such a mess.”Peirce seems fond of the men she’s representing, but she doesn’t mince her words about them. “There was a pecking order in the Pakistan trial because there were older men who were trying to get involved in something more serious [three of the men were given life sentences for plotting suicide-bomb attacks] and then some were trying to siphon off money that had been raised for good causes, and then right at the bottom you had these chumps!”View image in fullscreenTop: Mohibur Rahman and Tahir Aziz with his nephew.Composite: Guardian Design; Supplied;  hudiemm/Getty ImagesI ask Mariam about the evidence that the four men were planning a terrorist attack in 2016. She insists it’s nonsense. Take the Telegram app. “I’ve got Telegram. It’s a social app like WhatsApp. And in terms of content that’s shared in the joint app, it’s content that’s shared quite widely.” What she means is that you’d find many orthodox Muslim men saying similar things about feeling bad that they’re not supporting fellow Muslims abroad.At the trial, lyrics were quoted from nasheeds (songs focusing on Islamic values) that the men were listening to in a similar way that drill music has been used in the prosecution of young black men in Britain. “Khobaib and Naweed didn’t even speak Arabic,” Mariam says. “They didn’t understand what they were listening to.”The unlikely coupleNaweed Ali declined to give evidence, citing his stutter and lack of confidence. This proved disastrous. After all, the case began with him. The bag was found in his car. It meant he never challenged the charges against him, first-hand. Much of the mindset evidence could be accounted for relatively simply, but the “liquid bomb trial” references proved difficult, particularly as Ali didn’t take to the stand to say why he had been searching for it. Later in the trial, Hussain explained that on the night before their arrest the three men had been chatting about how they had watched The Liquid Bomb Plot while they were in prison. He said Rahman wanted to watch the film again because he had met some of the plotters in prison. Rahman’s reference to feeling guilty, Hussain said, was because he felt he should be financially helping prisoners he had been jailed with and their families more than he was.When Rahman gave evidence, he provided a similar account.As for saying, “We’ve got to do something … just nothing really happening”, Hussain insisted that was nothing to do with any plot, it was about the general rut the three of them were in – their failure to help other prisoners and their families financially as they had pledged to; their lack of marriage prospects; their failure to find fulfilling jobs. Although he was pleased to be doing shifts for Hero Couriers, it was hardly the law career he’d anticipated. “I didn’t feel I was progressing … I wasn’t able to move on like others in my family,” he told the court.View image in fullscreenWest Midlands Police handout of a cleaver that was found in Naweed Ali’s car, with the wordkafirscratched on the blade.Photograph: West Midlands Police/PAMariam says Hussain and Ali have been monstered by the media, and the reality couldn’t be more different. She describes them as an unlikely but lovable odd couple – Hussain, smart and academic; Ali, older and so unsure of himself. “I think what connected them is they’re very simple souls.” She talks about the innocence of Ali – the way he dressed, she says, is almost a metaphor. “Naweed wears Islamic dress – a thawb. You can’t hide anything in a thawb. Everything would just stick out. For me, that’s a reflection of his personality. He is so pure.” But that’s not how the jury saw it.Lawyer Matt Foot says he will never forget the day he was called out to represent Hussain and Ali after they were arrested. Not only did Hussain and Ali know nothing about the offences they were alleged to have committed, he says, nor did the police officers interviewing them. “It’s the scariest situation I’ve ever been in. It became apparent that the police who were interviewing did not know the provenance of the key exhibits that were being put to Naweed and Khobaib, which formed the basis of the whole allegation.”Back then, Foot, co-director of miscarriage of justice charity Appeal, was working for the law firm Birnberg Peirce. For two weeks, Hussain and Ali were interrogated by the police. Foot had previously represented them when they were charged after travelling to Pakistan. This time though, he says, they didn’t have a clue why they had been arrested. “I saw their reaction independently of each other and that helped to confirm it. It was like something out of The Trial. Completely Kafkaesque.” He remembers them being shown a photo of the meat cleaver with the word “kafir” scratched into it. “I asked the officers who found this and when, and there was no answer.”At that point neither he nor Hussain and Ali had been told Hero Couriers was a fake company. “I went to check out the place, and there was nothing there,” Foot says. “There’s no company. I’m asking people who work in the street have they seen anything and none of them want to get involved. It’s like: what is going on here?”The samurai swordOn Friday 26 August 2016, Tahir Aziz had just finished his shift at Primark as a retail assistant and collected his children from school. Aziz’s life was largely divided between work, his kids and the mosque. But the mosque was relatively new to his life. He had spent much of his life as a secular Muslim, and had two children he adored with his non-Muslim wife. It was only since they had separated that he had found comfort in religion.The children split their time between their mother and Aziz, who lived with his parents. He tried to work around them. So he’d end his shift at Primark in time to pick them up from school, then in the evening he worked as a delivery driver for a local takeaway.On this particular evening, he stopped off at the petrol station to fuel up. As he stepped out on to the forecourt, he was pinned against the wall by police and arrested under the Terrorism Act. “He didn’t know what was happening,” his sister Nazreen tells me. “He said: ‘I haven’t done anything.’ We didn’t see him until he was in court months later. He was taken straight to Belmarsh. It was so shocking.”We are talking by video link. Nazreen, who lives in Stoke, starts crying. She still hasn’t recovered from the shock. Nor has her family. “Dad was a kidney patient. His kidneys were functioning at about 40% and when my brother was arrested they dropped significantly. He got to a stage where 5% of his kidneys were working.” She tries to speak, but no words come out. Her father died in July 2018. “It was too much for my dad. Tahir was the son my dad relied on. He used to take him to hospital, look after him, and give him money towards the running of the house.”Aziz was the second eldest of seven children, with four sisters and two brothers. Nazreen, the oldest sibling, a former phlebotomy supervisor who has retrained as a lawyer, says all three boys struggled at school in an Islamophobic environment. They were provoked, got into trouble, and one by one they were expelled before their GCSEs. After Aziz was kicked out of school, Nazreen says he started hanging out with two men who were a bad influence. All three were sentenced to five years in prison for selling drugs. He was only 19 or 20 when he was convicted. When he was released, he settled down to life as a hard-working father and didn’t get in trouble again until that moment on the forecourt in 2016.Aziz, who was 38 when convicted, is another puzzle in the story of the Birmingham Four. He had only got to know Rahman in the months before his arrest and had only just met Hussain and Ali. Even the prosecution struggled to explain his involvement. He was clearly not one of the “Three Musketeers”. Unlike the other three, he was not under surveillance. The prosecution argued that although he was a latecomer, he was a co-conspirator and that the sword found in his car pointed to his guilt. Aziz said it was an ornamental Japanese sword he had bought from a sports shop as a deterrent to would-be attackers he encountered while delivering takeaways.The prosecution pointed out Aziz had downloaded extremist material, including the al-Qaida English language magazine Inspire, which featured an article on how to make a bomb. Aziz said he had deleted it as soon as he had seen what it contained. Kamlish told the jury: “You may despise the things they were looking at online, but it does not mean they were plotting to kill.”Although the jury was ordered to ignore the political climate, Nazreen believes it was impossible. Her brother and the other defendants, “were surrounded by these incidents and they were facing a terrorist trial. Even though the judge said not to take any of the matters happening outside into consideration, you can’t stop a human mind from believing that. It’s human nature to think: if we release these men, maybe they will attack.”When she saw her brother in court, she couldn’t believe how different he looked. “He had always shaved his head and face or had a short beard. Now his hair and beard were long. They made him look like a terrorist by not allowing him to access a barber to have his beard or hair cut.” Had he wanted to cut his hair? “Yes, he did want to, and he wasn’t allowed,” she claims. “They wanted to show the jury, this is a person we have alleged is a terrorist and look at him.”In court, Hussain described Rahman as “paranoid”. Perhaps it’s not surprising he was paranoid. Rahman told the court that, since 2015, two MI5 officers called “Rob” and “Greg” had made a number of attempts to recruit him as an informant. Rahman said Rob told him he was interested in Ali and Hussain and handed him £200 in cash as an inducement to work for them. (Ali had also been approached, separately, without success.) Rahman told the court that he feared for his life from MI5, and this was why he had sent Ali and Hussain new phones and told them not to use their regular phones in each other’s company.The MI5 officers and the Court of AppealPeople who claim to have been unfairly convicted are granted an automatic right to apply for permission to appeal, and usually have to do so within 28 days of their conviction. In November 2018, the Birmingham Four’s appeal (founded on the judge’s refusal to discharge the jury or lift the anonymity order on the undercover officers, and his summing up of Vincent’s evidence) was rejected by the Court of Appeal.In its judgment, Lord Justice Holroyde said: “We have considered whether anything put before us casts doubt on the safety of the convictions. We are satisfied that there is nothing that does so. The jury by their verdicts plainly rejected that the evidence had been planted. Having done so there was ample circumstantial evidence against each of the accused to support the convictions.” Now the Birmingham Four had to look to theCriminal Cases Review Commission(CCRC) if they wanted to challenge their guilty verdict.The CCRC was formed in 1997 after a series of high-profile miscarriages of justice in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Guildford Four and theBirmingham Six. It was given new statutory powers to investigate alleged wrongful convictions and refer them back to the Court of Appeal when there were strong grounds.Miscarriages of justice had previously been dealt with by a Home Office department known as C3. Peirce was a fan of the CCRC in its early days. “At the beginning, the commissioners who were first appointed were strong, confident individuals who’d had successful careers in another field. There was an energy there, and the original commissioners had a motivation to get cases referred back.”That’s long gone now, she says. Today, the commission is underfunded, conservative, rarely uses its investigative powers and is unbelievably slow. Critics say that, rather than providing a gateway to justice, the CCRC acts as a gatekeeper for the Court of Appeal.In 2023,Andrew Malkinsonhad his conviction for rape overturned 14 years after first submitting grounds to appeal to the CCRC. Last week, Peter Sullivan had his conviction for the murder of 21-year-old Diane Sindalloverturned after spending 38 years in prison– thought to be the longest in British history that a person has been imprisoned before being cleared. The sentence was quashed after Sullivan applied to the CCRC again in 2021 and new forensics tests revealed that his DNA was not on samples preserved at the time. Sullivan first applied to the CCRC in 2008, asking the commission to look at DNA evidence that could exonerate him. Back then, testing was cruder, the CCRC was told by forensic scientists that they were unlikely to be able to recover useful DNA, and his application was rejected. The same testing technique led to his conviction being overturned 17 years later. Critics say if the CCRC had been more assertive or proactive, Sullivan would have been cleared years ago. On Friday, a committee of MPs published adamning reporton the CCRC calling on its chief executive, Karen Kneller, to resign. In January, its chair Helen Pitcher resigned after successive justice secretaries indicated that they hadlost confidencein her.In the case of the Birmingham Four,Gareth Peircebelieves they are hampered by all the evidence of police misconduct that came out at their trial. If it had emerged after the trial, she would have an easier job in convincing the CCRC to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal because the CCRC relies so heavily on “new” evidence in its considerations. “Every single thing that happened would have led to the case being reopened and the conviction quashed,” she says, “but because it all came out in a trial, the CCRC can say the jury heard all this and they convicted.”The commission can demand to see evidence that was not disclosed to the defence. Peirce is convinced this would provide even more proof of an unsafe conviction. “They have the power to find internal evidence of discussions and decisions within police departments, but all they’ve done so far is send preservation orders to different bodies to preserve their records.”At the end of the prosecution’s evidence, Peirce asked the judge to strip the undercover officers of their anonymity on the basis they had perjured themselves, most notably in saying they had not been in touch with each other throughout the court case. Justice Globe refused, rejecting the allegation of perjury. The police being undercover is a huge obstacle to justice, says Peirce. For example, if the defence had known Vincent’s real identity, it could have checked his spending history to see whether he had bought any of the items found in the bag, and tested his DNA and fingerprints to see if they matched that found on the tape. (The defence asked the prosecution to make both of these checks, but it refused.) In previous cases, Peirce has been able to investigate the history of officers she has suspected of corruption. Here, she is working in a vacuum.It’s more than a year since she submitted grounds for appeal to the CCRC on behalf of Ali and Hussain. “It’s like a thriller that explains everything – the dynamics of the trial, the jury’s reactions, the impact of the terror attacks. It’s got everything they need to know.” The problem is, Peirce says, the CCRC is ossified and takes years to reach a decision. “So my next task is: ‘I’m going to point you to what you can do – forget all the rest, I’ll just point you to X, Y, Z.’” She’s talking to me, but addressing the CCRC. “We’ve baked your cake. All you need is a crumb and you’ll find more than a crumb here.”Peirce and Mariam make a good team. “We know the CCRC have higher powers,” says Mariam. “They don’t need to be too fixated on new evidence. It’s just that this body chooses not to use those powers.’”“So the case has been presented in both ways,” Peirce continues. “We’ve said there’s enough here for you to just send it back. However, if you think there needs to be more, this is the more that didn’t come out, or this is the route to more.” When I ask what the more is, she becomes coy. “A couple of things I can’t tell you because they’re personal and they require consent, which we don’t have.”There’s another problem, Peirce says. Lack of popular support. Again, it’s familiar to her. She experienced it when she took on Irish cases decades ago. Now it’s the same with Muslims. And what further complicates matters is the previous convictions of the two men she’s representing. “We’re in a very tricky situation because the subject is terrorism. And if you’re a convicted terrorist there isn’t a great lot of sympathy there.” Her frustration is visceral. As far as she is concerned, she’s dealing with a blatant miscarriage of justice that is destroying the lives of four men and their families.I talk to Peirce soon after thedeath of Paddy Hill, a member of the Birmingham Six. She says it’s a reminder that history does repeat itself. “There are significant similarities between the Birmingham Six and Birmingham Four. The defendants were members of suspect communities, and evidence was fabricated with utter arrogance and self-justification by the police.” She refers to it as “noble cause corruption” – the belief that a group of people are dangerous and need to be taken out, with the ends justifying the means. “These undercover police are clearly corrupt and dishonest. Having defined themselves as being there for a purpose – to get suspects out of the way permanently – they have succeeded in doing so for decades.”Mariam exhales loudly, and says she is praying the CCRC does the right thing – and quickly. “Every second wasted is so precious,” she says.When asked to comment, West MidlandsPolicetold the Guardian: “In 2018, a full Court of Appeal examined the safety of these convictions in great detail and upheld the findings of the jury.”The Guardian asked the CCRC if it had ordered West Midlands Police and MI5 to hand over relevant documents that were not disclosed at the trial and whether there is a mechanism to speed up the review process. “I can confirm we have received applications on behalf of Mr Hussain, Mr Ali and Mr Aziz, and reviews are underway. It would be inappropriate to comment further while the reviews are ongoing,” a CCRC spokesperson said.View image in fullscreen‘They were monitoring him for months and didn’t find anything’ … Khobaib Hussein’s father, Shab.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianThe impact on the familiesIn Sparkhill, Birmingham, Hussain’s father Shab is watching the snooker, cheering on Ronnie O’Sullivan. He’s just finished his shift as a cab driver. In the kitchen, Hussain’s mother Nusrat is cooking up lamb and loki, cauliflower and potato, pakoras, bhajis and chapatis. Mariam and her husband Faisal join us. Then Ali’s brother Ghaf and his mother pop round from next door. Neither family can disguise their devastation.Around the dinner table they discuss all sorts – the mindset evidence, miscarriages of justice in general, Liverpool’s premier league title and who is the greatest snooker player ever.But inevitably it returns to the case of the four men, and in particular their two boys. Ali’s elderly mother Parveen, who doesn’t speak English, clasps her hands in prayer. Ghaf translates. “She’s saying: ‘Can you help us?’ We’ve had so much stress. My dad passed away while Naweed’s been in prison and Mum says he didn’t get a chance to see his father, and she’s worried he won’t get a chance to see her.”Nine years on, they still can’t get their heads around what happened. Ghaf boils it down. “Do they think Naweed is such an idiot that he’s going to go to work with a bomb in his car, and give them his keys?”“Who the hell would do that?” Shab says. “That’s the thing that gets me. Think about it. First shift!”Hussain phones while we’re eating. The family hangs on his every word. He tells them what he’s been up to – doing his shift in the workshop, assembling headphones for Virgin Atlantic; gym early evening; bang-up at 6.30pm. He talks about what he would like the world to know about his case. “I just want people to know that miscarriage of justices do happen and people can get wrongly convicted and lost in the system. People know what happened in my trial, but the narrative always gets spun in a way, depending on the verdict. So if you get found guilty they’ll paint you into a monster.”One reason he has found himself lost in the system is that the Ministry of Justice has made it so difficult for him to campaign against his conviction. The governor of the category A prison he is in rejected my request for a visit and the prison returned the letters I sent him.After the cache of deleted police messages resurfaced, Hussain says he was sure the case would be dropped. “If Vincent, the key witness for the police, is in contempt of court and we’ve shown that their evidence is fabricated, surely the case has to be dropped. Stephen Kamlish burst into the room and said: ‘That’s it lads, we’re going home.’ He was so excited. But then it dawned on me that I was looking at getting convicted because of the climate.”As Hussain talks to his family, it becomes obvious how aware he is of life passing him by. He says it’s his family and faith that are keeping him strong. “I know the truth always comes out in the end, and that keeps me going.” It’s not simply about recognising the innocence of the Birmingham Four, he adds, it’s equally important to address the behaviour of the police. “What about the guys who put us in jail? Unless there are proper repercussions for their actions, this kind of behaviour is going to carry on.”After he says his farewells, everybody looks at each other, deflated.“Don’t get me wrong, there are people with these ideologies,” Shab says. “If Khobaib had done something, I would say, yes, let him rot in there. But what boils my blood is all the evidence is there. They were monitoring him for months and didn’t find anything. At the end of the day, think about it, they’ve lost their life. Look at the family – what we have to suffer through. Over what?”"

InMickey 17, triple-Oscar-winnerBong Joon-ho’s recent sci-fi blockbuster, the comedian plays a man desperate to join a mission to colonise the ice planet Niflheim. The next thing he knows, he’s on the spaceship – inexplicably trussed up in a luxuriant pigeon suit and acting as the expedition leader’s lackey. Can Key shed any light on this turn of events?“No I can’t,” he says, decisively. He enquired about his character’s outfit during his first meeting with Bong. “And he laughed and didn’t answer.” On set, Key says he “shuffled over in my costume” and asked again. “And he laughed again.” At the premiere, theParasitedirector gave Key “a big hug, and then I said: ‘Just going back to this pigeon thing … ’ and he laughed again. I don’t think I’m going to ask him any more.”Despite not being privy to even the most basic information about his character, Key certainly made Pigeon Man his own. It’s difficult to describe his performance in the film, which stars Robert Pattinson, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo, as anything other than very Tim Key-y: it’s the velocity of his sentences, the raising of the eyebrows, the combination of boyish eccentricity, melting desperation and a tendency, whenpushed, towards bone-dry belligerence. This singular mode is the common denominator in the 48-year-old’s sprawling CV: present in everything from his criminally underrated sketch showCowardsto hisEdinburgh award-winning live actto his pitch-perfect stint as Alan Partridge’s Sidekick Simon.There is something ineffable about Key’s comedic presence – even a legend like Steve Coogan has admitted that upon meeting his future co-star he struggled to work out “why what he was doing was funny”. While the Partridge gig did give Key a profile boost, this unpinpointable idiosyncrasy has kept him a cult figure, even within British comedy. Now, improbably, it looks as if it might make him a mainstream global star.I’d just be shaking my head thinking: ‘The esteemed Hollywood actress is now talking about my poetry show with Tom Basden’View image in fullscreenTim Key.Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian; set design & props: Victoria Twyman; grooming: Neusa Neves using skincare from Shiseido Ginza, TokyoIt’s not just decorated directors who have become enamoured of Key (Bong recently described a collection of his poetry – which renders the surreal, the extreme and the utterly mundane in pithy yet jarringly prosaic verse – as “one of the most amazing things I’ve ever read”). America is cottoning on, too. The US’s embrace of offbeat UK comedy talent has been gathering steam for a while (those in particularly high demand include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Jamie Demetriou, Richard Gadd, Will Sharpe, Brett Goldstein and Richard Ayoade), but Key’s inordinately wry stylings seemed particularly unlikely to translate. Apparently, not the case. Key spent last autumn in LA filming The Paper, the much-anticipated sequel to the US version of The Office, in which he has a major role. Soon after, his new film The Ballad of Wallis Island premiered at Sundance to a standing ovation (“One of the more overwhelming things that’s happened to me”) and has since been released across the Atlantic to glowing reviews.Based on Key and his Cowards colleague Tom Basden’s 2007 Bafta-nominated short, the film sees reclusive lottery winner Charles (Key) pay his favourite musician, indie-folk has-been Herb McGwyer (Basden, who also wrote all the film’s legitimately beautiful songs), to play a gig on a tiny Welsh island. Unbeknown to McGwyer, Charles has also invited his ex-collaborator and old flame Nell Mortimer (Carey Mulligan) in an attempt to get the band back together. Key admits it’s a “quirk” that this deeply British film was released in the US first, but is “surprised and delighted” at its reception. So am I, considering it shouts out Monster Munch, Mick Hucknall and BBC 6 Music presenter Gideon Coe. Key is still unsure how many of the jokes will land, “because there’s no chance an American would laugh at any of those things”. Ultimately, though, the film’s quintessential Britishness – it also features Olympic levels of emotional constipation – “felt like a positive rather than a negative”. With that thought, he begins to doubt himself. “Maybe we’ve accidentally made a film thatonlyworks in America.”Time will soon tell. Key is now back on home turf, his local coffee shop in Kentish Town, north London, ahead of the film’s imminent UK release. It’s a scorching May day and he is dressed for it: T-shirt, shorts, bright stripy socks, colourful trainers. Softly spoken and given to sudden, bashful smiles, he is feeling “self-conscious” about chatting in the silence of the cafe’s informal co-working space, where he sometimes writes himself. On stage, Key’s alter ego is petulant, commanding and bemusingly elliptical. In real life, only the latter remains. Last night, he tells me, he went to seethe hit Gareth Southgate play Dear England, which he describes as “absolutely fine” and “not a problem” – a verdict that could be glowing, neutral or damning, I honestly have no idea.Generally, though, Key plays it straight. He certainly doesn’t have the same compulsion to crack jokes as his character Charles, who seems powerless to stop the stream of dubious puns and inane chatter that spools out of him as he tries to smooth things over between Herb and Nell. Yet, alongside this general buffoonery, Key manages to convey Charles’s gradually revealed grief with the utmost subtlety and poignancy, in what I tell him is quite an incredible dramatic performance. “Oh wow,” he whispers, drowning the compliment in absurdly intense embarrassment. Seriously, though, he does “think there’s less difference between comedy acting and [dramatic] acting than you’d think. It’s all about finding the truth.” Having spouted such a luvvie cliche, he puts his head in his hands. “Oh my God.”It’s easy to get blinded by the new. It’s also easy to take for granted a friend who’s really, really talentedView image in fullscreenTim Key.Photograph: David Vintiner/The GuardianKey began his comedy acting career on a strange but indisputably triumphant note. After graduating from the University of Sheffield, he moved back to his home city of Cambridge and successfully auditioned for the Footlights comedy troupe – without mentioning his lack of student status. His peers – including Mark Watson, Peep Show’s Sophie Winkleman and his future Cowards comrades – did eventually find out, but by that point he was indispensable; they ensured he was still able to perform in their 2001 Edinburgh fringe production, which was nominated for the festival’s newcomer award.In the intervening years, Key has worked steadily: there have beenRadio 4 shows, the sketch series, a sitcom (2022’s The Witchfinder), a double act calledFreezewith Basden, various Partridge iterations and myriad TV appearances. But his success has never felt like “a runaway thing” – at no point has he been “swept away” by a powerful industry tide and found himself “in a long-running sitcom or playing Lewis or something”. This means, at the end of every onscreen project, he still goes back to his solo work: thepoetry books, the live shows. There are upsides and downsides. “You never feel like you’ve lost your way creatively; you might have lost your way financially …”View image in fullscreenTim Key with Carey Mulligan in The Ballad Of Wallis Island.Photograph: Alistair Heap/Focus FeaturesA case in point: Key has spent recent months finishing his new book, LA Baby, a semi-fictionalised, poetry-peppered account of his time spent filming The Paper in Hollywood last year. He looks panicked when I bring up the show – a mockumentary set at a failing Midwestern newspaper – and insists The Paper itself is “not relevant” to the book. So let’s just say LA Baby is a hilarious and often dreamlike chronicle of Key’s mounting insecurities about his inability to fit into his costume, do an American accent and generally act on an unnamed big-budget TV series.Last September, Key arrived in LA for the first time, feeling “petrified”, stressed by the city’s ongoing heatwave and failure to cater for pedestrians (“I love walking around”). Living alone, he initially had no social circle and was only required on set half the week. The writing started as a “very enjoyable form of therapy” in the face of loneliness, clammy discombobulation and homesickness (the last one manifests in the book in imagined sightings of BBC news presenter Nicholas Witchell and an extended fantasy about an Only Fools and Horses cuckoo clock). It was a period that echoed his experience of the pandemic, when he started writing “to stay afloat” during months by himself in his north London flat: his anthology He Used Thought As a Wife covers Key’s time chugging beer, craving hugs and losing touch with reality during the first lockdown, interspersed with grotesque vignettes sending up governmental incompetence.Mercifully, his isolation in LA was far more short-lived: by the end of the three-month stint, he was filming more frequently, had befriended his castmates and connected with one or two English expat comedians he knew from back home “who generously introduced me to their circle of friends. By the end of it, I had quite a nice little group.”I can imagine myself on the outskirts of comedy trying to make friends with Alex Horne. I’ve definitely got it in me to fanboyIn The Ballad of Wallis Island, Key embodies another cartoonishly lonely character: Charles’s heartbreakingly solitary existence is best summed up in the image of him aggressively playing a solo game of swingball. Does Key consider isolation a recurring theme in his work? He seems doubtful. “I hadn’t noticed that. I don’t know. I don’t think those two things are linked. Maybe they are.” Does he find loneliness a creatively fertile state? “Dunno. Maybe. I think that’s more for you to say.” He doesn’t seem overly keen on analysing the prospect (or perhaps he’s just not a fan of introspecting in the company of journalists, which would be fair enough), yet it’s clear he does funnel his psyche into his work: he would be “interested” he says, to to re-read He Used Thought As a Wife, which he wrote during lockdown, “because I probably was going out of my mind, and it would be interesting to go back into it”.Charles, on the other hand, isn’t especially autobiographical. For a start, he’s an obsessive fan – a compulsion Key doesn’t share: he never had any comedy heroes, let alone musical ones. That said, in a different life he can imagine himself “on the outskirts of comedy trying to make friends with [Taskmaster co-host] Alex Horne”. Also, he did get starstruck bumping into ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton. “So I’ve definitely got it in me to fanboy.”Another person Key seems slightly starstruck by is his co-star Mulligan. He and Basden co-wrote the film during lockdown, and the Oscar nominee topped the list of dream Nells. Key happened to have her personal email address; a few years prior she’d asked him to host a fundraiser she was organising. He’d actually declined – MCing a big event being something he’d “find really, really hard to do”. Still, he took a punt. Mulligan was unexpectedly keen; it turned out she was a longtime admirer of Key and Basden’s work – specifically, the pair’s Radio 4 series, Tim Key’s Poetry Programme. “It’s a deep cut,” he nods, mystified. During their US press tour, Mulligan would sometimes reference the show. “And I’d just be shaking my head thinking: ‘This is insane: the esteemed Hollywood actress is now talking about my poetry show with Tom Basden.’”‘What an unpleasant man’: Alan Partridge interviews Steve CooganRead moreMulligan may be the headline name, but The Ballad of Wallis Island’s real charm patently stems from Key and Basden’s decades-honed dynamic. This is perhaps why its wholesome parting message – meaning over money, kindness over ego, the true and the good over the shallow and the starry – packs such a punch. For Key, the achievement of having made the film is inextricably bound up with that bond. The first time he was asked in an interview to pick his favourite scene, he chose one with Mulligan. The second time, one with Basden. But “I found it really difficult to say it – I got really emotional. It’s easy to get blinded by the new and the fun. It’s also easy to get complacent and take for granted a friend who’s really, really talented. Not everyone has that.”For all the lavish, baffling blockbusters, A-list co-stars and LA stints, making The Ballad of Wallis Island is proof of his longstanding good fortune – and a reminder “that the other, more famous people aren’t better than this person you had all along”.The Ballad of Wallis Island is in UK cinemas on 30 May."

I was 20 years old and working on the desk at a credit union as a teller. Management thought it was a wise idea to offer our customers a glass of champagne with their withdrawals that day, so I had been helping myself to a small glass of bubbly as I handed the customers one.By the end of the day I was unsurprisingly a bit tipsy and, when I balanced up the till, I realised I was $20 short. At the time, $20 was almost a week’s pay for me, or at least half a week’s pay, so it was a decent amount of money. I was sitting there feeling quite distressed, because if the till was down you had to make it up from your own wages – that was the deal. It meant I would have no money for the Christmas period.The kindness of strangers: we worried we’d have to sleep in our car when a lovely couple welcomed us inRead moreSuddenly there was a knock on the window, and I looked up to see a man who seemed desperate to come in. We normally didn’t let anyone in after we’d closed but the man kept knocking, so I eventually opened the door a crack to see what he wanted. When I did, he handed me the missing $20 note – he told me I’d overpaid him, so he’d spent half an hour travelling across town on Christmas Eve to return the money, knowing that my till would be out.It was a lovely thing to do, and it made a lot of difference to my outlook on life. It wasn’t just the money, it was the fact that he had gone to such effort to make sure that I wasn’t out of pocket, when it was entirely my fault anyway. The experience also meant that I’d never accept an accidental overpayment from anyone ever again. I know how much that money can matter to people working in retail. And I think if you’ve ever worked in the lowest end of jobs, you tend to have more empathy.It’s been almost 50 years but I’ve not forgotten that man’s act of kindness. I’ve learned in life that people do mean things to you sometimes but it’s the kind things that really make the difference.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

What happens when they can’t tell their stories?Renée Reizman in Los AngelesSun 25 May 2025 11.00 EDTShareFor the past two years, a small arts non-profit has been telling stories about the communities living alongside theLos Angelesriver, one voice at a time.The organization, called Clockshop, has collected the oral histories of nearly 70 local residents, activists and elected officials. Their knowledge is compiled ina vast cultural atlas– which contains videos, an interactive map and a self-guided tour exploring the waterway and its transformation from a home for the Indigenous Tongva people to a popular, rapidly gentrifying urban space.But in April, the future of the ever-growing atlas was thrown in uncertainty, when a three-year federal grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the agency that supports libraries, archives and museums, was terminated 17 months early. The grant, originally for $150,000, still had $20,000 left to pay out. “There is no recourse to recover the funds still in the grant project activities,” the organization said in aposton Instagram.Arts groups for people of color steel themselves after Trump’s NEA cuts: ‘They poked the bear’Read moreNow, executive director Sue Bell Yank says their mission to preserve the stories of residents ousted by gentrification could lead to “erasure of the past, of cultural self-determination, and a lack of understanding about how communities can successfully advocate for the kinds of neighborhoods we deserve”.Clockshop’s post foreshadowed an alarming message that would eventually be delivered to hundreds of other arts and cultural institutions across the US. As theTrump administrationdirected federal agencies to cancel grants that did not support the president’s new priorities, which focused on funding “projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity” and targeted anything broadly deemed “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion), millions of dollars dedicated to preserving local history and culture suddenly disappeared.Shortly after IMLS grants were terminated, so too were those awarded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). By Friday 2 May, aspreadsheetcreated by writer and theater director Annie Doren was being passed around the internet, aiming to catalog every organization that had lost their NEA funding. With more than 500 organizations on the list, the question shifted from who lost their funding to whodidn’t.View image in fullscreenAn organization collecting oral histories about the Los Angeles river was among the hundreds that lost grant funding.Photograph: Citizen of the Planet/AlamyWhile organizations of all kinds were impacted, it is the small and midsized institutions that lack endowments, prominent donors, and broad outreach whose futures are particularly in jeopardy. The cuts have affected a broad swath of projects – froma documentary film-maker in Fresnomaking a film about a woman who has played Harriet Tubman in civil war reenactments for 30 years; to a dance performanceabout south-east Asian mothersin New York City, toan organizationthat brings films, book clubs and other cultural events to rural Montana.Rick Noguchi who runs a non-profit calledCaliforniaHumanities, said he has seen the 112 NEH grants it awarded across the state suspended indefinitely by the Trump administration.“There are many newer immigrant communities that don’t have deep donors and struggle with being able to find individual donors that step in to tell their stories.”‘The country is abandoning its citizens’Back in Los Angeles, the cuts have blanketed cultural institutions with feelings of anxiety and urgency. But their leaders are also fighting back, vowing to continue the work of preserving local history in spite of the administration’s threats torevokenon-profit status if they continue to champion DEI programs.The Japanese American National Museum (JANM), an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution in LA’s Little Tokyo neighborhood that focuses on the history, culture and legacy of Japanese immigrants, initially lost grants that amounted to roughly $1.45m – though somehave since been temporarily restoredafter a court order. Among those cut was a NEH landmarks of American history and culture grant, which funded a workshop helping teachers build a curriculum about the history of Japanese incarceration during the second world war. JANM CEO Ann Burroughs said that the program benefits approximately 20,000 students a year.“It was very much to ensure that the history was never forgotten,” Burroughs said about the museum’s mission and outreach. “It was also to ensure that what happened to Japanese Americans never happened to anybody else.”View image in fullscreenThe Japanese American National Museum lost funds that supported a teaching workshop about Japanese incarceration.Photograph: Raymond Boyd/Getty ImagesLos Angeles’sOne Institute, which houses the largest queer archive in the world, also uses their collection to help educate others on queer history and marginalization. They lost a $15,000 NEA grant to supporttheir upcoming annual festivalin October, and now they are scrambling to hold fundraisers to keep the festival on track.Tony Valenzuela, the organization’s executive director, said that their event is important because it covers a gap in education. “Even in liberal states like California, only a fraction of students learn about the contributions of queer people to society,” Valenzuela said. “If the government abandons funding non-profits and other individuals and organizations providing a social good, this country will also be abandoning whole swaths of its citizens who greatly benefit from this work.”Another organization that was hit hard was the Los Angeles Poverty Department (LAPD), which operates theSkid Row History Museum & Archive, located just a few blocks north of the neighborhood in Downtown Los Angeles. They lost four grants administered by IMLS, NEH, and California Humanities, and are unlikely to receive an NEA grant that normally keeps the organization running – a total value of nearly $144,000 dollars, or 22% of the organization’s annual budget.Like Clockshop, the LAPD’s exhibitions, public programs and archives chart the ways Skid Row has been transformed – and nearly erased –due to development and gentrification. “Not everyone sees Skid Row as a community, let alone a thriving arts community,” said Henry Apodaca, LAPD’s media archivist. “This is a critical counter narrative to popular narratives that we’ve all been inundated with when talking about Skid Row.”View image in fullscreenSkid Row History Museum & Archive seeks to preserve the neighborhood’s lesser-known creative community.Photograph: Allen J Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesOne of the terminated grants was an IMLS grant for small museums, which was being used to support a project called Welcome to the Covid Hotel. The project, named for the temporary medical treatment centers that popped up in vacant hotels during the pandemic to care for unhoused people, culminated in an exhibition and a series of theatrical performances based on interviews with patients, nurses and social workers.“There’s stories of people coming in blind and getting cataract surgeries,” explains LAPD’s co-founder and artistic director, John Malpede. “Someone with gangrene needed to have his legs amputated, and it saved his life. And most people got and accepted some form of next-step housing.”Malpede’s performance is a creative way for policymakers to notice the Covid Hotels’ impact and potentially make the sites into permanent fixtures. When the grants were canceled, LAPD was still waiting on more than $38,000 to come through: money that was supposed to pay venues, crew and performers for events that took place in April, as well as upcoming performances in May and June, and a forthcoming publication. While LAPD aims to move forward with their plans, they are uncertain on how to fund it.After going public on social media, private donors have since stepped up to help theJANMandClockshoprecoup their losses. LAPD and the One Institute, however, are still looking for support. Without this funding, not only could the non-profits disband, but also the communities that have flourished as a result of their work.As Malpede warns: “It’s only because of the neighborhood standing up and using its own history that it continues to be present.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCaliforniaArtMuseumsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She recalls an adult player in an online game persuading her to meet in person. Although her dad worked in IT, looking back she thinks: “My parents’ generation simply didn’t have a clue.”Now aged 18 and a student at the University of Edinburgh, she wouldn’t allow her children to have a smartphone until they’re adults. “As a teen I would have been the biggest advocate on everyone having a phone, but I’ve 100% changed my opinion,” she said.“Until you’re an adult and able to recognise the many ways in which people act deviantly to advance their own interests, you should not be online. The minute there is instant messaging I think it gets dangerous.”Social media fuelled bullying at Sophie’s school, including competing for likes and using anonymous confession apps to share cruel comments.

A poll this week suggested thatalmost half of young peoplewould rather live in a world where the internet does not exist, and a similar number would support a digital curfew, while more than three-quarters felt worse about themselves after using social media.View image in fullscreenIzzy Bouric 24, with her flip phone that has allowed her to reclaim time and mental space.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianMeanwhile, Netflix’s hitfour-part series Adolescencehas sparked a wide-ranging conversation about the harms to children of social media and the online misogyny that has taken root on some platforms.Izzy Bouric, 24, an artist from Brighton living in Paris, thinks part of the problem is the way the boundaries between child and adult spaces have blurred on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Roblox in recent years.“I was on [online children’s game] Club Penguin at their age – what you could actually say and type was limited and you got banned for using bad words because it was a child-friendly space, and now you have 12-year-olds on Instagram reading Nazi comments,” she said.Despite this, Bouric says, “I was definitely exposed to things I shouldn’t have been, growing up”, adding that “everyone from my generation has an experience of being on chatrooms and getting solicited by someone who is much, much older”.She would only allow her children to have a smartphone from age 17. “It’s not for children, it’s not for people who don’t have developed brains,” she said, adding: “Your parents not knowing what you’re doing is not the safest thing in the world.”She feels that in recent years social media has become oppressive and “cannibalised by advertisements and corporations” as well as spreading misinformation around sensitive topics such as mental health and neurodivergence. “Suddenly, instead of my friends, my phone was filled with tiny people shouting at me, saying I was doing everything wrong, and then begging me to buy something from them.”The shift left her feeling anxious and unwell and prompted her to opt for a flip phone, which she feels is a breath of fresh air that has allowed her to reclaim time and mental space.View image in fullscreen‘I found myself in moments of despair,’ says Tobias, 20, from Austria.Tobias, 20, from Austria, received his first smartphone aged 11 or 12, and noticed a change in his classmates. “You just sat down and started scrolling and you didn’t really talk to the person one row behind you, you texted them.”Although his school had a policy to keep phones turned off, teachers soon gave up on enforcing it. “They were just buzzing and there were notification sounds all the time,” he said.In his late teens, he began watching videos on YouTube and Instagram. “I found myself in moments of despair after watching short video content for two to three hours straight and wondering, ‘Wow, that went fast and I have no time left for things I actually want to do.’”Tobias was particularly unnerved to see his interest in first-person shooter games resulted in his algorithm showing content from creators showcasing real guns and violent acts. He now concludes: “The longer children and teens have restricted contact with smartphones, the better.”Lethe, 20, a student paramedic from near Birmingham, England, wouldn’t allow her child to have a smartphone until they were 16 and would only allow restricted media access.She didn’t get her first smartphone until she was nearly 18, but she noticed how her friends who had them were bullied, had reduced attention spans and spent their time scrolling through social media rather than chatting or being creative.Two years on from her first phone, she says: “It definitely has changed me. I’m less good at being bored, and my attention span has decreased. I struggle to live in the moment. Algorithms on social media have led to me seeing things I wouldn’t really wish to see.”Nora, 23, a project manager from Spain, wouldn’t allow social media access until age 13 and would restrict use and install content filters, although she would want to open a dialogue with her child, explaining the risks. “I would hope to have built enough trust and understanding for them to feel comfortable coming to me if they ever encountered something scary or unsettling,” she says.She remembers this growing up. Aged 13, she and other girls in her school started receiving messages from a stranger on Google Messages. He convinced some to send inappropriate images and was eventually imprisoned for paedophilia.She also recalls classmates bullying people on messaging services. “I struggled with some nasty messages,” she said.Later, she found that social media exacerbated her eating disorder through comparing herself to other girls and watching weight-loss transformation videos, which can promote unhealthy habits. She also chased likes on Instagram, which she has since deleted. “It was not very healthy for me.”Now, she fears for her 16-year-old brother. “His TikTok is filled with super misogynistic ideas and toxic masculinity – his friends say very nasty things about women’s bodies. That wasn’t a thing for me and my friends.”* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleSocial mediaSmartphonesInternetDigital mediaOnline abuseParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer now says more of them should be eligible.Pressure to shift had become intense after local elections where Labour councillors swept out of power by Reform repeatedly cited voter concern over winter fuel. But last week’s botched half U-turn leaves Labour in an embarrassing political mess – and raises fresh questions about its purpose in power.Dropping an unpopular policy is not problematic in itself, and this is an extremely unpopular one. But U-turns are best carried out swiftly and comprehensively. Here, by contrast, Labour have left themselves unable to say how many of the 10 million people who lost out on the payment will get it back.UK child poverty taskforce set to recommend return of Sure Start schemeRead moreCrucially, they are also unable to say how it will be paid for – which is problematic, given that Reeves painted the decision at the time as essential to repairing the public finances.Complete reversal of the policy would cost £1.5bn a year. Reeves’s team say they are still committed to the principle of means-testing the allowance – but intend not to say where the new threshold will fall, until the autumn budget. That opens the way to months of debilitating speculation.The personal politics of the U-turn also look brutal. Reeves’s team insist she andKeir Starmermade the decision jointly; but the original winter fuel announcement was the centrepiece of her tough-talking July statement, which was meant to demonstrate that she was ready to take unpopular decisions, to repair the tattered public finances.At the time, Reeves described scrapping the allowance for the vast majority of pensioners as a “necessary and urgent decision” and “the responsible thing to do.”Yet here was the prime minister last week, saying it would have to be reversed – a message that raised questions about the chancellor’s political judgment, and her grip on fiscal policy.Labour have not given a satisfactory answer either, to the question of why they’re making the change – which adds to the sense of a government driven by tactics, not values.Meanwhile, as Starmer was promising to direct more resources to pensioners, charities were being toldthey must now wait until the autumn, before the government’s child poverty strategy is unveiled – including what will inevitably be its centrepiece: the decision about whether to scrap the unconscionable two-child limit.Starmer isapparently learning towards scrapping the limit– despite hischief of staff Morgan McSweeney’s reported concern about the “fairness” argumentagainst doing so. The prime minister is right to override him: there is nothing fair about cutting off financial support for children, on the basis of how large a family they happen to be born into.And campaigners and sector experts are united in arguing that scrapping the two-child limit is by far the most cost-effective way to boost the incomes of the poorest families, lifting an estimated 470,000 children out of poverty for an annual investment of £3.5bn.Affecting one in nine children already, the limit, which means families receive no additional universal credit for third and subsequent children, has been the big driver of rising child poverty.A recentSave the Children briefing, prepared on the basis of evidence sessions with families affected by the limit, said, “many spoke about the impact on their wellbeing of not being able to afford food, clothes and in many cases rent”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They had fretted about the lack of Treasury input into the long-running review process, notwithstanding the sincerity of the cabinet ministers most closely involved, including Liz Kendall and Bridget Phillipson.But they also lament the fact that by the autumn it will have taken Labour well over a year since coming to power, to set out how it plans to tackle a problem that its manifesto committed it to confronting.Given Reeves’s reluctance to repeat last year’s bumper tax-raising budget, there was also a risk that the decision to restore (some of) the winter fuel allowance, had come at the expense of more radical action against child poverty.That would have been a mistake. As Curtice pointed out, pensioner households are on average £900 a year better off since 2010, as the triple lock has put a floor under the value of the state pension; families claiming benefits are £1,500 a year worse off.And Gordon Brown last week swept aside any claim that scrapping what he called the “cruel” two-child limit is unaffordable, setting out a menu of tax options for funding its abolition – starting witha £2.4bn increase in taxation of the gambling industry, which inflicts so much harm on vulnerable consumers – as my colleague Rob Davieshas powerfully reported.The politics of grand moral causes sits uneasily with Starmer’s governing style, which is to lay out the “options on the table”, as he likes to put it, and make a choice. But voters across the political spectrum seem to sense – and resent – this Labour government’s lack of a guiding project. It is not too late to embrace one, in the urgent challenge of improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of the UK’s poorest kids.Explore more on these topicsBenefitsEconomics viewpointEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsRachel ReevesPovertyChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

Writers and activists from Brazil to Berlin talk about the protests, hope and disappointment that followedSun 25 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 25 May 2025 17.40 EDTShareCriminal justice in the US is still riven with extraordinary inequitiesOsita NwanevuColumnist at the Guardian US and a contributing editor at the New Republic. He is based in BaltimoreFive years after 2020’s historic wave of racial justice protests, the US is very obviously a country much changed, though not in the ways that activists and reformers had hoped. Many pundits have interpreted Donald Trump’s re-election in November ⁠and the culture war he’s waging against the kind of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that flourished in response to BLM’s activism as the products of a broad public backlash against the movement’s goals. On DEI in particular, that backlash is not much in evidence ⁠– aCBS pollin October, for instance, found 64% of Americans agreeing efforts to promote racial diversity and equality were going either about right or not far enough. But perceptions matter more than realities in politics.It should be said too that realities on the ground have been disappointing for police reformers lately. While the protests of 2020 led to the drafting ofthousands of reform billsin state legislatures across the country, momentum has long since stalled. Civilian oversight boards arestruggling to make an impact. Cities that initially cut police budgets wound upincreasing fundingabove pre-protest levels. And federally, a few executive orders aside, hopes for major action fizzled completely under Joe Biden ⁠– whose 2020 campaign, researchers have found, wasprobably aidedby the political engagement and shifts in public opinion the protests induced.We may not see protests of this scale again, but one never knows:74 unarmed people, mostly people of colour, were killed by US police officers last year. And well beyond killings and confrontations, criminal justice in the US is riven with extraordinary inequities, racial and not, that affect millions. With the right spark or the right case, the country could return its attention to those inequities sooner than we expect.The killing of Black people remains part of the Brazilian social landscapeFabiana MoraesJournalist and author based in Recife, BrazilI will never forget when the first protest after the murder of George Floyd was called in my city, Recife, in north-eastern Brazil. A neighbour soon appeared in our building’s WhatsApp group sharing the poster of the call and saying: “Be careful, it will be near the building.” The idea that anti-racist movements are something to be scared of is deeply rooted in Brazilian society.The killing of Black people has been part of the Brazilian social landscape for centuries. In fact, our infamouslylethal police forceis a source of pride for many. In São Paulo, the high number of killings in the outskirts of the city is celebrated, and there had beenattempts to refuse body camerason police uniforms. The state governor, Tarcísio de Freitas (Republicans party), a supporter of the former president Jair Bolsonaro, is a likely candidate for president of Brazil. Though he has seeminglyreversed his positionon body cameras, the thinktank Afrocebrapstill warnsthat Freitas is committed to “the populist notion that ‘a good criminal is a dead criminal’”.Unfortunately, the record for leftwing administrations is also grim. In the state of Bahia, which has a Workers’ party governor,752 peoplewere killed in 662 violent incidents involving military police in less than one year in 2023. Another statistic about the Bahian police is even more stark: in that state, of the 616 people killed as a result of military police intervention in 2021,603 were Black. This number represents 97.9% of the cases. Five years on from Black Lives Matter (BLM), there is little sign of reform or progress – in fact, theUS is exacerbating the issueas they provide funding and training to Brazilian police.Antiracist solidarity is more urgent now than everAdam Elliott-CooperResearcher and writer based in London. He is the author of Black Resistance to British Policing and a member of Black Lives Matter UK2020 was a hugely significant moment for our movement. BLM UK as an organisation received more than 36,000 individual donations, amounting in total to an incredible £1.2m. We didn’t see this money as “ours” but meant for Black anti-racist struggle in general, so we decided to redistribute 50% of the funds to other groups. It was described as the largest redistribution of funding to Black groups since the 1980s.This mean £570,000 went towards dozens of grassroots, Black‑led collectives. This was part of our goal to uplift Black organising both in Britain and internationally. We dedicated the remaining funds towards building a Black-led, antiracist movement that can face the challenges ahead. Some of this key work is represented at our Festival of Collective Liberation, an annual national event in central London, and Project Timbuktu, our Black liberation political education programme.Hundreds of thousands of people in Britain took to the streets chanting “Black lives matter”, and forced institutions to confront colonial legacies, remove racist symbols and adopt (often imperfect) DEI initiatives. These modest and largely symbolic gains were short-lived, as the growth of anti-immigrant sentiment and recent race riots reveals the tenacity of racism in Britain. The return of Donald Trump and the rise of Reform, in the context of Labour’s austerity economics, declining living standards and the hostile environment, makes antiracist solidarity and resistance more urgent now than ever.US Black lives seem to matter more than African onesZanele MjiWriter, investigative journalist and podcaster based in Johannesburg, South AfricaIn June 2020, South Africans marched through Johannesburg. We had taken to the streets the year before over the rape and murder of19-year-old Uyinene Mrwetyana, a watershed-moment in our problem with gender-based violence. And we are no stranger to state killings – notably there was the case of Collins Khosa, who was beaten to death by soldiers in Johannesburg during South Africa’s Covid-19 lockdown enforcement. This time, we were marching in solidarity with BLM.But I noticed something: the US-based BLM organisation and its leaders offered little reciprocal support to our and other African struggles, such as Nigeria’s#EndSars protestsagainst police brutality. It seemed that some Black lives mattered more than others.BLM’s insularity benefited US corporations more than Black communities worldwide. Brands rushed to declare solidarity, launching DEI initiatives and partnering with prominent Black figures. But their investment in representation didn’t translate into lasting systemic change.Meanwhile, “digital nomads” fleeing the Trump presidency’s erosion of human rights and DEI gains have flocked to South Africa, driving up the cost of housing and other necessities (conversely, Trump is inviting white Afrikaners to seek “asylum” in the US citing false claims of “white genocide”). Among them are Black Americans who seem to ignore local Black South Africans’ pleas for them to consider the impacts of their “lifestyle neocolonialism”. Wealthy, western Black lives matter most of all.Little has changed to improve Black lives in Trinidad and TobagoAbeo JacksonMulti-disciplinary artist and academic from Trinidad and TobagoWhen I sat opposite the US Embassy in Port of Spain after the killing of George Floyd in 2020, I knew why I had been moved to join the protest. It was about recognising the injustice of racism and anti-blackness not just in the US but here in Trinidad and Tobago, where a considerable percentage of Afro-Trinbagonians face disparities in income, education and opportunity, and are victims of extrajudicial killings that are excused by a desensitized wider society.Trinidad and Tobago has seen few truly meaningful changes regarding the betterment of Black lives and our interactions with state apparatus. There have been amendments to school policy as it pertains to Afro hairstyles. This in a nation where more than 40% of our population is, in fact, of African descent. But our education system remains unequal, and government schools face the scourge of limited resources. The caveat of the new hair policy is that despite the new amendments being ministry policy, enforcement is at each school board’s discretion.Extrajudicial killingsundertaken by the police continue largely unchecked. The Police Complaints Authority continues to fight an uphill battle against “rogue” elements in the service. And the population vacillates between apathy and support for these killings in the face of feeling helpless with regard to white-collar-funded gang violence. There continues to be outcry, however, in impoverished “hot spot” communities where these murders take place. Many times their pain is met with wider public castigation and ridicule.We now have the further complication of a new government that is extremely sympathetic to Trumpian policy. The United National Congress administration was elected on a manifesto that promised easier access to firearms for citizens and stand-your-ground home invasion laws. These potential developments do not bode well for us, a society with issues of distrust along racial lines.Afro-Germans are focusing on building our own institutions to sustain our movementDaniel GyamerahChair of Each One Teach OneIn Berlin, Black African people have been marching under the banner of Black Lives Matter since theFerguson unrest of 2014. But 2020 felt like a turning point – the first time that we were joined by a cross-section of German society, to confront this global phenomenon of anti-Black racism. There was a sense that things in Germany might actually change. The German government presented a list of89 measuresto fight racism and extremism. But five years on that change has not come, the measures long forgotten.In April 2025, a young Afro-German man,Lorenz A, was killed by police in Oldenburg. He was shot at least three times from behind. This has made Afro-diasporic communities feel incredibly vulnerable and unsafe, and the government has said nothing. Even the most basic demand – to refer to acurrent UN effortto protect the human rights of people of African descent in the newcoalition agreement’spriorities – has not been taken up.Such disappointment has meant that antiracism activists have restrategised. Though we still agitate for change, we are focusing more on building our own institutions and infrastructure to sustain our movement. To take one example:Each One Teach Oneis a Black empowerment organisation based in Berlin – we recently published theAfrozensus, a data-gathering project that aims to fill in the knowledge gaps about the 1 million people of African origin in Germany. Though the rise of the far right threatens these gains, we are building confidence, and durable empowerment infrastructure not beholden to political moments.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Israeli and Russian leaders have much in common. Both claim to be still heroically battling Nazis, inGazaandUkrainerespectively. This fiction is used to justify the mass murder of civilians, spiralling troop casualties and huge economic and reputational costs. Maybe it helps them sleep at night.Bibi and Vlad: the world’s most wanted men – and possibly the most despised.Overseeing the random killing, maiming and traumatising of thousands of children is one of many shared behaviours. These two authoritarian “strongmen” have each plunged their countries into global pariahdom and moral purdah. Conflict keeps them in power. They milk patriotic sentiment to cow domestic opponents and vilify foreign critics as antisemites, terrorist sympathisers or Russophobes. They wage war because they fear peace. Both are on the run from international justice, withwarrantsissuedfor their arrest for heinous crimes.Netanyahu and his far-right cronies deny Palestinians the right to an independent state – the exact same right asserted by Israel’s founders. Likewise, Putin rejects the reality of Ukraine as a sovereign country.Both project messianic, expansionist visions– of a “greater Israel” and a revived Soviet imperium. Underpinning such views is a racially supremacist, ultra-nationalist mindset.European leaders predict Putin, if unpunished, will eventually turn his guns on them. Netanyahu has already expanded the Gaza war to Lebanon, Yemen and Syria. Latest US intelligence reports suggest he ispreparing to attack Iran, hoping to scupper nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran.And would-be peacemakers, especially the US president, Donald Trump, fail to grasp another visceral similarity: neither actually wants lasting peace.Forever waris their preferred option, their default setting. They depend for their survival on violence. If the fighting stops, they know they face a potentially ruinous reckoning.What will people say in Rostov-on-Don, Omsk or Nizhny Novgorod when thousands of returning veterans let on what really happened at the front? How long may Putin last when Russia’s elites begin to total up the mind-boggling economic and social cost of his failed gamble? When peace comes, Netanyahu will face elections – and probable defeat. Jail time foralleged bribery and corruptioncould follow. The international criminal court will demand their surrender. Both could be down and out.That’s why they fear peace. And that’s why relentless international insistence on ending the wars, backed by increased military and economic aid forUkraineand tougher sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Israel’s government, is the way to unseat two of the foremost villains of the age. No wonder this pair, whose sometimes rocky relationship goes back two decades, exchanged “warm greetings” on the phone. They need each other now.Perhaps they discussed ways to beat down critics such as Keir Starmer, as Netanyahu brutally tried to dolast week. Netanyahu thinks the appalling 7 October 2023 Hamas atrocities mean he is free to do anything he wants, however illegal and immoral. He’s wrong. Or perhaps he and Putin swapped tips on manipulating, flattering and bamboozling Trump. It’s a game at which both excel.This Netanyahu-Putin-Trump triumvirate, this mutually reinforcing, cynical political fan-dance, is now the major obstacle to peace on all fronts. The chaotic policymaking that characterised Trump’s first term is reaching new, dangerous levels of incoherence in his second. If the wars are to end and the Netanyahu-Putin era brought to a close, US power and leverage must be fully deployed in close cooperation with Washington’s allies.Right now, the opposite is happening.Visiting the Gulf, Trump more closely resembled a spivvy travelling salesman than a US president. Personally indifferent to starving Palestinians in Gaza, he isbelatedly trying to curbNetanyahu’s embarrassing excesses – and stop him bombing Iran. But that doesn’t mean Trump has seen the light on Palestine. Now his ugly “Gaza riviera” wheeze has flopped, he seems to have lost interest. There’s nothing in it for him.If the temporary Gaze ceasefire is reinstated, and more hostages released, Trump will claim credit. But the fundamental problem remains: he is aiding and arming a rogue prime minister and a far-right governing clique that, like American neocons after the 9/11 attacks, is exploiting the Hamas atrocities to advance a chauvinist agenda while flouting international law – and going even further than that bythreatening genocide.On Ukraine, it’s no better.Trump torpedoeda joint British-French-German-Polish ultimatum demanding Putin immediately accept a 30-day ceasefire, saying he knew best. But when he spoke to Russia’s president last Monday,he caved. Once again, Putin made a chump of Trump and divided the US and Europe.Trump’s dawning realisation that he is neither God nor pope, and that the force of his personality is not by itself sufficient to resolve all worldly woes, offers a glimmer of hope for Gaza and Ukraine. In a snit, Trump is threatening towalk away. If only he would! The US must remain engaged on multiple levels. But a Trappist stance of presidential silence would greatly assist the cause of peace.Like a quack doctor misdiagnosing problems, Trump makes matters worse. Each day, Netanyahu and Putin get away with murder due in large measure to their clueless, narcissistic White House bro. Each day, morechildren’s lives are devastated.Trump should stop grandstanding and delegate Gaza and Ukraine peacemaking to experienced US career diplomats, UN envoys, Arab and European mediators, intelligence chiefs and military experts. In short, he should leave it to people who know what they’re doing. As for Netanyahu and Putin, he should wash his hands of both.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When I asked my friends about their mourning rituals, they mentioned parties, dances, ice-creams on the seafront …Sun 25 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 25 May 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt’s “Celebration Day” on bank holiday Monday and it’s making me feel a bit … funny. Dreamed up in 2022, this “civilian Remembrance Day”, or BritishDía de los Muertos, is intended “to honour those we have loved and lost, as well as those whose lives have inspired us”,according to the website. Perfectly laudable, but something about the idea of being urged to celebrate our dead by Stephen Fry and Prue Leith, to buy a star-shaped badge in WH Smith and share memories on social media with the hashtag #shareyourstar makes me feel cringey.When I get an instinctive negative reaction to something (except maggots and Nigel Farage), I wonder if I’m being unreasonable. So, am I? Well, yes – no one is forcing me to join in or buy a badge (though they benefit really good charities, including Mind, Hospice UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity). Plus, Mel Giedroyc is involved, and she can do no wrong in my eyes. On top of this, could Celebration Day be meeting a real need?We’re not great, as a culture, with death and grief, though I think we’ve improved somewhat: fromgrief podcaststodeath cafesand a flowering of extraordinary memoirs, we’ve found more spaces and ways to articulate and respond to bereavement, at least the fresh and seismic kind. But that’s just the tip of the griefberg. I’m not sure we’ve processed all thosepandemic deathsvery well, for a start. Our desire to move on and not look back is particularly painful for those who lost their beloveds without any of the usual – vital – ritual and communion, and for those whose grieving felt frustrated, freighted with anger or distorted by trauma.View image in fullscreenThe National Covid memorial wall in Westminster, London.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesOther types of grief defy easy categorisation and response, too: how about grief that feels disproportionate to the closeness of your relationship? When you were peripheral to someone’s life, but their loss hits you hard, your grief can feel overblown, even intrusive. When the death of two less than intimate friends blind-sided her last year, the writer Daisy Buchanan described her “disenfranchised grief”. Then there are deaths you “should” have got over by now:prolonged griefis even considered a pathology in the United States. I know I’m not alone in feeling vaguely embarrassed mentioning my dead mum, imagining people thinking, “Is shestillgoing on about that?”So might a Celebration Day help? Anything that normalises talking about death more, or that shushes the inner voices that tell us our feelings are wrong, our grief is too intense, too prolonged, too mixed with other feelings or misplaced, is good news. Plus, grief of all kinds is notoriously notfun; indeed, it’s conspicuously lacking in the kir royale and bunting department. Why not, indeed, pick a moment to celebrate?But we already do, without Prue Leith’s prompting. The lovely online galleryProjecting Grief, which explores creative responses to bereavement, features some sublimely celebratory stuff,from Marianne, who used lipsticks her mum (who “always had her face on”) left behind to make explosively colourful photographs and sculptures,to Suchandrika, who created a standup show around her long-dead parents. Asking around, I discover a group of friends who organised a dance in honour of one of their number who died last year, sharing a memory of her every time they danced with a new partner. Then there’s the family who throw outrageous pudding parties in memory of their sweet-toothednonna. “At some point we have to use her catchphrase, ‘More cream, dear?’” A friend orders his late father’s favourite rum baba whenever he sees it on a menu; another eats her gran’s “Alice Jones Memorial Ice-Cream” walking the seafront at Criccieth.There’s a lovely specificity to these and I think that’s partly what puts me off Celebration Day: it feels too generic for our special dead people. We miss them – from partners to piano teachers, however long they’ve been gone and however ambivalent our experience of their lives or their dying – for who they were. That’s how we should celebrate them, whether that means getting a tattoo, shouting at a squirrel or pottering down the allotment. If the spirit moves you to celebrate on Monday, wonderful. But if it doesn’t, no one needs a hashtag to celebrate the dead, how and whenever they like.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But one summer of protest isn’t enoughSun 25 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 25 May 2025 17.24 EDTShareMemory is a strange thing – the way sounds, images, and sensations converge to cement a moment in our minds. For millions of people, the memory of what happened toGeorge Floydfive years ago in Minneapolis will stay with us for ever.On Sunday, we remember the life of George Floyd and reflect on the summer of 2020, when movement builders activatedas many as 26 millionpeople into the streets to demand an end to the state’s violent disregard for Black lives. Many people will opine today about the perceived failures of that time and the years that followed, focusing on how corporate pledges to increase diversity have since been revoked or zeroing in on how many police departments did not cut their budgets, all in an effort to decide whether the summer of 2020 was really as powerful as it felt.But to make any assessment of wins or losses, we have to look back beyond 25 May 2020. And more importantly, we must analyze several key social, cultural and political factors, not just those deemed paramount by elected officials or news pundits.Before George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and the image of Derek Chauvin’s knee on his neck bore into the collective memory of millions, organizers inMinneapoliswere combating the city’s longstanding refusal to invest more in systems that would pour resources into vulnerable communities.Before there was George Floyd, we lostPhilando Castile, shot by a police officer while being pulled over during a traffic stop. There wasJamar Clark, shot by police who responded to a paramedic call.Christopher Burns,strangled when two officers used a chokehold, and David Smith and Terrance Franklin and Marcus Golden and Fong Lee and so many more.Before 2020, Minneapolis organizers fought for many changes, including a review of the Minneapolis police department (MPD) by Barack Obama’s Department of Justice and settlements to change police training and approved tactics. They even got the Minneapolis city council toshift $1.1m from the MPDand reallocate it toward community-based public safety initiatives. That work, rooted in the desire for safer, flourishing communities, distended when Floyd was murdered on 25 May. The painful realities of Covid-19 and the state’s abysmal response, combined with the murders of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, cracked open an opportunity for transformative change. Echoing loudly out of that moment was the powerful demand to “Defund the Police”, calling not just for an immediate divestment from police departments, but from the institutions and systems failing to keep us safe.Critics say the movement to defund the police failed. But Austin and Seattle are seeing progressRead moreUnder the banner of Defund, Black movement illuminated a new vision of community safety that didn’t have to include policing and the broader carceral and militaristic systems, but instead could prioritize care, restoration, and prevention. The Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) had already developed a comprehensiveVision for Black Lives, the north star guiding the organizing of hundreds of Black-led organizations around the nation. One key element of that vision is divestment from the systems that harm us and the investment in the systems that would help our communities thrive.United behind that vision, we fought hard and organized people in the hundreds of thousands. Public opinion shifted, elected officials began considering our demands, investments in community safety increased, and we saw more radical budgets and policy proposals than ever before. Since the Minneapolis ballot amendment placing the police department under the jurisdiction of a department of public safety did not pass in 2021, many would say that Defund failed. They could not be more wrong. On that day, 62,000 people in Minneapolis voted for a different vision of safety; that was 42% of the vote and more people than voted for the mayor, who opposed the amendment.That many people imagining something different for public safety is a huge win for our movement, as it is evidence of abolition’s growing popularity with the public. Key pieces of M4BL’s omnibus bill,the Breathe Act, were introduced in Congress and inspired legislation across the country. We forced what was widely considered a fringe leftist position into the mainstream, making it a viable political stance. We were the spark that ignited protests around the world, from the UK toIndonesia, Colombia to South Africa, enraged as much by the murder of George Floyd here as they were by the deadly police-inflicted violence being committed in their home countries.Through the organizing of Black movement’s Defund campaign, we won over$840m in direct cuts from US police departmentsand at least $160m in investments in community services. More than 20 major cities reduced their police budgets in some form, and in 25 cities,officials removed police from schools.Some look at the landscape today, where fascism is tightening its grip on our civil and human rights, and think this must mean this fight was lost. But if you’re seeing it that way, you’re not thinking big enough. The systems we fight are centuries in the making, and the power they’ve amassed won’t be torn down by one summer of protest. Every major win Black movement has had, from the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement and beyond, was decades in the making through sustained organizing, strategy, and powerbuilding. It required persevering through the vicious backlash of American white supremacy, capitalism and other ills. The same is true now.As we prepare for the next season of movement building, we’re learning from history, elders and ancestors on how to endure this political moment. We must understand that, though it might seem like the time to retreat, our survival is dependent upon us uniting across race, region, demographic and issue, building community, and fighting back fiercely together.We have not lost. The movement is not over. It is our very power that has them working so hard to erase our wins and our history. Our efforts in 2020 mattered, not allowing George’s murder to be ignored mattered, and all 26 million people who took to the streets should be proud. Now, it’s time for the next step toward freedom. So let’s go.M Adams, Co-Executive Director, Movement for Black Lives & Miski Noor, Publisher of the Forge and former Co-Director of Black VisionsExplore more on these topicsGeorge FloydOpinionRaceProtestActivismMinneapolisMinnesotacommentShareReuse this content"

Two referendums on Quebec’s potential independence – in 1980 and 1995 – brought the country uncomfortably close to the precipice. Today, it’s not Quebec but the oil-rich western province of Alberta that is chafing under the constraints of Canadian confederation. US president Donald Trump’s tariffs and comments about turning Canada into the51st statehave set in motion a chain of political events that will probably result in a referendum on Albertan independence sometime in 2026.Conservative political leaders in Alberta have traditionally stoked resentment of the federal government in Ottawa without crossing the line to advocate separation. The grievances are largely economic and in recent years have focused on environmental policies. The Conservative-led Alberta provincial government has portrayed these policies as hostile to the oil and gas industry, and consequently an attack on the province’s affluence and identity.The current Alberta premier, Danielle Smith, has opened the door to a referendum bylowering the thresholdfor a citizen initiative to hold a referendum to a mere 10% of the votes cast in the most recent election. In practice this means that gathering just 177,000 signatures would be enough to put the measure before voters next year. Although Smith claims to want a united Canada, her actions have empoweredseparatists, who have busily begun collecting names of those willing to sign the petition.Separatism had previously been relegated to the fringes of Alberta’s politics. Every provincial election features a few small separatist parties running candidates and winning few votes. In fact, the idea of separation garners more public support than the parties advocating for it. This support tends to follow national Liberal party wins. Until recently, the high-water markhad been about 30% supportafter the 2019 federal election, when the re-election of tJustin Trudeau’s Liberalssparked the Wexit movement, but it then ebbed as the pandemic disrupted politics.If, as had been expected, the Conservatives had won the 2025 federal election, the Alberta separatist movement would have remained on the fringe. Instead, Trump’s musings about Canada becoming the 51st stateupended Canadian politics, allowing the Mark Carney-led Liberal party a miraculous political recovery. Predictably, after a Liberal win in the national general election, support for separation has once again increased in Alberta,this time to 36%, according to a recent Angus Reid poll.The separatist impulse in Alberta is closely tied to partisan politics. For all but four of the past 50 years, the province has been governed by a conservative party. In federal elections, around two-thirds of Alberta voters support the federal conservative party. (Provincial and federal conservative parties consider themselves part of the same movement, but are not formally affiliated.) The separatist movement occupiesthe far rightof the political spectrum and itssupporters are overwhelmingly conservative.Recent polling shows that many Albertans who would consider separation would change their view if the national-level Conservative party formed a federal government, or even if the federal government were to agree to some of Alberta’s demands for building pipelines and dropping environmental regulations. In this regard, separatist sentiment looks more like an expression of frustration with Canadian politics than a movement that truly aspires to form a new sovereign state.However, Trump’s comments about the country’s future have altered the terrain for this vote. Proponents of independence no longer have to make the case that Alberta could “go it alone” as a country. Instead, they allude to Trump’s invitation to statehood.Recognising the potential of the moment, one of the fringe parties advocating for Alberta’s independence has renamed itself in preparation for its desired future: the former Buffalo party of Alberta is now the Republican party of Alberta, ready to don a red baseball cap and make America great by adding Alberta to its union.These sympathies aren’t restricted to fringe parties either. Many in the Alberta provincial conservative base identify with Trump’s Maga movement. The imagined grievances that animate Maga are reflected in some of the party’s policy agenda. In recent months, it has placed strict limits on thedevelopment of renewable energy, amended the Human Rights Act toprotect freedom not to vaccinate, and limited transgender rights and medical treatment.Trump’s expansionist desires do more than answer the practical questions of how Alberta would govern itself. They may also offer meaningful support to the independence campaign. Just as Russia intervened to bolster support for Brexit, we can expect some US interests to lend support to the Alberta secessionists.Even with these interventions, a majority vote to support independence is unlikely. A solid majority of Albertans have no desire to contemplate separation fromCanada. A conversation about the practicalities of secession would probably dissuade many voters from casting a ballot to leave. Even if a majority of voters supported it, there is no clear path to statehood.First, all of the province is treaty land, meaning its status is granted by agreements signed between the federal government of Canada and the Indigenous peoples of the territory now called Alberta in the late 1800s. Indigenous leaders from the three treaty organisations assert that Albertacannot unilaterally extinguish their agreementswith the Canadian state by voting to secede.And also, after the close outcome in the 1995 Quebec secession referendum, the federal parliamentpassed the Clarity Act, which gives it authority to determine in advance whether a referendum question is clear and establish the threshold for a clear outcome. If these tests are passed, then the province seeking to leave enters into a constitutional negotiation with the federal government.With majority support for remaining within Canada, significant objections by Indigenous communities and a high threshold imposed by the Clarity Act, the impending vote on separation is unlikely to result in a quick exit from Canada. Why, then, would the provincial government pave the way for a referendum? Perhaps as a means of improving the province’s negotiating stance. Perhaps to allow an activist fringe to blow off steam.Canada’s Liberals inch toward majority, but one vote could decide key contestRead moreWhatever the reason, the referendum poses significant risks for the province. It is likely to exacerbate political tensions, pitting separatists against federalists. It is likely to drive investment in sectors other than oil and gas out of the province, making economic diversification more difficult. It also draws the Trump administration’s attention to the province, inviting unpredictable interventions.Premier Smith and the proponents of Albertan separation have drawn a dubious lesson from Quebec’s sovereignty referendums. They believe that Quebec’s credible threat of separation has empowered it within the Canadian federation, and they seek to emulate its “win”. This view ignores what decades of separatist foment have cost Quebec, from an exodus of head offices from the province to a politics focused primarily on the question of secession. By opening the door to a referendum on separation, Alberta’s government has invited similar uncertainty and conflict that could dominate its politics for years.Lisa Young is professor of political science at the University of CalgaryExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

We might seem unlikely activists – but we have a duty to dissentSun 25 May 2025 07.00 EDTShareThere is a stereotype that the natural political activists in academia are thehumanitiesprofessors: literary scholars, social theorists and critics of culture are the ones who speak truth to power and fight back against oppression.Yet scientists also ought to stand up and organize against theTrump administration’s attacks – not only the attacks onscientific researchand integrity, but also the attacks on immigrants, on political speech and on democracy. Scientists cannot see themselves as above the fray but rather in coalition with other workers resisting authoritarianism.History is replete with examples of scientists that have taken on great risks to resist authoritarianism. The Dutch neurologist GGJ Rademaker reorganized his laboratory into a base of resistance (complete with printing press, radio equipment and hidden weapons) against fascist forces in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. Some German scientists, including the psychoanalyst John Rittmeister and biochemistHeinrich Wieland, opposed the Nazi regime by hiding Jews and distributing banned anti-fascist literature. Brave German scientists even aided the Allied forces during the second world war.The Trump administration is sabotaging your scientific data | Jonathan GilmourRead moreAt this year’s meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, the CEO of this research society, Margaret Foti,encouragedcancer scientists to take part in demonstrations and meetings with elected representatives. Professors from all corners of campus are already fighting back against funding cuts, the attempted deportations of our international students and usurpations of democratic governance. At Columbia, where I work, faculty have been organizing to urge our university leadership to provide real protections to students at risk of deportation and sue the Trump administration, among otherdemands. Contrary to the stereotype, much of the organizing work is being spearheaded by science faculty – psychiatrists, epidemiologists, astronomers, mathematicians, economists, statisticians, oceanographers – hand in hand with our colleagues in the humanities.Despite the notion that scientists are and should be cautious or apolitical, professors in the sciences are well-suited to political activism. The work of political organizing is not so different from the work of managing a research lab: skills in divvying up tasks, managing people with sensitivity and foresight, and creating clear, compelling narratives to communicate accomplishments (eg to peer reviewers reading our manuscripts) are all clearly transferrable to activism. All science professors were once science students, doing the typically monotonous labor of scientific work, spending hours carefully tinkering in the laboratory, debugging computer code, or meticulously collecting information on the human or natural world. Often political activity involves straightforward but time-consuming tasks such as printing leaflets or making phone calls to representatives. Sometimes there are simple logistics that need taking care of in organizing a protest march. Some activism involves strategizing in coalitions to distribute needed resources or build supportive institutions. None of this is as difficult as “rocket science” and it is in fact remarkably similar to the more banal parts of everyday science.History is replete with examples of scientists that have taken on great risks to resist authoritarianismMany recent actions taken by the Trump administration impinge quite obviously on the expertise of scientists: the attacks on federal research funding, the rollback of decades-long protections of our environment and human health, the excising of research specifically related to climate change or vaccine development. Robert F Kennedy Jr has recently promised to dedicate scientific resources to studying the alleged relationship between autism and vaccination – a question that has been addressed by dozens of studies and on which the scientificconsensusto the contrary is clear – and thrown the weight of the government behind stigmatizing and dangerous initiatives related to autism,contestedby experts and advocates. Donald Trump has also taken steps to sabotage congressionally mandated research on the climate crisis bydismissing expert authorsof the National Climate Assessment.Opposingthese moves andorganizingagainst themas scientistsis a no-brainer. Yet also scientists must fight tooth and nail against the secretive and seemingly baseless incarceration of immigrants, the usurpation of democratic checks and balances, and the reorganization of society along ever more hateful lines. These things affect all of us regardless of our job descriptions. It should go without saying that scientific inquiry cannot flourish in a society dominated by fear, censorship and hate.Scientists are drawn to the work we do for many different reasons, but I would venture that for most of us there is an underlying goal of advancing humanity – whether that is by finding cures to disease, new technology or more abstractly by pushing the boundaries of human knowledge so that future generations are better off. All of that is at risk if we remain “neutral” or “apolitical” at the wrong moment in history. Though there is a plausible argument for erring on the side of “apolitical” in normal times, to ensure trust and guard against undue politicization of scientific work, the argument stretches thin and breaks down given our current political environment and apparent slide toward fascism. Our scientific research itself must remain free from prejudice and aimed wherever the truth may lead, but the work before us is not only scientific research. We must also work to preserve the conditions of life that make both science and society flourish. In these times that means that scientists have a duty to dissent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

This meant the video assistant referee could not intervene to rule on whether the forward had illegally kicked the ball from Altay Bayindir’s hands – as Bramall judged – and Unai Emery claimed later that this was the “key moment” that cost Villa Champions League ­qualification.The incident happened in the 73rd minute with the game at Old Trafford goalless and as ­Newcastle were losing to Everton, Villa – despite having had Emi Martínez sent off – were heading for the ­Champions League. Bramall’s ruling caused a furious reaction from Emery and his staff. After this Amad Diallo and Christian Eriksen goals – each provoking sarcastic Emery gestures – gave United a 2-0 win. The visitors ended in sixth and so will play Europa League football next season.Aston Villa rage at referee as Champions League hopes end at Manchester UnitedRead moreDamian Vidagany, Villa’s director of football, said: “The complaint is not about the decision. The complaint is about the selection of the ­referees. One of the most inexpe­rienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.”Villa later released a statement on X saying: “Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford. With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across thePremier Leaguetoday, Mr. Bramall was the 2nd least experienced.The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers’ goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, … was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.“As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.“Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.”Bramall has been a select group 1 referee since 2022. Vidagany said: “It’s not about the decision. The decision is clear. It’s a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.”Emery said: “Today we can speak about the season, we can speak about the game we played today and we can speak about the key moments. And the key moments of course was the goal of Morgan Rogers and how the referee in that moment decided this action.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I believe in VAR and I think we have referees in the Premier League but sometimes they make a mistake – we all do, I do. [But] with this goal maybe we could get a better result and Champions League position but we didn’t deserve more than the result we have.”Villa’s captain, John McGinn, said: “It’s tough to take in the circumstances. Man United deserved to win, they were the better team, but the decision is incredible … . I know this is the rule. I’ve seen it a couple of times, but it’s so, so hard to take, especially when the impact is so big. For Thomas to blow his whistle at that point – phwoar, it’s really tough to handle. We didn’t deserve to win the game but at that point you’re 1-0 up with 20 to go, and all you need is a point to get in the Champions League. It’s a really costly one.”Emery was asked if the result means Martínez will depart in the summer. “I don’t know, he has a contract with us and we are very happy,” said the manager.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaManchester UnitedRefereesPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

There was the impromptu guard of honour that Liverpool gave ­Crystal ­Palace in recognition of their historic FA Cup win and the tumultuous reception that meant everything to Trent ­Alexander-Arnold as he stepped on to the podium to collect one final medal with his boyhood club. Most ­poignantly and appropriately, there was the sight of Alan Hansen passing thePremier Leaguetrophy to Virgil van Dijk. A weight of history passed between two great Liverpool captains as well.Van Dijk and Hansen, what a central defensive partnership they would have made. The Scot had been the lastLiverpoolcaptain to receive a league championship trophy in front of the club’s fans, 35 years and 24 days earlier. How fitting it should be him to give the cherished piece of silverware to Liverpool’s current captain. How good it was to see Hansen too, less than a year after he was in hospital with a serious illness. Jordan ­Henderson was denied that electric moment with supporters by the pandemic in 2020, so too Jürgen Klopp. Both were present to witness Van Dijk and Arne Slot revel in Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th league title in front of the Kop.The lifting of the Premier League trophy was accompanied by a ­deafening sound, and not only from the fireworks that exploded behind the Liverpool squad. Anfield had craved this moment since 1990 and the sight of the silver­ware being raised in Van Dijk’s hands ignited an outpouring of joy and pride. Amid the frenzied celebrations that followed, the Nether­lands international called Hansen over. Together they lifted the title in front of the Kop. The 69‑year‑old then made a ­respectful exit and allowed the champions to soak up the acclaim. There will be more to follow when Liverpool parade the trophy through the streets of the city on Monday in front of an anticipated 750,000 fans.For one of them, ­Alexander‑Arnold, this was a moment where apprehension turned to the deepest appreciation. The departing defender had been roundly booed on his last Anfield­appearance. Whether it was the subsequent admonishments from Mohamed Salah and Klopp that did the trick, here he was given the ­warmest and most deserving of sendoffs. His name had been loudly cheered when announced before kick-off, although there were a few boos, and he was cheered again when replacing Conor ­Bradley at the start of the second half.However, the ovation ­Alexander-Arnold received when stepping up to collect his ­second Premier League winner’s medal was magnificent. His service and contribution rightly acclaimed, he kissed the badge on his chest and thumped his heart in response. The defender was in tears after the final whistle and inconsolable when his parents, Dianne and Michael, joined him on the pitch during the trophy celebrations.Next came Salah, who collected the Premier League’s Golden Boot and the playmaker of the season award having finished with 29 goals and 18 assists. He delivered one final goal to ensure Liverpool did not end with defeat, equalising with six ­minutes left after Ismaïla Sarr had given Palace an early lead and Ryan Gravenberch had been sent off. In doing so, Salah equalled the Premier League record of 47 goal involvements in a season, set by Andy Cole in 1993-94 and equalled by Alan Shearer the next year, in 42-game campaigns.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah celebrates scoring Liverpool’s equaliser.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAAnfield was in party mode long before kick-off and Palace’s opener barely made a dent in the celebrations. ­Oliver Glasner’s team gave the Premier League champions a guard of honour before kick-off.

Another former Liverpool manager, Rafael Benítez, was also in attendance 20 years to the day since Istanbul. Liverpool’s captain on that unforgettable night, Steven ­Gerrard, was here for the presentation ceremony too along with the club’s principal owner, John W Henry, and chairman, Tom Werner.The contest itself seemed incidental. Slot’s side were badly exposed when Bradley’s attempt to find Salah was intercepted by Tyrick Mitchell, who turned and found Sarr unmarked outside the Liverpool area. Van Dijk was stationed at left-back when ­Bradley played his pass and by the time he recovered ground Sarr had slotted a cool finish beyond Alisson.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr gives Crystal Palace the lead.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAlexander-Arnold gave Anfield a reminder of what they will miss by releasing his fellow substitute ­Darwin Núñez with a sublime pass. Dean Henderson was off his line quickly to smother the striker’s shot.Liverpool’s chances of recovery appeared to recede moments later when Gravenberch, dropped into central defence as Slot threw on his attacking options, miscontrolled a high ball and felled Daichi Kamada as he attempted to make amends. Gravenberch had been booked for diving in the Palace box but was shown a straight red for denying the midfielder a clear ­goalscoring opportunity. He will serve a one-match ban at the start of next season.Liverpool, and Salah, would not be denied. When Núñez crossed to the far post late on, Cody Gakpo headed back across goal towards the lurking, ­leading marksman. Salah converted from close range via a deflection off Maxence Lacroix for his 34th goal in all competitions this season. He rightly milked the acclaim of the Kop, before Hansen and Van Dijk got the real party started.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

A 1-0 victory atNottingham Forestconfirmed Chelsea will play in Europe’s premier competition next campaign and Maresca urged his squad to cap this season by winning the Conference League final on Wednesday.Chelsea finished fourth in the Premier League after Levi Colwill scored the only goal at the City Ground, jumping ahead of Newcastle, who slipped to a final-day defeat at home to Everton. Maresca, this his first season in charge after joining from Leicester, praised his team – the youngest in Premier League history with an average age of 24 years and 36 days.Maresca leads Chelsea’s new band of brothers to Champions League return | Jacob SteinbergRead more“I didn’t have any doubt about the players,” said the head coach. “The doubt was from outside. All the ones that have the answers or the ones that have the truth, they were saying that we are too young, we are not good enough … They were saying that we were not able to win on this pitch because we are too young, because we are not experienced.“Unfortunately for them, they have all been wrong. All the ones that have the truth and have the answers to everything. So in English, how do you say? Eff-off to all of them, because the players deserve that. The effort they have been doing is fantastic. Most of the time it [the noise] was from the outside was: we are not good enough, we are too young, we don’t have leaders, blah, blah blah, these kinds of things.“We are in a business where people judge us because of results. Today, if we were not able to win the game, probably all of you [the media] would judge the season as a disaster. But it was not a disaster.”Nuno Espírito Santo said his Forest players would deservedly rest after returning to Europe for the first time since 1995-96 while Chelsea’s focus turns to facing Real Betis in Wroclaw on Wednesday. “If we are able to win, I think we can say overall that it has been a very good season,” Maresca said. “I already said that, for me, it was a good season but it can become very good if we are able to get Champions League and hopefully we can win on Wednesday.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaNottingham ForestnewsShareReuse this content"

Given their often outstanding performances in the course of a Carabao Cup-winning season, the players fully deserve their fifth-place finish.It would have felt rough justice had this masterclass in how to win away from David Moyes’s gloriously obdurate Everton dashed that long-cherished dream but, as Alcaraz headed a fine 65th-minute winner, Howe looked as troubled as at any time this season.Newcastle’s manager diagnosed a bad case of nerves. “It was definitely not the way we wanted the day to go,” he said. “You can’t underestimate Everton, they’re very solid but I sensed our desire to win was almost too great.“ It wasn’t like us, we haven’t played like that for a long time. I had to change things tactically three times and it was a bit weird to be celebrating at the end, but hopefully during the course of the evening my mood will improve. Over the season, we’ve deserved it. I’m very proud of the players.”Moyes was unstinting in his congratulations, emphasising just how well Howe has done, before turning slightly mischievous. “Jordan enjoyed his clean sheet,” he said, referencing the England goalkeeper’s enduring devotion to his former employer and Newcastle’s local rivals, newly promoted Sunderland. “But it was a great team performance. It would have been easy for the players to be on the beach; instead we were magnificent.”Everton were one point above the relegation zone when Moyes succeeded Sean Dyche in January but here they sealed 13th place with a degree of comfort and considerable control.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Carlos Alcaraz heads home the winning goal at St James’ Park.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersNewcastle started slowly and seemed so strangely flat that they appeared in need of an urgent injection of adrenaline. This listlessness allowed the visitors to gain an increasing first-half foothold and, while the initially underworked Pickford was permitted to show off his much superior footwork, Nick Pope dived smartly to divert James Garner’s 25-yard shot.When Pickford was finally called to arms, Tyneside’s favourite pantomime villain demonstrated why he has 75 England caps by making a fine double save to deny Sandro Tonali from distance then Alexander Isak on the rebound. Forget the ties that bind Pickford to Sunderland, a big part of Newcastle supporters’ antipathy towards him is because they know how good he is.Not to be outdone, Pope promptly performed wonders to tip Alcaraz’s header over the bar after the Argentinian’s connection with Vitalii Mykolenko’s fine cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBy now Howe and his assistant, Jason Tindall, were deep in earnest conversation. Part of their problem was that Isak, although he passed a late fitness test to start, was far from his fluent best. A longstanding groin problem has clearly troubled him in recent weeks; summer surgery possibly beckons.With the Everton old boy Anthony Gordon struggling on the left wing before his replacement by Joe Willock at half-time, Howe had reason to be grateful that, yet again, Tonali was impressing in central midfield, intercepting a series of potential visiting counterattacks.Howe used the interval to implement a switch from a back three to a four. This revamp involved Dan Burn going to left-back and the England defender, so assured at centre-half, suddenly looked less sure-footed.As the tension grew Howe and Tindall exchanged cross words with a distinctly unhappy-looking Isak regarding the Swede’s perceived negligence of defensive duties. Then came a further reshuffle with Kieran Trippier replacing Sven Botman, in a move that allowed Burn to return to his preferred position.Maybe there was simply too much change because Alcaraz finally scored the goal he had long been threatening. A fine header created by Mykolenko’s cross, it left Howe with head in hands.There was still time for a couple more examples of Pickford’s craft, including a top-drawer tip-over from Bruno Guimarães, before news of Villa’s defeat dictated the party could begin. “The achievement’s huge,” said Howe, after leading his team into the Champions League for a second time in three years. “It’s a huge moment for this club.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Verstappen compared it unfavourably to Mario Kart, and Russell dismissed the ­policy as having failed and the race an ­irrelevance to an audience that were “sipping champagne on a yacht”.F1 had hoped that enforcing two pit stops would make for some ­jeopardy and create at least strategic interest in the 78-lap race through the narrow streets of Monte Carlo but it failed to do so. Nor did it address the fundamental problem which was once more painfully clear in the race on Sunday: that modern F1 cars are too big and too heavy to pass one another in Monaco. No overtakes on track were achieved in the entire race.Lando Norris wins Monaco F1 GP to close gap on championship leader PiastriRead moreVerstappen was leading for the final third but only because he had yet to take his final pit stop and when he did so Lando Norris, who had largely been in front from pole,claimed the victory. “I get it, but I don’t think it has worked,” Verstappen said.“You can’t race here anyway so it doesn’t matter what you do. One stop, 10 stops. Even at the end I was in the lead, but my tyres were completely gone, and you still can’t pass. We were almost doing Mario Kart. Then we have to install bits on the car – maybe you can throw bananas around? I don’t know, slippery surface?”Russell, who had qualified out of position in 14th place after an electrical problem, was equally dismissive as he trawled round, stuck behind the slow Williams cars who were on a different strategy but which he was powerless to pass and was reduced to doing so illegally and taking a ­penalty.He suggested the entire format of the meeting should be changed to a qualifying weekend, given the contest over a single lap usually presents a gripping contest. “The two-stop clearly did not work at all,” he said. “For all of the ­drivers, qualifying is the most exhilarating moment of the weekend. Do we accept that there should be no race and it’s a qualifying race?“You do one on Saturday, one on Sunday and the guy who qualifies on pole gets some points and gets a little trophy. The one on Sunday gets some more points, because that’s what we love most. I think that’s what you guys enjoy watching the most.“And 99% of the other people in Monaco are here sipping champagne on a yacht, so they don’t really care.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenGeorge RussellRed BullMercedes GPMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It did not return for the remainder of the afternoon as he was celebrated in an emotional, elaborate tribute following his retirement from professional tennis last November, marking the end of one of the greatest sporting careers in history.“I have been very, very emotional,” Nadal said afterwards. “I think it was perfect, honestly. I couldn’t expect a more emotional day.”Farewell, Rafael Nadal: it was my pleasure to know one of sport’s most gracious champions | Kevin MitchellRead moreA year ago, Nadal’s career at Roland Garros came to an end after a tight, first-rounddefeat by ­Alexander Zverev. Although he knew it would probably be his final act as a ­professional player, Nadal had opted against receiving a real farewell ceremony after his defeat as he was not 100% certain he would end his career. He ultimately chose to end it at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga after Spain were defeated by the Netherlands.Regardless of where Nadal officially ended his career, Roland Garros was always going to be his final destination. He retired with an incredible 112-4 record here, winning the title 14 times and establishing a level of dominance almost unheard of at the highest level of the most prominent, global professional sports. “To win 14 grand slams [titles] in the same place, here in Roland Garros, that can happen,” Nadal said, smiling. “But it’s gonna take a while, at least 30 more years.”Shortly after Lorenzo Musetti’s mercifully straightforward victory against Yannick Hanfmann, the main event began. The FrenchTennisFederation had provided the majority of spectators on Court Philippe-Chatrier with orange shirts that read “Merci Rafa”. A small minority at the top level of the stadium, meanwhile, were gifted a white shirt, which the organisers had strategically arranged so that the crowd spelled out: “14 RG” alongside the image of a trophy on one side and “Rafa” bracketed by two hearts on the other. Nadal, wearing a black suit, was ushered on to the court towards a lectern in the middle of the service line.He worked through a pre-prepared trilingual speech, navigating French, English and Spanish. He was accompanied in the audience by a large contingent of his family, including his parents, his uncle Toni, who coached him from his childhood to the record books, his wife Mery and their two‑year-old son, Rafael. He addressed each of them directly throughout the speech. Other ­familiar faces, such as Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, were present in the crowd.View image in fullscreenRoger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray congratulate Rafael Nadal in Paris.Photograph: Ella Ling/ShutterstockTowards the end of the ceremony, Nadal was joined on the court by his three greatest rivals, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Nadal said: “To have my three biggest rivals there in the court with me meant a lot, no? And at the same time it’s a great message for the world, I think, that best rivals, toughest rivalries probably in the history of our sport, are able to be good colleagues, to respect each other. You don’t need to hate the opponent to try to beat him with all your forces.”As he discussed his rivals later in a lengthy press conference, Nadal found himself thinking about ­Murray. The pair had not been in touch for a while until last month when, immediately after Arsenal defeated Real Madrid, Nadal received a message from Murray. Nadal, a diehard Real Madrid fan, pulled out the phone and read Murray’s message out: “I’m gonna read [Murray’s text], because it’s quite good: ‘Hey, Rafa, haven’t spoken to you in a while. Just checking in to make sure you are OK.’ So honestly, it took me like five ­seconds to realise what I was reading, because at the beginning, I said: ‘OK, he’s such a nice guy. He’s asking about how I’m doing, family.’ After five ­seconds, I said: ‘This always was [the] British sense of humour,” Nadal, said laughing. “By the way, I didn’t text him back when PSG beat Arsenal.”After 40 minutes, the ceremony ended with a final emotional trigger for Nadal as Gilles Moretton and ­Amélie Mauresmo, the FFT ­president and the Roland Garros tournament director respectively, unveiled a plaque on-court with Nadal’s footprint and signature. Court Philippe‑Chatrier will bear his footprint forever.“It has been unforgettable, plenty of emotions for a guy like me that, I don’t love these kind of things because I’m still a little bit shy for all this stuff,” Nadal said. “I don’t like a lot to be the centre of attention for these things. It was enough when I was playing tennis. But I enjoyed it, honestly. I suffered a little bit with the emotions, but I enjoyed a lot.”Explore more on these topicsRafael NadalFrench OpenFrench Open 2025TennisShareReuse this content"

Charlton’s Valley rather than ­Leyton Orient’s Brisbane Road will be a Championship venue next season.A free-kick from Macaulay Gillesphey proved enough, con­tinuing the comeback trail for Nathan Jones. In the aftermath the Addicks manager, as is his way, thanked his Lord by giving thanks to the skies. His team had proven his self-belief in his qualities as a manager when so many others have doubted him.“I came here, wanted to build something, took a gamble, drop a division, drop two divisions, my last job was Premier League,” Jones said. “I knew we could build something … I don’t believe in the football gods, I believe in my God.”Charlton Athletic 1-0 Leyton Orient: League One playoff final – liveRead moreJones, after his troubled, ­misfiring, misun­derstood spell at ­Southampton, has been explicit that completing this mission was something akin to redemption. His opposite number, Richie Wellens – an ­experienced lower-league campaigner, a ­Wembley winner with ­Salford in the EFL ­Trophy – will just have to go again, take the positives from a season where his club pointed in the right direction.“We’re a ­growing club, we’re a ­developing club,” Wellens said. “We have to realise where we have come from. We could easily have won that game but as a club we need more time.”Wembley had been a sea of red, nearly 80,000 rocking with noise in lunchtime sun. Two clubs who have suffered while many of the ­capital’s clubs thrive had a chance to set things right: fourth facing sixth, the Addicks seven points superior in the regular season, winning both games. At Wembley, that gap often felt narrower, sometimes Rizla-thin as Orient pushed for a ­leveller. Addicks fans watched through their fingers before their agonies were ended.“Masses of relief, lot of ­euphoria, a lot of pride,” Jones said. “It’s unquantifiable the work that’s gone in for a moment like this.” In the Cham­pionship, he will meet ­Southampton, the club where he said: “I just wasn’t accepted.”The playoffs cannot be relied upon to echo a 46-game campaign but Charlton began with the greater aggression, as Jones’s teams – especially Luton – have usually exhibited. Set pieces, another Jones specialism, soon became the key battleground, eventually the deciding factor.View image in fullscreenMacaulay Gillesphey (right) fires home Charlton’s first-half winner at Wembley.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAInitially, both teams showed the edginess that can clog these matches, impairing passes and manoeuvres usually a matter of course. ­Charlton looked to Matty Godden, their ­leading scorer, while Orient looked to Charlie Kelman, their equivalent. Kelman was restricted to six passes in a first half of frustration, Godden only three more. “It was one of those games where nothing really happened,” Wellens said.Few players were given time to think. The freneticism continued until a break in play broke the seal. After a charging Tyreece Campbell was fouled, a free-kick chance presented itself. From an inside-left position Gillesphey, a classic journeyman once of Newcastle, Carlisle, Brisbane Roar and Plymouth, bent his left-foot shot round an insufficient wall and Orient’s keeper, Josh Keeley. Disappointment on Keeley’s face reflected the guilt of letting one in; both hands got close to the ball. “He’s got a wand of a left foot,” Godden said, hailing a centre-back of unlikely dead-ball proficiency. “I fancied it as soon as it come up and when it went in, ­buzzing,” said the scorer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Charlton’s brick-wall defence, with clean sheets in the semi-final with Wycombe, had seen it out. They set sail for the second tier, where they last played in pandemic times, with three ownerships since.View image in fullscreenNathan Jones shows his delight after Macaulay Gillesphey’s opener.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockThe vanquished opponents have suffered just as hard. Orient’s absence from the second tier stretches back to 1982, including two seasons in the National League. By the end they were reduced to long-distance Hail Marys, though two shots from Jack Currie flew narrowly, achingly wide.Here was Orient’s moment and Jones responded with changes to stem the flow, adding extra beef in Chuks Aneke and Micah Mbick. That preceded a lengthy break in play after officials suffered a communications breakdown. “Embarrassing,” Wellens said, Jones similarly dismissive: “VAR is supposed to make the game better.”That added 11 minutes, but Orient had lost the snap that had Charlton on tenterhooks. When the Addicks keeper, Will Mannion, claimed a couple of ­unthreatening crosses, Jones knew his team were on their way. “We didn’t play well today, we just defended really, really well,” he said. Once victory was confirmed, having made sure to commiserate with Wellens, Jones took his moment of celebratory salvation.

And they say a week is a long time in politics …It was my question that sparked all this, as it happens. The day before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe, I asked Ben Stokes about Jacob Bethell, the conversations that surrounded his absence to play in the Indian Premier League, and whether, as the “incumbent No 3” who made such an impression in New Zealand, he would be “straight back in” for the series against India.Shoaib Bashir grabs six Zimbabwe wickets as England win Test in three daysRead moreThat this referred to the playing XI felt implicit, and when Stokes talked up Bethell and told those present to put “two and two together”,so too did an instant return. But Stokes also went on to praise James Rew, the spare batter in Nottingham, and in his mind this made it perfectly clear he was referring to Bethell returning to the squad. Not that the word “squad” was used.An honest mix-up, therefore, and not, as Stokes claimed after the victory,a deliberate misinterpretationdesigned to heap pressure on Ollie Pope. Besides, with England having played Bethell at No 3 for the entire New Zealand series, keeping Pope behind the stumps even after a spare wicketkeeper arrived on tour, debate around that position was pretty inevitable.Pope was a lot more chilled about all this come the end of the Trent Bridge Test, a slick 171 during England’s 565 for six declared – and yet more cat-like reflexes at short leg – no doubt helping. While acknowledging a combined Test average of 22 against India and Australia, this year’s big boss opponents, is slightly suboptimal, the vice-captain fancies he has come on a bit since.“I completely own that my numbers aren’t good enough against those guys, and I accept that,” Pope said. “But I think I am a better player. Hopefully over the next year I can prove that. I did that a little bit in India last year [a match-winning 196 in Hyderabad] but I look forward to doing it this summer and winter.“It will be good to have [Bethell] back in the squad. The selectors can make their decision and I will try to score my runs.”It is very England these days that competition for a player with eight Test centuries should come from a player yet to score one in senior cricket. But in Bethell they see a talent who is arguably more suited to the international game, where batters are tested by higher pace and more regularly on the back foot than in the County Championship. Those three half-centuries in New Zealand, including a near-miss 96, gave a taste of his suitability.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes claimed his words had been twisted by the media regarding Jacob Bethell’s (left) potential return to the England fold.Photograph: John Davidson/APThe difference between the two levels is also being shown by Shoaib Bashir, whose nine-wicket Test – even factoring in the quality of opposition – continued a divergence from his county numbers. In 14 outings for Somerset and his various loan sides, Bashir has taken 18 wickets at an average of 85. In 16 Tests the 21-year-old now has 58 wickets at 36 and takes one every 58 balls – a strike rate that is better than Graeme Swann (60.1) or Moeen Ali (61.8).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By his own admission, Bashir still takes time to settle into spells and his accuracy – something that will only be grooved by repetition – is a work in progress. But as Stokes noted after the win (words that could not be misinterpreted), Bashir is now beginning to challenge both sides of the right-hander’s bat. “We know that we’ve got a very special talent,” he said.Looking ahead to India, a greater uncertainty is the make-up of the seam attack (even if rotation will blur the pecking order); not just how Brydon Carse slots back into it after his breakout winter but whether Sam Cook can hold his spot as the new ball specialist given Chris Woakes’s summer is now belatedly under way. Figures of one for 119 across 31 overs from Cook may have further cemented England’s view of Test cricket being a very different beast to the Championship.It would be pretty harsh to judge Cook on the basis of one outing and a ground that is notoriously high-scoring. The surface at Trent Bridge, and the success of Bashir, also pointed to how dry the English season has been so far. As one reader pointed out below the line on Saturday, a continuation could make the Bazballers versus India’s spinners the key battle.There is just under a month for all this to work itself out before the first Test at Headingley, with attention now switching to six white-ball internationals against West Indies that start on Thursday and Harry Brook’s first outing as the permanent limited-overs captain. If the first week of the Test summer is anything to go by, there is unlikely to be a shortage of talking points.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamZimbabwe Cricket TeamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It creates the platform for penal policy to take a much-needed new direction.As Mr Gauke says, this will take bravery from government. Encouragingly, the lord chancellor,Shabana Mahmood, has acceptedmost recommendations in principle, though with some exceptions. The need now, though, is for sustained action, investment and results.When the review was established in 2024, prisons for men had been at 99% of capacity for 18 months and a surge of further prison sentences was developing after the summer riots.Managed early-release measureseased some pressures, but demand for places is still projected to exceed supply by 9,500 in 2028. The inescapable truth is that the crisis has its roots in long traditions of excessive prison sentencing, sometimes politically and media driven, and of grossly inadequate investment in new prisons and non-custodial alternatives. Both of these things now have to change in radical and measurable ways. The Gaukereviewtakes a wide-ranging approach. More prisons must certainly be part of the answer, but Ms Mahmood and Mr Gauke are right that Britain cannot build its way out of this crisis. That can only be ended by different sentencing policies, on which the review makes proposals on everything from the sentencing of serial violent offenders to the need for more deferred sentences for low-risk offenders with high needs, including pregnant women.The report’s central proposal is to reduce prison numbers by “earned progression” sentences with three phases – custody for at least one-third of the sentence, intensive non-custodial management (including tagging) and continuing lighter supervision in which the offender remains subject to recall. Most short prison sentences would also be abolished, a move that would help a lot of female prisoners. Suspended sentences should be used more. The review estimates its proposals would save nearly 10,000 male prison places. These proposals should be actively supported. However, they inevitably sharpen the need to invest in extensive high-quality non-custodial support. Released offenders will need to be properly supervised and, in far more cases than is possible in today’s custody-heavy sentencing, managed back into useful non-criminal, non-drug-dependent lives.That means tagging, but it also means better-paid and properly valued and resourced probation officers. Probation services in Britain are under pressures at least as severe as those facing the prisons, with cuts in staff numbers, excessive caseloads and inadequate technology. They cannotplay their partin this new approach without serious investment. The review rightly says that relationships between probation staff and offenders should get priority. Yet this will not be possible without training, educational, work experience and drug rehabilitation resources for custodial and non-custodial offenders alike. For this new start to have meaning and credibility, these needs must be fully reflected in the government’sspending reviewnext month.The Gauke review has a wider lesson for the UK state too. The review wascommissionedamid the crisis last October. It has reported, at nearly 200 pages, and been adopted as policy in a mere seven months. It provides Ms Mahmood with a once-in-a-generation chance to introduce radical change. Compare that model of delivery and momentum with successive, often judge-led, inquiries that have taken not months but years to do their job, yet with no guarantee of any lasting change to follow.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationOpinionSentencingUK criminal justiceShabana MahmoodDavid GaukeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The history of the Netherlands includes multiple instances ofstorms breaching dikes, leading to disastrous losses of life and land. These traumatic episodes were reflected in the country’s art and literature, as well as its engineering.In countries where floods are less of a danger, memories tend to be more localised: a mark on a wall showing how high waters rose when a town’s river flooded; a seaside garden such as the one inFelixstowe, Suffolk, to commemoratethe night in 1953when 41 people lost their lives there.If we can learn anything from these examples today, it should be a lesson both about nature’s destructive power and humanity’s capacity to adapt. But as with the other sorts of damage caused by rising global temperatures, neither the risks nor resources to deal with them are evenly shared out. As sea level rises cause low-lying parts of the world to be inundated, one of the authors of an alarmingnew paper, Prof Jonathan Bamber, points out that countries such as Bangladesh will be far more severely affected than the Netherlands, with its centuries-long history of holding back the waves.The paper shows that even if carbon emissions are slashed to meet the internationally agreed target of 1.5C, sea level rises will become unmanageable during this century. It argues that a truly safe limit is likely to be 1C or lower, meaning seas would be unlikely to rise more than 1cm per year. Around the world, about 230 million people live within 1 metre above the current sea level. In England, a 1-metre rise would see large parts of the Fens and Humberside below sea level – and thus underwater – unlesscoastal defencescan somehow protect them.These disturbing findings are made more ominous by the fact that even the existing 1.5C goal ismoving out of reach. The continued use of fossil fuels and other environmentally destructive practices have set the world on a course towardsat least 2.5Cof heating. This is almost certainly beyond the tipping points for the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, and is expected to trigger what the researchers call a “really dire” sea level rise of around 12 metres.Visions of melting ice caps and flooded coastal cities induce fear and helplessness. Butpeople will adaptto sea level rises in the future as they have in the past. This is not to deny or underplay the scale of the threat, but to stress the importance of preparing for changes which are now inevitable, as well as trying as hard as possible to avoid the worst-case scenarios. The less rapid and extreme the changes, the more likely it is that sea defences will be able to reduce destruction in some places, and people will be able tomigrate inland, away from unsafe coastal areas, in an orderly way.Donald Trump haspulled the US outof the UNloss and damage fundcreated to help communities in poorer countries that are stricken by climate disasters. The latest warnings about sea level rises point to the immoral folly of this approach. It is in all our interests to prepare for what is coming, and to ensure that others are prepared too.Explore more on these topicsSea levelOpinionClimate crisisOceansDonald TrumpParis climate agreementBangladeshNetherlandseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Asked by CNN’s State of the Union whether his faction had the numbers to halt the bill, he replied: “I think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending reduction and reducing the deficit.”Trump has invested a large portion of his political capital in the massive package. It extends the 2017 tax cuts from his first administration in return for about $1tn in benefits cuts including reductions in the health insurance scheme for low-income families, Medicaid, and to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food stamps.Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ spending bill, from tax cuts to mass deportationsRead moreThe bill squeaked through US House by justone voteon Thursday. It now faces a perilous welcome in the upper legislative chamber.Sunday’s admonitions from prominent senators angered by the failure to address the budget deficit bodes ill for Trump’s agenda given the tightness of the Republicans’ congressional majorities. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, can afford to lose only three votes from among his party’s 53.Thune has indicated that changes to the bill might be needed to bring refuseniks on side. That in turn could present the House speaker, Mike Johnson, with a headache.The House will have to approve any changes made in the Senate under the process of budget reconciliation, which allows spending packages to be fast-tracked through Congress avoiding a Senate filibuster of 60 votes. The final contents of the bill will need to be blessed by both chambers, with Democrats almost certain to vote unanimously in opposition.The House speaker renewed his plea to his Senate colleagues on Sunday to go lightly with him. He encouraged them on CBS News’s Face the Nation “to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House”.But Senate budget hawks do not appear to be in the mood for compromise. Ron Johnson estimated that the bill would add up to $4tn to the federal deficit, a calculation that is broadly in line with thelatest analysisfrom the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).Johnson added a rare note of personal criticism of Trump from a congressional Republican. He said that while Trump might not be worried about the national debt, “I’m extremely worried about that.”He added: “We are mortgaging our children’s future. It’s wrong. It’s immoral. It has to stop.”Another key Tea Party senator, Rand Paul from Kentucky, has also been vocal over the deficit. He laid into the spending cuts contained in the big beautiful bill, telling Fox News Sunday that in his view they were “wimpy and anemic” and would “explode the debt”.Other influential Republican senators have been expressing concern about the number of Americans who would lose access to health coverage as a result of the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid. According to the CBO, almost 8 million people would be thrown off the benefit.Speaker Johnson tried to dismiss the concern, telling CBS News that 1.4 million of those vulnerable people were “illegal aliens receiving benefits” – and a further 4.8 million were able-bodied individuals choosing not to work and “gaming the system”.An analysis by the non-partisanFactCheck.orgfound that the claim that 1.4 million undocumented migrants were on Medicaid was false. People living in the US without immigration papers are not eligible for the federal program other than to receive emergency medical treatment.‘Fiscally irresponsible’: Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ benefits the rich at the expense of the poorRead moreMore than 1 million undocumented immigrants are in danger of losing health benefits as a result of Trump’s cuts – but this assistance is provided by states and has nothing to do with Medicaid.Any reduction in Medicaid would be politically awkward for Trump, who promised repeatedly on the campaign trail last year that he would not touch basic safety nets such as Medicaid, Medicare and social security. The president’s loyal supporters in the Maga (“Make America great again”) movement have cautioned against the move.Steve Bannon, who served as chief White House strategist in Trump’s first administration and remains a persuasive voice within the movement, recently told listeners to his War Room podcast: “You got to be careful, because a lot of Maga is on Medicaid.”Josh Hawley, the Republican US senator from Missouri,recently saidthat “slashing health insurance for the working poor” would be “politically suicidal”.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansUS CongressUS taxationnewsShareReuse this content"

However, it has not yet featured in any serious policy discussions “despite everyone thinking they were excellent,” a source said.Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies found recently that Sure Start children’s centres in England generated £2 of financial benefits for every £1 in costs – and created £2.8bn in savings and revenues at the scheme’s peak.The programme was disbanded by the Conservative-led government from 2010 onwards, when it had 3,600 centres in England. Austerity cuts reduced government funding by two-thirds, with local authoritiesscaling back or closing most of the centresby 2018.Starmer is also said to be convinced of the need to lift the two-child benefit limit as a response to the government’s child poverty taskforce, nowdelayed until the autumn.This week the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, is due to make a speech in which he will attempt to outflank Labour on welfare – calling forthe restorationof the full winter fuel allowance and the end of the two-child limit.Farage will set out plans to woo working-class Labour voters in a speech this coming week,the Sunday Telegraphreported. He will say: “It’s going to be these very same working people that will vote Reform at the next election and kick Labour out of government.”Starmer has already pledged that the government will restore the winter fuel allowance to some pensioners, in a partial reversal of the government’s most unpopular policy.The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, has suggested Starmer couldset out more details of the winter fuel allowance U-turn at the spending review next month. However, she said she could not guarantee the payment would be restored in time for this winter, amid reports that the Treasury was looking at restoring the allowance to all but the richest pensioners.“I think that we’ve got the upcoming spending review, and I’m sure that the chancellor will set it out when we’ve got the opportunity, at the first opportunity, she will set out what we’ll be able to do,” Rayner said.Asked on Sky News if more detail would come at the spending review in less than a fortnight, she said: ​“I mean, the prime minister has announced it, so logically to me that indicates that the prime minister wants to do something in this area. And if the prime minister wants to do that, I’m sure the chancellor is going to look at how we can achieve that.”The prime minister had previously said details of the reversal would be set out “at the next fiscal event” – meaning the budget in the autumn.Asked on the BBC if the government would bring back the allowance in full for pensioners, Rayner said it would depend on the state of the economy and said she “can’t guarantee” it would return in time for this coming winter.TheSunday Timesreported that civil servants had raised concerns about their ability to build a new system of payment allocations for pensioners in time for the winter, because of ageing computer systems.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, speaking on the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg programme, said the Conservatives would immediately restore the winter fuel allowance to all pensioners but would keep the two-child benefit limit. She called for the immediate restoration of the winter fuel payment.“We would never have taken the winter fuel away. We kept it for 14 years, we brought in the triple lock, we look after pensioners,” she said.But Badenoch defended the two-child benefit cap, calling it “absolutely the right thing to do”.Badenoch said Farage was making empty promises to gain power, telling Sky News that Farage as prime minister would be “very bad for this country”. She said: “Nigel Farage is someone who is going to say whatever he wants in order to get into power. I am taking the hard road – I’m not going to do that.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenPovertySocial exclusionLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The “extremely difficult” conditions led to a first rescue mission being aborted, the company said, with a successful attempt made six hours later.The discovery came four weeks after heavy snowfall triggered avalanches and road closures in the popular skiing destination.Zermatt, which is famed for its views of “the world’s most photogenic mountain,” the Matterhorn, was temporarily inaccessible due to the deluge of snow last month, local media reported.The Guardian has contacted local authorities for comment.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A day earlier, a separate blaze, believed to have been started by arson, contributed to a power cut that hit Cannes.The first power cut affected 160,000 households, knocking out traffic lights and cash machines throughout the French Riviera. Broadcaster BFMTV reported that the incident was made worse as three of the four pillars of an electricity pylon in the region had also been cut with a saw.Writing on social media on Sunday, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, said he strongly denounced the “malicious acts”. He said power had been quickly restored, with local and national police mobilised. He added that the city would make surveillance camera images available to investigators and would reinforce the camera network around the city’s strategic electric sites.Commenting on the power cuts that hit Cannes, before the latest fire, Laurent Hottiaux, the prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes region, told BFMTV there were certain elements that were “not a coincidence” but would not comment further, as an investigation led by the national prosecutor’s office was under way. He said authorities had taken additional security measures.The power outage hit the Cannes film festival headquarters, interrupting several screenings, but the closing ceremony went ahead thanks to backup generators. Thetop prize was wonby the dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi for his dramaIt Was Just an Accident, inspired by his time spent imprisoned by the Iranian regime.Iranian authorities met the 64-year-old director’s victory with silence, for his film in which five people confront the man they believe tortured them in prison. After winning the Palme d’Or, Panahi, who has been jailed multiple times, made an appeal for national unity.On Sunday, however, Iran summoned the French charge d’affaires in Tehran over “insulting” comments made by France’s foreign minister.“Following the insulting remarks and unfounded allegations by the French minister … the charge d’affaires of that country in Tehran has been summoned to the ministry,” state news agency IRNA reported. Jean-Noel Barrot had called the film “a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime’s oppression.”Authorities said they did not believe the power cuts were a specific threat against the Cannes film festival and have not commented on the possible perpetrators.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All the passengers – made up of personnel from MI5, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British army – were killed, along with the helicopter’s four crew members.Now, victims’ relatives have written an open letter to the government saying they “deserve answers” and renewing calls for a public inquiry.They have also called for the full release of documents that, as a BBC documentary revealed last year, have been locked away until 2094 by theMinistry of Defence(MoD).After the crash, the Chinook’s pilots, Flt Lts Richard Cook and Jonathan Tapper, were found guilty of gross negligence by the RAF, but cleared by the UK government 17 years later.A subsequent review by Lord Philip set out Chinook helicopter safety concerns that had been raised before the crash.Andy Tobias, who was eight when his father, Lt Col John Tobias, 41, was killed, said the “secrecy” raised questions about what really happened.“I lost my father, and part of my childhood because he was put onboard a helicopter that had been deemed unairworthy and should never have taken off,” he said, speaking publicly about the incident for the first time.“I have tried for many years to put this crash, and my family’s unnecessary loss, behind me – but learning that the MoD has sealed away the archive until after all of us will be long gone seriously raises my concerns about what really happened and who knew what.“Why the secrecy? Why did my father and 28 others die? We want answers.”Esme Sparks, who was seven when her father, Maj Gary Sparks, lost his life, said it had been a “shock” to learn about the existence of the documents, adding: “We are furious that the government and the MoD is refusing to listen or to meet us.“Our request for a meeting with the defence minister was summarily dismissed with platitudes. What happened to their duty of candour promises?”The open letter stated that the Chinook Justice Campaign – which includes most of the bereaved families – formally requested a public inquiry on 9 October 2024, but that this was rejected by the minister for veterans and people, Alistair Carns, on 17 December.It added that the minister had not yet responded to a subsequent request for a meeting.The letter also described the “huge concern and upset” the sealed documents have caused to the bereaved families.“The papers will not be released until 2094, long after the spouses and children of those killed have themselves passed away,” it stated.“It is unbearable to us as bereaved families to know that this sealed information could give us the answers we need.”An MoD spokesperson said: “The Mull of Kintyre crash was a tragic accident and our thoughts and sympathies remain with the families, friends and colleagues of all those who died.”Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceRoyal Air ForceMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

We would argue that the application of this is not only deeply invasive – it raises immediate questions about enforcement. We ask, non-rhetorically, on what basis are staff expected to prove their sex to use a toilet?”The letter says this approach “risks exposing [trans people], and anyone who may be gender non-conforming, to humiliation, harassment or worse – all under the guise of ‘clarity’.”The letter, which is now available online for other MSPs and parliamentary staff to add their names to, has already been signed by a number of former Scottish government ministers including Elena Whitham and Emma Roddick, the deputy leader of the Scottish National party, Keith Brown, and the leaders of the Scottish Lib Dems and the Scottish Greens, Alex Cole-Hamilton, Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie. It has the support of MSPs from four of the five main parties at Holyrood, including the former Labour leadership contender Monica Lennon.Hannah Bardell, the former SNP MP who organised the letter working with the Good Law Project, said she expected more Holyrood politicians and staff to sign up now that the concerns had been made public.“I’ve spoken to many MSPs who feel huge concern about this decision. I hope this can move the debate forward and that the corporate body can rethink their decision just like other organisations have done,” she said.“It’s very sad that the question of how trans people live their lives has become so toxic that the very people who represent them feel nervous about signing a letter like this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Institutions that protect fundamental rights cannot bend to political cycles. If they do, we risk eroding the very stability they were built to ensure.”He said the European court of human rights was the only international court adjudicating violations of human rights in the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. “This should never be undermined,” he said.TheCouncil of Europe, which was formed in 1949 in the period of postwar reconciliation, and which is separate to the EU, has 46 member countries that have signed the European convention on human rights. The European court of human rights, based in Strasbourg, determines whether governments are living up to their obligations under the convention.The court has ruled against Italy in a handful of migration cases, including a 2016 case where Tunisians fleeing their country in the wake of the Arab spring were held at a detention centre on Lampedusa before being removed to their home country.The court has ruled against Denmark over the issue of family reunification, such as in a 2021 case where Danish authorities were found to have denied a Syrian refugee his right to a family life by refusing his wife permission to join him.More than 30 cases are pending at the court against Latvia, Lithuania and Poland after allegations of pushbacks into Belarus to prevent people from claiming asylum in these countries. For instance, the court is hearing from 26 Iraqi nationals of Kurdish origin who allege that Latvian authorities forced them back into Belarus without hearing their asylum claims. The people, who have nearly all been sent back to Iraq, also say they were denied access to food, shelter or water while stranded in the forest on the Latvian-Belarusian border.The Baltic states and Polandaccuse Belarus of weaponising migrantsby luring people from the Middle East and Africa to the border region in an attempt to destabilise the EU. They say they are facing “hybrid warfare” and that stability of their societies needs greater priority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So far no European country has succeeded in setting up a return hub and it remains unclear which countries might host the facilities.In 2022 the then Conservative-led British government criticised the convention after the Strasbourg courtruled againstits flagship plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, meaning an inaugural flight to the east African country was abandoned at the last minute.Last year Boris Johnson, who had been prime minister at the time of the ruling,called for a referendumon the UK’s membership of the convention when he was promoting his memoir.Explore more on these topicsEuropean court of human rightsCouncil of EuropeHuman rightsEuropeMigrationRefugeesnewsShareReuse this content"

He is a close political ally of the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, who has led a centrist coalition government since late 2023.During a speech to a huge crowd, Trzaskowski laid out his vision for a Poland that is inclusive and vowed to work to help develop industry as the nation continues a economic transformation into a regional economic and military power.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Karol Nawrocki gather in Warsaw.Photograph: Albert Zawada/EPAIn another part of Warsaw, Karol Nawrocki, 42, addressed his supporters. A conservative historian and former boxer, Nawrocki is backed by the national conservative Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. He heads the state-run Institute of National Remembrance, which under Law and Justice’s populists became known for promoting nationalist versions of Polish history.“I am a Pole who understands the hardships of everyday life,” Nawrocki told the crowd. “I stand before you and I am fully convinced that I am your voice.”Earlier this month, the White House released photographs of Nawrocki meeting Donald Trump in the Oval Office – a tacit but unmistakable show of support from the US president.Trzaskowski argued in his speech that Nawrocki was not fit to represent the nation as its president.“It’s high time for truth, honesty, to win, for the future to win, and that’s exactly what’s at stake in these elections,” Trzaskowski said. “On 1 June, we will all make a decision that may be one of the most important in our lives.

What was he going through?” McLaurin recalled thinking as he stood in front of the mural. Flowers and stuffed animals from visitors surrounded the memorial. Roger said he was struck with a range of emotions from sadness to peace. “You think about the racist demeanor that these individuals had toward him, and it was just like his life did not matter,” he told the Guardian. “The entire space to me is just sacred.”Now, five years since George Floyd’s murder, the future of the square where he died remains uncertain, as the city council deliberates on development plans. McLaurin and Roger Floyd want the area to be commemorated as a historic site that launched a global racial justice movement and served as a rallying call for police accountability. Roger Floyd would like it to become a pedestrian plaza that includes a memorial to his nephew as well as shops and a library.View image in fullscreenGeorge Floyd Square in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Thursday.Photograph: Kerem Yücel/AFP/Getty Images“We want to see the businesses that are there get their momentum restarted, for whatever traction they may have lost during this timeline,” Floyd said of the limited vehicular traffic since the murder. “This place is actually a destination for world visitors, because this is a global undertaking as well.”The square’s future has served as an existential conflict forMinneapolisas a split city council decides how best to commemorate the site of Floyd’s death and the birthplace of a global movement. Most city council members want to create a pedestrian plaza that restricts buses and vehicular traffic to emergency vehicles, local business and residents, and that will include a memorial and mall that they say will bring vitality to the area.Meanwhile, the mayor, Jacob Frey, and most business owners want a flexible open street plan to increase vehicular traffic and reintroduce major bus routes that have not stopped in the area in several years, while also allowing for streets to be temporarily shut down for festivals and gatherings. In late February 2025, the disagreement came to a head when thecity council voted9-4 to override Frey’s veto on the square’s development. The council had asked the city staff to create a study on the pedestrian plaza, which Frey disagreed with.For Dwight Alexander, the co-owner of the soul food restaurant Smoke in the Pit near George Floyd Square, the solution is clear: the bus routes and traffic need to return to help revive his and others’ businesses. The historically Black commercial district of south Minneapolis was home to the oldest Black-owned and operated newspaper in Minneapolis, as well as more than 20 Black-owned businesses from the 1930s to 1970s.Alexander said that the area had changed for the worse: “There’s no traffic up here, no motion, no energy up here, no life like it was before.” In the few years since Floyd’s murder, he said that the area had become tantamount to a “ghost town” that elicits somberness. When people see pictures at the square’s memorial commemorating Floyd and other Black people who have been murdered by police, Alexander said that visitors were not eager to eat food afterward.View image in fullscreenA mural at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, the area called George Floyd Square.Photograph: Craig Lassig/EPA-EFE“By the neighborhood being so closed, the negative energy is keeping people from inside Minneapolis coming up here,” Alexander said. “A lot of people don’t even want to come up and visit no more, just because of the output and the impression on the neighborhood.” The tension over the square illustrates the complicated dance between commemoration and moving on that American cities have to contend with following tragedies.‘We can’t sanitize what happened here’Back in 2020, as the world watched the nine minutes and 29 seconds during which Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck, south Minneapolis was irrevocably changed. Protesters took over the square and it became the stage for regular standoffs between the police and activists protesting against police brutality. In June 2021, thecity reopenedthe area to vehicular traffic. Yet one of the busiest bus routes in the citynever resumedstops in the area.Over several years, the city spent 17,000 hours and $2m worth of staff time between listening sessions, meetings and door knocking to ascertain what residents wanted to see in the square, Frey told the Guardian. Most people from those listening sessions want a flexible open street plan that allows bus traffic to return and for the city to erect a memorial: “Everybody agrees that we need to honor the long-term legacy of George Floyd and the movement that emanated out from the space.”View image in fullscreenA group of artists and community members install a sculpture of a raised fist at George Floyd Square on Martin Luther King Day in 2021 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesIn support of Frey’s preferred plan, Alexander said his business has been down by about 50% because of the decreased car and foot traffic: “We want this neighborhood back to where it was before.”Michael McQuarrie, the director at the Center for Work and Democracy at Arizona State University, who conducted research at the square during the 2020 protests, said the city has been divided on how to move forward with the area for the past five years. He sees the street closure from 2020 to 2021 as transformative for the community.“It really did enable a kind of grieving and memorialization which would have been impossible if the street was open,” McQuarrie said. The advocates for the pedestrian plaza can point to evidence that when the street was closed, “it really was a very special place for people who had been victims of state violence”.When people grieve in private, McQuarrie said, “that has a way of hiding the kind of systemic violence police do to people. Once you make it a communal experience, you can see the systematicity of the violence of the state or the violence that Black people experience.”View image in fullscreenCommunity members and Floyd family members gather at George Floyd Square on Friday during a tribute to mark nearly five years since Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police.Photograph: Kerem Yücel/AFP/Getty ImagesFor council member Linea Palmisano, who oversees Ward 13 about a mile and a half from 38th and Chicago, a study on the pedestrian plaza is delaying a flexible open street concept plan that would bring much-needed traffic back to the area. About 6,000 residents, property owners and business owners in the four surrounding neighborhoods were surveyed and more than 70% of them said they did not want a pedestrian plaza that would restrict vehicular and bus traffic, she added.“You don’t usually get 70% or more of people saying the same thing, that they want a vibrant corridor, not one that is closed off,” Palmisano said. “Here we are almost five years out from the murder of George Floyd, and we still do not have a plan to move forward, to revitalize the area and honor the memory of Mr Floyd. I find that to be incredibly shameful. We are not honoring Mr Floyd by doing nothing.”But some community members, city council members and members of Floyd’s family say there’s no way to rush healing. Council member Jason Chavez of Ward 9, where part of the square is located, said it needed to be recognized as “a historical component in our city history that will never be forgotten”.“It caused ripple effects across the country and across the globe, and I think that it was a reminder to residents in Minneapolis that police brutality continues to be a thing that happens to Minneapolis residents,” Chavez said. He added that it is a reminder for “regular people” to push for change in the police department.“We can’t sanitize what happened here in the summer of 2020,” Chavez said.Americans are preoccupied with joyous resolutions to calamities, said Yohuru Williams, a professor of history at Minnesota’s University of St Thomas and the founding director of the school’s racial justice initiative.“When you aim for the tragedy with a happy ending, the wages for that are always this form of forgetting, and then you’re just waiting for the next incident to reawaken people’s sensibilities,” Williams said.The moment that ushered in George Floyd Square is deserving of a memorial that honors the movement it ushered in, he said. “How do we remember thoughtfully all the things that came to confluence there that led to that tragedy?”"

Officially, that was before age and decay caught up. Horrifically, forDemocrats, in June 2024 a debacle of a debate against Donald Trump confirmed what Washington insiders had only dared whisper but what most voters had known: Biden should not have sought re-election.Less than a month later, he was out, replaced as Democratic nominee by his vice-president,Kamala Harris. Now, Trump runs wild and Biden’s legacy is buried beneath a heap of unkind reporting – and bouquets of sympathy, after news of his cancer.“It was an abomination,” one prominent Democratic strategist isquoted as sayingby Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. “He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people.”Tapper and Thompson concur. Over 350 engrossing pages, they deliver a stinging judgment, trenchantly written and well-sourced.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThe two reporters spoke to about 200 people, including members of Congress, White House staffers and campaign insiders. Some reportedly sounded the alarm about Biden’s mental acuity and desperate efforts by aides to hide his deterioration. The alarm was not heeded.Tapper is CNN’s lead DC anchor and chief Washington correspondent. Thompson is a national political correspondent for Axios and a CNN contributor. His speech at the recent White House Correspondents’ Association dinner was one for the ages.“President Biden’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Thompson said. “We, myself included, missed a lot of this story. And some people trust us less because of it. We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows.”Original Sin begins with a bang. Its first chapter is titled “He Fucked Us”, from an on-record quote by David Plouffe, senior adviser to the Harris campaign, before that manager of Barack Obama’s 2008 winning effort. “We got so screwed by Biden as a party,” Plouffe says. Harris was a “great soldier”, but the race was “a fucking nightmare. …“And it’s all Biden … He totally fucked us.” Try putting that toothpaste back in the tube. On the other hand, Plouffe doesn’t reveal what Harris knew about Biden’s fitness and when she knew it.Biden loyalists return the favor, too, the authors write: “Many … felt that Harris didn’t put in the work and was also just not a very nice person. Some quietly expressed buyer’s remorse: They should have picked [Gretchen] Whitmer,” the Democratic governor of Michigan.Tapper and Thompson report cold political facts. In 2020, identity politics played an outsize role in Biden’s VP pick. “It boils down to whether he has a Hispanic woman or a Black woman,” Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader,saidthen.Tapper and Thompson lay bare a sense of betrayal.“The presidency requires someone who can perform at 2am during an emergency,” they write. “Cabinet secretaries in [Biden’s] own administration told us that by 2024, he could not be relied upon for this.”Yet, Biden and his minions made sure to clear the field. The representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Biden’s only challenger among elected officials, never had a prayer. Governors stayed on the sidelines.Tapper and Thompson tell us one senior White House aide left because he or she didn’t think Biden should run again. Biden had been walled off from staff to shield his decline.“I loveJoe Biden,” the unnamed aide continues. “When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.”That ranks as an understatement. The cover of Original Sin shows Biden with hands covering his eyes. The former president, his family and his closest advisers – known as the “politburo” here – dwelt in a world of alternative facts.“The Bidens’ greatest strength is living in their own reality,” a source tells Tapper and Thompson. “And Biden himself is gifted at creating it:Beau isn’t going to die. Hunter’s sobriety is stable… Joe always tells the truth. Joe cares more about his family than his own ambition … They stick to the narrative and repeat it.”To quote Lewis Carroll: “I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true.”Biden’s decline was not sudden, according to Tapper and Thompson. The signs were there years ago: “During an eight-day, grueling bus tour in Iowa in December 2019, Biden gave his aides pause. While doing prep, he struggled to remember the name of longtime aide Mike Donilon. ‘You know, you know,’ he said, groping for it.”Donilon had worked with Biden for nearly 40 years. It should have been time to start worrying. Cover-up and denial are foundational to the Biden saga.This week brought Biden’s bad diagnosis.“He did not develop [metastatic prostate cancer] in the last 100, 200 days,” Zeke Emanuel, a doctor, told MSNBC on Monday. “He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021 … I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that.”Emanuel’s brother, Rahm, was Biden’s ambassador to Japan, and before that chief of staff to Obama.Democrats must address such self-inflicted wounds. Disapproval of Trump may be all they need to retake the House next year. But reckoning and redirection will be needed to recapture the White House. The party’s brand circles the drain.For now, Trump is the exception that proves the rule: America is no country for old presidents.Original Sin ispublishedin the US by Penguin Random HouseExplore more on these topicsBooksJoe BidenUS politicsDemocratsUS elections 2024reviewsShareReuse this content"

I had assumed, given the vitriolthat novel attractedwhen it was published in 2020, that she would be trying to distance herself from it.For the first year after its publication, that was the case, she tells me from a light-filled, bookshelf-lined room in her New York home. “My husband would ask me every week: ‘Knowing what you know now, would you still write it?’” she says, and the answer was consistently: “No, I would not.”Eventually that answer shifted to maybe, and now, five years on, the 50-year-old author is firmly at yes. “I’m really glad I wrote that book,” she says. “I’m proud of it. But having to endure the experience of publication, it was brutal.”American Dirt had been expected to be one of the buzziest books of 2020, having reportedly earned Cummins a seven-figure advance. Copies of the novel, about a mother and son fleeing a drug cartel in Mexico, arrived in bookshops emblazoned with a quote from the thriller writer Don Winslow, who called it “a Grapes of Wrath for our times”, and it was chosen as an Oprah’s book club pick.“The kind of praise that it got was so over the top,” Cummins says now. She wasn’t used to the attention – her three previous books had not received anywhere near that level of hype – and she certainly wasn’t prepared for what came next: a string of bad reviews, one calling the book “trauma porn”. Whether Cummins had the right to tell the story of Mexican migrants, being neither Mexican nor a migrant herself, was called into question, and 141 writerssigned a letter to Oprah Winfrey, asking her to remove it as a book club pick.None of this was helped by the way Cummins’s publishers marketed the book, with barbed-wire centrepieces decorating a launch event, or the novel’s author’s note, which the writer now thinks opened the door to scrutiny.In it, Cummins, whose grandmother was Puerto Rican, wrote that she “wished someone slightly browner than me” had written the novel, but added: “if you’re a person who has the capacity to be a bridge, why not be a bridge?” She also explained that her husband had been an undocumented immigrant in the US – but didn’t mention that he was white, and that his country of origin was Ireland.“I was trying to justify my right to write that book and I didn’t need to justify it. It’s a novel. I’m allowed to write it.” She will continue to write characters who share different experiences from her, she says, and “would encourage every other writer out there to do the same”, as long as they do so with tremendous care.It was her publisher who encouraged her to expand on the author’s note, which in the original manuscript was a one-line statistic about the number of migrants who had died in the US-Mexico borderlands. Before the book was sold, when she was taking meetings with the numerous editors who were interested in buying it, “every single one of them said: ‘Why did you write this book? Why?’” She felt she was being pushed to come up with a personal link to the story, when really she was thinking, given what was going on at the border: “Why isn’t everyone writing this book?”The notion that I was writing trauma porn or that I was unqualified to write about grief was really absurdAddressing “this enormous humanitarian stain on our national conscience” was the real reason she wrote American Dirt, Cummins says – and the reason she remains proud of it.For her, it was “a very personal book”, because it was written just after her father died suddenly while out with friends. It was only later, after someone pointed it out to her, that she realised all the book’s major characters are grieving for their fathers. “So the notion that I was writing trauma porn or that I was unqualified to write about grief was really absurd,” she says.Much was made at the time of the fact that she had referred to herself as white ina 2015 New York Times opinion pieceabout the murder of two of her cousins, the subject of her first book, the memoir A Rip in Heaven. “I have always been white. I will always be white,” she says now. “I have always been Latina. I will always be Latina. Those things are not mutually exclusive. I couldn’t believe that in 2020 I had to say Latino people come in different colours.”The question of which ethnic group the author belongs to is one that has come up throughout her life, and is a major theme in her latest novel, Speak to Me of Home, in some ways a product of her post-American Dirt “soul-searching”. The intergenerational saga follows an Irish‑Puerto Rican family that closely reflects Cummins’s own – nobody can this time accuse her of writing outside of her own experience. “It’s unassailable in that particular way, which is a comfort,” Cummins says, though “that’s not why I wrote it”.The character of Rafaela is partly based on Cummins’s grandmother, who was born into a well-to-do family in Puerto Rico, a “cherished and coddled oldest child” until her father “lost everything” when she was a teenager, and she was sent to the US naval base in Trinidad to work. There, she met Cummins’s grandfather, and the couple “ended up in St Louis with eight kids”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In the end, she is allowed to become a member, but must change in the staff locker room. “That’s a true story,” Cummins says – the same thing happened to her grandmother. Rafaela’s children being banned from speaking Spanish at home in order to fit in better at school is also taken from real life – Cummins herself was only allowed to speak English at home. And like Rafaela’s daughter Ruth, the writer felt like a fraud in all of the social groups at university, where everyone seemed to gravitate towards sororities or fraternities “where everyone looked exactly like them”.Having grown up in Gaithersburg, Maryland, widely recognised as one of the most racially diverse US cities, Cummins was shocked by the way her fellow students at Towson University in Baltimore segregated themselves. “I’ll never forget being in the dining hall for the first time,” she says, where Black students were sitting in one room, white students in another. “And then there were a few tables in the corner for whoever was Asian or Latino, not Afro-Latino. And I was like, where do I sit?”She and her boyfriend at the time, who was Black, tried to set up a club, “Target Unity”, with a view that it could be “a social outlet where people could mix and mingle with people who were not from their same racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic background.” They rented a room in the student union, but “no one came … no one wanted that”.Cummins went on to work in publishing for a decade, so she was “acutely aware that publishing had a race problem”, but it “felt very weird” to be a focal point of that criticism – American Dirt sparked a wider global conversation about race and publishing, out of which the #DignidadLiteraria campaign for greater Latino representation in US publishing was launched.Now her feelings about the book are bittersweet. Commercially, American Dirt was a huge success, something the author wasn’t able to feel excited about at first. She was “relieved” rather than happy every week it continued to be a No 1 bestseller. Though she doesn’t read media coverage or online reviews, occasionally her husband will send her a screenshot “if there’s something really lovely”. Yet so often these positive reviews “are defending my right to author the book”, she says, which she finds “really bothersome”. When reviewers say things like “it doesn’t matter that she’s not Latina”, they are still viewing her identity differently from the way she identifies herself: IrishandPuerto Rican; whiteandLatina.“The book won,” she says. “It’s sold three and a half million copies and continues to sell.” But “in those moments, I realise I lost”.Speak to Me of Home by Jeanine Cummins is published by Tinder.

This fun new murder mystery bounces along with verve. It’s a cut aboveLucy ManganSun 25 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareBy some curious dint of mathematics, one of life’s greatest pleasures is coming across something that is just a little bit better than it needs to be. It’s such rarity, such a treat – and to pessimists, such a shock to the system – that it becomes disproportionately, though still genuinely, delightful.Such a phenomenon is Death Valley, a new Sunday night comedy drama in which an amateur sleuth helps the police solve crimes in a bucolic village – usually English, this time Welsh – with an astronomically high murder rate and a suspect under every gooseberry bush and felt hat. So far, so Gently cum Midsomer cum Marple cum Agatha Raisin cum pull-up-a-chair-and-a-teacake-and-enjoy.And it does hit that cosy spot. Timothy Spall, who I suspect was looking for a way to recharge his actorly batteries after putting every bit of power he had into his performance as Peter Farquhar in 2023’s harrowingThe Sixth Commandment, stars as the amateur sleuth, John Chapel. Chapel is a retired actor (if there ever is such a thing, darling!) who made his name in a long-running police procedural series as its eponymous detective, Caesar. The first episode opens, as the first episodes of new cosy crime series should, with a case so clear it couldn’tpossiblybe anything else: dead property developer slumped over his desk, a gun in his hand, obviously having killed himself.But is it obvious? Why would a man planning such a thing have a lunch in his diary for the next day and a holiday booked for Dubai? DS Janie Mallowan (Gwyneth Keyworth), treading the fine line between perky and infuriating with nary a wobble (Chapel calls her “scintillatingly irritating”, which is both a perfect description and a mark of the writing quality), reckons she should at least ask the neighbours if they saw anything suspicious on the day he died. As a devotee of Caesar, she is awestruck when the first door she bangs on is answered by none other than Chapel himself. And Chapel knows it was murder. How? “Because actors observe.” The victim was an orderly man – a gunshot was too messy. And because “action is character” – and the victim was a considerate man, who designed bespoke birthday cards for his cleaner’s son and would never have left her to find his body when she was due in the next day.Janie visits the deceased’s high-maintenance wife – “I shouldn’t cry. Just had my lids done” – to find out if he had any enemies. “Any beef with anyone? Doesn’t have to be big beef. Small beef. Mince?” Not even a meatball’s worth, is the reply.And we’re off. A few red herrings scent the air but Chapel and Janie remain undeterred for long in their hunt for clues. (“I’m the inspiration,” says Chapel to Janie as he brings his actorly powers to bear on the evidence. “You’re the perspiration.”)Why would a man who fired an electrician for wonky socket work in a show home not also fire a decorator for missing a patch of wall? Why would a woman with a love of traditional tea towels want to buy a new-build? A cancelled bacon delivery here, an empty foxglove bed there, a chance remark from a child of uncertain parentage over the way and soon the threads are drawn together to find the means, motive, opportunity – and the murderer (by the end of the hour). Their next adventure involves a member of Janie’s mum’s walking group dying in an apparent fall (guess what!) and is worth watching for many reasons, not least Mum’s description of the dead woman: “Too thin by half. And stubborn eyes.”Within each case scenario are the longer arcs involving Chapel’s grief for his late wife and Janie’s struggles over the loss of her best friend, which season the jollity with something a little more piquant.So, it’s Midsomer Murders –with jokes. It’s Rosemary and Thyme – but good. Or a pastoral Old Dogs New Tricks, if you prefer. Take your pick. It’s also witty and fun and bounces along with enough verve to get you past any footling objections you have to either form or content before they can make their way from brain to mouth. Not everything has to be The Wire. Sometimes you can just relax and enjoy a different thing done very well indeed.Death Valley was on BBC OneExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTimothy SpallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rejecting the received wisdom that factual telly couldn’t afford to create CGI dinosaurs as convincing as the ones from the Jurassic Park movies, it opened with Kenneth Branagh’s narration confidently claiming that we were about to be transported to the Earth as it was 65m years ago. Then it pulled off this incredible illusion.A T-rex with lips? Predators with pink eyebrows? Walking with Dinosaurs is back to challenge everything you knowRead moreIn the quarter of a century that has elapsed since then, much has changed. Palaeontologists have advanced their knowledge, discovering new species and coming to the realisation that not all of their conjecture about what dinosaurs looked like was correct. Now, we know some of them had feathers, or fur, or were brightly coloured, when previously we’d envisioned them all as a uniform reptilian greeny-brown. And, in TV, the dream of making a dino show that is indistinguishable from nature programmes shot on live cameras in the present day (because the computer-generated monsters are so realistic) has got closer and closer.Reviving the Walking with Dinosaurs brand suggests that we are about to take another ground-shaking leap forward. But, it would be surprising if the increasingly extinct-smelling BBC of 2025 were able to perform the same feat it did in 1999 – and it hasn’t. The new Walking is a decent dino documentary and nothing more: it’s fine but compared with the competition, it feels cheap and tired.We start at an archaeological dig in eastern Montana, which Bertie Carvel’s voiceover describes as “a vast, untamed wilderness”. To confirm that his script will be happy to use cliches that are almost as old as the fossils in the dry Montana dust, Carvel then informs us that the team from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences is excavating an “iconic species” – a Triceratops.Specifically, the scientists are exhuming an animal they have nicknamed Clover, a dog-sized baby Triceratops who died when she was around three years old. Cue the digitally created pictures of Laramidia, a continent that was the lush, green ancestor of what we call North America. Clover is surviving alone, bewildered by run-ins with the intimidating pterosaur, Infernodrakon – which hadn’t been discovered back when the original WWD went out – and surviving attacks from her most feared predator, the Tyrannosaurus rex. The ill-fated Clover tries to tag along with a passing adult Triceratops, but the show imagines a Disney-ish dynamic, where the old-timer can’t be doing with an annoying pup, so Clover has to join a herd of the cow-like Edmontosaurus instead.The visuals are certainly better than they were 25 years ago, but they have a slight jerkiness that doesn’t look totally cutting-edge. Viewers who have immersed themselves in Prehistoric Planet, the stunning2022 Apple TV+ seriesnarrated by David Attenborough, are being asked to take a step backwards here: that show was so crisp and smooth it actually achieved the impossible and felt real.As if it knows it can’t compete, the new Walking with Dinosaurs changes direction. All dino documentaries are based on the work of palaeontologists, and they usually mention what recent breakthroughs have been made. Here, however, we regularly leave the Clover story, return to the present and watch those experts carry out everyday tasks in a way that is painstaking to the point of tedium. As soil is brushed away, bones are measured and facts are delivered verbally by experts, instead of being illustrated by Clover the anthropomorphised digital dinosaur, it’s not clear who Walking with Dinosaurs is aimed at. Dinosaurs are massively popular with primary-schoolchildren, but it tends to be an interest that doesn’t survive the asteroid impact of puberty; of course there is a section of a Sunday teatime audience that might grow up and retain a desire to become the next generation of palaeontologists, but perhaps showing them real palaeontologists at work isn’t the best way to encourage them.The science and the drama do interact effectively on occasion. In one thrilling sequence, vascular channels on the surface of a Triceratops bone lead the museum guys to surmise that the creature could change the colour pattern on its frill; then we see an adult Triceratops doing just that, making it look as if it has a pair of giant, blood-red eyes to scare off a T rex. Kids who haven’t become too fidgety during the science bits will also enjoy a neat twist at the end of the fictional Clover story, guessing at how she might have survived for at least a little longer. But when the bone-diggers of the future look back, this won’t be the dinosaur documentary they remember most fondly.Walking with Dinosaurs aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sick of reporting on Love Island, she wants to write about something worthy of a Pulitzer prize: death. Specifically, our societal reluctance to broach the subject.She visits a hospital to get the inside scoop from dying people. But she’s also having symptoms of her own and when she’s diagnosed with a rare illness, primary sclerosing cholangitis, things unravel.Olive’s journey echoes Madeley’s – she’d been interviewing terminally ill people for a show about death when her diagnosis arrived – and there are fun intrusions from the real story, this self-awareness cutting through Olive’s self-absorption.While Olive was ready to probe strangers about their mortality, she struggles to face her own. She pushes away supportive fiancée Tess, and starts partying, running and behaving increasingly recklessly.It’s just Madeley on stage, but other characters appear as audio clips, Madeley seamlessly interacting with them in a sparky and charismatic performance. She’s in gym gear, a treadmill and exercise ball as props, and pointedly runs away from her feelings until she can’t run anymore.This is all played for comic effect, Olive’s existential crisis spiralling into farce. Olive’s well drawn as a self-congratulatory young woman, blinded by her ego, but unable to get a handle on her feelings and how her inability to confront them is affecting those around her. There are plentiful solid punchlines – “It occurs to me that my early death could be not the worst thing for my career” – and a great pull-back-and-reveal when Olive’s left questioning her sanity.The extreme comic escalation somewhat dulls the emotional resonance, a sense of jeopardy is missing. But the pace of the show, directed by Madelaine Moore, keeps us invested, the closing scenes imploring us to appreciate the love in our own lives.At Park theatre, London, until 7 June.Explore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Dating from 1916 and written for 24 solo players, it is cast in the form of a ceaselessly evolving single movement, though its four sections echo and approximate conventional symphonic structure. Strauss and early Schoenberg lurk behind the scoring, which has an ornate, jewelled glamour, sometimes described as being like a Klimt painting in sound. Elder, clearly fond of it, lingered, sometimes a bit too much, over its sensuous textures, teasing them out with exquisite finesse and eliciting some gorgeous playing from the BBCSO in the process.The same attention to textural detail characterised the performance ofMahler’s Das Lied von der Erde that followed after the interval, an interpretation of unsparing intensity, magnificently controlled. Speeds were carefully calibrated, and Elder’s slightly slower than usual tempo for Von der Jugend captured a poignant nostalgia behind the surface elegance, while the almost reckless momentum for the horsemen in Von der Schönheit immeasurably heightened the sense of yearning their appearance provokes. The sheer weight of orchestral sound was electrifying at the start and the ending immaculate in its reflective beauty. Elsewhere instrumental solos, played with exceptional refinement, seemed to call and echo across open spaces and voids, heartbreaking and desolate.Alice Coote and David Butt Philip were the soloists. Coote’s voice has lost some of its opulence of late, and a hint of metal occasionally creeps into her upper registers. Her artistry remains intact, however, and she has always been superb in this work, slightly declamatory in her delivery, words and emotions deeply felt, yet etched with restraint and great dynamic subtlety. Butt Phillip, meanwhile, was simply revelatory, tackling some of the most demanding music ever written for tenor with astonishing ease, ringing fullness of tone and verbal clarity, even in the most implacable high-lying passages, all of it balanced with soft singing of immaculate warmth and sensitivity – a truly outstanding achievement in a very fine concert.Broadcast on Radio 3 on 27 May then available on BBC Sounds for 30 days.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Symphony OrchestraBarbicanMark ElderreviewsShareReuse this content"

A battered mannequin lies splayed on a bare stage. A huddle of women carry on bodies, gashed, broken-boned and in one case, headless. These are their children, grown-up, lifeless, eternally loved. Sometimes you think their words are coming, in pregnant pauses when they stand before microphones, as if about to speak. Yet no words emerge. The meaning of this becomes apparent: how do you find language to express the maternal anguish featured in the eviscerated space here?Milk was conceived by Bashar Murkus in 2022 but it could just as well have been made in response to the current killings of Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces – so many of them mothers and children inGaza. That this production feels so hauntingly relevant to the present moment says something about the circularity of violence for those living under occupation in the region.But the production is not so much concerned with the politics of conflict as its psychological effect on mothers. The show, directed by Murkus and produced by Khulood Basel, takes us into the realm of the emotional, and eternally repeating, in which these mournful mothers are caught. Lactation is a powerful visual tic, signifying the life-giving force of a mother, as well as the pain and waste of this milk in the face of death. There are moments of joy and fecundity amid the desolation, but the memory of child-loss always returns.View image in fullscreenSearing images … Milk.Photograph: Eid AdawiThe language of music, movement and visual imagination is deployed with visceral effect. A cast of six women (Salwa Nakkara, Reem Talhami, Shaden Kanboura, Samaa Wakim, Firielle Al Jubeh, Samera Kadry) and one man (Eddie Dow), give extraordinarily physical performances. But most devastating is the stillness that reflects their anguished paralysis and shock.The grieving takes place in non-chronological time: women give birth to grown men or cradle their adult dead, cooing or kissing them as if they were babies. Majdala Khoury’s set design reflects a generalised catastrophe rather than a specific war. The empty blackness gives the sense of a razed space in which smoke and heaped rubble are conjured in symbolic ways. It is eerily reminiscent of the real-life images of some parts of Gaza, flattened and devoid of life. There is melancholic lighting by Muaz Al Jubeh, and music by Raymond Haddad, which gives the production its plaintive poetry.Part of theShubbak festival, numerous searing images resonate: a pregnant woman digging at the rubble, heaped dead bodies and a final, tragic, tableau of the women caught in this catastrophe. It is an appalling register of accumulating and unspeakable pain.

Yes, Faust has celebrated musical moments which are a pleasure to hear sung well. Yes, Gounod’s score eventually becomes more interestingly chromatic as the denouement nears. And yes, David McVicar’s darkly gothic production, now with 21 years’ service on the clock, successfully removes it fromGoethe’s intellectual shadow, turning Faust into a theatrically boisterous Parisian show reminiscent at times of Les Mis or Moulin Rouge.McVicar’s production is revived, amid Charles Edwards’s towering Second Empire sets, by Peter Relton. You immediately grasp why this 1860s French setting is still one of Covent Garden’s most bankable productions. Yet, for all its mix of panache and musical charms, well marshaled under Maurizio Benini’s experienced direction in the pit, Faust struggles to hold the attention, not least because of the final act ballet that Gounod added a decade after the 1859 premiere.View image in fullscreenCarolina López Moreno and Stefan Pop as Marguerite and Faust.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn the end, Faust still depends on singers who can make Gounod’s beguiling music convincing. Over the years, Covent Garden has relied on a steady stream of notables in the roles on which the work’s reputation rests – the restless Faust, the devil Méphistophélès to whom he sells his soul, and the innocent Marguerite whom Faust seduces. There have been exceptional singers of the roles of Valentin and Siébel too. This production, for instance, launched in 2004 with Roberto Alagna, Bryn Terfel and Angela Gheorghiu.The current cast cannot match that vocal star power. That’s particularly obvious in the case of Stefan Pop in the title role, whose singing rarely ascends above the level of reliably solid. Making Faust either believable or sympathetic is tough, and while Pop undoubtedly has the stamina for a demanding role, the voice offers little in the way of elegant tenorial phrasing and grace, while his diction is muddy and his acting minimal.As so often, it is Méphistophélès who commands the attention whenever he is involved, and Adam Palka, deputising impressively for the originally announced Erwin Schrott, has both voice and stage presence to do so most of the time. Boris Pinkhasovich’s big baritone gives a reliable rendering of Valentin’s famous aria in act two, though nuanced it is not. Hongni Wu is an attractively bright voiced Siébel. But it is left to Carolina López Moreno’s Marguerite, the opera’s most interesting role, to bring real vocal distinction to the evening. After a suitably demure start, López Moreno brought contrasts of mood and tone to Marguerite’s ballad, followed by a pinpoint bright Jewel Song before impressively dominating the tragic (though simultaneously banal) final trio.At the Royal Opera House, London, until 10 June.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

Similar folk music clubs have since started in other cities including Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø.Musician Tuva Syvertsen started Tuvas Blodklubb, which she describes as “Norway’s, probably the Nordic region’s, and maybe even the world’s first pure folk music nightclub”, seven years ago with the aim of opening up the kinds of experiences she was having at folk music festivals to more people, particularly among the LGBTQ+ community.View image in fullscreenTuvas Blodklubb in concert.Photograph: Knut UtlerInspired by Oslo’s techno music scene, she wanted to make folk music less “stiff” and create an event that attracted younger people. “I wanted to have a place that you could go and get wasted and dance to folk music on a Saturday,” said Syvertsen, 41, who is in the band Valkyrien Allstars. “So that’s what we did.”Part of its gen Z appeal, she believes, is the sense of rootedness it offers in an uncertain world. “Young people feel that the world is unsteady as it is and they seek something real, something warm and close to them. So maybe that has something to do with it,” she said.Valkyrien Allstars.Norwegian folk music, which dates back hundreds of years, is played using traditional instruments including Norway’s national instrument,hardingfele(the hardanger fiddle),bukkehorn(an instrument made from a goat’s horn) andlangeleik(a stringed instrument similar to a dulcimer).The Sámi vocal tradition ofjoiking, which for a long time was banned in schools as a result of racist assimilation policies by the Norwegian government, is also being revitalised by younger generations and artists such as Marja Mortensson, 30, gaining mainstream recognition.The Sámi people are the Indigenous population of Sápmi, a region covering northern Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden, who have been subjected to widespread discrimination.“As long as you know the tradition it’s very important that joiking also lives in popular music or where young people listen to music because that’s how traditional music will live on and be passed on to younger generations,” she said.It is especially important, she added, to have spaces for traditions to live where people can be exposed to traditional folk music. “It gives you some kind of strength to know your own music tradition,” she said.View image in fullscreenPeople dancing at a Tuvas Blodklubb concert.Photograph: Knut UtlerDance is a big part of the Tuvas Blodklubb nights. Before each club night, Syvertsen puts on sessions to teach people the basics beforehand, which she said are also “packed with young people that want to learn”.Many young clubbers, she said, are not used to dancing to live music, but with folk music the interplay between musician and dancer is key.“An actual person sitting there playing for you, that is way different to dancing to a DJ. It’s much more sensitive. Not on the dance itself but in the chemistry between the dancers and the musicians, that’s really essential.”As well as booking live performers and DJs from around the world, she has a house DJ, DJ Sissyfus, who plays electronic music and makes remixes of old folk music recordings. Sometimes she also books singers who sing along to fiddle tunes. “We put microphones under the stage so it’s just the sound of the voice and the foot-stomping. It’s really amazing,” she said.

Though I functioned well day to day, I was a heavy binge drinker and smoker. Unfit, obese and unhappy, on impulse I signed up to a white-collar boxing fight. I trained six days a week for three months, shifting three stone by fight night. Winning that fight was great, though turning my life around had been my main goal. After that, I started challenging myself regularly while raising money for mental health charities.My first 24-hour challenge involved ascending Pen y Fan – the highest peak in south Wales – 10 times in a row during the dead of winter. It was horrific, but it raised lots of money, so next time I wanted something even bigger. Having seen examples ofStrava artonline, I thought that might be a good way to get people’s attention. I decided on a big run in the Bannau Brycheiniog(formerly theBrecon Beacons), an hour from my home, and chose November to coincide with Men’s Health Awareness Month. A giant penis seemed the obvious way to represent this, plus it was undeniably eye‑catching. I researched previous examples made using GPS mapping, all created on foot in a single, continuous effort. Plenty of them were three or four miles long, but I was aiming for something on a much grander scale.View image in fullscreenTerry Rosoman running in the Welsh hills.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianUsing the Strava planner, I found a route resembling a shaft between England and Wales, right upOffa’s Dyke. I thought, “Brilliant. Can I tack on a little bell-end at the top, near Hay-on-Wye?” Yes, there it was. “Now, can I squeeze some balls on at the bottom?” The whole thing took shape very easily, taking in Crickhowell and Llangenny, and passing serendipitously through a village called Three Cocks. Only then did I realise the route was just over 72 miles (116km) long, with almost 10,000ft of elevation. But now I’d plotted the picture, I had to do it.I started and ended in Abergavenny, where I set off at 5pm on 1 November 2024, running for 12 hours in darkness. Friends were stationed en route to run alongside me for a while and keep my spirits up; likewise my brother was waiting for me right on the tip. Without their encouragement, I don’t know if I’d have made it. The first 20 miles were uphill, and after 50 I just wanted to die, yet still had the best part of a whole marathon to go.Bone-tired and wrapped in a Welsh flag, I crossed the finish line at 4.30pm the following afternoon, half an hour shy of the 24-hour mark. A local craftsman presented me with a 3D-printed cock and balls trophy. The giant manhood has also been recreated in cake form by my mother, to celebrate my 40th birthday, and I’ve even been a question on Have I Got News for You. Some have suggested my real aim was to make my name the top result whenever anyone Googles “world’s biggest penis”. Alas, it turns out the search terms have to be a bit more specific.‘I turned too soon coming out of the shark’s mouth’Samppa Tölli put on ice skates to etch a 16km image of a great white shark on to a frozen lake in FinlandView image in fullscreenSamppa Tölli (above) on Lake Hiidenvesi, where he skated a picture of a great white shark.Photograph: Juuso Westerlund/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: courtesy of Samppa TölliHiidenvesi is the second-largest lake in Finland’s Uusimaa region, north-west of Helsinki. My parents have lived near the lake since I was a kid, so I’ve known it all my life. In summer, I’d ride around the surrounding bike trails or go out in my kayak. I still live nearby. During the winter the lake freezes over, and in 2023 I spent a lot of time skating on it.After a couple of months, doing the same circuits started to feel a little repetitive. The idea of creating aGPSpicture on ice was an attempt to shake things up a bit. I decided to try an animal that lives in water and, though not a creature you’d naturally find in the lake, a shark seemed to fit. I adapted a simple colouring picture I’d found online that used one continuous line, then I placed it on to the map, making sure the fin and tail fitted neatly into coves around the shoreline.When I’m on my bike, I strap my GPS watch to the handlebars so I can always keep an eye on it. It’s trickier to see where I am on the map while skating, because I have to move my arm in front of my face. So when I skated the shark, I was moving more slowly than I usually would, a situation made worse by the fact the ice wasn’t particularly smooth that day. There was also fog that affected visibility – when I started, I couldn’t see more than a couple of hundred metres ahead. This meant I wasn’t able to rely on any landmarks to keep me oriented.View image in fullscreenTölli took two hours to skate this picture of an eagle.Illustration: courtesy of Samppa TölliAlthough making GPS art in a big open space offers a lot of freedom, it was difficult to work out exactly when to turn, and how much by. For example, I turned too soon when coming out of the shark’s mouth and had to skate back and fix it. I also had to make some compromises, such as the gills, which I chose to skate in a zigzag, rather than pausing and unpausing the recording so I could make a series of parallel lines.Overall, I was happy with how the 16km-long (10 mile) shark turned out. After Strava posted it on their Instagram page, I got a few new followers and some complimentary messages, which encouraged me to try more GPS art. The following February, I spent two hours skating a more detailed picture of an eagle, as a celebration of the sea eagles you see around that part of the lake during wintertime. As a child I dreamed of seeing one but never did – nowadays they’re rare in Finland.View image in fullscreenTölli’s most recent drawing.Photograph: Courtesy of Samppa TolliMy most recent piece, completed at the start of this year, was a response to someone who suggested I try a single-line drawing of a woman. The line was more than 7km long. I was unable to skate that one, though – there was too much snow on the ice on the day I’d chosen, so instead I did it on my cyclocross bike using spiked tyres. I don’t yet have a specific picture planned for next winter, but I’m open to suggestions.‘Chappell Roan performs with a punk spirit that appeals to me.I’ve also done Whitney and Pet Shop Boys’Frank Chan ran almost 75km to draw a portrait of singerChappell Roanin San FranciscoView image in fullscreenFrank Chan (above) and his drawing of Chappell Roan.Photograph: Cayce Clifford/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: courtesy of Frank ChanRunning is something I didn’t really embrace until I was approaching middle age – I ran the San Francisco Marathon in 2018 and just got hooked. There’s something about the meditative aspect of longer runs that appeals to me. They require a lot of training, of course, and you need to do most of your running at an easy pace. What better way to slow yourself down than to look at a map?That’s how I got into doing Strava art, which has the added advantage of encouraging me to mix up my routes. I’vedone all sorts, from pop culture characters like Ariel from The Little Mermaid to more personal ones like a picture of my mom tying my laces that I did for Mother’s Day. I’ve collaborated with another Strava artist calledLenny Maughanon images like Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam, where he ran God’s hand on the east side of the city and I ran Adam’s hand in the west, and I’ve created more meaningful pieces, such as spelling out the name ofAhmaud Arbery, who was murdered in a racially motivated hate crime while running in 2020.Music is a big thing for me, so that’s the subject I return to most often. Until recently, I’ve tended to stick to music I grew up with, such as punk and Britpop. The aim with my album-cover drawings is to ensure that people who know that particular sleeve art will recognise it instantly. When I did Actually by the Pet Shop Boys, people generally got that, though there were some who said, “Is that two ice‑cream cones?” Whitney Houston’s Instagram page re-postedmy Strava art versionof the photo from her second album – an absolute honour.View image in fullscreenChan’s GPS drawing of the cover of the Pet Shop Boys’ 1987 album Actually.Illustration: courtesy of Frank ChanI don’t think I’m necessarily the target audience for Chappell Roan, but she’d become such a phenomenon that she came to my attention. She performs with a certain punk spirit that appeals to me – she’s unapologetic and clearly has a sense of humour. I decided to recreate the sleeve of her debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, on the first anniversary of its release.The layout of San Francisco is pretty much a grid pattern. I can see how some older, pre-automobile cities might offer opportunities for more interesting routes, where you’re not so constrained by blocks, but there are moments where I can optimise things on the ground – for example, cutting across a parking lot might improve a diagonal. What I most want to avoid is missing a turn and offsetting part of the picture by a block – with Chappell, for example, I didn’t want to end up with one eye bigger than the other.View image in fullscreenChan’s GPS drawing of Whitney Houston.Illustration: courtesy of Frank ChanLike Whitney, Chappell was a three-day effort, covering almost 75km (50 miles). I tend to stop as it’s getting dark, or when I’m fading, then resume from the same spot the next day. Having decided on the scale of the runs, I work out how much detail I want to include, and which flourishes I’m happy to omit in order to avoid another couple of days’ running.There’s a certain degree of uncertainty with Strava mapping when running near tall buildings, as they can cause the satellite signal to glitch, and I took a wrong turn on the Pet Shop Boys piece, which means Neil Tennant looks as though he’s sticking his tongue out rather than yawning. I’m pleased with Chappell, though – I think she turned out great.‘We shared extraordinary moments. A world record was just the cherry on the cake’Frédéric de Lanouvelle and his daughter Mathilde used a tandem to cycle a 2,162km heart in FranceView image in fullscreenFrédéric de Lanouvelle and his daughter Mathilde (above), and their heart drawing.Photograph: Maite Baldi/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: courtesy of Frédéric de la NouvelleI have always been close to my four daughters and decided some years ago that it would be fulfilling to share a special adventure with each of them when they reached the age of 16. For example, my eldest daughter, Cécile, and I travelled to southern Morocco to run the 250km, seven-day Marathon des Sables in the Sahara desert. It was wonderful to experience this with her, but my second daughter, Mathilde, made it clear that she didn’t want to do the same thing for her 16th birthday.We struggled to come up with an original idea that felt equally special, until a colleague showed me a newspaper article about a group of French cyclists who had created the world’s biggest GPS drawing made by bicycle:a 1,025km dinosaur. Mathilde likes cycling, so I suggested we attempt something similar on a tandem.Five or six years earlier, we’d ridden a tandem for 600km round Île-de-France starting near our home in Paris. We had good memories of this adventure and decided that for our new one we should try to raise money for a charity. We choseMécénat Chirurgie Cardiaque, an organisation that provides heart surgeries for children in countries with limited access to such care. That’s why our route was planned in the shape of an enormous cartoon heart – starting and finishing in Lyon, the journey would measure 2,162km in total, almost 1,350 miles.We did only three days’ tandem training before the August 2023 trip, cycling more than 100km each time, but aimed to cover about 150km a day while making our attempt. On days where the landscape was mostly flat, we started at 7am and checked in at our destination – usually a pre-booked hostel or Airbnb – at 4-5pm. But on days with more uphill stretches, we sometimes didn’t finish until 8-9pm. Still, one of the benefits of riding a tandem was that if either of us ever felt particularly weak, the other could usually pedal a little harder to make up for it.We faced more serious issues than tiredness, though. Five days in, I had to mend one of the spokes on the back wheel and made a somewhat clumsy job of it. Less than an hour into our ride the following day, the spoke came loose again and got caught in the bike’s chain, breaking both that and the derailleur gears. Even the frame of the bike cracked. Less than a week into our adventure, it seemed we might have to abandon it entirely. Instead, local people rallied to help. A mechanic was found and everything was fixed in a few hours. There were no further major setbacks, but day 13 proved a particular challenge. We were in France’s Massif Central highland region and, although our surroundings were beautiful, the cycling was very tough.In the end, we completed the heart on the 16th day. Guinness World Recordsrecognised our achievement, though it was unofficially beaten a few months later by another French cycling duo who recreated the Olympic rings. Still, the adventure was never about the world record; that was just the cherry on the cake. The main reason was to share extraordinary moments and build memories with my daughter. We also raised enough for two children to have the operations they needed. We’ve met one of them, which gave us a great sense of satisfaction. Now my third daughter and I have just over a year to decide what we’re going to do for her 16th birthday. All we know so far is that it will probably involve horses.‘It captures my dog’s character, even if it does look like something scribbled by a toddler’Chiara Franzosi ran 60km around Edinburgh to draw her cocker spaniel, MilesView image in fullscreenChiara Franzosi with her dog, Miles (above), and the picture she drew of him.Photograph: Robert Ormerod/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIllustration: courtesy of Chiara FranzosiWhen I moved to Scotland from Italy about 10 years ago I was already hooked on running, but it was in Edinburgh that I really fell in love with the whole scene. I’d explore the city as part of my daily run and met many friends that way – and my partner, too. Gradually, I got into long-distance races and running on mountain trails. When Covid-19 hit and races started getting cancelled, I had to rethink my routine and find new ways to motivate myself, such as running up and down the Royal Mile 26 times.Not long after I’d completed my Royal Mile marathon, we bought a cocker spaniel puppy – I called him Miles. When I committed myself to running seven marathons over seven consecutive days in May 2021, Miles became the motivation for another of my training challenges. I’d been using GPS to create routes for my long runs, and had also seen some particularly impressive Strava art online. I thought, “Maybe I could do something like that, drawing one of the things I love the most?”I found a route above the Water of Leith that looked like it could be a spaniel’s ear, and working from there I started to see if I could achieve the whole dog. It became quite difficult to draw the back legs and tail, because the part of the city where they fell is quite industrial and made up of straight lines and sharp corners, which wasn’t ideal for the “freehand” effect I was after. But, after a bit of trial and error, Imanaged to drawsomething that resembled a 60km (37 miles) version of Miles leaping over the Pentland Hills.I’ve since bought a fancy GPS sports watch that allows you to check on your progress as you make your way round the route, but at the time of the run, in February 2021, I had a cheaper version without that feature. For the training runs, I’d refer to my Strava drawing and run different sections of it on different days. I remember getting a bit confused on the tail and having to back up – it was quite hard to remember everything by heart, but it did help take my mind off the distance.The day of the run was beautiful, but it had snowed quite heavily a night or two before, and some of the footpaths had been covered in drifts from passing snowploughs. I ended up doing a lot of hopping from side to side between roads and paths, and there was a quite treacherous stretch beside the Grand Union canal, where the snow had become icy. But starting at 7.30am I completed the run in just over six hours – not a bad pace given the conditions.I think “Cocker Spaniel Leaping Over the Pentlands” captures something of Miles’s character, even if it does look more like something scribbled by a toddler than some of the artistic Strava pieces I’ve seen other runners achieve around Edinburgh. I haven’t attempted any more Strava art since, but Miles is now my loyal running companion.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleGPSRunningCyclingDrawingArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We value our own and each other’s freedomAva and I grew close when I was her boss, and still with my ex-wife. I’m twice her age, and worried how that would appear. What if people confused us for father and daughter? I questioned whether I was a bad person. My daughter, who is four years younger than Ava, was disgusted at first, calling me a pervert, and my ex-wife was also understandably furious. They felt as though they had never truly known me. I feared I may have severed those relationships for ever, but I knew that, with Ava, I had the chance to be incredibly happy.It was months before we had sex. The first time we were intimate, we kept our clothes on. It was an intense experience. I remember her scent and how soft her skin was. I hadn’t been able to get an erection for a few years, which led to the death of my sex life with my wife, and I assumed that was it for me. With Ava, I’ve rediscovered pleasure. Not only sexually, but also the pleasure of being together.We both believe in female empowerment … and Ava likes to be spanked, which excites meIn sex, we have dominant-submissive roles. We both believe in female empowerment and equality, and we talk about that conflict, but the two can coexist. Ava likes to be spanked, which excites me. I also find her freedom a turn-on, so sometimes we roleplay scenarios where she’s been unfaithful and I’m punishing her. I like the idea of her being with other people, but it makes me jealous.We don’t call ourselves a couple. We value our own and each other’s freedom, and don’t want a conventional future where we fall victim to the mundanity of daily routine. Although we work together, we have decided we will never live together. I’ve found that cohabiting causes the desire to know everything about someone to fall away, and I always want to feel a deep interest in Ava.To me, intimacy is the time we afford each other. I feel most connected to Ava at the end of the day when I massage her feet and we talk about things that interest us. Sometimes I wake up during the night and we’re holding hands, so I start the day feeling loved, like I’ve been replenished overnight.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Rather than being attractive in a sweet, innocent way, as the restaurant’s name suggests, Moffat’s style – or swagger, to be more precise – is elegant but plentiful modern British cooking, featuring a scoop ofFergus Henderson, a nod toMark Hix, a dash of London’sQuality Chop Houseand a teeny touch ofToby Carvery.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Pork with rhubarb ketchup and freshly baked parker house rolls to drag through warm butter or hollandaise. Asparagus with a dippy egg for starters, or mussels and trotters on toast. Bread-and-butter pudding with brandy custard. You get the gist. This is Cool Britannia wearing a napkin bib with a side portion of rhubarb jelly and custard for pudding.View image in fullscreenA starter with swagger (and a dinosaur egg cup): Winsome’s asparagus with a dippy egg.ButWinsomeis far from a novelty restaurant. Yes, there are little playful touches here and there – dino egg cups, cow-shaped gravy boats and school dinner puddings – but it’s all done in such a sleek, cool and pared-back way. Moffat may be a hugely experienced chef, but this is his first proper bricks-and-mortar venture, working with Owain Williams, who, among many other restaurants, launched Liverpool’s rather brilliantBelzan, and Tom Fastiggi, ex head bartender at Manchester’s bold, glitzySchofield’s. Winsome has taken over a large, cool, airy space clamped to the side ofWhitworth Locke, one of those new-fangled co-working/hotel/gymnasium/cocktail bar/leisure/third spaces populated by bright young things on laptops. What is it exactly? An apparthotel? A cult headquarters? Never mind all that, this restaurant stands fully alone, so let’s just concentrate on Winsome.It is from the outset an attractive and lovable room, with a large open kitchen down one side and blue-aproned staff serving trays of sbagliatos and breakfast martinis laced withDuerr’s marmalade. Tables are large and well spaced, and topped with pale tablecloths topped with pale paper, presumably to protect the linen from spills. No such luck with us. Perhaps your family can share a platter of cylindra beetroot in goat’s curd without someone leaving a CSI Manchester crime scene smear; mine was not so successful. “I do apologise,” I told the staff as we gave back the empty plate after a feast of Tewkesbury courgettes in a glut of excellent olive oil that we’d spilled rather dramatically while grabbing our fair share. There’s something about Moffat’s cooking, however fine and highfalutin it may seem to be, that lends itself to the sheepish dry-cleaning of blouses. A plate of Brixham crab came with celeriac remoulade and a whole heap of mustard cress that weirdly reminded me of growing the stuff back at primary school. Another starter of incredibly rich fried wild mushrooms and shallots on a slick of well-seasoned pease pudding was similarly deeply nostalgic.View image in fullscreen‘Rich and nostalgic’: Winsome’s wild mushrooms and shallots with pease pudding.For mains, we shared a whole john dory, cooked perfectly and served in a pool of pale green pie shop liquor, and aCreedy Carverassiette of duck featuring rare breast, rendered skin and a jug of rich duck jus. It was a Sunday, so both came with all the Sunday lunch trimmings, which here involve cartoon-esque XL yorkshire puddings, carrot puree, roast parsnips and a thick piece of trencher bread topped with stewed beef shin in ale.This is confident, clever cooking that stays just the right side of earnest, or at least as earnest as a chef can be when he also serves up a dessert that is essentially a 1980s school sponge pudding with a scoop of milk ice-cream flecked with multicoloured sprinkles, or hundreds and thousands as they will for ever be known in my heart. In a further nod to the sainted Fergus Henderson, right at the end of the meal eccles cakes are offered with slices of St Sunday’s cheese from Cumbria.View image in fullscreenWinsome is ‘Cool Britannia wearing a napkin bib with a side portion of rhubarb jelly and custard for pudding’.Winsome may well be my new favourite restaurant, and it’s the new, big, generous beating heart of Manchester hospitality. It’s classy but come-all – bring your gran, bring your baby, no one need feel conspicuous.

Many foods are described as melting in the mouth, but these really did.View image in fullscreenThe one that started it all: the Cake Fridge in Bixter’s Viennese whirl. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.These relatively plain biscuits are known asSpritzgebäckin German, from the verb “to squirt”, because they’re piped or pressed from a special cookie tool rather than cut or rolled. The dough is, asRavneet Gillobserves in her first book The Pastry Chef’s Guide, “really simple … the knack is in the piping”. Somewhere between a fairy cake and a cookie, they’re fancy enough for a tea party, but easy enough to knock up, though the people at the Cake Fridge were, quite understandably, tight-lipped about their recipe.The flourPlain flour is the thing for a short, rather than chewy texture – readers in the US, Canada and other places that grow high-protein wheat may wish to experiment with specialcake flour, but in the UK, bog-standard plain is ideal. The protein content is relevant because, when hydrated and kneaded with sufficient force, these give dough its strength and elasticity in the form of gluten. Great for bread, but the kiss of death for a biscuit of this kind, which bears more relation to a shortcrust pastry (hence their Italian name,biscotti di pasta frolla).View image in fullscreenLeiths’ take on the Viennese whirl dispenses with a lot of the ‘faff’ involved in other versions.To minimise gluten development, work the dough as little as possible after adding the flour (though I’m not sure patting it together between two sheets of clingfilm, asRose Levy Beranbaum recommendsin her Baking Bible, is really necessary. Stirring it briefly together, as Susan Spaull and Fiona Burrell direct in their rivalLeiths Baking Bible, feels as if it should do the job almost as well, with rather less in the way of faff. Like Gill, bothMary Berryand Delicious magazine replace some of the flour with gluten-free cornflour.The sugarIcing sugar is the name of the game for a smooth, fine crumb, but too much will cause the biscuits to spread in the oven. Instead, keep the dough muscularly plain and add sweetness in the filling, or just give them a generous dusting of icing sugar before serving.The dairyAs pastry chef Nicola Lamb explains on herKitchen Projectsbaking Substack, “piped biscuits need to do a few things – first, be delicious, second they can’t spread too much when baking, and third, the dough needs to be soft enough to be pipeable. Unfortunately, points one and two are kind of mutually exclusive. When it comes to flavouring your biscuits, butter is the MVP. But butter, it melts and spreads. So, limiting the overall proportion of butter without losing flavour or texture is KEY.”View image in fullscreenRavneet Gill recommends filling her Viennese whirls with curd or even Nutella.Her solution is to add much less butter than some of the other recipes. Berry, for instance, uses equal parts butter and flour; Gill,DeliciousandBen Mims’ book Crumbsslightly less; and Leiths slightly less again – Lamb allows just half the weight of butter to the flour, butbrowns it first, to concentrate the flavour. She makes up for the loss by adding egg and milk to bring moisture and flavour to the dough without burdening it with too much extra fat (Leiths’ egg yolk and single cream do much the same job).I love the nuttiness and rich golden hue of Lamb’s browned butter, but my testers prefer the less Germanically precise-looking, but richer-tasting butter-heavy versions. Thanks to the lack of water hindering gluten development, however, browned butter cookies will always spread more than ordinary ones, so I’m happy to yield and go half and half, because taste always comes first, especially when precision piping isn’t really in your skill-set in the first place. That way, I can blame the butter. If you’d prefer a more classically perfect-looking Viennese whirl, skip the browning step.The flavouringsView image in fullscreenMary Berry sticks to the traditional buttercream filling for her Viennese whirls.Gill uses custard powder (cornflour, salt, colouring and vanilla flavouring) to give her biscuits colour, but I’m relying on the browned butter to do that job for me, while I’ll save the vanilla for the buttercream filling I’ve borrowed from Berry. If you’re planning not to fill your biscuits with icing or jam (or the Nutella or curd Gill suggests), or to dip them in chocolate as Delicious does, you may like to flavour the dough with vanilla, Mims’ lemon zest or the ground hazelnuts in the Delicious take. The latter is particularly good, and I suspect most ground nuts would work well here.The pipingMuch easier than it sounds – these biscuits are very forgiving, though, given the high butter content, they do benefit from a brief chill before baking, so they keep as much as their shape as possible in the oven while still tasting great.Perfect Viennese whirlsPrep45 minChill30 min+Cook15 minMakes20, or 10 sandwiches300g butter, if making browned butter or 240g softened butter if skipping that step55g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting¼ tsp fine salt, or a good pinch of coarse salt250g plain flour50g cornflour1 tsp vanilla extract(if not using buttercream filling)A splash of milk(optional)For the buttercream (optional)100g softened butter200g icing sugarA pinch of salt½ tsp vanilla extract, or flavouring of your choiceA splash of milkView image in fullscreenIf making browned butter, melt 180g of the butter in a light-coloured pan over a medium heat, making sure you have a heatproof bowl ready. Once the butter stops sizzling, whisk or stir it regularly to stop the milk solids sticking to the pan and, once it’s turned a honeyed, amber colour, tip into the bowl, solids and all, and leave to cool and set.View image in fullscreenMeasure 120g of the browned butter into a large bowl or stand mixer, add 120g ordinary butter and beat to soften (or, if not making browned butter, beat 240g plain butter instead). Sift over the icing sugar, add the salt and beat again until the mix is soft and spreadable, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.View image in fullscreenCombine the flour and cornflour, then add to the bowl with the vanilla, if using. Stir just until everything is thoroughly combined – do not overwork the dough. It should be firm, but add a splash of milk if the dough looks too stiff to pipe.View image in fullscreenLine two baking trays with greaseproof paper (stick it down with a little oil or butter), and prepare a piping bag with a large star nozzle – I used a 1½cm one. Pipe round swirls (or S shapes or fingers) across the trays, spacing them slightly apart; you can make them as large as you like, but I think about 5cm is perfect. Chill the biscuits on their trays for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, then bake for 14-16 minutes, until the biscuits are very lightly golden. Remove and leave to cool on the trays.Meanwhile, if you’re making the buttercream, beat the butter until soft, then sift in the icing sugar, add the salt, vanilla extract and a splash of milk to loosen, and beat again.View image in fullscreenIf making sandwiches, pair up biscuits of a similar size and shape, then spread the flat side of half of them with the buttercream (or jam or similar). Top with the remaining biscuits, dust lightly with icing sugar and serve.Viennese whirls,spritzgebäck,biscotti di pasta frolla… if it’s a sweet, soft biscuit that melts in the mouth, it’s probably from the same family, so share your favourite relatives!

It sounds as if your boyfriend understands thisEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriSun 25 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 25 May 2025 09.49 EDTShareI have been dating my boyfriend (we are both in our20s) for almost a year. I’m absolutely smitten. He makes me feela better person, and I believe we are really good together.Sadly, he doesn’t have a very good relationship with his family. I haven’t really seen this play out because I’ve notseen them together that often, but he’s told me about his childhood and that he discusses his family in his regular therapy sessions.I, on the other hand,have a really positive relationship with my family. I am aware of how much of a privilege this is, but I am worriedI can’t really understand how his childhood affects who he is and how he acts, and that I can’tsupport or know him properly.Hehas mentioned how unusual he finds a familythat spends time with each other and interacts positively, which breaks my heart.I would love to invite my boyfriend to spend more time with my family, but don’t want to pull him away from his own or seem like I’m “showing off” mine.We did a special trip to introduce him to my parents, and on some level, I feel like not doing a similar thing with his parents or siblings means he doesn’t feel as strongly towards me as I do towards him (I’ve only ever seen his parents in passing), which makes me sad. I know this isn’t the case, but it’s hard for me to separate emotion and logic here.It makes me feel unsure about our future. I don’t know what sort of parent he would make. I don’t know what sort of parent I’d make either, or whether we would even choose to have kids. I know a lot of the time people who have abusive parents make great parents because they know how it felt to have otherwise.Can you help me get some clarity on how I should think about this?Well, first: wow for being such an amazing and thoughtful partner. I went to UKCP-accredited psychotherapist Katherine Walker, who is the author ofStep Up,a book about blended families. “I would not underestimate the importance of what your relationship means to your partner,” Walker assured. “Having a safe and loving relationship with someone who encourages you to be your best self is the holy grail of what most spend their time searching for, and it sounds like you’ve [both] already found that!”Walker emphasised that it’s OK to have different experiences of our families: “You won’t be spending most of your time with them, so as long as your relationship itself is strong, everything else is a really lovely bonus. Diversity is vital. If we were all the same we’d never appreciate our privileges [as you do]; neither would we have the opportunity to observe a healthier dynamic and learn to question things when we are/were treated badly.”If and when you get to talking about children, a good idea might be therapy for both of you, to discuss your expectationsYou are right that how we are parented (and I would say how our siblings treated us too) affects us. But we can either choose to emulate that or challenge it and change it (or, what most people do: a bit of both). It sounds as if your boyfriend is already doing that by talking about his family when he wants to and going to therapy, so he’s changing the script. Walker explained that sometimes people are quite blind to how they were brought up and never think about it or discuss it. “When things are kept in the shadows,” she said, “and not worked with, we don’t have the opportunity to grow or learn.”Your relationship is only a year old. It’s young but sounds extremely promising. If and when you get to talking about children, a good idea might be therapy for both of you, to discuss what your expectations are (if only more people did this!).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

How can I help? | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead moreYou said in your longer letter that you didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable by asking questions, but both Walker and I think that, while you shouldn’t bombard him, it’s an idea to let him know that he can talk with you if he wants to. “If you can learn to develop a healthy and open communication style now, when your relationship is in its relatively early stages, it will pay dividends as your relationship matures,” she said. “It can also give him the opportunity to say how he feels about spending more time with your family. At the moment you’re projecting how you think he might feel.”Overall, there’s lots of promise in your relationship – for discussion, connection and a happier future.

I think the government currently disincentivises it. You pay more money, more tax, more stamp duty, all that sort of stuff, so I think the balance is about right.Yung YungI disagree with people buying a second property just to leave it empty. It destroys the community; local people can’t afford to buy. And the worst of it is, if it’s empty, the local people can’t even rent it. We both agreed that the government is doing quite a bit in deterring second home ownership. If you’re not a first-time buyer and you’re buying a second home, you already pay a premium. But I think people who have enough money to buy a second home might need more of a financial deterrent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I got out and I persuaded people; I was passionate about it. It wasn’t complicated for me in the slightest. Although I voted for Brexit, I thought the issue was horrendously complicated. I’ve got a view on referendums: if the issue is clear cut, don’t ask the people, just legislate; and if the issue is too complicated, never have a referendum.Yung YungHe mentioned how the EU had treated Greece really badly. That seemed to be his main reason for opposing EU membership – he really, really likes Greek wine. I voted remain, and, actually, I don’t think I had the chance to explain why.

But I felt like we kept trying to come to a consensus view, before we really agreed.View image in fullscreenFor aftersDavidOn immigration, the numbers have become huge – it’s distorting elections because we’re not having a national conversation about what we want in terms of workforce, and the whole argument is dominated by the small boats, which is a humanitarian crisis not a migration crisis. You could eliminate crossings tomorrow and it’s not going to change people’s experience of migration, because those numbers are tiny. It’s just been weaponised by the Conservatives and Reform.Yung YungHe said: “A million people coming in is too much.” But he didn’t really expand on that, and I felt that was a place he could have stood his ground or tried to bring me around to his point of view.

A large QR code on the machine offers to take you directly to the right website where you put in your card details before going on with your day. Only much later are you hit with the double whammy: money gone from your account, and a fine for not paying the genuine parking company.The rise in app- and phone-based parking payment has opened a new frontier for fraudsters: quishing – so called because they are phishing attacks that start with a QR code. The fraudsters stick the codes in places where you would expect to see details of how to pay to park. When you scan one, it takes you to a site where you are asked for your payment details – as you would expect when booking parking.One victim whoscanned a code in a station car park told the BBCthat the fraudsters tried to take payments then posed as her bank to get more information from her, before running up £13,000 worth of debt in her name.Last year, the UK’s Action Fraud received 1,386 reports of scams involving QR codes – a small number, but more than double that in the previous year. In just the first three months of 2025 there were 502, suggesting the problem is growing.Chris Ainsley, the head of fraud risk management at Santander UK, says it is hard to get a full picture of the scale of the fraud. “Unless drivers receive a parking ticket, a lot of people are unaware that their personal or card details were compromised in this way,” he says. “When it comes to reporting the eventual scam, often the fact that it originated through quishing goes undocumented.”What the scam looks likeA QR code where you might expect to see one – on a parking charge machine, on a post in a car park or sometimes on a public EV charger.View image in fullscreenBe suspicious of any QR code on a parking payment machine or signpost in a car park.

It will also ask for your car details, but that is likely to be just an attempt to convince you it is a legitimate parking website.You may later get a call from someone pretending to be from your bank who will use the information you have given and tell you that you have been defrauded and need to move your money to a safe account. The safe account is actually in the control of the scammers.

Do not click on it if it looks suspicious.When you land on a page through a QR code, check details to make sure it is not a fraudulent version. Giveaways include weird URLs and bad spelling. Check that the URL includes HTTPS, rather than HTTP, before handing over details.Keep an eye on your bank account and report any suspicious payments to your bank.Report the scam to the local council, police and car park owner if it is a private company.Explore more on these topicsMoneyScam watchScamsConsumer affairsMotoringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s something else available to teach kids during the holidays – their parents. See also: weekends and evenings.GoldgreenSweltering in a classroom in July and August, surrounded by sweatily-smelling kids and oozing unattractively oneself is not conducive to education. It’s been a very long time since I had to consider this (I may take a very different view if I’d had to find something for children to do in the long holiday), but the prospect of being in a populated environment through the heat of summer (which does assume we’ll get any) is not one that appeals.School is bad enough already – much of it a thoroughgoing waste of time. But at least in winter you’re out of the cold and rain, until some hearty fool makes you go outside for a nice healthy run through wet mud, so don’t make it worse than it is already.wightpaintThe long break is good for children to learn to use their imaginations, especially if they are not booked up with constant daily programmes or looking at their phones.RivermamaThree-term school year with the months of December, April and August off seems just the ticket.TeemytooksMost developed countries give their children longer summer holidays and have better educational outcomes. The longer breaks also give children a valuable bookend to the academic year and a chance to reset, re-energise and sometimes even reinvent themselves for the following one. The idea of further shortening their summer is only being floated to appease parents and businesses. Perhaps we should make decisions about children with their wellbeing in mind and not our own?stavrolebeauIn Northern Ireland schools close July and August. In my experience both pupils and teachers are exhausted by the end of June and the longer break is welcome. Play is an important part of the school experience and out-of-school learning helps children develop, too.SJM1960School terms are already devolved along with all other education matters. They’ve always been different in Scotland and Ireland from those in England. Climate is one of the factors as harvest times varied when schools were first established.MikePickenHolidays can be educational too.GorseBushEngland is tied with the Netherlands for six weeks’ summer break – the shortest in Europe. Summer break ranges anywhere from six to 14 weeks (Italy). France is eight, Sweden is eight to 10.I was a teacher for 33 years. The UK has some of the shortest summer holidays in Europe. Many other countries that seem to have much better educational outcomes than the UK have longer holidays. If the worry is that the kids forget what they have learned over the six weeks then we can’t be teaching them properly.HiDeHiA little detrimental. But at least with computers you don’t have to learn how to hold a pen all over again. I used to like it in uni and during A levels where we would finish early to mid June. Cheaper to travel than July and August, and August is a more mixed bag of weather. Plus if football season has started you need to be back at school to recreate the goals from MotD at break time. So I would go five weeks June into July and then put one week late September for that Indian summer vibe that tends to happen. And again, cheaper travel.catchytitledThe evidence around changing the school calendar, such as changing the summer holiday break, does indicate that this could have an average overall positive impact on pupils educational progress. It may, however, not be cost-effective for schools to implement compared to other approaches. Schools would also need to consider the workload and wellbeing of their staff.Grace Stokes, Education Endowment FoundationThirty years of secondary school teaching have taught me that the long summer holidays make no sense in terms of education and progress. Nor do three terms fit with the tiredness and fatigue children are clearly exhibiting along with teachers at the end of each term.Far better to have five fixed terms with shorter breaks in between to limit the loss of learning but also provide meaningful downtime. Easter should be the bank holidays only rather than two weeks so that the foreshortening of terms artificially to make the moveable feast fit is removed. More extended holidays across the year also allow for holidays to be taken outside peak periods.Sara Wells, by emailThe traditional six-week summer holiday is too long – by a week. While it remains part of our national rhythm, growing evidence suggests that such long breaks negatively impact learning, especially for pupils already at a disadvantage.For children from resource-scarce backgrounds, the summer can widen existing gaps. Without the structure, support, and learning environment school provides, too many pupils return in September having lost ground, not just academically, but socially and emotionally.Summer-born pupils too already contend with issues of maturity and school readiness; the long summer only compounds these challenges.For many pupils, particularly those with Send or historical attendance issues, being out of school for too long can create real anxiety about returning, which then feeds a cycle of absence and disengagement.We should also acknowledge the strain the long summer places on both families and staff. From a teacher’s perspective, most colleagues are already working during the final week of the holiday to prepare for the term ahead. And after five weeks, many children are ready to come back, so are the staff. Shortening the summer to five weeks and introducing a two-week break in October would create a more balanced, manageable calendar. Some authorities are doing this alreadys.An extended October half term could also ease the pressure many families feel to take holidays in June or early July. By offering more flexibility within the school year, we may be able to reduce unauthorised absence.Our education system must be designed to support those with fewest resources. More evenly spread term times would help create continuity, reduce the anxiety caused by long gaps, and allow schools to maintain more regular contact with those pupils who benefit from it most.Mark Barker, Sheffield, by emailLong school summer breaks are essential to growing, coming of age and forgetting that school ever existed. It’s a time for playing, kids losing themselves in building dens, exploring, cycling and letting time stand still. Mental health improves when there are no stresses. The long school break is one of the few times in a person’s existence when everyone can just be.Daniel Maclaren, by emailI grew up in 90s Poland where we would break for summer by the end of June. We had two full months free from school and it didn’t stop some of us from finishing top of the class. Rest and play enhances learning. Stop forcing kids to roast in classrooms in July, let them enjoy the elusive good weather and create provision for universal summer childcare.Agnes Panasiuk, by emailLook at the places that have longer holidays. Ireland has nearly double the summer holidays than the UK while also sitting just above the UK in most of the global ranking charts.It is clear the longer holidays in Ireland are not hindering Irish students – and they may be helping them.Let quality take the lead over quantity.Paul Hunt, by emailI find this question quite amusing as I find the UK system great. I’m an ex-pat in Italy with a daughter in school and find the school year here crazy. They get three months (yes three!) off in the summer, but then nothing during the year apart from two weeks at Christmas. No half terms, four days at Easter, and three days in February plus the odd bank holiday (which are often mid week so no long weekend, or fall at the weekend and they lose them altogether).They arrive to the summer completely dead after six months without a full week break. Their school days here are also crazy: 8am to 2pm, six hours straight with two 10-minute breaks, no play time, no lunch breaks, no outdoor space, just enough time to queue to use the toilet. It’s insane. So don’t complain about the UK system, if you ask me, it’s just perfect.ClimateUnboxedBritish summer seems to be frequently over by the end of July, so six weeks of grey and wet. A two-week autumn break so kids can properly decompress before the Christmas busy term would be ideal. Some UK counties do that now.GrundleAs a former working single parent, planning my kids’ summers began in January of each year. As a nurse, it was nearly impossible to get the common holidays off as hospitals run 24/7.I would generally engage with my children about what activities they would like to pursue during their breaks. Art? Music? A sport? A second language?Growing up with summers off, I look back at that time as mostly wasted. When I was older, and could have a summer job, that had value, but prior to that, I wish I’d had more opportunities to learn.Sadly, we could rarely afford fancy summer camps nor could we afford vacations to the country.For myself, for my children, I think the option to pursue new subjects (physical, academic, artistic) has more value than “free time”.RitaDLMy school had a lot of children with overseas family (mostly in India, some in the Caribbean). The long summer holidays allowed these kids to spend extended time with grandparents and cousins that just wouldn’t be possible if the weeks were broken up across the year.natfantasticMy partner was a teacher for many years. Back in the 70s, the local authority decided to try saving money by moving a week from the summer holiday to the Christmas break so that they didn’t have to heat the schools. It was horrible as the weather was too bad to go anywhere.sgiwenShould barristers have to defend the indefensible? Or should they be able to refuse clients?Read moreThe break is far too long. If you work it is a nightmare. There should be structured available quality clubs if it’s not possible to distribute the holiday across the year.sophieecpI’ve been a teacher for 15 years and by the end of the summer term, the children are absolutely knackered. Christmas isn’t really a break, it’s full on emotional stimulation. Easter is their first proper break and even that is now becoming a Christmas 2.0. Summer is their reset and it’s also the time they can just be themselves. They are pushed so hard in school now in a never ending pursuit of better. Doesn’t it need to quite as long? No. But move a week and bolt it on to a half term, don’t take away their summer by making a two week holiday. Give them a break, they need it.Andy Sutton, by emailMy daughter, who is at secondary school, heartily agrees that the summer holidays are too long and that you don’t get enough during the rest of the year. Summer holidays can be really boring when both parents are out at work, you live a bus journey from all your friends and your parents can’t even afford a week away: the appeal of lying in bed all morning reading a book palls after a couple of weeks.Meanwhile, so much of the Easter and Christmas holidays is taken up with being dragged round to relatives. Two weeks off the summer holidays and redistributed among the others would suit my daughter down to the ground.SpoilheapSurferWhen I was young we had long summer breaks. Best times. And then a longish break before Christmas. One would wait for it and cherish it more because it was awaited. I live in Germany where children have seven weeks’ long summer holidays. In Finland, which is very progressive re schools, the break is 10 weeks.LakehausExplore more on these topicsSchoolsNotes and queriesChildrenParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Knipe Scar, at the edge of the Lake District national park, Lowther’s acres sprawl around the shell of a ruined 19th-century castle. Wildflower meadows, bee-friendly tree hives and rambling woodland contrast with a parterre, sculptured hornbeams and a Sleeping Beauty-inspired rose garden designed byDan Pearson. Bikes and ebikes can be rented for pootling around the estate’s trails or perhaps a five-mile cycle to Ullswater. There is a Lost Castle adventure playground and a cafe. Before leaving, visit the west terrace for views across the Lowther valley to distant fells.Open daily, adults £15, children £10,lowthercastle.orgRousham House, OxfordshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Britain Gardens and Flowers/AlamyWhile filming his BBCBritish Gardensseries, Monty Don described Rousham as “one of my favourite gardens of all and one of the truly great gardens of the world”. Rousham is the handiwork of William Kent (1685-1748), whose imaginative use of follies, mysterious “ta-da” avenues and one of the earliest ha-has blur the line between fantasy and reality. A master of the unbroken view, Kent manipulated the landscape to create a harmonious flow between the garden, the surrounding countryside and Rousham’s castellated pile. The estate’s 10 hectares (25 acres) include kitchen gardens, a rill, classical statuary, cascades and a seven-arched colonnade overlooking the River Cherwell. The house is still owned by the family who employed Kent to reshape the garden centuries ago. No cafe or children under 15, but picnics are encouraged. House tours on request.Open daily, £10,rousham.orgParcevall Hall, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex KnightLaid out in 1927, Parcevall Hall Gardens’ 10 hectares surround a Grade II-listed Arts and Crafts-style house set in the Yorkshire Dales national park.

As 70 years’ worth of undergrowth was peeled away, the present owner discovered enchanting spaces, including a walled garden that dips in a graceful catenary curve and a woodland garden containing the remains of a 19th-century folly. Steps lead down to an enchanting “valley garden” where four waterfalls splosh into the River Cadnant. Some of the outbuildings and a gardener’s cottage have been converted into holiday accommodation, and guests have full access to the gardens and parkland.Open April-Oct, adults £11.50, concs £2.50-£10.50,plascadnant.co.uk.

Over three decades, a hectare of agricultural land has been transformed into a flourishing wildlife garden filled with more than 700 flowers, herbs, vegetables and trees planted with biodiversity and natural healing in mind. A rewilding and wetland area has encouraged native flora, such as the Northumbrian bloody cranesbill, to thrive. Visit the “spirit henge”, breathe in the fragrant camomile lawn, wander the labyrinth and buy products made with ingredients from the garden in the shop (proceeds to the registered charity). Dilston is on the Corbridge Heritage Trail, and a scenic 20-minute walk along the Tyne from Corbridge station.Open Wed-Sun, April-Oct, Fri-Sun, Nov-March, adults £8, concs £4,dilstonphysicgarden.comLeonardslee Lakes, West SussexView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stephen Tattersall/AlamyThis tranquil, Grade I-listed garden is home to redwoods, giant oaks and the renowned Loderi rhododendron hybrids.

The result, 40 years on, is a practical and creative triumph featuring beautiful gardens, an enfilade of lawns and an “apple walk”. Some of the traditional – and windproof – wildlife habitat lost to modern farming methods is now restored. The Arizona-inspired Desert Wash garden is planted with drought-tolerant plants such as South American bromeliads, agaves and aloe. The cornfield has self-seeding poppies, corn marigolds and corn camomile, and there are shelterbelts of Monterey pine, Italian alders, holm oak and eucalyptus.

At Cowden you can unpick the symbolism or simply enjoy the garden in its purest sense – as a tranquil space where everything is in its place. Cowden was inspired by the travels of a wealthy adventurer, Ella Christie, who commissioned Japanese horticulturist Taki Handa to design a garden in the boggy grounds of her home, Cowden Castle. A 10-year restoration, completed in 2023, was overseen by Chelsea flower show gold and best in show winner Prof Masao Fukuhara. The gardens undulate through woodland and over gentle hills dotted with cherry blossom, maples and acers. On the Christie Walk, you might spot Indian rhubarb, the heart-shaped leaves of the katsura tree and the petals of the Himalayan blue poppy fluttering in the breeze. Workshops include cyanotype printing and kintsugi (the art of repairing pottery).Open daily except Tue, adults £9.85, seniors £8.75, children £5.75,cowdengarden.comVann, SurreyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Vicki FlynnYou may have seen this 16th-century, English Heritage-listed house and its garden “rooms” on screen in Disney’s Christopher Robin, ITV’s Agatha Christie’s Poirot or the BBC’s 2017 adaptation of EM Forster’s Howards End. A Gertrude Jekyll-designed water garden is a highlight of the 2 hectares. Crossed by bridges and stone paths, the water garden contains 1,500 plants nurtured at Jekyll’s Munstead Wood nursery. Traditional rose varieties bloom in the Old Garden, and an orchard leads to a yew walk where pears fruit on a crinkle crankle wall and ferns sprout from Bargate stone – the medieval quarries that provided it can still be seen in the surrounding hills.Open Aprilto the first week in July, £10 (cash only),vanngarden.co.uk.

When owners John and Rosamund Wallinger purchased the 2‑hectare site in 1984, it was nearly derelict, but after they discovered the eminent garden designer’s original plans for the garden, they embarked upon a remarkable journey of faithful restoration. Situated east of Basingstoke, Upton Grey features wild, kitchen and rose gardens, the nuttery, and a yew-hedged formal garden filled with the hallmarks of Jekyll planting design: lofty hollyhocks and azure delphiniums, billowing phlox, poppies and campanulas.Open Mon-Fri, May-July, entry £7,gertrudejekyllgarden.co.ukIford Manor, WiltshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Peter/AlamyOne of Britain’s premier romantic gardens, Iford Manor meets formality with enrapturing naturalism: euphorbia and catmint soften the stone terraces, roses clamber up the columns; a 200-year-old wisteria romps in unbridled profusion. Located on the edge of the Cotswolds, beside the River Frome in Wiltshire, Iford was the home in the early 20th century of influential architect and garden designer Harold Peto, who augmented its Georgian roots with Italianate flare and finesse. There are intimate cloisters and grand steps, a tranquil Japanese garden, and masterfully positioned statues and architectural fragments, while more modern additions include an award-winning restaurant and bakery. For the last half-century, Iford has been under the stewardship of the Cartwright-Hignett family who, with current head gardener Steve Lannin, are continuing the garden’s expressive legacy.

He had looks, cash and some of the easy swagger of London done good.Nick was over 6ft tall and had nice white teeth, labrador eyes and a healthy quotient of melanin courtesy of the sunbeds at the health club he went to twice a week. Financially, Nick had done well for himself, creating a mobile phone app and selling it to a big company. He’d put some of the proceeds down on a small flat in west London – not bad for someone in his mid-20s with no family money. Nick had even helped his parents buy an apartment in Spain on the Costa Blanca where the family holidayed twice a year, frequenting English bars and greasy spoons with all the other English people. He bought a lot of designer clothes, too (Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Stone Island, Off-White, Hugo Boss). “Important to have the basics sorted,” he’d say, splashing Tom Ford cologne on his neck before a trip to Mayfair.I was clearly missing something: in particular, any concept of what he thought he was missing. The outward trappings of success were visible, yet internally there was a sense of inadequacy. Nick was not enough, or at least he thought he wasn’t, and somewhere out there was a course that would fix him.What the various dating and masculinity coaches were selling Nick was a fantasy of control. That if he performed a certain set of actions, he would get a reliable set of results. Unsettling variables would be extracted from the equation. All it would take was somebody with a bit of charisma going off on YouTube, then the credit card would be out; another workshop booked in three weeks’ time. He was a sucker for the promises of spectacular transformations and“guaranteed results for a limited time only and there aren’t many places left so register now while there’s still time”.I occasionally went out with Nick to the clubs and cocktail lounges of west London. Most of his mates from school were petty criminals, or wide boys from Fulham who were unreliable on a night out. They would drink too much and start talking about doing lines, and it wasn’t even midnight. Nick knew I was writing a book about the manosphere. He also knew that, as a freelancer, I had fewer excuses when it came to going out on a weeknight. I’d get a WhatsApp message in the afternoon asking if I was up for it. I’d reluctantly iron a shirt, put on uncomfortable shoes and tell myself that I might get some copy out of it.We usually ended up in a club in Mayfair. Nick might eventually approach a woman he was interested in. Occasionally, the two of them would go home together at the end of the night. She’d notice him, glance over a few times coquettishly, and then, after psyching himself up, Nick would glide over and introduce himself. From there it was usually smooth sailing: she’d like him from the off and he hadn’t done anything to ruin the magic. Yet when I’d touch base with Nick the following day, his recollection of the night would usually differ from my own. For him it was all about the techniques he had used in the club: the power stances, the “alpha” tonality of his voice and the dominant frame control.Nick’s emotional health would cycle through several different iterations. He would discover the latest influencer and seem content for a while. Feelings of self-doubt would recede while the hidden code retained its novelty. He would like to proselytise about it, too. We would meet at a bar or food court and he would wax enthusiastically about the latest stuff he was into. “Women want a leader of men, but society put us inside these boxes and made us passive,” he said while making the shape of a cube with his hands. “That way, we aren’t a threat to the status quo.” Nick would radiate confidence and authority as he let me in on some newly acquired piece of forbidden knowledge. After a month or so of this, the disillusionment would steadily kick in. Nick was a poor disciple, for the same reason he was good with technology. He would always discover some flaw in their inelastic models of the world – some nugget that didn’t quite sit right. Nick would take a few steps back and his search for answers would start over again, the zealous apostle metamorphosing back into the angst-ridden sceptic.Dating is increasingly depicted as a winner-takes-all world in which a small percentage of men at the very top take the spoilsNick reckoned he was 15 when his dad tried to have a solemn talk with him about women. “He acts like he knows a bit because the only woman he ever asked out said yes,” Nick, whose parents had been married for 25 years, told me through a smirk. “In his mind he’s got a 100% success rate.” The Talk made Nick cringe still 10 years later. “He said if I liked a girl, then I should buy her flowers, make a gesture and show her how I feel.” I asked Nick if he’d ever tried his dad’s approach. “Once,” he told me – when he was 16. “Nothing really happened. She didn’t take the piss, which was what I was most worried about. But it went nowhere. She ended up getting with another guy who wasn’t doing any romantic stuff. He used to take the piss out of her in class. I thought he was being a dick. But there was another level I wasn’t seeing.”Nick had been looking for a girlfriend when I had first met him in Miami. He had a whiteboard in his room with a “vision” on it for where he wanted his life to be in six months’ time. He was fully bought into the self-help dogma about building momentum and improving – always improving. He planned to drop down a few percentage points of body fat, listen to more audiobooks (always on 1.5x speed) and find a quality girl to spend time with on weekends: someone to go out to restaurants with or watch films with on a rainy day. When Nick told me about the vision board, his goals sounded achievable and I was tentatively in favour of them. However, a few months later he scrubbed out the third goal and wrote a new one in its place. This one was more ambitious; it also seemed to have been implanted in Nick’s head by someone else. Finding a girlfriend was no longer one of the objectives. Now he wanted a “rotation”: a micro-harem of women who would share him between themselves and never demand exclusivity. “Women would rather share an alpha than get with a beta,” he told me, ventriloquising some red-pill huckster I had definitely heard say the same thing.The manosphere has long divided the world into rigid and distinct hierarchies. Women are rated on a scale from one to 10. Men apply a similar taxonomy of social rank to themselves and each other. There are alphas and betas; red-pilled and blue-pilled; high-status and low-status. With the advent of social media, the process of stratification intensified.Datingis increasingly depicted as a winner-takes-all world in which a small percentage of men at the very top take the spoils. The rest are surplus men, condemned to a life of onanistic obstinacy.In one sense the manosphere reflects wider market logic, which continually pushes its tentacles into new areas of life. Instagram launched in 2010; 10 years later it was home to 1.4 billion users. For some of them, life would steadily become a series of monetisable content opportunities. For others, this and similar platforms fostered subjective feelings of pauperisation. Users were more keenly aware of what they didn’t have; who their competition was; and how they were failing to market themselves correctly as consumable brands. At around the same time, dating apps were injecting market logic into the intimate domains of love, sex and romance. The LGBTQ+ app Grindr went online in 2009, followed by Tinder in 2012. Other people were becoming two-dimensional objects, marketed to potential consumers via these digital catalogues of flesh.In the manosphere, these technological developments helped to spur the emergence of two contrasting – and mutually antagonistic – communities. “Incels”, a shorthand for involuntary celibates, subscribe to an ideology they call the “black pill”. Followers of the black pill accept most tenets of the red pill. Sex and relationships are viewed as rigid and hierarchical. Women, whom they depict as shallow, deceitful and opportunistic, are said to be “programmed” by their biology to sort men into desirable alphas and repulsive betas.Menoutside the community are viewed as “blue-pilled” and brainwashed. Intimate relationships take place within a “sexual marketplace” (SMP). “High-value” individuals have a greater sexual market value (SMV: exchange value) than “low-value” individuals.If the blue pill is synonymous with ignorance and the red pill about understanding the matrix to manipulate it, the black pill is rooted in the decision to relinquish hope altogether. Incels see themselves as the unwanted detritus of successive sexual and social media revolutions. Refusing to compete with the torrent of perfect images, they stew in nihilism and despair, denied access to the main currency of masculinity: women’s bodies.Nick wasn’t an incel; he was one of the men who saw incels as a cautionary tale – the ultimate destiny of anyone who failed to mould themselves to the dictates of the digitised sexual marketplace. These men subscribed to many of the same reductive theories as the incels. They knew all about “SMVs” and – in common with just about every other faction in the manosphere – they frequently made men and women sound like eBay collectibles. Yet they were status-maxxers. Instead of marinating in resentment on subterranean forums such as 4chan and Reddit, they were spending eye-watering sums of money in the hope of joining the digital sexual elite. And, inevitably, a new generation of masculinity salesmen were on hand, promising to make their dreams come true.By the summer of 2022, London was getting Nick down. He’d recently attended yet another pick-up bootcamp. The instructor had got the students to do “social pressure drills” in and around Leicester Square. First, he made them pair up and stand on opposite sides of the street in Piccadilly and yell at each other. Then he had them tap a stranger on the shoulder and attempt to start a conversation using gibberish – for example, “Orange peels. I like orange peels.” The exercises were meant to desensitise the students to rejection so that, later on, when they were in the thick of the action in the nightclub, things would seem easy by comparison.It was the final drill that did it for Nick. The instructor told the men to attach themselves to lamp-posts in one of the city’s busiest thoroughfares. They were then to simulate having sex with it. Nick did what he was told because he was “trusting the process” (another self-help dictum). As was often the case on these programmes, clients would spend a lot of money and then rationalise it by following orders.Nick located a suitable piece of street furniture and took up the position. He began with a gentle motion of the hips. The instructor was bearing down on the students, ensuring they were pushing through the fear. “Let’s see some enthusiasm, guys,” he bellowed. “Imagine you’ve just pulled a hottie back to yours from the club. Visualise it.” Nick tried closing his eyes to shut out the passing crowds. He started pummelling away until he reached a steady rhythm. He felt himself letting go as the crowds began to dissolve; maybe it didn’t matter what people thought of him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He snapped back to reality and looked down: his phone was vibrating inside his trouser pocket. The instructor was berating another student who had detached himself from a lamp to swat away some tracksuited teenagers. Nick slipped his phone out surreptitiously and saw the word “Mum” flash on the screen. He had spoken with her already that day but he took the call anyway; he assumed it must be important. She sounded choked up when he answered. It was his grandad. He hadn’t been answering the phone all morning, so one of Nick’s cousins had gone round. He’d had to go in through an upstairs window because their grandad wasn’t answering the door either. Then he found him still lying in bed, propped up by a couple of pillows. He’d died during the night. “It was a lot to take in,” Nick told me.Men like Andrew Tate showed Nick it was OK to have muscles, a sports car, more than one girlfriend. And you weren’t ‘toxic’The instructor wasn’t letting up, though. “Fight the fear,” he bellowed as Nick nestled the phone between his shoulder and ear, and listlessly gyrated his hips. “People in the street had completely faded out by that point,” he said. “I wasn’t feeling fear because I wasn’t feeling anything.” His mum was still on the line, fussing about her dad’s affairs that would need sorting. Had his grandad wanted to be buried or cremated? How should he know? He was still half-heartedly going at the lamp-post when the first salty tear ran down his cheek and into his mouth. At that point, “ it was like: what the fuck am I doing with my life?” Nick finally gave up when a drunken woman kicked him between the legs from behind with a bulky heel. The pain took a moment to reach his stomach but when it did, it brought welcome clarity. Nick said goodbye to his mum, wiped his eyes on his sleeve and tottered to the nearest underground station, hunching over to dull the pain.Talking to Nick, the same names kept coming up: Michael Sartain, who charged students as much as $10,000 to attend his Men of Action course, which he likened to Noah’s Ark – a life vessel designed to rescue them from the rising swamp of involuntary celibacy; Dan “Blitz” Bilzerian, the self-proclaimed “king of Instagram”, widely known in the 2010s for his ostentatious portrayal of bachelorhood;Andrew Tate. There were other influencers, too, whose names I hadn’t heard before. I would look them up and invariably see the same loud and in-your-face wealth – enormous houses, luxury vehicles, yachts, private jets. But the most important prop of all was always the women, half-naked and willing – the more the better.Nick regarded the Tate brothers, Andrew and Tristan, as high-status men. They hadn’t beenarrested for suspected sex traffickingat that point; I just knew Andrew as this obnoxious guy from the internet. For Nick, however, men like him were showing the world that it was OK to have muscles and a sports car and more than one girlfriend. And you weren’t “toxic” or “problematic” for wanting those things. A normal life seemed boring by comparison. Nick agreed with Tate when he said that not every man wanted beans on toast, television at night, a nine-to-five job and a homely wife. Some men had a fire inside them, and Nick believed he was one of them.‘There were no warning signs’: what happens when your partner falls into the ‘manosphere’?Read moreThere was also the question of expediency and not being left behind. “It does get rubbed in your face more nowadays,” he said one day out of the blue. “You see some guys getting all this attention.” From this, Nick had concluded that women were no longer interested in “average” men. Instead they wanted the best. Not just some women butallwomen. He was convinced he needed to lay the foundations of a high-status lifestyle. “Social media has ruined it for average guys,” he told me one night while we were at a bar in east London. “Girls see what they’re missing out on. Polygyny is nature’s equilibrium, and we’re going back there because it’s a better proposition for women than being with a beta.” Nick had been watching YouTube, listening to red-pill podcasts. He’d also been reading up on evolutionary psychology, comparing the events that supposedly took place in our ancestral past with the things he was seeing on social media and out at the club. The reality was brutal and shouldn’t be sugar-coated.Nick liked to point out that 16 million men in the former Mongolian empire were direct descendants of the warrior-ruler Genghis Khan. “This is what happens when hypergamy goes unchecked,” he told me one evening during a catchup, blithely leaving out the raping and pillaging. “Look around you,” Nick said wearily. “High-status men have all the options.” We were getting food at Boxpark in Shoreditch, east London, on a wet and windy January evening. We were sitting at a picnic table. Next to us were some mixed groups of twentysomethings who, like us, were drinking beer out of plastic cups. “You really believe that?” I asked Nick. “On here I mean,” he said, waving his phone in the air. He then laid it on the table and took in the flesh and blood world for a moment. “They aren’t fucking those dudes any more,” he added, pointing to a group of men sitting at an adjacent table. “That girl, she’s probably talking to a high-status guy behind his back, or at least hoping he’ll slide into her DMs. That’s what social media has done; it’s changed expectations.”In this, Nick seemed to be parroting another red-pill guru, Rollo Tomassi, who has accused social media of“grossly inflating [women’s] egos”; others have described them as being “delusional” about their dating prospects. Of course, the most delusional thing here was the idea that social media was boosting women’s self-esteem. In fact, Instagram has made body-image issues worse for one in three girls, according tointernal Meta researchleaked to the Wall Street Journal. Inone studyof teenagers in the UK and the US, more than 40% of Instagram users who said they felt “unattractive” said they started to feel that way after using the app.I asked Nick if he thought his own sense of reality had been distorted at all by social media. (He admitted to watching internet porn for “at least 10 minutes” on most days.) “Maybe,” he replied before slamming the door firmly shut on that train of thought. “But I reckon I would want those things anyway,” he added. “As men, we aren’t programmed to be with one woman. Our proclivities weren’t created by reason, but by natural selection.”Nick was ventriloquising one of his favourite gurus again.This is an edited extract from Lost Boys: A Personal Journey Through the Manosphere, published by Atlantic Books at £14.99.

I canvassed almost daily in my constituency and found that we had completely alienated many former longstanding Labour voters over the winter fuel allowance and personal independence payment. On the door, their response was resigned anger, with many saying that we had abandoned Labour policies and they didn’t understand why. Most didn’t pivot to Reform UK, they simply didn’t vote.To U-turn any policy without some acknowledgment of it being a dreadful mistake will probably lead to even more anger and deeper distrust. We are not only losing voters but party activists as well. Members are resigning because of their disagreement with government policies on a range of issues.We need more than a U-turn. Instead, a complete reset is required, but I’m not holding my breath. I doubt that the current leadership is capable of doing anything without being forced into it and, if they do, that will enable the cheerleaders for Reform to make cynical political capital of the situation we find ourselves in.Ian JenkinsonNewcastle-under-Lyme, StaffordshireFinally,Keir Starmerreluctantly announces that the government is considering reinstating the winter fuel payment, at least for some pensioners, although the exact details have not been released as yet. He has done so because he’s been forced into it by public demand and belatedly realises that the appallingly callous decision is largely responsible for the fact that Labour polled so badly in the recent council elections.Starmer andRachel Reeveswill never be forgiven for this. Their reputation is now indelibly damaged, and quite rightly so. Ruthlessly targeting the poorest, most vulnerable members of society was indefensible.In 2017,Labour itself cited researchto argue that as many as 4,000 lives would be put at risk by Conservative plans to scrap winter fuel payments. So Starmer and Reeves would have been fully aware of the potential consequences of what they were doing. But they went ahead and did it anyway simply to save a measly £1.5bn.Linda EvansLondonThere are moral and pragmatic political reasons for a U-turn on scrapping the winter fuel allowance. Merely tinkering with the means-tested eligibility criteria will still leave some, potentially many, elderly pensioners vulnerable to the cold this coming winter, and the political fallout will continue unabated.It would be far wiser to make winter fuel allowance a universal non-means-tested benefit to ensure all those who need it receive it. Does it really make any significant difference to the exchequer if, as is often cited, a handful of millionaires was also eligible, given that they will have contributed more income tax during their lifetimes?Dr Guy SpenceBude, CornwallThere is a simple way of ensuring that those pensioners who need the extra help with their winter fuel bills get it, while those who are wealthy enough not to need it don’t – give it as a universal benefit and then claw it back through the tax system. That’s what taxes are for, among other things.Hazel DaviesNewton-le-Willows, MerseysideHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, we cannot justify building to that standard because the cost has risen over the past two years to £3,800 per sq metre for a 165-sq-metre timber-frame build.Obviously, if the nation’s housebuilding companies did try to build to Passivhaus standard, the costs would be less due to economies of scale but, given their constant complaining that they cannot afford to do so, and our government’s refusal to stipulate higher environmental standards, it seems highly unlikely that they will try to future-proof their often poorly built and designed homes. As for our desperately needed social homes, if building costs remain as high, how many will be able to be built to a Passivhaus standard?After extensive revisions to our plans, we are getting closer to building an energy-efficient home that incorporates many of the Passivhaus features, but at a lower cost and, potentially, a lower energy performance certificate score. Passivhaus standard should be the future for British housebuilding, but not at current price levels.Alan and Jane HillPerthOver 15 years ago as one of the trustees overseeing the renovation of the Mildmay Community Centre in north London, we went for the Passivhaus standard of serious insulation, solar panels and ground-source heating. Despite considerable opposition at the time, the building was the first retrofitted Passivhaus standard community centre in England. It is warm, beautiful and efficient.Passivhaus is a long established standard in Germany, and could and should be adopted in the UK for new builds. But as anyone can see if they visit our community centre, it is also perfect and appropriate for retrofitting old buildings.Jenny LittlewoodLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Her male passenger was also injured.Allan said the government first announced plans to ban machetes in March but, at the time, Victoria police advised that a six-month implementation period was the “safest” and “quickest” approach.“It took the United Kingdom 18 months to bring about a ban on machetes,” she said. “That was not a time frame that was acceptable to the government.”She said after Sunday’s incident she was briefed on powers available under commonwealth consumer laws, which allow a state minister to impose an interim ban on the sale of certain goods.Consumer affairs minister, Nick Staikos, said it was the first time these powers had been used to ban machetes.“This is actually the first ban of the sale of machetes anywhere in Australia, and it follows the decision by this government to implement the first ban on the possession of machetes anywhere in Australia,” he said.“We are using whatever powers we have under Australian consumer law to ban the sale and the supply of machetes immediately.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does not include knives primarily used in kitchens.There will be no exemptions to allow the sale of machetes during the interim ban, as Australian consumer law doesn’t allow it, Staikos said.Allan acknowledged it would affect some “legitimate users” of machetes but said she prioritised community safety above all.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailRetailers have been told to remove machetes from shop shelves and store excess stock in a safe location until the amnesty scheme begins on 1 September.From that date, machetes will be classified as a prohibited weapon in Victoria. Exemptions will be available only for legitimate uses, such as agricultural work.An amnesty period run from 1 September to 30 November, allowing Victorians to safely surrender machetes at 40 designated police stations across the state without facing penalties.After the amnesty ends, anyone found in possession of a machete could face up to two years in prison or fines exceeding $47,000.Explore more on these topicsVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

But as he waited for help, fearing the worst, some of his cattle had the same idea.“I had a heifer come into the bedroom,” Schlenert says.“She wanted to jump on the mattress and I had to actually push her back to get away from me. I felt bloody terrible doing it but it was either me or her. All I kept saying to myself was, ‘I am not ready to drown and die here. I don’t want to die here.”Schlenert spent a night huddled with his cows, surrounded by water, last week. When he was eventually rescued by a neighbour on a boat, he left with just his clothes, his cat and dog.When the water subsided and Schlenert returned to his home, he discovered five of his cows had died inside. Another three were alive in the home, but needed urgent care.The floods and droughts in Australia are fingerprints of a warming planet | Kimberley ReidRead more“People have said to me: ‘Why didn’t you have the doors closed?’ I did have them shut to try to keep the water out, but the pressure of the cows and the water was just too much,” he says.Like many farmers in the region, Schlenert is now burying his dead stock. So far, he’s discovered 15 dead cows. But he says about 70% of his herd has been washed away, unaccounted for. At the flood’s peak, the water rose until only a metre or so of the dairy’s roof was exposed.“We are trying to organise other farmers to take our cows to milk as the dairy is a total write-off,” he says. “We don’t have power and I assume we won’t have it for weeks.”View image in fullscreenKevin Schlenert (right) on his flooded property in Taree. Now ‘virtually homeless’ and staying with friends, he fears he is being forced to ‘give up on the industry’.Photograph: Dean SewellSchlenert, 57, is a third-generation farmer. He has now seen five major floods tear through the region, including in 1978, when the Manning River breached its banks. Now “virtually homeless” and staying with friends, he fears he is being forced to “give up on the industry”.“It’s just got to the point where I think this will send me bankrupt,” Schlenert says. “I think I have no choice. This is breaking point for me.”Peita Carroll, who runs a Sydney rock oyster farm near the Manning River estuary, says her stock has also been decimated. She has now endured five floods in five years. She says she won’t be able to sell anything for another two years.View image in fullscreenIndia Boss (left) and Chloe Graham (right) handed out cold beers to strangers sweeping mud and rubbish from mud-clad homes.Photograph: Dean Sewell/The Guardian“We always get left behind because no one sees our stock die,” Carroll says. “They see the cows and they see the sheep – this is a big farming area – people share the images. But this is our stock too.”Like many others, Schlenert and Carroll are mostly uninsured. This is not uncommon, according to the Insurance Council of Australia’s Andrew Hall, who says insurance rates for flood-prone areas are “less than one in four”.So far, more than 3,600 insurance claims have been lodged after the severe flooding across the mid-north coast, Hunter and greater Sydney regions. Four in five claims are for personal property, with the remainder being commercial and motor claims.“People who can least afford to lose everything are living in homes that were built in the wrong location and often have very little flood defences available to them,” Hall told ABC TV on Sunday.Hall says far more money needs to be spent on preventive measures, to limit the impact of future floods. While surveying the damage to his property and stock, Schlenert agrees.View image in fullscreenMachinery removes dead cows from Kevin Schlenert’s property.

They need to get them in place as soon as possible.”As the focus turns from rescue to recovery, thestate government has announced“a range of immediate support measures” for those affected by the floods, including hardship payments. Schlenert is pleading with the government to move as quickly as possible.The state’s premier, Chris Minns, acknowledges these payments have not always helped desperate people in a timely fashion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the 24 hours to Sunday morning, there were 328 incidents reported to the SES, including 16 flood rescues. More than 40 people remained in evacuation centres, unable to return home.While many people are now focused on rebuilding their lives, the SES is urging them not to become complacent.“I get why people want to get back on the road and get back into the communities where they can but again, my message is, do not go through flood waters,” says the SES commissioner, Mike Wassing.“I want to see zero flood rescues tomorrow. That’s my aim, and I need people to and the community members to help me in achieving that aim.”Explore more on these topicsFloodingExtreme weatherNatural disastersNew South WalesAustralia weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Devastating to see children among innocent victims harmed and killed … We need the strongest international pressure on Russia to stop this war.”MapKallas was echoed by Estonia’s foreign minister, Margus Tsahkna. “Another night of Russia demonstrating its ongoing aim to wipe Ukraine off the map with swarms of drones & missiles – including ballistic ones. Putin continues this until the pressure becomes unbearable. It’s in our hands to make him stop,” he wrote on X.Keith Kellogg, the US’s special envoy for Ukraine, condemned the attacks but without any mention of Russia or Putin. “The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva peace protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now,” hewroteon X.Late on Sunday, Donald Trump expressed deep unhappiness at the bombing of Ukraine, saying: “I’m not happy with Putin.”“I don’t know what’s wrong with him. What the hell happened to him? Right? He’s killing a lot of people. I’m not happy about that,” Trump told reporters at the airport in Morristown, New Jersey, as he prepared to return to Washington.Asked if he was considering more sanctions on Russia, Trump replied: “Absolutely.”Russian strikes hit locations across Ukraine on Saturday night into Sunday, from the southern coast and east to the west. Four people were reported dead in the western Khmelnytskyi region, four in the Kyiv region and one in Mykolaiv in the south.View image in fullscreenRescue workers extinguish a fire at a house destroyed by a Russian strike in Markhalivka village, Kyiv region.Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APIn Markhalivka village, just south-west of Kyiv, where most of a residential street was destroyed, Tetiana Iankovska, 65, told AFP: “We saw the whole street was on fire.”Another retiree who survived the strikes, Oleskandr, 64, said he had no faith in diplomacy. “We don’t need talks but weapons, a lot of weapons, to stop them [the Russians]. Because Russia understands only force, nothing else,” he said.Emergency services said four people were killed and 16 injured in the Kyiv region, including three children, in the “massive night attack”. The children were later identified as siblings: Stanislav, Roman and Tamara Martyniuk, who died when their family home in Zhytomyr region was struck.Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district was hit by a drone and one of its outside walls was on fire.Odesa, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Konotop, Chernihiv, Ternopil and Kharkiv were also hit, according to local media reports.The intensity and frequency of this weekend’s strikes contrasted sharply with Trump’s claim that Vladimir Putin was interested in peace.The attacks meant Kyiv Day – celebrated on the last Sunday in May – began with exhausted people sheltered in bunkers, metro stations and basements.View image in fullscreenA woman leaves her house after it was destroyed in a Russian rocket strike in Markhalivka, Kyiv.Photograph: Thomas Peter/ReutersWith waves of drones beginning at about midnight on Saturday, accompanied by warnings of ballistic missile launches as the night wore on, a Guardian reporter in Kyiv heard three drones reach the centre of the city, despite action by air defences, and the sound of loud detonations.There are claims that Russia has upgraded its missiles with radar decoys and evasive tactics to make them harder to intercept by Ukraine’s air defence systems.Russian authorities reported that a dozen drones flying towards Moscow had been shot down.In Ukraine, I saw Trump’s ‘peace deal’ wouldn’t just trade away land – but lives, memories and homes | Timothy Garton AshRead moreThe attack on Kyiv began with Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city’s military administration, warning “the night will not be easy” as residents tracked waves of launches on air raid warning apps.At one point, Tkachenko reported more than a dozen Russian drones were flying around the capital. “Some of the drones over Kyiv and the surrounding area have already been dealt with. But the new ones are still entering the capital,” he posted.Ukraine and its European allies have sought to push Moscow into signing a 30-day ceasefire as a first step to negotiating an end to the war. In a blow to their efforts, Trump this weekdeclined to place further sanctionson Moscow for not agreeing to an immediate pause in fighting, as Kyiv had wanted.Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram: “Without pressure, nothing will change and Russia and its allies will only build up forces for such murders in western countries. Moscow will fight as long as it has the ability to produce weapons.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A day earlier, a separate blaze, believed to have been started by arson, contributed to a power cut that hit Cannes.The first power cut affected 160,000 households, knocking out traffic lights and cash machines throughout the French Riviera. Broadcaster BFMTV reported that the incident was made worse as three of the four pillars of an electricity pylon in the region had also been cut with a saw.Writing on social media on Sunday, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, said he strongly denounced the “malicious acts”. He said power had been quickly restored, with local and national police mobilised. He added that the city would make surveillance camera images available to investigators and would reinforce the camera network around the city’s strategic electric sites.Commenting on the power cuts that hit Cannes, before the latest fire, Laurent Hottiaux, the prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes region, told BFMTV there were certain elements that were “not a coincidence” but would not comment further, as an investigation led by the national prosecutor’s office was under way. He said authorities had taken additional security measures.The power outage hit the Cannes film festival headquarters, interrupting several screenings, but the closing ceremony went ahead thanks to backup generators. Thetop prize was wonby the dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi for his dramaIt Was Just an Accident, inspired by his time spent imprisoned by the Iranian regime.Iranian authorities met the 64-year-old director’s victory with silence, for his film in which five people confront the man they believe tortured them in prison. After winning the Palme d’Or, Panahi, who has been jailed multiple times, made an appeal for national unity.On Sunday, however, Iran summoned the French charge d’affaires in Tehran over “insulting” comments made by France’s foreign minister.“Following the insulting remarks and unfounded allegations by the French minister … the charge d’affaires of that country in Tehran has been summoned to the ministry,” state news agency IRNA reported. Jean-Noel Barrot had called the film “a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime’s oppression.”Authorities said they did not believe the power cuts were a specific threat against the Cannes film festival and have not commented on the possible perpetrators.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The youngest, Sayden, six months old, was still sleeping. And like every day, with war raging in Gaza and Israeli strikes landing just metres from her neighbourhood in Khan Younis, Najjar worried about leaving them at home without her.But Najjar, 35, had little choice. One of Gaza’s dwindling number of medics, a respected paediatrician at the Nasser medical complex, she had to go to work to care for injured babies who had barely survived Israeli attacks. She could never have imagined that that farewell to her family would be her last.A few hours later, the charred bodies of seven of her children, killed by an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis, arrived at her hospital. Two other bodies, including Sayden’s, remained under the rubble. Of her 10 children,only one had survived, along with their father, Hamdi al-Najjar, 40, also a doctor. Both are now in hospital.“It’s one of the most heartbreaking tragedies since the beginning of the conflict,” Mohammed Saqer, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital, said. “And it happened to a paediatrician who dedicated her life to saving children, only to have her own motherhood stolen in a moment of fire and deafening silence.”Footage shared by the director of Gaza’s health ministry and verified by the Guardian shows the burnt, dismembered bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of Najjar’s building near a petrol station as flames still engulfed what remained of the family’s home.Ali al-Najjar, 50, the older brother of Hamdi, Alaa’s husband, said: “When I heard the house was bombed, I instinctively rushed to my car and headed to the place as I knew my brother and his children were inside. When I arrived, I was shocked. I found my nephew Adam, who survived, lying on the road under the rubble. He was covered in soot, his clothes were almost torn, but his soul was still inside him. My brother was lying on the other side, bleeding heavily from his head and chest, and his arm was cut off. He was still breathing with difficulty.”Ali called the medical team and took the two survivors to the hospital. Then he began searching for his nine missing nieces and nephews.“The house was very difficult to clear because the ceiling was stacked on top of itself. I started searching around the house hoping to find any of the children because I assumed the bombing might have thrown them outside the house,” he said. “But then, sadly, the first burnt body appeared. After completely putting out the fire, we found the rest of them – some were mutilated and all were burnt.”Alaa al-Najjar rushed to the site of the explosion as rescuers pulled the body of her daughter Revan from the rubble. In tears, she begged the rescuers to let her hold her one last time.“Her [Revan’s] body was completely burnt from the upper part, nothing remained of her skin or flesh,” Ali said. “There are still two bodies of my brother’s children we could not find: the oldest, 12-year-old boy, Yahya, and the six-month-old girl, Sayden.”Najjar returned to the hospital to check on her son Adam, 11, and her husband. Sources at the Nasser hospital who transferred the children’s bodies one by one to the morgue said their mother was not able to identify them, so bad were the burns.The children’s names were Yahya, Rakan, Ruslan, Jubran, Eve, Revan, Sayden, Luqman and Sidra.View image in fullscreenEve and Rakan with their father, Dr Hamdi al-Najjar.Photograph: Reuters“Alaa went to the morgue, held her children in her arms, recited the Qur’an over them and prayed for them,” said Dr Ahmed al-Farra, 53, the director of the children’s building at the Nasser medical complex. “Other female doctors around her collapsed from grief and rage, but Dr Alaa remained composed. God sent peace upon her heart. After they were buried, she went directly to check on her husband and son and began caring for them.”Colleagues at the hospital described Najjar as a committed, polite and ethical doctor, capable of enduring immense pressure, treating dozens of children and patients daily, and at the same time caring for a large family.“She was in constant worry for her children when she was at the hospital. When she heard a house had been bombed in the Qizan al-Najjar neighbourhood, her mother’s heart sensed something was wrong,” Farra said.He said there were no words for her loss. “If anyone wants to share an opinion, let them first imagine it happening to them – to suddenly lose every person connected to you.”After saying goodbye for the last time to the lifeless bodies of her seven children, Alaa went to the ward where her surviving child was being treated.“Her husband was suffering from severe injuries – brain damage and fractures caused by shrapnel, along with shrapnel wounds and fractures in the chest. He was placed on a ventilator and fitted with medical tubes,” Farra said. ‘‘Her son’s condition was relatively better – his injuries ranged from moderate to severe.”View image in fullscreenDr Alaa al-Najjar (standing left) at her husband’s side in hospital.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesNajjar’s colleagues and friends said her children held Egyptian citizenship and that Alaa and Hamdi had been planning to leave for Egypt and enrol their children in Cairo’s Al-Azhar University.The Israel Defense Forces said: “Yesterday, an IDF aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis. The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety. The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”The Gaza health ministry says nearly 54,000 Palestinians, including 16,503 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks across the territory.Farra said: “My only hope is that those who were killed are not just names on paper. We were created just like every other human being in this world. And like every other human, we have the right to live.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Another strike in the Jabaliya area of northernGazakilled at least five, including two women and a child, it added.Civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said some people were still under the debris, as “the civil defence does not have search equipment or heavy equipment to lift the rubble to rescue the wounded and recover the martyrs.”Two more people, including a woman who was seven months pregnant, were killed in an attack targeting tents sheltering displaced people around Nuseirat in central Gaza, said Bassal.Sunday’s death toll includes the civil defence’s director of operations, Ashraf Abu Nar, and his wife, who were killed in a strike on their home in Nuseirat, according to Bassal. Local media reports said that in Jabaliya, journalist Hassan Majdi Abu Warda and several family members had been killed by an airstrike that hit his house earlier in the day.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that two of its staff, Ibrahim Eid and Ahmad Abu Hilal, had been killed in a strike on a house in Khan Younis on Saturday.“Their killing points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza. The ICRC reiterates its urgent call for a ceasefire and for the respect and protection of civilians, including medical, humanitarian relief, and civil defence personnel,” the ICRC statement added.Israel has intensified its air campaign in Gaza in recent days. On Friday, a strike on Khan Younis destroyed the home of doctors Alaa and Hamdi al-Najjar,killing nine of their 10 children.The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday it had targeted more than 100 sites across the territory over the weekend, despite aid agencies warning that the Palestinian population is plunging deeper intomalnutrition and famine.For nearly three months Israel blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians.If aid doesn’t enter Gaza now, 14,000 babies may die. UN peacekeepers must step in | Michael FakhriRead moreUnder international pressure, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,who has vowedthat the entire Gaza Strip will be under Israeli security control by the end of the war, said last week he would ease the 11-week siege ofGazato prevent a “starvation crisis”. Aid agencies and many governments say that crisis already exists.A total of 107 aid trucks belonging to the UN and other aid groups carrying flour, food, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals were transferred on Thursday into Gaza, the Israeli military said.The UN secretary general said on Friday that Israel had only authorised for Gaza what “amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required” to ease the crisis.“Without rapid, reliable, safe and sustained aid access, more people will die – and the long-term consequences on the entire population will be profound,”António Guterrestold reporters.“The entire population ofGazais facing the risk of famine … The Israeli military offensive is intensifying, with atrocious levels of death and destruction.”Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid. The UN and aid groups deny there has been significant diversion.Israel says it plans to seize full control of Gaza and facilitate what it describes as the voluntary migration of much of its population, a plan rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community. Experts say it would probably violate international law.Health officials in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 3,785 people had been killed in the territory since Israel ended the ceasefire on 18 March.Israel’s 19-month offensive followed the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 in which more than 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed.The Israeli offensivehas killed more than 53,939, Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which says women and children make up most of the dead. It does not provide figures for the number of civilians or combatants killed.The offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of the population, often multiple times.AFP, AP and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaAntónio GuterresnewsShareReuse this content"

Given what’s happening inGazaI thought it’s only fair that we own it.”The proliferation of the term has added another strand to Irish activism on Gaza amid controversy over outspokenstatements by the rap group Kneecap. With one of its membersfacing a terror charge, there is a question mark over the group’s invitation to perform at Glastonbury next month.The origin of the term Paddystinian is unclear but many first heard of it in December after Israelclosed its embassy in Dublinto protest what it said was Irish government antisemitism and extreme hostility. Pro-Israeli voices online combined Paddy with Palestinian to underscore the accusation that Ireland, byrecognising Palestinian statehoodand lobbying the EU for a tougher line on Israel, was rewarding terrorism by Hamas.Ben Cohen, a columnist for the Jewish News Syndicate, wrote that he initially regretted making a quip about Paddystinians because Paddy was an ageing pejorative about drunkenness and other Irish stereotypes.“As it turns out, I needn’t have worried,”he wrote. “I discovered that the hashtag #Paddystinian was being eagerly adopted on social media by Irish supporters of Hamas. The accompanying posts were variously obnoxious or downright stupid, with many of those mocking the assertion that their country is antisemitic.”Zoë Lawlor, the chair of theIreland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, welcomed the adoption of the term. “It was being used as an insult. People here thought that was hilarious so we really embraced it and turned it on its head. We started having fun with it at chants. Lots of people changed their Twitter names and social media handles to reflect that.”Garments, badges, pins and other accessories emblazoned with “Paddystinian” have become popular merchandise. Some producers, such as the progressive campaign group Uplift, donate the proceeds to aid for Gaza.Izzeddeen Alkarajeh, a Palestinian who serves Palestinian cuisine at Izz Cafe in Cork, sells Paddystinian pins. “It quickly became one of our top-selling items. It’s a beautiful example of how a term meant to mock can be reclaimed and redefined by the community,” he said via email.The term amplifies awareness about Palestine among young Irish people, as do the Kneecap trio, who visited the cafe in February, said Alkarajeh. “Ireland has consistently shown solidarity with the oppressed, and this is especially evident now in the face of the ongoing crisis in Gaza.”Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, the Palestinian ambassador toIreland, laudedIrish solidarity. “Any link between the Irish people and the Palestinian people is a positive one. I hope the Irish people feel the same. We share the same history of colonisation and know too well how important freedom, justice, and human rights are.”Activists say their goal is to leverage online solidarity to pressure the Irish state to match tough statements on Israel with actions, such as an enacting a bill to ban trade withillegal Israeli settlements on the West Bank, ending the Irish central bank’s authorisation of Israeli state bond sales in Europe and curbing the use of Irish airspace for flights suspected of carrying war material to Israel.“Our pressure point is the Irish government,” said Lawlor. “The rhetoric is very strong but they have to back it up with actions. If they do that we can start a snowball effect within the EU.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandIsrael-Gaza warSocial mediaEuropeGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The force said the change meant officers were attending crimes such as robberies faster, but mental health groupssaid they feared it could result in deaths.May and two ex-health ministers, Syed Kamall and Frederick Curzon, have tabled amendments to the mental health bill going through parliament which, if passed, would lead to mental health nurses, psychiatrists or other doctors being called out to restrain and detain someone under the MentalHealthAct. Those professionals would each become an “authorised person” who is allowed to detain someone under the act.May took an active interest in mental health issues during her time as home secretary and in Downing Street. She helped ensure those detained under the act were no longer held in police cells and were instead taken to “places of safety”, usually at NHS facilities.But in a joint statement on Monday the eight groups said the risks posed by someone in a mental health crisis meant police officers must continue to always attend. The groups include the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association.At present, only police officers are permitted under the Mental Health Act to detain someone in a mental health crisis, for example because they are having a psychotic episode.The groups said: “Removing police involvement entirely has hugely dangerous implications, as entering someone’s home without permission is fraught with huge risks and is only currently done with the assistance of police intelligence. Without this, professionals may be entering homes without police help and therefore lacking crucial intelligence that could ensure their safety.”They added: “While we recognise the immense pressures faced by police services, we also acknowledge that mental health crises in the community are becoming increasingly acute and almost never occur without some level of risk.“The expertise, skills and equipment of the police remain essential for safely reaching individuals in crisis, especially where they may be in immediate danger to themselves, pose a risk to others or face a threat from others.”Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Detaining, and if necessary restraining, someone is essentially arresting them and to do this safely requires specialist skills and legal powers.“Expecting clinicians whose role is to provide therapeutic care to arrest people in the street or burst into their homes if they notice someone suffering a mental health crisis is simply inappropriate and indicates a lack of understanding of what health professionals do.”Chief constables are backing the change. They want to see responsibility for dealing with mental health crises become split between their officers and NHS staff.A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said: “We support the proposed amendments to the mental health bill, which will enable authorised medical professionals to effectively deal with some mental health incidents. This will ensure vulnerable people receive the most appropriate care without feeling criminalised because of their mental health issues.”They added: “We will always attend incidents where there is a risk of serious harm to the individual or attending professionals, or where criminality is involved.”The groups opposed to the plan also include the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, the College of Paramedics, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, the British Association of Social Workers and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services.The Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, the party’s former shadow cabinet minister for mental health who is also an A&E doctor, voiced unease about the plan.She said: “I am concerned that these amendments aim to turn practitioners into enforcers and could expose healthcare staff to increased danger. It runs the risk of eroding trust in dedicated and hard-working mental health staff by delegating police powers to them.”Ministers are also against the change. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Extending police powers to other professionals would represent a major shift in the roles, responsibilities and practice for health and care staff and would place additional resource on an already stretched NHS at a time where we are trying to rebuild a health service fit for the future.“It also raises questions around whether it is right for the health and social care professionals to have powers to use reasonable force, which could have implications for patient, public and staff safety, as well as potentially damaging the relationships clinicians have with patients.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthNHSHealthEnglandWalesMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

The charity has also warned that melanoma cases are expected to rise again this year, with 21,300 cases.Michelle Mitchell, CRUK’s chief executive, said:“Improvements in skin cancer survival rates highlight the remarkable progress driven by our research. But the growing number of people diagnosed with melanoma is still concerning, especially when we can see that rates are rising faster in men.“If you notice anything different on your skin, like a new mole, a mole that’s changed in size, shape or colour, or any patch of skin that looks out of the ordinary – don’t ignore it, speak to your GP. We want to beat skin cancer for everyone, no matter who they are or where they’re from – early diagnosis is key and could make all the difference.”Fiona Osgun, head of health information at CRUK, said: “As the weather gets warmer, it’s really important to look after yourself in the sun. Getting sunburned just once every couple of years can triple your risk of melanoma skin cancer, compared with never being burned. And it’s not just the hot, sunny days you need to watch out for – UV rays can be strong enough to cause skin damage between mid-March and mid-October in the UK, even when it’s cloudy or cool.“That’s why we encourage people to take some simple steps to stay safe. Try to stick to the shade between 11am and 3pm when the sun is strongest, wear clothes that help cover up your skin, with a hat and sunglasses, and use a sunscreen with at least SPF30 and 4 or 5 stars.”Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: “Prevention is by far the best plan with skin cancer, so avoid the sun when it is at its hottest and ensure you use sunscreen. For skin cancer, as for any cancer, it is vital that you are seen and diagnosed as early as possible, so people should come forward if they are concerned about symptoms. Getting checked saves lives.”Explore more on these topicsSkin cancerCancerMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The force said a 71-year-old woman from the same family who was also injured in the fire had been discharged from hospital.A 41-year-old man who was arrested outside the house on Saturday morning remained in custody on Sunday afternoon.Bunches of flowers and a blue teddy bear were left near the homes as fire crews wearing helmets and respiratory equipment built scaffolding against the burnt-out buildings.Neighbours said the family were of Pakistani origin and had lived on Tillett Close for years.Firefighters said the mother and one of her children were rescued from the second floor but pronounced dead by air ambulance crews.The other two children who were declared dead were found inside the property as crews tackled the fire, London fire brigade said.Cecilia Marquis, 60, a neighbour, said she was “stunned by the devastation” of the fire.Marquis, who is a caterer at Brentford FC and witnessed the fire, said: “This will leave a devastating impact.”In a statement on Saturday, Supt Steve Allen, from the Met’s local policing team in north-west London, said detectives were leading the investigation into the cause of the fire.“Despite the efforts of the emergency services, I can confirm a woman and three of her children died at the scene,” Allen said.“The wider family have been informed, and officers will continue to support them at this incredibly difficult time.“I recognise the significant impact this incident has had on the community.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The remainder were either only partly implemented, often in symbolic, limited or inconsistent ways, or were too vague or difficult to measure.Labour MPs said the UK was trapped in “a performative cycle”, where a crisis prompted a report to be commissioned to “diffuse anger” and its recommendations were later quietly shelved.View image in fullscreenProf Ted Cantle, who led the Cantle review, said the UK is in a ‘doom loop’, where a riot or issue leads to a review, recommendations and then the process starts again.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianProf Ted Cantle, the former chief executive of Nottingham city council, led the community cohesion review team after 2001 riots in northern towns with predominantly white and Asian populations.Analysis by the Guardian has suggested that of his recommendations, an estimated 5% had been fully implemented, while more than a third had not been implemented at all. The rest had been partly implemented or were deemed not measurable for this analysis.Cantle said: “We’re in this doom loop where a riot happens or there’s an acknowledgment of some sort of issue, a review happens and the recommendations aren’t really taken up and then the process starts again.”After last year’s riots, Cantle renewed the call he first made in 2001 for a community cohesion strategy. “There is no doubt in my mind that there has to be, at the heart of government, an agency, a department, that is focused on developing cohesion and provides a national strategy, a national narrative, which is then implemented at the local level by the local government, by voluntary agencies.”Lord Victor Adebowale, the chair of the NHS Confederation, made 28 recommendations after his 2021 review of mental health and policing, which examined the disproportionate number of Black men dying in police custody.Analysis suggested an estimated 14% of his recommendations have been fully implemented, while around a quarter was ignored. “A healthy society is an equitable society,” he said. “It’s one that understands individuals, communities and the interactions between them in such a way that they can provide appropriate services.”Since the riots that broke out in the UK last summer, the rightwing Reform party has taken control of 10 councils, vowing to target equality, diversity and inclusion policies, while Keir Starmer has said the UK risked becoming “an island of strangers” without further controls on immigration.View image in fullscreenVictor Adebowale believes that some lives could have been saved if some of his recommendations had been put into place.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianAdebowale told the Guardian that while it has become easier to “pander to prejudice [than] to lead progressively”, stark racial inequalities remain as “successive governments, not just this one, fail to accept the systemic nature of race discrimination”.He said: “If you look at the stats, Black men are still disproportionately detained. If you pick any one of the major disease categories, you’ll find that Black people have a greater, worse experience and worse outcomes. You look at cancer, Black people are likely to discover they’ve got stage four in A&E. If you look at mental health, they have a worse experience and worse outcomes … on and on it goes.”Adebowale said if all of the 27 recommendations he made had been implemented, he was “pretty certain” that some deaths since “wouldn’t have occurred”.The Guardian’s analysis found that some recommendations made in official reports produced since 1981 were implemented initially but later dropped or significantly altered.Several recommendations from the 2001 Cantle report were introduced under the Blair and Brown governments – for example, the requirement for Ofsted to inspect and report on the public duty on schools to promote community cohesion, the expansion of Sure Start to support disadvantaged children early and prevent disengagement from education, and other youth outreach work such as Connexions Service.However, these programmes were substantially defunded during the coalition government’s austerity drive in the 2010s, and many were later dismantled entirely under the subsequent Conservative majority government.Some recommendations, such as Adebowale’s on developing safer models on restraint, come up again in later reports. The issue of deadly use of restraint, particularly those in the prone position, came up four years later in theAngiolini review in 2017, yet multiple individuals have died in custody while being restrained, including in prone-position holds.Many recommendations the Guardian assessed to have now been fully implemented were first made decades ago, resurfacing in two or even three subsequent reviews before finally being acted on – often after 10 or even 20 years.Others, such as the call for police forces and teaching staff to reflect the communities they serve, or for the curriculum to meaningfully reflect Britain’s racial diversity, have been repeatedly recommended but remain unmet.The Guardian’s snapshot analysis builds on earlier work by the Stuart Hall Foundation and the Centre for Public Data.While a majority of recommendations made over five decades have not led to policy changes in the public sector, David Tyler, who co-chaired the Parker review which made recommendations to the private sector, saidbig business has acted.The Parker reviewset FTSE 100 businesses a deadline of having one minority ethnic board member by 2021, and also said each FTSE 250 board should have at least one director of colour by 2024.The review’s yearly update earlier this year found that 95% of FTSE 100 companies now have one minority ethnic board member, while 86% of FTSE 200 companies could say the same.Tyler said: “Broadly, unless you’re talking about the very recent past, which has been influenced above all by Donald Trump and Maga, it’s moved in the right direction in terms of the attitude of business people to take the best possible talent from the ethnic minorities in the UK.”Nonetheless, the number of recommendations made to the state that have been “shelved” meant the UK was “trapped in a performative cycle” when it comes to racial inequality in the UK, the Labour MP Clive Lewis said.“This research sadly confirms what many of us have long suspected: when it comes to race equality in the UK, we are trapped in a performative cycle – crisis, commission, then conveniently shelved recommendations.“From Scarman to Macpherson to Lammy, we’ve seen inquiry after inquiry confirm what racialised communities already know: that systemic racism is real, it’s persistent, and it’s baked into the institutions that shape our lives. But instead of acting on those truths, successive governments have treated these reviews as fire blankets – designed to smother outrage, not spark change,” said Lewis.The Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy urged the government to act. She said: “Looking at the British state’s track record, you could be forgiven for thinking the main purpose of race inquiries past has been to diffuse anger around the many inequalities facing Black communities in our country and divert attention away from securing real change.”Explore more on these topicsRaceThe race reportBlack Lives Matter movementnewsShareReuse this content"

The driver was security cleared, actually recommended by GCS, it was a contract that had been in place for about five years, and I renewed that contract.“A memo was sent by someone who was unfamiliar with the contract, asking about security concerns, and other civil servants said there were no security concerns, and that’s the end of the matter.”The Conservative party leader said it was “destructive” that someone would leak the memo out of context. “I’ve never, ever, ever put myself in a situation where security was reduced,” she said. “And also, it would not have been allowed in the first place. There is no way that the department would have allowed me to be carrying official secret documents in a car that wasn’t security cleared. It’s a nonsense story.”Labour said Badenoch had still failed to explain why she did not use the government car service like other ministers.“The Tory leader cannot just dismiss the security concerns that were raised at the time and hard-working families deserve to know how much this extravagant arrangement cost,” a party spokesperson said.The Guardianreported last yearthat Badenoch had asked officials to pay for a holiday flight to the US with taxpayers’ money while in government but was rebuffed by her former department’s top civil servant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The justice department did not respond to the Guardian’s request for access to a copy of the criminal complaint.According to the justice department, Neumayer arrived inIsraelin April. The 28-year-old was then alleged to have arrived to the US embassy branch office in Tel Aviv with a backpack and spit on an embassy guard last week.When the guard tried to arrest him, Neumayer managed to break free and escape, leaving behind his backpack.Suspect charged with murder in shooting of Israeli embassy staffersRead moreThe justice department alleged that the backpack had three molotov cocktails. Officials reportedly tracked him to his hotel and arrested him.The department’s press release further alleges that a social media account purportedly linked to Neumayer read: “join me as I burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv. Death to America, death to Americans, and fuck the west.” Officials say he also allegedly posted threats to assassinate Donald Trump.The Tel Aviv diplomatic office was the site of the US embassy until 2018, when the embassy formally moved to a site in Jerusalem, in aceremony overseen by Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter.“The defendant is charged with attempting to firebomb the US Embassy and making threats to President Trump,” the FBI’s director, Kash Patel, said in a statement. “This despicable and violent behavior will not be tolerated at home or abroad, and the FBI, working with our partners, will bring him to face justice for his dangerous actions.”Neumayer reportedly stood before a judge on Sunday and was ordered detained without bond.The arrest of Neumayer comes days after authorities in Washington DCarrested a man in connectionwith the fatal shootings of two Israeli embassy officials.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeIsraelNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

The officer accused her of improperly making a false turn – but those charges were later dropped after the police forceadmitted to mistaking her carfor another.The damage, though, was done by the time Arias-Cristobal’s charges were dismissed. The 19-year-old – who is undocumented and was driving with a Mexican license – was brought to the US from Mexico in 2007, when she was just four.The timing of her having been taken to the US barely missed the deadline for her to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program initiated during Barack Obama’s presidency that provided children in her situation some protections from deportation.After O’Neal arrested her, local authorities contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the federal agency that detains and deports immigrants. Ice agents then transferred her to an immigration jail in the state.“I cannot go to jail,” Arias-Cristobal said during the arrest, according to dash-cam footage. “I have my finals next week. My family depends on this.”Arias-Cristobal’s plight captured national attention, with many supporting her and calling for her release. Others – including the far-rightGeorgiacongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – agitated for Arias-Cristobal to be deported.“In Mexico, today, there’s over 1.6 million United States of America citizens, living and thriving in Mexico, and I’m sure she and her family will be able to do the same,” Greene saidduring an interviewwith Tennessee’s Local 3 News. “But it’s important for our nation, for our sovereignty, for us to uphold the law. And this is what we have to do.”The White House’s attempts to engage in “mass deportations” during Donald Trump’s second presidency has led to an increase in arrests throughout the country. Immigration enforcement operations have been aided by local jurisdictions that partner with Ice, under what are known as 287(g) contracts. These contracts deputize local officials to carry out immigration enforcement arrests, collaborating closely with Ice.The Whitfield county sheriff’s office, which runs the local jail for people arrested in Dalton,has a 287(g) contractwith Ice.Additionally, a law signed last year by Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, requires local law enforcement, in the entire state, to apply to enter into 287(g) contracts with Ice. Immigration advocacy organizations have called that law “disastrous”.The Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, for instance, said it would lead to “racial profiling, terrorize immigrant communities and waste local resources”.Disabled people detained by Ice sound alarm over overcrowded jailsRead moreArias-Cristobal’s father, José Arias-Tovar, had also been detained by Ice weeks earlier after another traffic stop for speeding. He bonded out of Ice detention on 16 May. Five days later, Arias-Cristobalpaid a $1,500 bond, leading to her release. She was home with her family by Thursday evening.“We’re going to keep working on her case to try to keep her here permanently,” Arias-Cristobal’s attorney, Dustin Baxter,told local TV station WSB-TV.Arias-Cristobal’s arrest has prompted some torally for her release, whether in person or online. Her advocates have criticized Ice and the local police department for how they have handled her case.A GoFundMe campaign launched for her legal defense hasraised more than $90,000.The jail where Arias-Cristobal was detained before she bonded out is known as the Stewart detention center. It is a run privately in Lumpkin, Georgia, by CoreCivic under a contract with Ice and for years has beenaccused of violating rightsandmaintaining horrific conditions.This article was amended on 25 May 2025 to include the officer’s resignation letter.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationGeorgiaUS policingTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked by CNN’s State of the Union whether his faction had the numbers to halt the bill, he replied: “I think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending reduction and reducing the deficit.”Trump has invested a large portion of his political capital in the massive package. It extends the 2017 tax cuts from his first administration in return for about $1tn in benefits cuts including reductions in the health insurance scheme for low-income families, Medicaid, and to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food stamps.Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ spending bill, from tax cuts to mass deportationsRead moreThe bill squeaked through US House by justone voteon Thursday. It now faces a perilous welcome in the upper legislative chamber.Sunday’s admonitions from prominent senators angered by the failure to address the budget deficit bodes ill for Trump’s agenda given the tightness of the Republicans’ congressional majorities. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, can afford to lose only three votes from among his party’s 53.Thune has indicated that changes to the bill might be needed to bring refuseniks on side. That in turn could present the House speaker, Mike Johnson, with a headache.The House will have to approve any changes made in the Senate under the process of budget reconciliation, which allows spending packages to be fast-tracked through Congress avoiding a Senate filibuster of 60 votes. The final contents of the bill will need to be blessed by both chambers, with Democrats almost certain to vote unanimously in opposition.The House speaker renewed his plea to his Senate colleagues on Sunday to go lightly with him. He encouraged them on CBS News’s Face the Nation “to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House”.But Senate budget hawks do not appear to be in the mood for compromise. Ron Johnson estimated that the bill would add up to $4tn to the federal deficit, a calculation that is broadly in line with thelatest analysisfrom the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).Johnson added a rare note of personal criticism of Trump from a congressional Republican. He said that while Trump might not be worried about the national debt, “I’m extremely worried about that.”He added: “We are mortgaging our children’s future. It’s wrong. It’s immoral. It has to stop.”Another key Tea Party senator, Rand Paul from Kentucky, has also been vocal over the deficit. He laid into the spending cuts contained in the big beautiful bill, telling Fox News Sunday that in his view they were “wimpy and anemic” and would “explode the debt”.Other influential Republican senators have been expressing concern about the number of Americans who would lose access to health coverage as a result of the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid. According to the CBO, almost 8 million people would be thrown off the benefit.Speaker Johnson tried to dismiss the concern, telling CBS News that 1.4 million of those vulnerable people were “illegal aliens receiving benefits” – and a further 4.8 million were able-bodied individuals choosing not to work and “gaming the system”.An analysis by the non-partisanFactCheck.orgfound that the claim that 1.4 million undocumented migrants were on Medicaid was false. People living in the US without immigration papers are not eligible for the federal program other than to receive emergency medical treatment.‘Fiscally irresponsible’: Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ benefits the rich at the expense of the poorRead moreMore than 1 million undocumented immigrants are in danger of losing health benefits as a result of Trump’s cuts – but this assistance is provided by states and has nothing to do with Medicaid.Any reduction in Medicaid would be politically awkward for Trump, who promised repeatedly on the campaign trail last year that he would not touch basic safety nets such as Medicaid, Medicare and social security. The president’s loyal supporters in the Maga (“Make America great again”) movement have cautioned against the move.Steve Bannon, who served as chief White House strategist in Trump’s first administration and remains a persuasive voice within the movement, recently told listeners to his War Room podcast: “You got to be careful, because a lot of Maga is on Medicaid.”Josh Hawley, the Republican US senator from Missouri,recently saidthat “slashing health insurance for the working poor” would be “politically suicidal”.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsRepublicansUS CongressUS taxationnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m not going to lie,” said Rebecca Solloa, executive director of Catholic Charities of the diocese of Laredo, Texas.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) continued to ask shelters in Texas and Arizona to house people even after the 11 March letter, putting them in the awkward position of doing something that Fema appeared to say might be illegal. Both agencies are part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and have also been accused ofwithholding fundsfrom organizations, in addition to asking them to hand over names of those they’ve helped and implying that some charities are human-smuggling operations.Trump administration threatens groups that distributed federal aid for migrantsRead moreAfter receiving the letter, Catholic Charities still received eight to 10 people a day from Ice until financial losses forced it to close its shelter in the Texas border city on 25 April, Solloa said.The Holding Institute community center, also in Laredo, has been taking about 20 families a week from Ice’s family detention centers in Dilley and Karnes City, Texas, executive director Michael Smith said. They come from Russia, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Papua New Guinea and China.Annunciation House in El Paso, Texas, a storied institution in the region, has been receiving five to 10 people a day from Ice, including from Honduras and Venezuela, said Ruben Garcia, its longtime executive director.The International Rescue Committee (IRC) did not get a letter but continues receiving people from Ice in Phoenix, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information that has not been made public. The releases include people who had been held at Ice’s Krome detention center in Miami, Florida, a site of severe overcrowding.Ice’s requests struck Solloa as a “little bit of a contradiction”, but Catholic Charities agreed to them. She said some guests had been in Ice detention centers for two to four weeks after being arrested in the nation’s interior and ordered released by an immigration judge while their challenges to deportations wind through the courts. Others had been flown from San Diego, California, after crossing the border without authorization.Those released were from India, China, Pakistan, Turkey and Central and South America, Solloa said.Smith, a Methodist pastor, said that the Fema letter was alarming and that agreeing to continue caring for people released by Ice was “probably not a good idea”. Still, it was an easy choice.“There’s some things that are just right to do,” he said.Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the DHS, drew a distinction with large-scale releases under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.

Those hurdles have prompted Ice to deport people to countries other than their own, including El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama, and – this week –an attemptto remove people, mostly originally from south Asia, to South Sudan. If those options aren’t available, Ice may release people in the US, which the Trump administration is reluctant to do.Fema awarded $641m to dozens of state and local governments and organizations across the country in the 2024 fiscal year to help them deal with large numbers of immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico.But Fema has suspended payments during its investigation, which requires shelters to provide “a detailed and descriptive list of specific services provided”. Executive officers must sign sworn statements that they have no knowledge or suspicions of anyone in their organizations violating the smuggling law.The releases show how border shelters have often maintained close, if cordial, relations with federal immigration authorities at the ground level, even when senior officials publicly criticize them.“We have a good working relationship with our federal partners. We always have,” Solloa said. “They asked us to help, then we will continue to help, but at some point we have to say: ‘Yikes, I don’t have any more money for this. Our agency is hurting and I’m sorry, we can’t do this anymore.’”Catholic Charities hosted at least 120,000 people at its Laredo shelter since opening in 2021 and housed 600 to 700 people on its busiest nights in 2023, Solloa said. It was counting on up to $7m from Fema. The shelter closed with a loss of nearly $1m million after not receiving any Fema money.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS-Mexico borderUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson said the department doesn’t discuss the citizenship of individuals.The core issue is whether foreign leaders should hold American citizenship when they also enjoy broad immunity from US laws, said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor and an expert on citizenship law. Such immunity clashes with the constitutional principle that no US citizen should be above the law.However, the US supreme court in a 1980 decision ruled that Americans can’t be stripped of their citizenship unless they intentionally renounce it.“The state department never assumes that you intend to lose your citizenship unless you specifically say so through the renunciation process,” Spiro said.He said it would be hard to argue that Leo, by becoming pope, demonstrated an intent to give up being a US citizen.“I think it’s highly unlikely that the US moves to terminate the pope’s citizenship,” Spiro said.Peruvian law has no conflict with Pope Leo remaining a citizen, said Jorge Puch, the deputy director of registry archives at Peru’s National Registry of Identification and Civil Status.Leo was granted Peruvian citizenship in August 2015, the month before Pope Francis appointed him bishop of Chiclayo in the South American country’s northern region. To qualify, he had to live in Peru for at least two years and pass a civics test.“It is the most praiseworthy thing our beloved supreme pontiff could have done: Wanting to have Peruvian nationality without having been Peruvian by birth,” Puch said.All adult Peruvians, including naturalized citizens, are required to vote in elections through age 69. Voting in Peru’s presidential election next April won’t be mandatory for Leo. He turns 70 in September.It’s not clear what happened to the citizenship status of Leo’s predecessors once they became pope. That’s not information the Vatican discloses.Pope Francis renewed his passport in his home country of Argentina in 2014, the year after he became pope. Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II – natives of Germany and Poland, respectively – never publicly relinquished citizenship in their home countries.John Paul was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years.Margaret Susan Thompson, a Syracuse University history professor and expert on AmericanCatholicism, said she doubts Leo would renounce his US citizenship. But she believes the new pope was sending a message when he delivered his first speech in Italian and Spanish without using English.“I think he wants to stress that he is the pope of the universal Catholic Church,” Thompson said, “and not an American holding that position”.Other US citizens who have served as leaders of a foreign government include Boris Johnson, the former UK prime minister who was born in New York to British parents.Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed was an American citizen when he was elected president of Somalia in 2017. Valdas Adamkus became a US citizen after his family fled Lithuania to escape Soviet occupation. He returned to win Lithuania’s presidency in 1998, years after the Soviet Union collapsed.Johnson, Adamkus and Mohamed all renounced their US citizenship.Explore more on these topicsPope Leo XIVThe papacyCatholicismChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

As he did, Morgan Rogers prodded the ball from his clutches – the goalkeeper did not appear to have it under control – and the forward found the empty net.Cue pandemonium because Bramall, a select group 1 official since 2022, had blown his whistle before the strike so the video assistant referee could not intervene – and so cue, too, Unai Emery and his players going ballistic at the referee and his officials as the match remained scoreless.View image in fullscreenAmad Diallo guides his header past Robin Olsen to give Manchester United the lead just minutes after Villa were wrongly denied a goal.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesThis being the funniest of old games, what happened next was predictable. A Bruno Fernandes cross was met by Amad Diallo’s head, Robin Olsen, on for the sent off Emiliano Martínez, was beaten in Villa’s goal and Emery’s men were down to sixth – despite Newcastle losing against Everton.A madcap end to the contest next featured Ian Maatsen taking down Diallo as the wideman surged into the area and Bramall awarding a penalty that drew sarcastic Emery applause. Christian Eriksen converted and the home congregation offered gleeful waves to Villa’s fans.The visitors’ Champions League hopes then rested on a comeback in eight added minutes. It did not happen and so Villa were heartbroken, with a still-furious Emery soon to cite the Rogers-Bayindir farrago as killing them, as the “key moment” that turned the contest, though the Spaniard was later measured.As Bramall reached the tunnel Emery waited for him: obviously not to inquire about the referee’s health – he later stated the referee admitted his error. And for United, their push to avoid 17th was successful and they finished in the vertigo-inducing heights of 15th.Then, on the pitch, goodbyes for Victor Lindelöf, Eriksen and Jonny Evans – the last finishing a second spell at United – while Alejandro Garnacho, not chosen in Ruben Amorim’s matchday squad, joined the squad for a lap of appreciation that came after the head coach apologised for the season and offered a bold statement: “The good days are coming.”Before the breathless last act of this season-closer, Villa’s delighted support had chorused “something tells me I’m into something good”, their team at that point in the promised land of the Champions League. This was prompted when, in the second half, Everton scored at Newcastle and Villa were up to fifth – yet it was a jubilation that soured as much as United’s season did after Amorim took over.When Erik ten Hag was sacked on 28 October, United were seven points from a Champions League berth. It was not in the playbook when Sir Jim Ratcliffe war-gamed removing Ten Hag and recruiting Amorim that the club would face a last-day dog‑fight to avoid finishing the worst of the non-relegated.Nor was it the plan that a fast young aggressive winger in the storied tradition of the 20-time champions would be excluded from the squad and be (seemingly) a footballer non grata heading for the summer market. But such is Garnacho’s situation.How about, too, another homegrown starlet, who started England’s Euro 2024 final, being unable to get a starting berth in midfield ahead of a creaking 33-year-old Casemiro? That has been Kobbie Mainoo’s fate.Or a latest action from The 1958 fan group, this one a pre-game march down Sir Matt Busby Way, to protest against 20 years of troubled Glazer ownership?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A cross was met by Mason Mount, whose shot failed to beat Martínez, and when Ayden Heaven recycled the ball the No 7 had to head home from point-blank range. But, no, again Villa’s No 1 saved, as he did when Fernandes fired straight at him moments later.All day, Emery’s men were nervy, kicking passes out or straight to Casemiro when playing from the back. United knocked incessantly on the door. Diallo was next to miss, again with a near-range header, this one defeating Martínez yet not his right post.Villa, though, are versed in how powder-puff United are and when they finally launched a raid, numbers flooded the area, and if John McGinn had pulled the trigger they might have taken the lead.It proved a collector’s item as United continued to throttle them. After Mazraoui limped off on 20 minutes – replaced by Diogo Dalot – a raking Maguire diagonal dropped to Mount, who fashioned a grass-cutter aimed for the lurking Rasmus Højlund. It was blocked but here was the rapid back-to-front move recently added by Amorim to United’s armoury.Now, crisis for the visitors. A loose Matty Cash pass back sold Martínez short, Højlund flicked the ball on, the goalkeeper barged the No 9 over, and out came Bramall’s red card.The referee was as correct as Dalot’s 20-yard effort soon after was ballooned wildly and so at the break United were 17th and Villa sixth – on goal difference. But this proved the relative calm before the tempest.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester UnitedAston VillaRefereesmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Logan Cooley and Brady Skjei provided the assists and goaltender Jeremy Swayman shut out the Swiss with 25 saves.“We did it, the wait is over,” Swayman said in a social media post. “Thanks for sticking along with us. It’s going to be a great summer.”The Americans were also awarded the title in 1960 when they won the Olympic tournament and the worlds did not take place. Team USA’s last men’s Olympic title came thanks to the Miracle On Ice at the 1980 Games.Many of the world’s top players do not take part at the worlds as it takes place during theNHLplayoffs, while others choose to rest after the long and grueling regular season. While most of the US players at this year’s tournament are on NHL teams, there are also a number of college players.

They came and took it. I didn’t know it happened like that. I didn’t know how quick they would come and grab it – like in the middle of the night,” Paul, who has career earning of $10.8m, said. “Now I’m watching all these ‘repo’ shows, where they come in and swoop trucks at one in the morning. It’s definitely a funny experience. To be in Europe while it happened is even crazier. But we did get it back.”He found out that the truck was gone when his trainer – who was back in Florida – asked Paul to check his security camera footage to see whether there were any packages that needed to be picked up.To Paul’s surprise, he said “There were no packages – and no truck.”When he scrolled back through the video, the American saw what had happened.“I’m like, ‘What the hell is going on? There’s a tow truck coming and taking my car!’ I thought it was stolen at first,” he said.When he figured out what had happened, Paul posted the black-and-white footage of his truck being towed away, adding a soundtrack of Celine Dion’s My Heart Will Go On.Explore more on these topicsFrench OpenTennisFrench Open 2025US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But it was No 6, “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” that he had circled on his calendar.Roger Penske fires three over Indianapolis 500 cheating scandalRead moreWithout an Indy 500 win, Palou said his career resume would never be complete.Palou stopped the car just beyond the Yard of Bricks. He jumped out his car and took off in a run down the front stretch, pulling off his gloves and tossing them behind him, and ultimately was engulfed by his father, Ramon, and his Chip Ganassi Racing team in a jubilant celebration.Scott Dixon gave him a big hug, so did Dario Franchitti, with both Ganassi Indy 500 winners welcoming Palou into the exclusive club.“I cannot believe it. What an amazing day. What an amazing race,” Palou said. “I cannot believe it. It was tough. Tough conditions out there, especially if you were like, third or fourth in the pack. Even leading, the fuel consumption was super high, so they didn’t want me to lead. I wanted to lead, honestly, so yeah, made it happen.”Meanwhile, Ericsson climbed from his car and pressed his hands to his face at the disappointment of coming so close to a second Indianapolis 500 victory.Ericsson, the 2022 Indy 500 winner, finished second for Andretti Global in a 1-2 finish for Honda. David Malukas was third for AJ Foyt Racing and the highest-finishing Chevrolet.Josef Newgarden’s bid to win three consecutive Indy 500s ended with a fuel pump issue. He was trying to become the first driver to come from the back row to win after he and Team Penske teammate Will Power were dropped to the back of the field for failing inspection before qualifying.Power wound up 19th, the highest-finishing Penske driver on a miserable day for the organization owned by Roger Penske. He earlier this weekfired his top three IndyCar executivesfor a second technical infraction in just over a year, and has had to defend the optics of his teams failing inspections when he also owns IndyCar, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indy500.Penske has won the Indy 500 a record 20 times.It was Indy 500 win number six for Ganassi, who has been on a dominating wave since hiring Palou ahead of the 2021 season. Palou then won the championship that year, has added two more titles and now seems on pace for a fourth one.“The guy is just unbelievable – I don’t know what else to say,” Ganassi said. “It is an incredible thing – it’s going to make Alex Palou’s career, it is going to make his life, and it has certainly made mine.”Kyle Larson won’t complete “the double” after crashing out of the Indianapolis 500 before he headed to North Carolina to compete in the Coca-Cola 600 Nascar race.Explore more on these topicsIndycarMotor sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It did not return for the remainder of the afternoon as he was celebrated in an emotional, elaborate tribute following his retirement from professional tennis last November, marking the end of one of the greatest sporting careers in history.“I have been very, very emotional,” Nadal said afterwards. “I think it was perfect, honestly. I couldn’t expect a more emotional day.”Farewell, Rafael Nadal: it was my pleasure to know one of sport’s most gracious champions | Kevin MitchellRead moreA year ago, Nadal’s career at Roland Garros came to an end after a tight, first-rounddefeat by ­Alexander Zverev. Although he knew it would probably be his final act as a ­professional player, Nadal had opted against receiving a real farewell ceremony after his defeat as he was not 100% certain he would end his career. He ultimately chose to end it at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga after Spain were defeated by the Netherlands.Regardless of where Nadal officially ended his career, Roland Garros was always going to be his final destination. He retired with an incredible 112-4 record here, winning the title 14 times and establishing a level of dominance almost unheard of at the highest level of the most prominent, global professional sports. “To win 14 grand slams [titles] in the same place, here in Roland Garros, that can happen,” Nadal said, smiling. “But it’s gonna take a while, at least 30 more years.”Shortly after Lorenzo Musetti’s mercifully straightforward victory against Yannick Hanfmann, the main event began. The FrenchTennisFederation had provided the majority of spectators on Court Philippe-Chatrier with orange shirts that read “Merci Rafa”. A small minority at the top level of the stadium, meanwhile, were gifted a white shirt, which the organisers had strategically arranged so that the crowd spelled out: “14 RG” alongside the image of a trophy on one side and “Rafa” bracketed by two hearts on the other. Nadal, wearing a black suit, was ushered on to the court towards a lectern in the middle of the service line.He worked through a pre-prepared trilingual speech, navigating French, English and Spanish. He was accompanied in the audience by a large contingent of his family, including his parents, his uncle Toni, who coached him from his childhood to the record books, his wife Mery and their two‑year-old son, Rafael. He addressed each of them directly throughout the speech. Other ­familiar faces, such as Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, were present in the crowd.View image in fullscreenRoger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray congratulate Rafael Nadal in Paris.Photograph: Ella Ling/ShutterstockTowards the end of the ceremony, Nadal was joined on the court by his three greatest rivals, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Nadal said: “To have my three biggest rivals there in the court with me meant a lot, no? And at the same time it’s a great message for the world, I think, that best rivals, toughest rivalries probably in the history of our sport, are able to be good colleagues, to respect each other. You don’t need to hate the opponent to try to beat him with all your forces.”As he discussed his rivals later in a lengthy press conference, Nadal found himself thinking about ­Murray. The pair had not been in touch for a while until last month when, immediately after Arsenal defeated Real Madrid, Nadal received a message from Murray. Nadal, a diehard Real Madrid fan, pulled out the phone and read Murray’s message out: “I’m gonna read [Murray’s text], because it’s quite good: ‘Hey, Rafa, haven’t spoken to you in a while. Just checking in to make sure you are OK.’ So honestly, it took me like five ­seconds to realise what I was reading, because at the beginning, I said: ‘OK, he’s such a nice guy. He’s asking about how I’m doing, family.’ After five ­seconds, I said: ‘This always was [the] British sense of humour,” Nadal, said laughing. “By the way, I didn’t text him back when PSG beat Arsenal.”After 40 minutes, the ceremony ended with a final emotional trigger for Nadal as Gilles Moretton and ­Amélie Mauresmo, the FFT ­president and the Roland Garros tournament director respectively, unveiled a plaque on-court with Nadal’s footprint and signature. Court Philippe‑Chatrier will bear his footprint forever.“It has been unforgettable, plenty of emotions for a guy like me that, I don’t love these kind of things because I’m still a little bit shy for all this stuff,” Nadal said. “I don’t like a lot to be the centre of attention for these things. It was enough when I was playing tennis. But I enjoyed it, honestly. I suffered a little bit with the emotions, but I enjoyed a lot.”Explore more on these topicsRafael NadalFrench OpenFrench Open 2025TennisShareReuse this content"

This meant the video assistant referee could not intervene to rule on whether the forward had illegally kicked the ball from Altay Bayindir’s hands – as Bramall judged – and Unai Emery claimed later that this was the “key moment” that cost Villa Champions League ­qualification.The incident happened in the 73rd minute with the game at Old Trafford goalless and as ­Newcastle were losing to Everton, Villa – despite having had Emi Martínez sent off – were heading for the ­Champions League. Bramall’s ruling caused a furious reaction from Emery and his staff. After this Amad Diallo and Christian Eriksen goals – each provoking sarcastic Emery gestures – gave United a 2-0 win. The visitors ended in sixth and so will play Europa League football next season.Aston Villa rage at referee as Champions League hopes end at Manchester UnitedRead moreDamian Vidagany, Villa’s director of football, said: “The complaint is not about the decision. The complaint is about the selection of the ­referees. One of the most inexpe­rienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.”Villa later released a statement on X saying: “Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford. With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across thePremier Leaguetoday, Mr. Bramall was the 2nd least experienced.The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers’ goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, … was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.“As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.“Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.”Bramall has been a select group 1 referee since 2022. Vidagany said: “It’s not about the decision. The decision is clear. It’s a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.”Emery said: “Today we can speak about the season, we can speak about the game we played today and we can speak about the key moments. And the key moments of course was the goal of Morgan Rogers and how the referee in that moment decided this action.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I believe in VAR and I think we have referees in the Premier League but sometimes they make a mistake – we all do, I do. [But] with this goal maybe we could get a better result and Champions League position but we didn’t deserve more than the result we have.”Villa’s captain, John McGinn, said: “It’s tough to take in the circumstances. Man United deserved to win, they were the better team, but the decision is incredible … . I know this is the rule. I’ve seen it a couple of times, but it’s so, so hard to take, especially when the impact is so big. For Thomas to blow his whistle at that point – phwoar, it’s really tough to handle. We didn’t deserve to win the game but at that point you’re 1-0 up with 20 to go, and all you need is a point to get in the Champions League. It’s a really costly one.”Emery was asked if the result means Martínez will depart in the summer. “I don’t know, he has a contract with us and we are very happy,” said the manager.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaManchester UnitedRefereesPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

There were tears and celebrations. There was Bobby Robson and Johan Cruyff. There were tributes from colleagues, peers, friends and family and an invitation to “go gallivanting” from Gazza.“You don’t believe it but you will be missed,” said Pep Guardiola.The 64-year-old largely held it together as he was taken down memory lane and ushered towards the exit door of the BBC’s top sports programme after 26 years of hosting. Only a sniffle betrayed his deeper feelings as he signed off for the last time. “Rather like my football career, everyone else did the hard work and I got the plaudits”, he said. “It’s been utterly joyous.”Lineker has often described the opportunity to be a custodian of a programme he himself had grown up watching as “a privilege”. In truth, the former England captain’s stint as presenter dwarfs that of every other host. From David Coleman to Des Lynam, the host of Match of the Day has also been the face of the BBC’s sports programming and Lineker continued that tradition, but only his presence has been consistent across an entire generation.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker (right) joined Match of the Day in 1999, presenting alongside Trevor Brooking (left) and Alan Hansen (centre).Photograph: PA Images/AlamyAfter an initial stint as a pundit, Lineker’s presenting debut came on 7 August 1999. He introduced himself with a Lynam-esque moment of fourth-wall breaking. “Hey, tell you what, football’s back,” he said, before adding: “Any good? Did I get the job?”His first match was Chelsea at home to promoted Sunderland, a thrashing led by Gianfranco Zola; his punditry panel Alan Hansen and Trevor Brooking.Twenty-six years later and Lineker saw out his last 90 minutes of action and analysis in the company of Alan Shearer and Micah Richards. Both men are bigger, louder and snappier than their predecessors. They also work with Lineker all week long as part of The Rest Is Football, the hit podcast produced by Lineker’s Goalhanger studio. There, their personalities are given looser rein and banter gushes freely. The more mannered versions of the trio on MOTD can seem a little awkward by comparison.Over the years Lineker found a distinctive voice as a broadcaster, conveying his enthusiasm for the game while adopting an avuncular approach to the athletes he was watching. He also indulged his fondness for wordplay and made many deprecating references to the achievements of his career.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker presenting Match of the Day in 2000.Photograph: YoutubeHis boyish looks endured for decades, his ageing betrayed only by his whitening hair. In 2015 he agreed to present MOTD in “just my undies” if the team he had once played for and always supported, Leicester City, won the Premier League. The Foxes duly pulled off the miracle and Lineker half-honoured his commitment: the white bloomers were more shorts than pants.At that point in his career it was as close to controversy as Lineker had come. The player who never received a yellow card had become the good guy host, even-handed in his observations and gentle in his humour. But his pants pledge came via a post on Twitter and Lineker’s social media activity was to change the perception the public had of him.He used Twitter to articulate his personal political views. His support for refugees brought attacks from the press and strangers into his home. Two years ago, criticism of the previous government’s language on asylum led to debates over impartiality and a brief suspension, only for Lineker’s pundit peers to walk out in solidarity.Scrutiny of Lineker’s activity away from the studio has only grown since, at the same time as his independence from the BBC has deepened. The decision that Lineker would begin to step away from his BBC responsibilities was made last autumn, with the promise of a last dance at the men’s World Cup next summer. Lineker’s decision two weeks ago to repost content relating to the Gaza conflict that contained an antisemitic symbol then put an end to plans for an extended farewell.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker with Alan Shearer and Micah Richards during his last Match of the Day.Photograph: Match of the Day/PA“It wasn’t meant to end this way,” was how Lineker opened his final show, but there was to be no confessional. Of course it was a set up for a joke. “With the title race over, the Champions League was all we had left to talk about,” said Lineker as Richards grimaced keenly, but the camera didn’t linger.As ever with a show that is edited with military precision, the match action had to be cued up. “We’ll take it in table order,” Lineker said. The show rolled on.There were little chuckles at the prospect of free pints at Shearer’s Bar at St James’ Park and a recital of law 12 relating to the control of the ball in a goalkeeper’s hand. The Chelsea defender Levi Colwill was compared to a “prime Lineker in the box” by Richards and giggles were had over unrevealed remarks relating to Sunderland made by Shearer in the green room.There was a graphic that got the West Ham manager wrong and Lineker momentarily confused Brighton and Bournemouth. It was all as familiar and as comforting as a warm bath. Then, finally, the plug was pulled.Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerMatch of the DayBBCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was the impromptu guard of honour that Liverpool gave ­Crystal ­Palace in recognition of their historic FA Cup win and the tumultuous reception that meant everything to Trent ­Alexander-Arnold as he stepped on to the podium to collect one final medal with his boyhood club. Most ­poignantly and appropriately, there was the sight of Alan Hansen passing thePremier Leaguetrophy to Virgil van Dijk. A weight of history passed between two great Liverpool captains as well.Van Dijk and Hansen, what a central defensive partnership they would have made. The Scot had been the lastLiverpoolcaptain to receive a league championship trophy in front of the club’s fans, 35 years and 24 days earlier. How fitting it should be him to give the cherished piece of silverware to Liverpool’s current captain. How good it was to see Hansen too, less than a year after he was in hospital with a serious illness. Jordan ­Henderson was denied that electric moment with supporters by the pandemic in 2020, so too Jürgen Klopp. Both were present to witness Van Dijk and Arne Slot revel in Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th league title in front of the Kop.The lifting of the Premier League trophy was accompanied by a ­deafening sound, and not only from the fireworks that exploded behind the Liverpool squad. Anfield had craved this moment since 1990 and the sight of the silver­ware being raised in Van Dijk’s hands ignited an outpouring of joy and pride. Amid the frenzied celebrations that followed, the Nether­lands international called Hansen over. Together they lifted the title in front of the Kop. The 69‑year‑old then made a ­respectful exit and allowed the champions to soak up the acclaim. There will be more to follow when Liverpool parade the trophy through the streets of the city on Monday in front of an anticipated 750,000 fans.For one of them, ­Alexander‑Arnold, this was a moment where apprehension turned to the deepest appreciation. The departing defender had been roundly booed on his last Anfield­appearance. Whether it was the subsequent admonishments from Mohamed Salah and Klopp that did the trick, here he was given the ­warmest and most deserving of sendoffs. His name had been loudly cheered when announced before kick-off, although there were a few boos, and he was cheered again when replacing Conor ­Bradley at the start of the second half.However, the ovation ­Alexander-Arnold received when stepping up to collect his ­second Premier League winner’s medal was magnificent. His service and contribution rightly acclaimed, he kissed the badge on his chest and thumped his heart in response. The defender was in tears after the final whistle and inconsolable when his parents, Dianne and Michael, joined him on the pitch during the trophy celebrations.Next came Salah, who collected the Premier League’s Golden Boot and the playmaker of the season award having finished with 29 goals and 18 assists. He delivered one final goal to ensure Liverpool did not end with defeat, equalising with six ­minutes left after Ismaïla Sarr had given Palace an early lead and Ryan Gravenberch had been sent off. In doing so, Salah equalled the Premier League record of 47 goal involvements in a season, set by Andy Cole in 1993-94 and equalled by Alan Shearer the next year, in 42-game campaigns.View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah celebrates scoring Liverpool’s equaliser.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAAnfield was in party mode long before kick-off and Palace’s opener barely made a dent in the celebrations. ­Oliver Glasner’s team gave the Premier League champions a guard of honour before kick-off. Liverpool got to the end of the line and formed one of their own.

Another former Liverpool manager, Rafael Benítez, was also in attendance 20 years to the day since Istanbul. Liverpool’s captain on that unforgettable night, Steven ­Gerrard, was here for the presentation ceremony too along with the club’s principal owner, John W Henry, and chairman, Tom Werner.The contest itself seemed incidental. Slot’s side were badly exposed when Bradley’s attempt to find Salah was intercepted by Tyrick Mitchell, who turned and found Sarr unmarked outside the Liverpool area. Van Dijk was stationed at left-back when ­Bradley played his pass and by the time he recovered ground Sarr had slotted a cool finish beyond Alisson.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr gives Crystal Palace the lead.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAlexander-Arnold gave Anfield a reminder of what they will miss by releasing his fellow substitute ­Darwin Núñez with a sublime pass. Dean Henderson was off his line quickly to smother the striker’s shot.Liverpool’s chances of recovery appeared to recede moments later when Gravenberch, dropped into central defence as Slot threw on his attacking options, miscontrolled a high ball and felled Daichi Kamada as he attempted to make amends. Gravenberch had been booked for diving in the Palace box but was shown a straight red for denying the midfielder a clear ­goalscoring opportunity. He will serve a one-match ban at the start of next season.Liverpool, and Salah, would not be denied. When Núñez crossed to the far post late on, Cody Gakpo headed back across goal towards the lurking, ­leading marksman. Salah converted from close range via a deflection off Maxence Lacroix for his 34th goal in all competitions this season. He rightly milked the acclaim of the Kop, before Hansen and Van Dijk got the real party started.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

All the ones that have the answers or the ones that have the truth, they were saying that we are too young, we are not good enough … They were saying that we were not able to win on this pitch because we are too young, because we are not experienced.“Unfortunately for them, they have all been wrong. All the ones that have the truth and have the answers to everything. So in English, how do you say? Eff-off to all of them, because the players deserve that. The effort they have been doing is fantastic. Most of the time it [the noise] was from the outside was: we are not good enough, we are too young, we don’t have leaders, blah, blah blah, these kinds of things.“We are in a business where people judge us because of results.

The goal came from a first note of urgency, Matheus Nunes surging down the right, found by a flick from Omar Marmoush.Newcastle v Everton, Fulham v Manchester City, and more: Premier League final day – liveRead moreNunes crossed. The ball was deflected in a high, slow arc off the glove of Bernd Leno, hanging idly as the day seemed to freeze for a moment. At the back post Gündogan adjusted his feet, ran the numbers, corrected the descent vector a couple of times, then launched himself into a perfectly balanced, viciously executed flying overhead volley, which clanged down into the Fulham goal off the underside of the crossbar.With that, the afternoon eased into something more manageable for City. Fulham were peppy and keen, made chances, had shots blocked and really might have equalised before City made it 2-0 on 71 minutes, as the score would remain to the end.This time the goal came from the penalty spot after Jérémy Doku had been tripped. Erling Haaland rolled the ball into the corner like the ice‑cold big-note goal machine he is,apart from in FA Cup finals.And so for Manchester City the memory circuits can be purged, the scar tissue of winter allowed to heal. The potential disaster of missing out on the Champions League has been averted with a third-placePremier Leaguefinish. A summer reset is close at hand. What better way to ease the pains of winter than a few weeks in the sun at Fifa’s low-throttle power‑grab spectacular. Next stop: Wydad AC at the Lincoln Financial Field three weeks from now.With Fulham’s own season all but done there were three potential notes of City drama on the line at kick-off. First, they could drop out of the top five, an unlikely outcome given three other results would have to align and the last time City lost against Fulham was shortly before the invention of the flint-headed axe.Second, there was an opportunity here for further sentimental farewells. And third there were personal points to be made among those City players who will remain for the job of refurbishment. Kevin De Bruyne came on as a late substitute. More significantly, Jack Grealish was absent entirely, and not in a metaphorical way this time, but literally not even on the bench.View image in fullscreenIlkay Gündogan acrobatically fires Manchester City ahead against Fulham.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersAfterwards, Pep Guardiola denied there was any significance to this beyond squad rotation, while also admitting Grealish’s ultimate future at the club was a question “for Jack and his agent”. “It’s not anything personal about Jack, absolutely anything. I am the person who fought [for Jack] to come here and fought [for him] to stay here this season.” In the event De Bruyne got the last six minutes here, applauded warmly in pockets around the ground as he came on – followed by another chant of “Chelsea reject” – and serenaded all game by the City fans.And from the start Craven Cottage was breezy, sunny, chilly, loud, sleepy and restless all at once, with an agreeably holiday-ish feel after a good Fulham season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe opening goal was the first notable act of the afternoon. Guardiola deserves a nod for employing Gündogan in a roving semi-No 10 role, from where he was on hand to wander in under that deflected cross.Fulham woke up, broke well down the right a few times, and saw a couple of shots blocked. Adama Traoré had a run through on goal but was unable to control a looping pass over his shoulder, producing instead a first touch with all the feather-footed delicacy of a man dismantling a tree stump with a blunt axe. Kenny Tete forced a fine save at full stretch from Ederson just before half-time.City were in containment mode for much of the second half, but always threatened to punish Fulham down Doku’s side. Haaland celebrated with real feeling in front of the City fans after his penalty had sealed the game. This was his 22nd league goal of the season, although it takes a fairly basic assessment of the outline numbers to conclude he doesn’t carry any weight for City’s fallow year.Haaland was there too for all the big losses. The win percentage is much higher without him this season, evidence that Haaland is an elite asset in a high-functioning team that can keep the ball, but that it’s also a whole lot easier to say, well, I did my job, when you only have one of those to do. How Guardiola rebuilds around his one remaining undeniably world-class player will be fascinating to watch.This, though, was a safe enough end point for both teams. Fulham played well here with nothing on the line. City got to say another fond farewell to their greatest ever footballer. And Guardiola will now get to draw the curtain down on a strange, fretful but ultimately safe season of collapse and retrenchment.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Given their often outstanding performances in the course of a Carabao Cup-winning season, the players fully deserve their fifth-place finish.It would have felt rough justice had this masterclass in how to win away from David Moyes’s gloriously obdurate Everton dashed that long-cherished dream but, as Alcaraz headed a fine 65th-minute winner, Howe looked as troubled as at any time this season.Newcastle’s manager diagnosed a bad case of nerves. “It was definitely not the way we wanted the day to go,” he said. “You can’t underestimate Everton, they’re very solid but I sensed our desire to win was almost too great.“ It wasn’t like us, we haven’t played like that for a long time. I had to change things tactically three times and it was a bit weird to be celebrating at the end, but hopefully during the course of the evening my mood will improve. Over the season, we’ve deserved it. I’m very proud of the players.”Moyes was unstinting in his congratulations, emphasising just how well Howe has done, before turning slightly mischievous. “Jordan enjoyed his clean sheet,” he said, referencing the England goalkeeper’s enduring devotion to his former employer and Newcastle’s local rivals, newly promoted Sunderland. “But it was a great team performance. It would have been easy for the players to be on the beach; instead we were magnificent.”Everton were one point above the relegation zone when Moyes succeeded Sean Dyche in January but here they sealed 13th place with a degree of comfort and considerable control.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Carlos Alcaraz heads home the winning goal at St James’ Park.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersNewcastle started slowly and seemed so strangely flat that they appeared in need of an urgent injection of adrenaline. This listlessness allowed the visitors to gain an increasing first-half foothold and, while the initially underworked Pickford was permitted to show off his much superior footwork, Nick Pope dived smartly to divert James Garner’s 25-yard shot.When Pickford was finally called to arms, Tyneside’s favourite pantomime villain demonstrated why he has 75 England caps by making a fine double save to deny Sandro Tonali from distance then Alexander Isak on the rebound. Forget the ties that bind Pickford to Sunderland, a big part of Newcastle supporters’ antipathy towards him is because they know how good he is.Not to be outdone, Pope promptly performed wonders to tip Alcaraz’s header over the bar after the Argentinian’s connection with Vitalii Mykolenko’s fine cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBy now Howe and his assistant, Jason Tindall, were deep in earnest conversation. Part of their problem was that Isak, although he passed a late fitness test to start, was far from his fluent best. A longstanding groin problem has clearly troubled him in recent weeks; summer surgery possibly beckons.With the Everton old boy Anthony Gordon struggling on the left wing before his replacement by Joe Willock at half-time, Howe had reason to be grateful that, yet again, Tonali was impressing in central midfield, intercepting a series of potential visiting counterattacks.Howe used the interval to implement a switch from a back three to a four. This revamp involved Dan Burn going to left-back and the England defender, so assured at centre-half, suddenly looked less sure-footed.As the tension grew Howe and Tindall exchanged cross words with a distinctly unhappy-looking Isak regarding the Swede’s perceived negligence of defensive duties. Then came a further reshuffle with Kieran Trippier replacing Sven Botman, in a move that allowed Burn to return to his preferred position.Maybe there was simply too much change because Alcaraz finally scored the goal he had long been threatening. A fine header created by Mykolenko’s cross, it left Howe with head in hands.There was still time for a couple more examples of Pickford’s craft, including a top-drawer tip-over from Bruno Guimarães, before news of Villa’s defeat dictated the party could begin. “The achievement’s huge,” said Howe, after leading his team into the Champions League for a second time in three years. “It’s a huge moment for this club.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedEvertonmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Martin Chivers, Steve Perryman, Pat Jennings, Ricky Villa and Ossie Ardiles to name but a handful. They formed part of the post-match guard of honour forAnge Postecoglouand his players, the club’s newly anointed Europa League-winning heroes, the exterminators of the trophy drought. Postecoglou had embraced each of the legends and now they turned to applaud him.It was a touching moment, one he is unlikely to forget as he luxuriated in the continued afterglow of Wednesday’svictory over Manchester Unitedin Bilbao – and sought to move on quickly from this latest Premier League capitulation. The question that positively screamed in the background concerned whether Daniel Levy will give Postecoglou the thumbs up or down when he carries out his review into the manager’s future.The story here went beyond a Brighton victory that was enough to lock down eighth place but not to keep alive hopes of Conference League qualification. It leaned into another limp Spurs showing, how they fell apart in the second half. They had partied hard after Bilbao, the release of emotion quite something. It looked to have caught up with them. This was a 22nd league defeat of the season, equal to the all-time low from 1934-35 and that was across a 42-game campaign.Manchester City and Newcastle qualify for Champions League amid Villa fury at refereeing controversy: Premier League final day – live reactionRead moreReally, it was about Postecoglou and whether the Spurs fans would show their backing for him to carry on after everything they have lived through; the sublime highs in Europe, the dreadful lows in the league.There were busts of support for Postecoglou, his name rolling around the stadium at times, including after the Brighton fans had informed him he would be sacked in the morning. It was a little subdued for long spells, hungover, even; the definition of an event after the parade, which had taken place on the open-top bus on Friday. And yet when the Brighton substitute Diego Gómez bent home his team’s fourth in stoppage time, it was the trigger for a mass outpouring of flag-waving from the home crowd, of songs and defiance. They appear to remain with Postecoglou. Or maybe it is simply gratitude.The man himself sounded isolated, exasperated, bemused. Why did he even have to talk about his future after achieving something so cherished and rare? Besides, he does not have the answers. Only Levy does. It is very much over to the chairman.“My gut feeling is I feel right now that I’ve done something that no one believed I could do,” Postecoglou said. “And I shouldn’t be sitting here talking about it [his future]. You’re right to ask the question but you’re asking the person who can’t give you that answer. I am so confident about what we can build at this football club and I want to push on and take it to the next level. We’ll see whether that happens.”The vibe among the Spurs support was happy and relaxed, plenty of Europa League-winning merchandise on show, footage on the big screens to thrill, especially the highlights from the final. But it was coloured, too, by Levy’s programme notes. The chairman did mention Postecoglou, having chosen not to do so at the end of March in his statement that accompanied the club’s financial report. Levy thanked him for making the trophy success possible. But that was it. No clues as to what he may do next with him. No vote of support. It was easy to read it negatively from Postecoglou’s point of view.View image in fullscreenAnge Postecoglou was given a positive, if subdued, reception.Photograph: John Walton/PASpurs played without pressure at the outset and they enjoyed a break when Mats Wieffer lunged into a silly challenge on Mathys Tel. Wieffer stood on one of the Spurs winger’s feet as Tel jinked inside the area, going away from goal. Tel went down. Dominic Solanke converted coolly from the penalty spot.Brighton had a few moments in the first half, Jack Hinshelwood working Guglielmo Vicario with a header from a corner, but they had to show more purpose and intensity. Tel ought to have made it 2-0 in the 38th minute after being played in by Pedro Porro. He shot for the far corner only to see Bart Verbruggen produce a smart low save.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fabian Hürzeler made half-time changes, introducing Kaoru Mitoma and Gómez, dropping Hinshelwood into a deeper midfield role. It may have been Mitoma’s farewell appearance; Bayern Munich are interested in him.Brighton stirred, coming to dominate. Carlos Baleba exerted himself in midfield, Mitoma made a difference. The equaliser came when Adam Webster attacked a corner and the ball fell kindly for Hinshelwood.Brennan Johnson fluffed a decent chance on 56 minutes but it was all Brighton, Hürzeler’s team creating a fistful of chances. Vicario saved from Gómez and the dangerous Yankuba Minteh, who also saw a shot blocked by Kevin Danso. Baleba rattled an upright.Brighton had advertised the next goal and Hinshelwood got it from another corner, Spurs again defending weakly. This time, he had his back to goal when the ball ricocheted for him. The improvised backheeled finish was a beauty. It was a tired challenge by the Spurs substitute Yves Bissouma on Gómez to concede the penalty converted by Matt O’Riley. And it was Gómez who had the last word, curling home his first Brighton goal from distance.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurBrighton & Hove AlbionAnge PostecoglouAustralia sportmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Banned from the touchline after picking up a suspension against Newcastle last week, Mikel Arteta was seen deep in conversation with the Arsenal co-chair Josh Kroenke throughout as Kieran Tierney signed off with a goal before he returns to Celtic and Martin Ødegaard broke Southampton’s hearts with a late winner.After a campaign in which no Arsenal player managed to score 10 league goals or more for the first time since 1924, summer recruitment plans were surely the main topic of discussion. Arteta’s selection of the ineffective Raheem Sterling for only the sixth time in aPremier Leaguegame since he joined on loan from Chelsea was perhaps another reminder of the Arsenal manager’s request for more firepower. If they need any inspiration to take the final step after being confirmed as runners-up for a third successive year, the success of Renée Slegers’ women’s team in becoming European champions against all the odds on Saturday night should provide it.“We were all watching it on the way to Southampton and it was incredible,” Arteta said. “It’s a good example to look ahead. We will turn every stone that we possibly can to make this club even more successful.”Manchester City and Newcastle qualify for Champions League amid Villa fury at refereeing controversy: Premier League final day – live reactionRead morePlanning for life in the Championship is already well advanced for Southampton, who described Will Still as one of the “brightest young coaching talents in Europe” when his appointment was confirmed before kick‑off. The 32-year-old who cut his teeth in Ligue 1 was also pictured sitting just in front of the former prime minister Rishi Sunak and could not contain his delight when Ross Stewart scored a deserved equaliser after half-time.While they could not quite hang on for a point, an impressive first senior start for the 18-year-old winger Jay Robinson hinted at the direction they will probably head in after a disastrous campaign under Russell Martin and then Ivan Juric.So far has Sterling’s stock fallen over the past nine months that the travelling fans were even threatening to take drastic action if he managed to break his goal duck in the league here. “If Sterling scores, we’re on the pitch,” they sang. He almost granted them their wish but was once again otherwise a shadow of his former self. Aaron Ramsdale saved from Gabriel Martinelli and Mikel Merino should have hit the target with a header before Sterling curled a shot just past the post in the sixth minute.View image in fullscreenKieran Tierney, who is set to join Celtic in the summer, scores Arsenal’s first goal.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersIt summed up Southampton’s luck this season that Yuki Sugawara’s shot was heading for the top corner until it struck Declan Rice’s hand but the referee, Darren Bond, and the video assistant referee turned down their pleas for a penalty. Merino hit the crossbar from another cross before Ramsdale did brilliantly to deny Martinelli when the Brazilian was clean through on goal. It was left to Tierney – unusually for him operating in central defence – to finally break the deadlock when he touched home Ben White’s cross from close range to cue a punch of the fist from the Scotland international and a chorus of appreciation from the away end.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Robinson had forced David Raya into an excellent save with a jinking run and, from the resulting corner, Stewart outjumped everyone to steer his header past theArsenalgoalkeeper, meaning he will share this year’s Golden Glove award for the most clean sheets with Nottingham Forest’s Matz Sels.Tierney was withdrawn to another round of applause as Sterling’s afternoon also came to an end. But having survived an onslaught when Ødegaard, Bukayo Saka – who needed treatment on his ankle after slipping late on – and Kai Havertz were unloaded off the bench, Ramsdale could do nothing to stop the Norwegian’s drive from outside the area in the final minute of normal time to put the final nail in the coffin of a season no Southampton fan will remember fondly.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSouthamptonArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Verstappen compared it unfavourably to Mario Kart, and Russell dismissed the ­policy as having failed and the race an ­irrelevance to an audience that were “sipping champagne on a yacht”.F1 had hoped that enforcing two pit stops would make for some ­jeopardy and create at least strategic interest in the 78-lap race through the narrow streets of Monte Carlo but it failed to do so. Nor did it address the fundamental problem which was once more painfully clear in the race on Sunday: that modern F1 cars are too big and too heavy to pass one another in Monaco. No overtakes on track were achieved in the entire race.Lando Norris wins Monaco F1 GP to close gap on championship leader PiastriRead moreVerstappen was leading for the final third but only because he had yet to take his final pit stop and when he did so Lando Norris, who had largely been in front from pole,claimed the victory. “I get it, but I don’t think it has worked,” Verstappen said.“You can’t race here anyway so it doesn’t matter what you do. One stop, 10 stops. Even at the end I was in the lead, but my tyres were completely gone, and you still can’t pass. We were almost doing Mario Kart. Then we have to install bits on the car – maybe you can throw bananas around? I don’t know, slippery surface?”Russell, who had qualified out of position in 14th place after an electrical problem, was equally dismissive as he trawled round, stuck behind the slow Williams cars who were on a different strategy but which he was powerless to pass and was reduced to doing so illegally and taking a ­penalty.He suggested the entire format of the meeting should be changed to a qualifying weekend, given the contest over a single lap usually presents a gripping contest. “The two-stop clearly did not work at all,” he said. “For all of the ­drivers, qualifying is the most exhilarating moment of the weekend.

I want secondly to say: ‘Thank you.’Aston Villa rage at referee as Champions League hopes end at Manchester UnitedRead more“We are very grateful for your support during the season. Now we have to make a choice or we stay stuck in the past because this season is in the past. We either fight each other or we stick together and move forward.“Six months ago in my first three games in charge, with two victories and one draw I said: ‘The storm is coming.’ Today after this disaster season I want to tell you: ‘The good days are coming.’ If there is one club that has proved in the past they can overcome any situation or any disaster it is our club, it isManchester United. Now I also want to say to my players sometimes I was not fair but I always try to be honest to you guys. Thank you very much, see you next season.”In the post-game media conference, Amorim was asked whether he would be under particular pressure at the start of next season. “That is normal, that [was] a risk when I started six months ago. If you start now you can have a pre-season and [next] season will be the first season. So I have to deliver next year. I am really confident we are going to play better and get more results. It will take time. We will suffer again but we need to have better results, that’s for sure.“I am really excited to finish the season. I am really excited to start again. We cannot lose any time. We need to prepare in the pre-season. In the next year we will have a World Cup so will not have time to take advantage of that.

He also appeared to yell at Mercer shortstop Bradley Frye and the opposing dugout. The Mercer coaches voiced their displeasure with the umpires while Frye had to be held back as he approached Gupton.Mercer started to leave the field, while Frye, Gupton and two coaches were ejected. Frye’s mother then jumped on the dugout roof and was told to leave the stadium.

Clark finished with 18 points, 10 assists and 10 turnovers, shooting 2 for 11 on three pointers. Breanna Stewart and Cloud had 16 points each for the Liberty (3-0).Ride of the Valkyries: how the WNBA finally found a home in the Bay AreaRead moreHowever, the Fever were unhappy with three calls in the final 10 seconds that could have swung the game. Clark believed she was fouled by Cloud on the final play of the game, and Indiana believed Cloud had also fouled DeWanna Bonner on a blocked shot. They also disputed the call on Lexie Hull that led to Ionescu’s free throws but could not challenge as they had no timeouts left.“I think it’s pretty egregious what’s been happening to us the last four games, you know, a minus-31 free throw discrepancy,” Fever coach Stephanie White said. “And I might be able to understand it if we were just chucking threes. But we’re not. We’re attacking the rim and the disrespect right now for our team has been pretty unbelievable.”Clark protested with the officials after the final play of the game but later said she was unsure if she had been fouled. “I’d have to go back and watch ... I don’t know,” she said.The Fever’s two losses this season have been by a total margin of three points, and Clark said her team need to address the performance in close games. “That’s probably what’s frustrating about it. ... We are two possessions from being 4-0,” Clark said. “But there were so many little areas of this game we could have improved. It definitely stings, but this is what’s going to make us better at the end of the year.”Aliyah Boston led Indiana (2-2) with 27 points and 13 rebounds. Hull, starting in place of Bonner, and Kelsey Mitchell added 15 points each. Clark’s turnovers were scattered between precise feeds to the rim to her teammates, including Boston, who bounced back from a four-point performance in a win over the Atlanta Dream on Thursday.The Fever had an 80-68 lead with less than nine minutes remaining in the game. It was an impressive midgame run for the new-look Fever against the reigningWNBAchamps, having stormed back from down 14 early in the second quarter. But the Liberty’s experience showed up when it mattered. Jones, Stewart and Ionescu brought them quickly back into the game. They went on a 14-2 run for an 84-82 lead after Jones drained consecutive three-pointers.“I’m proud of how we hung in there,” Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said. “We’ve been though some mud before, and it was a muddy game. But we know how to get out of it if we just commit to being consistently great with how we should play. We got it back. We found a way to win. We had good defense near the end.”The Liberty head home to play a pair of games againstexpansion team Golden Stateon Tuesday and Thursday.

He gave the quick-handed, ball-pressuring Thunder a taste of what it’s like to play against themselves with a couple of relentless pursuits of loose balls he turned into breakaway dunks.Outscored 69-37 in the third quarter over the first two games, the Wolves made sure to avoid another post-halftime malaise. Edwards, tightly guarded by Isaiah Joe in the corner, found enough space to drive along the baseline and spin an up-and-under reverse layup off the glass for a 79-52 lead.“That’s what we need him to do, and when he does it, it takes us to another level,” Minnesota coach Chris Finch said.Explore more on these topicsNBAMinnesota TimberwolvesOklahoma City ThunderBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Standing beside them, dressed in black, wasElon Musk, billionaire ally of Donald Trump and head of his government efficiency drive.“Elon is from South Africa – I don’t want to get Elon involved,” the US president told his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa,during a discussionabout crime against white farmers. “He actually came here on a different subject: sending rockets to Mars. He likes that better.”Musk’s silence during the fraught hour-long meeting was a small but telling reminder of his shift in Trump’s orbit. He remains close to the president and welcome in the West Wing. He also paid a second visit to the Pentagon this week. But a relationship that many forecast would end in anexplosive collision of egosseems instead to be undergoing an inexorable tapering off.On Monday, the Politico websitepublished an analysisunder the headline “Why has Elon Musk disappeared from the spotlight?” It found a sharp drop in the number of times that Trump posted about Musk on his Truth Social platform, from an average of four times a week in February and March to zero since the start of April.Move fast and destroy things: 100 chaotic days of Elon Musk in the White HouseRead moreIn February, Politico said, Trump’s fundraising operation invoked Musk in fundraising emails almost every day, with one message reading: “I love Elon Musk! The media wants to drive us apart, and it’s not working. He’s great.” But such mentions abruptly halted in early March, with the exception of one email in May advertising a “Gulf of America” hat that Musk had worn.In addition, White House officials no longer fill their social media feeds with Musk-related content. Reporters seldom ask about him at the White House press briefing. Members of Congress are giving his name a wide berth.Musk seems to be taking the hint. This week, the Tesla chief executive confirmed that he had reduced his role as the unofficial head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to just two days a week, and will alsocut his political spendingsubstantially – the latest public signal that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.It is a dramatic shift from the first weeks of Trump’s second term, when Musk attended the inauguration, was a constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, appeared alongside Trump in the Oval Office andgave a joint interviewon Fox News full of mutual admiration. Doge dominated media headlines as it took a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy.It seemed that Trump was dazzled by the world’s richest person, who sends rockets into space and spent at least $250m to support his election campaign last year. In March, the president even turned the White House south lawn into atemporary Tesla showroom, displaying five of the electric vehicles and promising to buy one himself.View image in fullscreenElon Musk and his son X Ã† leave the US Capitol in Washington DC on Wednesday.Photograph: Will Oliver/EPABut the polls told their own story. Last month,a national survey by Marquette University Law Schoolfound approval of how Musk is handling his work at Doge at 41% with disapproval at 58%. About 60% of those polled had an unfavourable view of Musk himself, compared with 38% who were favourably disposed to him.Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of Congress who has known Musk for more than a decade, commented: “As his numbers declined, so did Trump’s interest. Trump discards people when their ratings fall and it’s very transactional. It’s nothing more than an initial fascination and a sense of being discarded.”Khanna, whose congressional district sits in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, had predicted from the outset that Musk was not going to last more than four or five months: “I said he’s going to get frustrated, exhausted and Washington will win – not him – in terms of how the town works.”At that time, Khanna was hoping that Doge would make cuts at the Pentagon. Instead, it flouted the constitution to slash the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service and other targets.“I said there’s no way he’s going to get anywhere close to $2tn of cuts; he didn’t even get close to a trillion; it’s about $81bn. He learned the lesson that a lot of very successful business leaders learn, that democracy is much tougher than they imagine and doesn’t bend to their will,”Khanna said.Indeed, Musk continues to hit roadblocks. On Wednesday, the US Institute of Peaceretook control of its headquartersafter a federal judge said the firing of its board and employees by Doge was illegal. On Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco said Trump cannot restructure and downsize the US government without the consent of Congress and that she would probably extend her ruling blocking federal agencies from implementing mass layoffs.Even so, Doge has already enacted deep cuts to the workforce and spending and, in some cases, sought to shutter entire agencies, causing untold damage to the fabric of government.For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) “is not ready” for next month’s start of the hurricane season, according to an internal agency reviewreported by CNN. The disaster relief agency, which employs more than 20,000 workers, has lost roughly 30% of its full-time staff to layoffs and Doge buyouts.Khanna warned: “We’re going to be living with the consequences for years to come because unfortunately they’ve managed to totally destroy USAID, they’ve destroyed NIH [the National Institutes of Health], they’ve destroyed FDA [the Food and Drug Administration], they’ve destroyed EPA [the Environmental Protection Agency], they’ve hollowed out so much of the state department and it’s going to take a generation to rebuild.“I’m hoping that the damage will stop. We have to see what will continue but hopefully there’ll be no more sledgehammer to these institutions.”Even conservatives who believe in downsizing government share the concerns.Rick Tyler, a political strategist who has worked on Republican campaigns, said: “What they’re trying to do is make the government smaller, which I applaud, but they are not making it more efficient because there has been no vision, no plan to actually make the government operate with fewer people and less money.There is no redesign. This is just slash and burn.”Tesla, which is the major source of Musk’s wealth, has suffered significant brand damage and lost sales due to his political work, particularly with Trump. He has also expressed support for the far-right, anti-immigration AfD party in Germany. Tesla dealerships have become scenes of protest and vandalism in the US and beyond.It may be that Musk met his political Waterloo in Wisconsin. His spending of at least $3m helped make Wisconsin’s supreme court racethe most expensive of its kindin US history. He even made a personal appearance in Green Bay the weekend before the election wearing a cheesehead hat – popular with fans of the NFL’s Green Bay Packers – and personally handed out cheques for $1m to supporters.View image in fullscreenMusk speaks at a town hall on 30 March in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He spent $3m on a judicial election his favoured candidate lost by 10 points.Photograph: Jeffrey Phelps/APBut the candidate he backed lost by 10 percentage points. Democrats had used his intervention to successfully mobilise voters in an election dubbed “People vs Musk”.This week, Musk told Bloomberg’s Qatar Economic Forum in Doha: “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future.” The Wisconsin Democratic party chair, Ben Wikler,told the Associated Press: “The people have won. The biggest funder in Republican politics is taking his toys and going home.”Evidently, Musk and his chainsaw have become a political liability for Republicans seeking re-election in next year’s midterms. Democrats in races across the country are expected to use Musk asa political boogeyman in attack adson their opponents.Tyler observed: “The polling numbers, Trump suffering politically, which would hurt his party, which is going to hurt his agenda, caused enough strife that I’m sure he heard from enough members to say, could we just not talk about Elon Musk any more?”Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, added: “It was a trial balloon on how they would reduce federal employees. If it worked and people thought it was great, maybe they would keep going with or without Musk, but they used him as the front person for it and the punching bag. When it backfired, they cut him loose. Not surprising at all.“There is nobody that you can sincerely believeDonald Trumpthinks is important to his popularity or his standing in a positive way because he believes he generates all that himself. And I don’t think he’s wrong about that. But if you become a liability, you’re gone pretty quickly.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She recalls an adult player in an online game persuading her to meet in person. Although her dad worked in IT, looking back she thinks: “My parents’ generation simply didn’t have a clue.”Now aged 18 and a student at the University of Edinburgh, she wouldn’t allow her children to have a smartphone until they’re adults. “As a teen I would have been the biggest advocate on everyone having a phone, but I’ve 100% changed my opinion,” she said.“Until you’re an adult and able to recognise the many ways in which people act deviantly to advance their own interests, you should not be online. The minute there is instant messaging I think it gets dangerous.”Social media fuelled bullying at Sophie’s school, including competing for likes and using anonymous confession apps to share cruel comments. She also wonders what else she might have done with the time wasted.Sophie is one of many so-called digital natives who are growing sceptical of the largely unfettered access to technology that they grew up with. A poll this week suggested thatalmost half of young peoplewould rather live in a world where the internet does not exist, and a similar number would support a digital curfew, while more than three-quarters felt worse about themselves after using social media.View image in fullscreenIzzy Bouric 24, with her flip phone that has allowed her to reclaim time and mental space.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianMeanwhile, Netflix’s hitfour-part series Adolescencehas sparked a wide-ranging conversation about the harms to children of social media and the online misogyny that has taken root on some platforms.Izzy Bouric, 24, an artist from Brighton living in Paris, thinks part of the problem is the way the boundaries between child and adult spaces have blurred on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Roblox in recent years.“I was on [online children’s game] Club Penguin at their age – what you could actually say and type was limited and you got banned for using bad words because it was a child-friendly space, and now you have 12-year-olds on Instagram reading Nazi comments,” she said.Despite this, Bouric says, “I was definitely exposed to things I shouldn’t have been, growing up”, adding that “everyone from my generation has an experience of being on chatrooms and getting solicited by someone who is much, much older”.She would only allow her children to have a smartphone from age 17. “It’s not for children, it’s not for people who don’t have developed brains,” she said, adding: “Your parents not knowing what you’re doing is not the safest thing in the world.”She feels that in recent years social media has become oppressive and “cannibalised by advertisements and corporations” as well as spreading misinformation around sensitive topics such as mental health and neurodivergence. “Suddenly, instead of my friends, my phone was filled with tiny people shouting at me, saying I was doing everything wrong, and then begging me to buy something from them.”The shift left her feeling anxious and unwell and prompted her to opt for a flip phone, which she feels is a breath of fresh air that has allowed her to reclaim time and mental space.View image in fullscreen‘I found myself in moments of despair,’ says Tobias, 20, from Austria.Tobias, 20, from Austria, received his first smartphone aged 11 or 12, and noticed a change in his classmates. “You just sat down and started scrolling and you didn’t really talk to the person one row behind you, you texted them.”Although his school had a policy to keep phones turned off, teachers soon gave up on enforcing it. “They were just buzzing and there were notification sounds all the time,” he said.In his late teens, he began watching videos on YouTube and Instagram. “I found myself in moments of despair after watching short video content for two to three hours straight and wondering, ‘Wow, that went fast and I have no time left for things I actually want to do.’”Tobias was particularly unnerved to see his interest in first-person shooter games resulted in his algorithm showing content from creators showcasing real guns and violent acts. He now concludes: “The longer children and teens have restricted contact with smartphones, the better.”Lethe, 20, a student paramedic from near Birmingham, England, wouldn’t allow her child to have a smartphone until they were 16 and would only allow restricted media access.She didn’t get her first smartphone until she was nearly 18, but she noticed how her friends who had them were bullied, had reduced attention spans and spent their time scrolling through social media rather than chatting or being creative.Two years on from her first phone, she says: “It definitely has changed me. I’m less good at being bored, and my attention span has decreased. I struggle to live in the moment. Algorithms on social media have led to me seeing things I wouldn’t really wish to see.”Nora, 23, a project manager from Spain, wouldn’t allow social media access until age 13 and would restrict use and install content filters, although she would want to open a dialogue with her child, explaining the risks. “I would hope to have built enough trust and understanding for them to feel comfortable coming to me if they ever encountered something scary or unsettling,” she says.She remembers this growing up. Aged 13, she and other girls in her school started receiving messages from a stranger on Google Messages. He convinced some to send inappropriate images and was eventually imprisoned for paedophilia.She also recalls classmates bullying people on messaging services. “I struggled with some nasty messages,” she said.Later, she found that social media exacerbated her eating disorder through comparing herself to other girls and watching weight-loss transformation videos, which can promote unhealthy habits. She also chased likes on Instagram, which she has since deleted. “It was not very healthy for me.”Now, she fears for her 16-year-old brother. “His TikTok is filled with super misogynistic ideas and toxic masculinity – his friends say very nasty things about women’s bodies. That wasn’t a thing for me and my friends.”* Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleSocial mediaSmartphonesInternetDigital mediaOnline abuseParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The history of the Netherlands includes multiple instances ofstorms breaching dikes, leading to disastrous losses of life and land. These traumatic episodes were reflected in the country’s art and literature, as well as its engineering.In countries where floods are less of a danger, memories tend to be more localised: a mark on a wall showing how high waters rose when a town’s river flooded; a seaside garden such as the one inFelixstowe, Suffolk, to commemoratethe night in 1953when 41 people lost their lives there.If we can learn anything from these examples today, it should be a lesson both about nature’s destructive power and humanity’s capacity to adapt. But as with the other sorts of damage caused by rising global temperatures, neither the risks nor resources to deal with them are evenly shared out. As sea level rises cause low-lying parts of the world to be inundated, one of the authors of an alarmingnew paper, Prof Jonathan Bamber, points out that countries such as Bangladesh will be far more severely affected than the Netherlands, with its centuries-long history of holding back the waves.The paper shows that even if carbon emissions are slashed to meet the internationally agreed target of 1.5C, sea level rises will become unmanageable during this century. It argues that a truly safe limit is likely to be 1C or lower, meaning seas would be unlikely to rise more than 1cm per year. Around the world, about 230 million people live within 1 metre above the current sea level. In England, a 1-metre rise would see large parts of the Fens and Humberside below sea level – and thus underwater – unlesscoastal defencescan somehow protect them.These disturbing findings are made more ominous by the fact that even the existing 1.5C goal ismoving out of reach. The continued use of fossil fuels and other environmentally destructive practices have set the world on a course towardsat least 2.5Cof heating. This is almost certainly beyond the tipping points for the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets, and is expected to trigger what the researchers call a “really dire” sea level rise of around 12 metres.Visions of melting ice caps and flooded coastal cities induce fear and helplessness. Butpeople will adaptto sea level rises in the future as they have in the past. This is not to deny or underplay the scale of the threat, but to stress the importance of preparing for changes which are now inevitable, as well as trying as hard as possible to avoid the worst-case scenarios. The less rapid and extreme the changes, the more likely it is that sea defences will be able to reduce destruction in some places, and people will be able tomigrate inland, away from unsafe coastal areas, in an orderly way.Donald Trump haspulled the US outof the UNloss and damage fundcreated to help communities in poorer countries that are stricken by climate disasters. The latest warnings about sea level rises point to the immoral folly of this approach. It is in all our interests to prepare for what is coming, and to ensure that others are prepared too.Explore more on these topicsSea levelOpinionClimate crisisOceansDonald TrumpParis climate agreementBangladeshNetherlandseditorialsShareReuse this content"

We might seem unlikely activists – but we have a duty to dissentSun 25 May 2025 07.00 EDTShareThere is a stereotype that the natural political activists in academia are thehumanitiesprofessors: literary scholars, social theorists and critics of culture are the ones who speak truth to power and fight back against oppression.Yet scientists also ought to stand up and organize against theTrump administration’s attacks – not only the attacks onscientific researchand integrity, but also the attacks on immigrants, on political speech and on democracy. Scientists cannot see themselves as above the fray but rather in coalition with other workers resisting authoritarianism.History is replete with examples of scientists that have taken on great risks to resist authoritarianism. The Dutch neurologist GGJ Rademaker reorganized his laboratory into a base of resistance (complete with printing press, radio equipment and hidden weapons) against fascist forces in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. Some German scientists, including the psychoanalyst John Rittmeister and biochemistHeinrich Wieland, opposed the Nazi regime by hiding Jews and distributing banned anti-fascist literature. Brave German scientists even aided the Allied forces during the second world war.The Trump administration is sabotaging your scientific data | Jonathan GilmourRead moreAt this year’s meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, the CEO of this research society, Margaret Foti,encouragedcancer scientists to take part in demonstrations and meetings with elected representatives. Professors from all corners of campus are already fighting back against funding cuts, the attempted deportations of our international students and usurpations of democratic governance. At Columbia, where I work, faculty have been organizing to urge our university leadership to provide real protections to students at risk of deportation and sue the Trump administration, among otherdemands. Contrary to the stereotype, much of the organizing work is being spearheaded by science faculty – psychiatrists, epidemiologists, astronomers, mathematicians, economists, statisticians, oceanographers – hand in hand with our colleagues in the humanities.Despite the notion that scientists are and should be cautious or apolitical, professors in the sciences are well-suited to political activism. The work of political organizing is not so different from the work of managing a research lab: skills in divvying up tasks, managing people with sensitivity and foresight, and creating clear, compelling narratives to communicate accomplishments (eg to peer reviewers reading our manuscripts) are all clearly transferrable to activism. All science professors were once science students, doing the typically monotonous labor of scientific work, spending hours carefully tinkering in the laboratory, debugging computer code, or meticulously collecting information on the human or natural world. Often political activity involves straightforward but time-consuming tasks such as printing leaflets or making phone calls to representatives. Sometimes there are simple logistics that need taking care of in organizing a protest march. Some activism involves strategizing in coalitions to distribute needed resources or build supportive institutions. None of this is as difficult as “rocket science” and it is in fact remarkably similar to the more banal parts of everyday science.History is replete with examples of scientists that have taken on great risks to resist authoritarianismMany recent actions taken by the Trump administration impinge quite obviously on the expertise of scientists: the attacks on federal research funding, the rollback of decades-long protections of our environment and human health, the excising of research specifically related to climate change or vaccine development. Robert F Kennedy Jr has recently promised to dedicate scientific resources to studying the alleged relationship between autism and vaccination – a question that has been addressed by dozens of studies and on which the scientificconsensusto the contrary is clear – and thrown the weight of the government behind stigmatizing and dangerous initiatives related to autism,contestedby experts and advocates. Donald Trump has also taken steps to sabotage congressionally mandated research on the climate crisis bydismissing expert authorsof the National Climate Assessment.Opposingthese moves andorganizingagainst themas scientistsis a no-brainer. Yet also scientists must fight tooth and nail against the secretive and seemingly baseless incarceration of immigrants, the usurpation of democratic checks and balances, and the reorganization of society along ever more hateful lines. These things affect all of us regardless of our job descriptions. It should go without saying that scientific inquiry cannot flourish in a society dominated by fear, censorship and hate.Scientists are drawn to the work we do for many different reasons, but I would venture that for most of us there is an underlying goal of advancing humanity – whether that is by finding cures to disease, new technology or more abstractly by pushing the boundaries of human knowledge so that future generations are better off. All of that is at risk if we remain “neutral” or “apolitical” at the wrong moment in history. Though there is a plausible argument for erring on the side of “apolitical” in normal times, to ensure trust and guard against undue politicization of scientific work, the argument stretches thin and breaks down given our current political environment and apparent slide toward fascism. Our scientific research itself must remain free from prejudice and aimed wherever the truth may lead, but the work before us is not only scientific research. We must also work to preserve the conditions of life that make both science and society flourish. In these times that means that scientists have a duty to dissent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

But one summer of protest isn’t enoughSun 25 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 25 May 2025 17.24 EDTShareMemory is a strange thing – the way sounds, images, and sensations converge to cement a moment in our minds. For millions of people, the memory of what happened toGeorge Floydfive years ago in Minneapolis will stay with us for ever.On Sunday, we remember the life of George Floyd and reflect on the summer of 2020, when movement builders activatedas many as 26 millionpeople into the streets to demand an end to the state’s violent disregard for Black lives. Many people will opine today about the perceived failures of that time and the years that followed, focusing on how corporate pledges to increase diversity have since been revoked or zeroing in on how many police departments did not cut their budgets, all in an effort to decide whether the summer of 2020 was really as powerful as it felt.But to make any assessment of wins or losses, we have to look back beyond 25 May 2020. And more importantly, we must analyze several key social, cultural and political factors, not just those deemed paramount by elected officials or news pundits.Before George Floyd was murdered in 2020 and the image of Derek Chauvin’s knee on his neck bore into the collective memory of millions, organizers inMinneapoliswere combating the city’s longstanding refusal to invest more in systems that would pour resources into vulnerable communities.Before there was George Floyd, we lostPhilando Castile, shot by a police officer while being pulled over during a traffic stop. There wasJamar Clark, shot by police who responded to a paramedic call.Christopher Burns,strangled when two officers used a chokehold, and David Smith and Terrance Franklin and Marcus Golden and Fong Lee and so many more.Before 2020, Minneapolis organizers fought for many changes, including a review of the Minneapolis police department (MPD) by Barack Obama’s Department of Justice and settlements to change police training and approved tactics. They even got the Minneapolis city council toshift $1.1m from the MPDand reallocate it toward community-based public safety initiatives. That work, rooted in the desire for safer, flourishing communities, distended when Floyd was murdered on 25 May. The painful realities of Covid-19 and the state’s abysmal response, combined with the murders of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, cracked open an opportunity for transformative change. Echoing loudly out of that moment was the powerful demand to “Defund the Police”, calling not just for an immediate divestment from police departments, but from the institutions and systems failing to keep us safe.Critics say the movement to defund the police failed. But Austin and Seattle are seeing progressRead moreUnder the banner of Defund, Black movement illuminated a new vision of community safety that didn’t have to include policing and the broader carceral and militaristic systems, but instead could prioritize care, restoration, and prevention. The Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) had already developed a comprehensiveVision for Black Lives, the north star guiding the organizing of hundreds of Black-led organizations around the nation. One key element of that vision is divestment from the systems that harm us and the investment in the systems that would help our communities thrive.United behind that vision, we fought hard and organized people in the hundreds of thousands. Public opinion shifted, elected officials began considering our demands, investments in community safety increased, and we saw more radical budgets and policy proposals than ever before. Since the Minneapolis ballot amendment placing the police department under the jurisdiction of a department of public safety did not pass in 2021, many would say that Defund failed. They could not be more wrong. On that day, 62,000 people in Minneapolis voted for a different vision of safety; that was 42% of the vote and more people than voted for the mayor, who opposed the amendment.That many people imagining something different for public safety is a huge win for our movement, as it is evidence of abolition’s growing popularity with the public. Key pieces of M4BL’s omnibus bill,the Breathe Act, were introduced in Congress and inspired legislation across the country. We forced what was widely considered a fringe leftist position into the mainstream, making it a viable political stance. We were the spark that ignited protests around the world, from the UK toIndonesia, Colombia to South Africa, enraged as much by the murder of George Floyd here as they were by the deadly police-inflicted violence being committed in their home countries.Through the organizing of Black movement’s Defund campaign, we won over$840m in direct cuts from US police departmentsand at least $160m in investments in community services. More than 20 major cities reduced their police budgets in some form, and in 25 cities,officials removed police from schools.Some look at the landscape today, where fascism is tightening its grip on our civil and human rights, and think this must mean this fight was lost. But if you’re seeing it that way, you’re not thinking big enough. The systems we fight are centuries in the making, and the power they’ve amassed won’t be torn down by one summer of protest. Every major win Black movement has had, from the abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement and beyond, was decades in the making through sustained organizing, strategy, and powerbuilding. It required persevering through the vicious backlash of American white supremacy, capitalism and other ills. The same is true now.As we prepare for the next season of movement building, we’re learning from history, elders and ancestors on how to endure this political moment. We must understand that, though it might seem like the time to retreat, our survival is dependent upon us uniting across race, region, demographic and issue, building community, and fighting back fiercely together.We have not lost. The movement is not over. It is our very power that has them working so hard to erase our wins and our history. Our efforts in 2020 mattered, not allowing George’s murder to be ignored mattered, and all 26 million people who took to the streets should be proud. Now, it’s time for the next step toward freedom. So let’s go.M Adams, Co-Executive Director, Movement for Black Lives & Miski Noor, Publisher of the Forge and former Co-Director of Black VisionsExplore more on these topicsGeorge FloydOpinionRaceProtestActivismMinneapolisMinnesotacommentShareReuse this content"

The Israeli and Russian leaders have much in common. Both claim to be still heroically battling Nazis, inGazaandUkrainerespectively. This fiction is used to justify the mass murder of civilians, spiralling troop casualties and huge economic and reputational costs. Maybe it helps them sleep at night.Bibi and Vlad: the world’s most wanted men – and possibly the most despised.Overseeing the random killing, maiming and traumatising of thousands of children is one of many shared behaviours. These two authoritarian “strongmen” have each plunged their countries into global pariahdom and moral purdah. Conflict keeps them in power. They milk patriotic sentiment to cow domestic opponents and vilify foreign critics as antisemites, terrorist sympathisers or Russophobes. They wage war because they fear peace. Both are on the run from international justice, withwarrantsissuedfor their arrest for heinous crimes.Netanyahu and his far-right cronies deny Palestinians the right to an independent state – the exact same right asserted by Israel’s founders. Likewise, Putin rejects the reality of Ukraine as a sovereign country.Both project messianic, expansionist visions– of a “greater Israel” and a revived Soviet imperium. Underpinning such views is a racially supremacist, ultra-nationalist mindset.European leaders predict Putin, if unpunished, will eventually turn his guns on them. Netanyahu has already expanded the Gaza war to Lebanon, Yemen and Syria. Latest US intelligence reports suggest he ispreparing to attack Iran, hoping to scupper nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran.And would-be peacemakers, especially the US president, Donald Trump, fail to grasp another visceral similarity: neither actually wants lasting peace.Forever waris their preferred option, their default setting. They depend for their survival on violence. If the fighting stops, they know they face a potentially ruinous reckoning.What will people say in Rostov-on-Don, Omsk or Nizhny Novgorod when thousands of returning veterans let on what really happened at the front? How long may Putin last when Russia’s elites begin to total up the mind-boggling economic and social cost of his failed gamble? When peace comes, Netanyahu will face elections – and probable defeat. Jail time foralleged bribery and corruptioncould follow. The international criminal court will demand their surrender. Both could be down and out.That’s why they fear peace. And that’s why relentless international insistence on ending the wars, backed by increased military and economic aid forUkraineand tougher sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Israel’s government, is the way to unseat two of the foremost villains of the age. No wonder this pair, whose sometimes rocky relationship goes back two decades, exchanged “warm greetings” on the phone. They need each other now.Perhaps they discussed ways to beat down critics such as Keir Starmer, as Netanyahu brutally tried to dolast week. Netanyahu thinks the appalling 7 October 2023 Hamas atrocities mean he is free to do anything he wants, however illegal and immoral. He’s wrong. Or perhaps he and Putin swapped tips on manipulating, flattering and bamboozling Trump. It’s a game at which both excel.This Netanyahu-Putin-Trump triumvirate, this mutually reinforcing, cynical political fan-dance, is now the major obstacle to peace on all fronts. The chaotic policymaking that characterised Trump’s first term is reaching new, dangerous levels of incoherence in his second. If the wars are to end and the Netanyahu-Putin era brought to a close, US power and leverage must be fully deployed in close cooperation with Washington’s allies.Right now, the opposite is happening.Visiting the Gulf, Trump more closely resembled a spivvy travelling salesman than a US president. Personally indifferent to starving Palestinians in Gaza, he isbelatedly trying to curbNetanyahu’s embarrassing excesses – and stop him bombing Iran. But that doesn’t mean Trump has seen the light on Palestine. Now his ugly “Gaza riviera” wheeze has flopped, he seems to have lost interest. There’s nothing in it for him.If the temporary Gaze ceasefire is reinstated, and more hostages released, Trump will claim credit. But the fundamental problem remains: he is aiding and arming a rogue prime minister and a far-right governing clique that, like American neocons after the 9/11 attacks, is exploiting the Hamas atrocities to advance a chauvinist agenda while flouting international law – and going even further than that bythreatening genocide.On Ukraine, it’s no better.Trump torpedoeda joint British-French-German-Polish ultimatum demanding Putin immediately accept a 30-day ceasefire, saying he knew best. But when he spoke to Russia’s president last Monday,he caved. Once again, Putin made a chump of Trump and divided the US and Europe.Trump’s dawning realisation that he is neither God nor pope, and that the force of his personality is not by itself sufficient to resolve all worldly woes, offers a glimmer of hope for Gaza and Ukraine. In a snit, Trump is threatening towalk away. If only he would! The US must remain engaged on multiple levels. But a Trappist stance of presidential silence would greatly assist the cause of peace.Like a quack doctor misdiagnosing problems, Trump makes matters worse. Each day, Netanyahu and Putin get away with murder due in large measure to their clueless, narcissistic White House bro. Each day, morechildren’s lives are devastated.Trump should stop grandstanding and delegate Gaza and Ukraine peacemaking to experienced US career diplomats, UN envoys, Arab and European mediators, intelligence chiefs and military experts. In short, he should leave it to people who know what they’re doing. As for Netanyahu and Putin, he should wash his hands of both.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Blind-sided by the abrupt end of her decade-long marriage, Cassie described her estranged husband, Michael, as a “full-blown narcissist” – charming, grandiose, entitled and self-centred. A senior barrister, Michael represented a slew of high-profile clients and was renowned for his arrogance, both in and out of the courtroom.“He’s a narcissist, right?” Cassie asked, adding that friends and family had gone so far as to insist he had a narcissistic personality disorder.“He sure does sound difficult,” I replied, mindful of not offering a diagnosis or clinical opinion based on secondhand information. “Either way,” I added, “we’ve got to find a way to manage your interactions with him.”How Charlie discovered that time wealth can be the key to a slower, happier life | Modern mindRead moreThis is a common therapy scenario – the person seeking help may not be the one with disordered behaviour. Dealing with a narcissist – be it a partner, ex-partner, parent, adult child or boss – can prove to be laborious and emotionally exhausting. Attempts to change a narcissist’s behaviour are usually ineffective.Like all personality traits, narcissism exists on a spectrum. Narcissistic personality style and disorder are two separate but related constructs. Narcissistic personality style is typified by inflated ego, self-centredness and self-assuredness. This personality style can be quite common in western culture, particularly in medicine, law, entertainment and politics.Further along the continuum, a narcissistic personality disorder is set apart by severity and intensity of behaviour and characteristics, including grandiosity, entitlement, manipulation or exploitation, attention-seeking and lack of empathy. Narcissistic personality disorder is relatively rare and is typically diagnosed in males.Like the Greek mythical figure Narcissus, for whom the personality style and disorder are named, narcissists are consumed with themselves and their own image. Narcissists bask in the glow of their own reflection. An over-inflated ego makes the narcissist feel invincible. This can be an attractive trait to others too; romantic partners, friends and colleagues are often charmed by the narcissist’s allure.The narcissist’s sense of confidence is initially taken as an indication of reliability and fidelity. But this appeal invariably gives way to fractured relationships and destruction of personal and professional ties, as narcissists are typically unable to concede mistakes and lack skills necessary for negotiation or compromise.Unsurprisingly, narcissists do not often present for therapy. They see nothing problematic with their behaviour, nor do they demonstrate genuine remorse for hurt inflicted on others. A narcissist may be prompted to engage in therapy for other reasons – perhaps at the behest of a long-suffering partner, or when the fallout from fractured personal or professional relationships becomes insurmountable.Narcissistic individuals are often erroneously categorised as “untreatable”, such is the bewilderment and sense of hopelessness inherent to those left in their wake. While narcissists make for challenging therapy patients, long-term treatment can assist with developing new perspectives and modification of interpersonal behaviour.Claire felt overwhelmed by life’s uncertainties. A self-imposed pause helped her find solid ground | Sara MussaRead moreHow to fight back?Whether due to personality style or personality disorder, the impact of narcissistic behaviour can be devastating. A narcissist’s shadow is a cold and lonely place to find oneself. Understandably, “no contact” is often preferred for those who have borne the brunt of a narcissist. But this is not a feasible option for many, who must maintain contact and communication due to obligations related to co-parenting, family or work. To this end, therapy needs to move beyond a postmortem of the narcissist. The development of coping skills and management strategies is essential.Limit contact to necessary interactions. Make communication succinct and unambiguous. Avoid aggression, pettiness or personal insults. These all fuel the narcissist’s supply, leaving narcissists energised and their victims depleted. Instead, take the high road; it is less crowded and the view is nicer.Do not look to a narcissistic person for comfort or compassion, as perceived weaknesses may be used as fodder to bolster the narcissist’s own ego. The so-called “grey rock strategy”, in which a neutral tone and facial expression is adopted during interactions with the narcissist, can encourage them to lose interest.Setting and enforcing boundaries around contact and communication is essential but likely to rile a narcissist. Loss of control is the ultimate insult. Difficult behaviour is therefore likely to escalate. But like a toddler throwing a tantrum in a supermarket, yielding to unreasonable demands is easy in the short term but ultimately leads to the problematic behaviour patterns becoming further entrenched.Dealing with a narcissist can feel all-consuming. But, both in therapy and other contexts, it is necessary to resist sole focus on the narcissist and their behaviour. Patients such as Cassie can benefit from exploration of their own attachment style and relationship patterns that may have predisposed attraction to a narcissistic person. This can assist in rebuilding a depleted sense of self and, most importantly, help ensure healthier future relationships.Dr Bianca Denny is a clinical psychologist based in Melbourne.

Two referendums on Quebec’s potential independence – in 1980 and 1995 – brought the country uncomfortably close to the precipice. Today, it’s not Quebec but the oil-rich western province of Alberta that is chafing under the constraints of Canadian confederation. US president Donald Trump’s tariffs and comments about turning Canada into the51st statehave set in motion a chain of political events that will probably result in a referendum on Albertan independence sometime in 2026.Conservative political leaders in Alberta have traditionally stoked resentment of the federal government in Ottawa without crossing the line to advocate separation. The grievances are largely economic and in recent years have focused on environmental policies. The Conservative-led Alberta provincial government has portrayed these policies as hostile to the oil and gas industry, and consequently an attack on the province’s affluence and identity.The current Alberta premier, Danielle Smith, has opened the door to a referendum bylowering the thresholdfor a citizen initiative to hold a referendum to a mere 10% of the votes cast in the most recent election. In practice this means that gathering just 177,000 signatures would be enough to put the measure before voters next year. Although Smith claims to want a united Canada, her actions have empoweredseparatists, who have busily begun collecting names of those willing to sign the petition.Separatism had previously been relegated to the fringes of Alberta’s politics. Every provincial election features a few small separatist parties running candidates and winning few votes. In fact, the idea of separation garners more public support than the parties advocating for it. This support tends to follow national Liberal party wins. Until recently, the high-water markhad been about 30% supportafter the 2019 federal election, when the re-election of tJustin Trudeau’s Liberalssparked the Wexit movement, but it then ebbed as the pandemic disrupted politics.If, as had been expected, the Conservatives had won the 2025 federal election, the Alberta separatist movement would have remained on the fringe. Instead, Trump’s musings about Canada becoming the 51st stateupended Canadian politics, allowing the Mark Carney-led Liberal party a miraculous political recovery. Predictably, after a Liberal win in the national general election, support for separation has once again increased in Alberta,this time to 36%, according to a recent Angus Reid poll.The separatist impulse in Alberta is closely tied to partisan politics. For all but four of the past 50 years, the province has been governed by a conservative party. In federal elections, around two-thirds of Alberta voters support the federal conservative party. (Provincial and federal conservative parties consider themselves part of the same movement, but are not formally affiliated.) The separatist movement occupiesthe far rightof the political spectrum and itssupporters are overwhelmingly conservative.Recent polling shows that many Albertans who would consider separation would change their view if the national-level Conservative party formed a federal government, or even if the federal government were to agree to some of Alberta’s demands for building pipelines and dropping environmental regulations. In this regard, separatist sentiment looks more like an expression of frustration with Canadian politics than a movement that truly aspires to form a new sovereign state.However, Trump’s comments about the country’s future have altered the terrain for this vote. Proponents of independence no longer have to make the case that Alberta could “go it alone” as a country. Instead, they allude to Trump’s invitation to statehood.Recognising the potential of the moment, one of the fringe parties advocating for Alberta’s independence has renamed itself in preparation for its desired future: the former Buffalo party of Alberta is now the Republican party of Alberta, ready to don a red baseball cap and make America great by adding Alberta to its union.These sympathies aren’t restricted to fringe parties either. Many in the Alberta provincial conservative base identify with Trump’s Maga movement. The imagined grievances that animate Maga are reflected in some of the party’s policy agenda. In recent months, it has placed strict limits on thedevelopment of renewable energy, amended the Human Rights Act toprotect freedom not to vaccinate, and limited transgender rights and medical treatment.Trump’s expansionist desires do more than answer the practical questions of how Alberta would govern itself. They may also offer meaningful support to the independence campaign. Just as Russia intervened to bolster support for Brexit, we can expect some US interests to lend support to the Alberta secessionists.Even with these interventions, a majority vote to support independence is unlikely. A solid majority of Albertans have no desire to contemplate separation fromCanada. A conversation about the practicalities of secession would probably dissuade many voters from casting a ballot to leave. Even if a majority of voters supported it, there is no clear path to statehood.First, all of the province is treaty land, meaning its status is granted by agreements signed between the federal government of Canada and the Indigenous peoples of the territory now called Alberta in the late 1800s. Indigenous leaders from the three treaty organisations assert that Albertacannot unilaterally extinguish their agreementswith the Canadian state by voting to secede.And also, after the close outcome in the 1995 Quebec secession referendum, the federal parliamentpassed the Clarity Act, which gives it authority to determine in advance whether a referendum question is clear and establish the threshold for a clear outcome. If these tests are passed, then the province seeking to leave enters into a constitutional negotiation with the federal government.With majority support for remaining within Canada, significant objections by Indigenous communities and a high threshold imposed by the Clarity Act, the impending vote on separation is unlikely to result in a quick exit from Canada. Why, then, would the provincial government pave the way for a referendum? Perhaps as a means of improving the province’s negotiating stance. Perhaps to allow an activist fringe to blow off steam.Canada’s Liberals inch toward majority, but one vote could decide key contestRead moreWhatever the reason, the referendum poses significant risks for the province. It is likely to exacerbate political tensions, pitting separatists against federalists. It is likely to drive investment in sectors other than oil and gas out of the province, making economic diversification more difficult. It also draws the Trump administration’s attention to the province, inviting unpredictable interventions.Premier Smith and the proponents of Albertan separation have drawn a dubious lesson from Quebec’s sovereignty referendums. They believe that Quebec’s credible threat of separation has empowered it within the Canadian federation, and they seek to emulate its “win”. This view ignores what decades of separatist foment have cost Quebec, from an exodus of head offices from the province to a politics focused primarily on the question of secession. By opening the door to a referendum on separation, Alberta’s government has invited similar uncertainty and conflict that could dominate its politics for years.Lisa Young is professor of political science at the University of CalgaryExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

I didn’t expect to find hope in a book by a party leaderSun 25 May 2025 08.17 EDTLast modified on Sun 25 May 2025 11.45 EDTShareThe word “care” sits in a strange place in UK politics, somehow combining an increasing sense of urgency with a maddening and very British vagueness. Most of us know that there is a worsening care crisis. The reasons, we are told, are to do with demographics – more old people, put bluntly – and the seemingly eternal lack of money, or governments willing to spend enough on the kind of care most politicians fixate on: the sort that revolves around either residential settings or home visits, done by the anonymous mass of people we call “care workers”. This category of human being is now in the news as never before: a lot of them tend to come from abroad, something that Westminster has nowdecided is intolerable.What a mess this issue is, and how many other matters the debate about it omits – not least the care needs of hundreds of thousands of adults who are learning disabled. But by far the biggest gap in our understanding centres on about7 million unpaid carers, whose lives are explored in a new book. Strangely, it has been written by a frontline British politician; stranger still, the best bits are among the most compelling, moving pieces of political prose I have read in a very long time.The author ofWhy I Care: And Why Care Matters is the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey. Its first third focuses on his own life story: his experience of looking after the mother he lost to cancer when he was still in his teens, and the life he and hiswife, Emily– and their daughter, Ellie – share with his son, John, who was born with physical and intellectual disabilities.Like all parents, Davey experiences joy and worry, but at intense extremes. As theparent of a childwith special educational needs, I recognise his deep fears about the future that awaits his son after his parents have gone: “No one’s going to love him, and hold him, like Emily and I do.” And just about everything he says is full of a mixture of frustration and bafflement I completely relate to, mostly focused on our systems of government and politics, and the archaic workings of what remains of the welfare state.Pretty much by definition, what Davey calls family carers lead pressured, often sleepless, overburdened lives. Large numbers of them have to cope with mental health problems. More than 1 million are reckoned tolive in poverty. Attempts to calculate the monetary worth of what carers do, he says, have put the aggregate figure at about the same level as the UK’s annual spend on the NHS. But how often do we hear about any of this?Family care was part of the pre-political lives ofKeir StarmerandAngela Rayner; it was also there inDavid Cameron’s story. But what it demands of policymakers still seems too awkward: in a political culture that rarely sees issues as much more than debates about budgets, the needs of people who look after their close relatives seem too complex and messy to really grapple with. There is, moreover, a problem with Westminster’s prevailing conceptions about what makes life worthwhile: as politicians constantly describe the voters they worry about as “working people” who make up “hard-working families”, it’s pretty obvious who such thinking excludes.3:42Ed Davey releases personal campaign video for the Liberal Democrats – videoAs a result, omissions and oversights pile up. The UK has no system of paid leave for family carers: one study Davey quotes suggests that 40% of people who provide high-level family care have had togive up workcompletely. Huge injustices are woven into the lives of young carers – who have to start seeing to the needs of siblings and parents at pitifully young ages – and how little the education system makes allowances for what they have to do at home.As I read Davey’s book, Private Eye magazine gave this year’sPaul Foot awardfor investigative journalism to my Guardian colleagues Josh Halliday and Patrick Butler, for their work on a mind-boggling scandal: the story of how hundreds of people who received carer’s allowance (which is £83.30 a week) wereprosecuted for unwittingly breakingcruel earnings rules. Everything came down to a key facet of the benefits system that remains in place: the fact that earning a penny over a weekly threshold of £151 – nowraised to £196– meant that the entirety of someone’s carer’s allowance was summarily withdrawn; and if the relevant systems didn’t pick up any accidental exceeding of the earnings limit, “overpayments” could fester on for months, until people whose lives were already loaded with pressures and stresses were suddenly hit with impossible demands for payback.The government has announced an overhaul aimed atspotting overpaymentsmore quickly, but all this is surely the ultimate example of the institutionalised callousness displayed towards family carers: not just the miserly levels of benefits they receive, but the way the system seems to cast them as people prone to lie and cheat (witness one of manystark recent headlines: “Mother of autistic boy left with £10,000 debt after breaching DWP rules by £1.92 a week”). The way officialdom treats any combination of work and care, moreover, is reflected in rules about education: if you study for less than 21 hours a week, you remain eligible for carer’s allowance – but any more time spent on formal learning means you lose the benefit completely.‘I could never, ever not care for her’: how do carers know when to stop caring for those they love?Read moreAnd now there is another level of cruelty. The government’s plans to cut down millions of people’s entitlements to the personal independence payment will have knock-on effects for carers, depriving an estimated150,000 peopleof either carer’s allowance or the carer element of universal credit which means that many households will be hit twice over. Plainly, this is more proof of how devalued carers are.There may be one or two rays of light. Unpaid care was largely missing from most of thePR blurbthat launched the government’s independent inquiry into adult social care, but Louise Casey – the cross-bench peer leading its work – nonetheless made a point of beginning the process with conversations thatinvolved family carers. But the surrounding political context remains grim: Westminster’s musings about care still seem to myopically revolve around older people having to sell their houses to pay for places in homes, and whether a country that clearly needs as many care workers as possible should make recruiting them even more difficult.Towards the end of his book, Davey asks a handful of questions about very different subjects. “What would happen if we totted up unpaid carer hours and paid them the minimum wage?” he wonders. “What would happen if we looked at families whose real crisis is poor and unaffordable housing and fixed that first? What would happen if we took the concept of a good childhood – with a right to play, a right to education, a right to be carefree – and applied it to the thousands of child carers we know exist?”I have a couple more. As our society rapidly ages, what will happen when the majority of us start to experience life as family carers, and have to confront the fact that our responsibilities to some of our loved ones can no longer be entirely palmed off on other people? And what will that mean for an established model of politics and economics that holds that, unless we are in paid employment, we can be ignored? These will be two of the central questions of the next 10 years, and when they finally hit us, they will change everything. Davey, to his credit, seems to know that.

How is the climate crisis affecting these contrasting extremes?The weather pattern bringing heavy rainfall to NSW is a common wet-weather scenario for the coast. A high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea has stalled, and the anticlockwise air flow around the high is pushing moist air from the ocean over land. At the same time, about three kilometres above the surface, a low-pressure system is lifting the moist ocean air up. As moist air rises, it forms clouds, storms, and finally rain.While this weather pattern itself isn’t unusual, the duration of the weather pattern is. Typically, high pressure in the Tasman may hang around forone to two days. But the current high has been there for the past four days, bringing unrelenting rainfall to NSW. The rain is falling onalready sodden ground, increasing the likelihood of flooding.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThis is reminiscent of what we saw during the March 2021 floods. Unfortunately,the forecastfor the next few days is also reminiscent of March 2021. After the rain from the east finally moves away, another strong band of rain is forecast to cross NSW from the west on Monday.Scientists areactively researchinghow climate change is shaping Australia’s weather systems. We are not sure if weather systems will stall more often or not, mostly because we don’t yet have the computing power to run high-definition climate models needed to study them.However, climate modelling capability is growing every year. Just last week, Australian climate scientists took part in aglobal hackathonto analyse data produced by models with about 50 times higher resolution than a typical one. Earlier studies using lower definition models suggest we may seea decreasein stalled high pressure in the Tasman Sea, and low-pressure systems may also occur less often but producemore intense rainfallwhen they do happen.While future high- and low-pressure systems are uncertain, atmospheric moisture is likely to increase in a warmer world.Climate targets are only as good as the action behind them. We need to aim higher | Amanda McKenzieRead moreAfter the March 2021 floods, my colleagues and I assessed how often Sydney may experience persistently high amounts of atmospheric moisture over the region. High atmospheric moisture is a key ingredient in heavy rainfall, and when it sticks around for a while, persistent rainfall and flooding become more likely.We foundthat by 2080-2100, the chance of these high moisture events may increase by about 80% under both moderate and high emissions scenarios. With more moisture in the atmosphere, when low-pressure systems do occur and help convert the moisture into rain, the rain will probably be more intense due to global heating.As NSW sandbags, Adelaide isramping upits desalination plant to ensure the city’s water supply. Parts of South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia have received very much below the average rainfall over summer and autumn. Drought in Australia is largely driven by a lack of heavy rainfall events. Onlyone to five days of heavy rainfallper year can be the difference between whether there is a drought or not.The climate patterns in theIndianandPacific Oceans, which influence year-to-year rainfall variability in Australia, have been in neutral or dry phases. Neither El Niño nor La Niña have appeared since autumn 2024.

Instead,slow-moving high-pressuresystems have brought frustratingly settled weather to southern Australia.Like flooding, the change in drought occurrence with a warming planet is still a leading topic of research in Australia. Since droughts are rare events, identifying trends in the data is much harder than identifying trends in maximum temperature, for example, which happens every day.NSW flooding: PM delivers climate crisis warning as damaging winds to strike flood-hit mid-north coastRead moreThe “tinderbox drought” of 2017-2019 was the first drought in Australia where theseveritywould not have been possible without global heating. Additionally, southwest Australia has seen a robust rainfall decline since the 1970s, which is expected to continue.Droughts and floods have marked the Australian psyche for generations. But the fingerprints of a warming planet are starting to appear as increasing rainfall intensity and drought severity.

InMickey 17, triple-Oscar-winnerBong Joon-ho’s recent sci-fi blockbuster, the comedian plays a man desperate to join a mission to colonise the ice planet Niflheim. The next thing he knows, he’s on the spaceship – inexplicably trussed up in a luxuriant pigeon suit and acting as the expedition leader’s lackey. Can Key shed any light on this turn of events?“No I can’t,” he says, decisively. He enquired about his character’s outfit during his first meeting with Bong. “And he laughed and didn’t answer.” On set, Key says he “shuffled over in my costume” and asked again. “And he laughed again.” At the premiere, theParasitedirector gave Key “a big hug, and then I said: ‘Just going back to this pigeon thing … ’ and he laughed again. I don’t think I’m going to ask him any more.”Despite not being privy to even the most basic information about his character, Key certainly made Pigeon Man his own. It’s difficult to describe his performance in the film, which stars Robert Pattinson, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo, as anything other than very Tim Key-y: it’s the velocity of his sentences, the raising of the eyebrows, the combination of boyish eccentricity, melting desperation and a tendency, whenpushed, towards bone-dry belligerence. This singular mode is the common denominator in the 48-year-old’s sprawling CV: present in everything from his criminally underrated sketch showCowardsto hisEdinburgh award-winning live actto his pitch-perfect stint as Alan Partridge’s Sidekick Simon.There is something ineffable about Key’s comedic presence – even a legend like Steve Coogan has admitted that upon meeting his future co-star he struggled to work out “why what he was doing was funny”. While the Partridge gig did give Key a profile boost, this unpinpointable idiosyncrasy has kept him a cult figure, even within British comedy. Now, improbably, it looks as if it might make him a mainstream global star.I’d just be shaking my head thinking: ‘The esteemed Hollywood actress is now talking about my poetry show with Tom Basden’View image in fullscreenTim Key.Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian; set design & props: Victoria Twyman; grooming: Neusa Neves using skincare from Shiseido Ginza, TokyoIt’s not just decorated directors who have become enamoured of Key (Bong recently described a collection of his poetry – which renders the surreal, the extreme and the utterly mundane in pithy yet jarringly prosaic verse – as “one of the most amazing things I’ve ever read”). America is cottoning on, too. The US’s embrace of offbeat UK comedy talent has been gathering steam for a while (those in particularly high demand include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Jamie Demetriou, Richard Gadd, Will Sharpe, Brett Goldstein and Richard Ayoade), but Key’s inordinately wry stylings seemed particularly unlikely to translate. Apparently, not the case. Key spent last autumn in LA filming The Paper, the much-anticipated sequel to the US version of The Office, in which he has a major role. Soon after, his new film The Ballad of Wallis Island premiered at Sundance to a standing ovation (“One of the more overwhelming things that’s happened to me”) and has since been released across the Atlantic to glowing reviews.Based on Key and his Cowards colleague Tom Basden’s 2007 Bafta-nominated short, the film sees reclusive lottery winner Charles (Key) pay his favourite musician, indie-folk has-been Herb McGwyer (Basden, who also wrote all the film’s legitimately beautiful songs), to play a gig on a tiny Welsh island. Unbeknown to McGwyer, Charles has also invited his ex-collaborator and old flame Nell Mortimer (Carey Mulligan) in an attempt to get the band back together. Key admits it’s a “quirk” that this deeply British film was released in the US first, but is “surprised and delighted” at its reception. So am I, considering it shouts out Monster Munch, Mick Hucknall and BBC 6 Music presenter Gideon Coe. Key is still unsure how many of the jokes will land, “because there’s no chance an American would laugh at any of those things”. Ultimately, though, the film’s quintessential Britishness – it also features Olympic levels of emotional constipation – “felt like a positive rather than a negative”. With that thought, he begins to doubt himself. “Maybe we’ve accidentally made a film thatonlyworks in America.”Time will soon tell. Key is now back on home turf, his local coffee shop in Kentish Town, north London, ahead of the film’s imminent UK release. It’s a scorching May day and he is dressed for it: T-shirt, shorts, bright stripy socks, colourful trainers. Softly spoken and given to sudden, bashful smiles, he is feeling “self-conscious” about chatting in the silence of the cafe’s informal co-working space, where he sometimes writes himself. On stage, Key’s alter ego is petulant, commanding and bemusingly elliptical. In real life, only the latter remains. Last night, he tells me, he went to seethe hit Gareth Southgate play Dear England, which he describes as “absolutely fine” and “not a problem” – a verdict that could be glowing, neutral or damning, I honestly have no idea.Generally, though, Key plays it straight. He certainly doesn’t have the same compulsion to crack jokes as his character Charles, who seems powerless to stop the stream of dubious puns and inane chatter that spools out of him as he tries to smooth things over between Herb and Nell. Yet, alongside this general buffoonery, Key manages to convey Charles’s gradually revealed grief with the utmost subtlety and poignancy, in what I tell him is quite an incredible dramatic performance. “Oh wow,” he whispers, drowning the compliment in absurdly intense embarrassment. Seriously, though, he does “think there’s less difference between comedy acting and [dramatic] acting than you’d think. It’s all about finding the truth.” Having spouted such a luvvie cliche, he puts his head in his hands. “Oh my God.”It’s easy to get blinded by the new. It’s also easy to take for granted a friend who’s really, really talentedView image in fullscreenTim Key.Photograph: David Vintiner/The GuardianKey began his comedy acting career on a strange but indisputably triumphant note. After graduating from the University of Sheffield, he moved back to his home city of Cambridge and successfully auditioned for the Footlights comedy troupe – without mentioning his lack of student status. His peers – including Mark Watson, Peep Show’s Sophie Winkleman and his future Cowards comrades – did eventually find out, but by that point he was indispensable; they ensured he was still able to perform in their 2001 Edinburgh fringe production, which was nominated for the festival’s newcomer award.In the intervening years, Key has worked steadily: there have beenRadio 4 shows, the sketch series, a sitcom (2022’s The Witchfinder), a double act calledFreezewith Basden, various Partridge iterations and myriad TV appearances. But his success has never felt like “a runaway thing” – at no point has he been “swept away” by a powerful industry tide and found himself “in a long-running sitcom or playing Lewis or something”. This means, at the end of every onscreen project, he still goes back to his solo work: thepoetry books, the live shows. There are upsides and downsides. “You never feel like you’ve lost your way creatively; you might have lost your way financially …”View image in fullscreenTim Key with Carey Mulligan in The Ballad Of Wallis Island.Photograph: Alistair Heap/Focus FeaturesA case in point: Key has spent recent months finishing his new book, LA Baby, a semi-fictionalised, poetry-peppered account of his time spent filming The Paper in Hollywood last year. He looks panicked when I bring up the show – a mockumentary set at a failing Midwestern newspaper – and insists The Paper itself is “not relevant” to the book. So let’s just say LA Baby is a hilarious and often dreamlike chronicle of Key’s mounting insecurities about his inability to fit into his costume, do an American accent and generally act on an unnamed big-budget TV series.Last September, Key arrived in LA for the first time, feeling “petrified”, stressed by the city’s ongoing heatwave and failure to cater for pedestrians (“I love walking around”). Living alone, he initially had no social circle and was only required on set half the week. The writing started as a “very enjoyable form of therapy” in the face of loneliness, clammy discombobulation and homesickness (the last one manifests in the book in imagined sightings of BBC news presenter Nicholas Witchell and an extended fantasy about an Only Fools and Horses cuckoo clock). It was a period that echoed his experience of the pandemic, when he started writing “to stay afloat” during months by himself in his north London flat: his anthology He Used Thought As a Wife covers Key’s time chugging beer, craving hugs and losing touch with reality during the first lockdown, interspersed with grotesque vignettes sending up governmental incompetence.Mercifully, his isolation in LA was far more short-lived: by the end of the three-month stint, he was filming more frequently, had befriended his castmates and connected with one or two English expat comedians he knew from back home “who generously introduced me to their circle of friends. By the end of it, I had quite a nice little group.”I can imagine myself on the outskirts of comedy trying to make friends with Alex Horne. I’ve definitely got it in me to fanboyIn The Ballad of Wallis Island, Key embodies another cartoonishly lonely character: Charles’s heartbreakingly solitary existence is best summed up in the image of him aggressively playing a solo game of swingball. Does Key consider isolation a recurring theme in his work? He seems doubtful. “I hadn’t noticed that. I don’t know. I don’t think those two things are linked. Maybe they are.” Does he find loneliness a creatively fertile state? “Dunno. Maybe. I think that’s more for you to say.” He doesn’t seem overly keen on analysing the prospect (or perhaps he’s just not a fan of introspecting in the company of journalists, which would be fair enough), yet it’s clear he does funnel his psyche into his work: he would be “interested” he says, to to re-read He Used Thought As a Wife, which he wrote during lockdown, “because I probably was going out of my mind, and it would be interesting to go back into it”.Charles, on the other hand, isn’t especially autobiographical. For a start, he’s an obsessive fan – a compulsion Key doesn’t share: he never had any comedy heroes, let alone musical ones. That said, in a different life he can imagine himself “on the outskirts of comedy trying to make friends with [Taskmaster co-host] Alex Horne”. Also, he did get starstruck bumping into ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton. “So I’ve definitely got it in me to fanboy.”Another person Key seems slightly starstruck by is his co-star Mulligan. He and Basden co-wrote the film during lockdown, and the Oscar nominee topped the list of dream Nells. Key happened to have her personal email address; a few years prior she’d asked him to host a fundraiser she was organising. He’d actually declined – MCing a big event being something he’d “find really, really hard to do”. Still, he took a punt. Mulligan was unexpectedly keen; it turned out she was a longtime admirer of Key and Basden’s work – specifically, the pair’s Radio 4 series, Tim Key’s Poetry Programme. “It’s a deep cut,” he nods, mystified. During their US press tour, Mulligan would sometimes reference the show. “And I’d just be shaking my head thinking: ‘This is insane: the esteemed Hollywood actress is now talking about my poetry show with Tom Basden.’”‘What an unpleasant man’: Alan Partridge interviews Steve CooganRead moreMulligan may be the headline name, but The Ballad of Wallis Island’s real charm patently stems from Key and Basden’s decades-honed dynamic. This is perhaps why its wholesome parting message – meaning over money, kindness over ego, the true and the good over the shallow and the starry – packs such a punch. For Key, the achievement of having made the film is inextricably bound up with that bond. The first time he was asked in an interview to pick his favourite scene, he chose one with Mulligan. The second time, one with Basden. But “I found it really difficult to say it – I got really emotional. It’s easy to get blinded by the new and the fun. It’s also easy to get complacent and take for granted a friend who’s really, really talented. Not everyone has that.”For all the lavish, baffling blockbusters, A-list co-stars and LA stints, making The Ballad of Wallis Island is proof of his longstanding good fortune – and a reminder “that the other, more famous people aren’t better than this person you had all along”.The Ballad of Wallis Island is in UK cinemas on 30 May."

Officially, that was before age and decay caught up. Horrifically, forDemocrats, in June 2024 a debacle of a debate against Donald Trump confirmed what Washington insiders had only dared whisper but what most voters had known: Biden should not have sought re-election.Less than a month later, he was out, replaced as Democratic nominee by his vice-president,Kamala Harris. Now, Trump runs wild and Biden’s legacy is buried beneath a heap of unkind reporting – and bouquets of sympathy, after news of his cancer.“It was an abomination,” one prominent Democratic strategist isquoted as sayingby Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. “He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people.”Tapper and Thompson concur. Over 350 engrossing pages, they deliver a stinging judgment, trenchantly written and well-sourced.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesThe two reporters spoke to about 200 people, including members of Congress, White House staffers and campaign insiders. Some reportedly sounded the alarm about Biden’s mental acuity and desperate efforts by aides to hide his deterioration. The alarm was not heeded.Tapper is CNN’s lead DC anchor and chief Washington correspondent. Thompson is a national political correspondent for Axios and a CNN contributor. His speech at the recent White House Correspondents’ Association dinner was one for the ages.“President Biden’s decline and its cover-up by the people around him is a reminder that every White House, regardless of party, is capable of deception,” Thompson said. “We, myself included, missed a lot of this story. And some people trust us less because of it. We bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows.”Original Sin begins with a bang. Its first chapter is titled “He Fucked Us”, from an on-record quote by David Plouffe, senior adviser to the Harris campaign, before that manager of Barack Obama’s 2008 winning effort. “We got so screwed by Biden as a party,” Plouffe says. Harris was a “great soldier”, but the race was “a fucking nightmare. …“And it’s all Biden … He totally fucked us.” Try putting that toothpaste back in the tube. On the other hand, Plouffe doesn’t reveal what Harris knew about Biden’s fitness and when she knew it.Biden loyalists return the favor, too, the authors write: “Many … felt that Harris didn’t put in the work and was also just not a very nice person. Some quietly expressed buyer’s remorse: They should have picked [Gretchen] Whitmer,” the Democratic governor of Michigan.Tapper and Thompson report cold political facts. In 2020, identity politics played an outsize role in Biden’s VP pick. “It boils down to whether he has a Hispanic woman or a Black woman,” Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader,saidthen.Tapper and Thompson lay bare a sense of betrayal.“The presidency requires someone who can perform at 2am during an emergency,” they write. “Cabinet secretaries in [Biden’s] own administration told us that by 2024, he could not be relied upon for this.”Yet, Biden and his minions made sure to clear the field. The representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Biden’s only challenger among elected officials, never had a prayer. Governors stayed on the sidelines.Tapper and Thompson tell us one senior White House aide left because he or she didn’t think Biden should run again. Biden had been walled off from staff to shield his decline.“I loveJoe Biden,” the unnamed aide continues. “When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.”That ranks as an understatement. The cover of Original Sin shows Biden with hands covering his eyes. The former president, his family and his closest advisers – known as the “politburo” here – dwelt in a world of alternative facts.“The Bidens’ greatest strength is living in their own reality,” a source tells Tapper and Thompson. “And Biden himself is gifted at creating it:Beau isn’t going to die. Hunter’s sobriety is stable… Joe always tells the truth. Joe cares more about his family than his own ambition … They stick to the narrative and repeat it.”To quote Lewis Carroll: “I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true.”Biden’s decline was not sudden, according to Tapper and Thompson. The signs were there years ago: “During an eight-day, grueling bus tour in Iowa in December 2019, Biden gave his aides pause. While doing prep, he struggled to remember the name of longtime aide Mike Donilon. ‘You know, you know,’ he said, groping for it.”Donilon had worked with Biden for nearly 40 years. It should have been time to start worrying. Cover-up and denial are foundational to the Biden saga.This week brought Biden’s bad diagnosis.“He did not develop [metastatic prostate cancer] in the last 100, 200 days,” Zeke Emanuel, a doctor, told MSNBC on Monday. “He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency, in 2021 … I don’t think there’s any disagreement about that.”Emanuel’s brother, Rahm, was Biden’s ambassador to Japan, and before that chief of staff to Obama.Democrats must address such self-inflicted wounds. Disapproval of Trump may be all they need to retake the House next year. But reckoning and redirection will be needed to recapture the White House. The party’s brand circles the drain.For now, Trump is the exception that proves the rule: America is no country for old presidents.Original Sin ispublishedin the US by Penguin Random HouseExplore more on these topicsBooksJoe BidenUS politicsDemocratsUS elections 2024reviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1856 New York, Eunice Foote discovers the greenhouse effect, but her breakthrough is dismissed because of her gender and status as an amateur scientist. And in a seed vault on Svalbard in 2100, pregnant Ana is waiting for a freak weather event to end so that she can go home and give birth in a safe, clean hospital.Spanning a quarter of a millennium, Flora Wilson Brown’s The Beautiful Future Is Coming interweaves these three narratives into a conceptually dexterous examination of motherhood and climate anxiety. With each scenario seemingly haunted by absent children, Wilson Brown asks what it might take, and what it might promise, to bring a child into an increasingly ecologically inhospitable planet.View image in fullscreenPromise … The Beautiful Future Is Coming.Photograph: Ellie KurttzLucidly directed by Nancy Medina, stage action fluidly shifts back and forth between each period and there is an effective – if subtle – change in acting registers between each setting. In order of chronology, Phoebe Thomas as Eunice, Nina Singh as Claire, and Rosie Dwyer as Ana, are all persuasive and authoritative anchors to their respective epochs. Michael Salami as Dan, in what is the most fleshed-out of the male roles, also impresses. Staged on Aldo Vázquez’s set of sliding storm-dappled panels, Ryan Day’s lighting and Elena Peña’s sound design, in particular, successfully bind the play’s expansive time frame within single and often striking stage images.Each of its tripartite scenarios contains a compelling dramatic proposition, all individually pressing and prescient in different ways. However, when condensed into a single one-act play, thematically overlapping without wholly coalescing dramatically, it is inevitable that narrative development is circumscribed, restricting the dramatic stakes. Both the individual and culminative endings feel somewhat surprising and perhaps too readily optimistic.AsWilson Brown noted in a recent interview, holding on to a sense of hope is entirely necessary within narratives that seek to address the terror of climate change. Despair only precipitates inaction and one admires the quiet radicalism of daring to be easily hopeful, even if it is not wholly dramatically satisfying. If only the climate emergency, too, could be solved by a deus ex machina.At Bristol Old Vic until 7 June.Explore more on these topicsTheatreClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

I had assumed, given the vitriolthat novel attractedwhen it was published in 2020, that she would be trying to distance herself from it.For the first year after its publication, that was the case, she tells me from a light-filled, bookshelf-lined room in her New York home. “My husband would ask me every week: ‘Knowing what you know now, would you still write it?’” she says, and the answer was consistently: “No, I would not.”Eventually that answer shifted to maybe, and now, five years on, the 50-year-old author is firmly at yes. “I’m really glad I wrote that book,” she says. “I’m proud of it. But having to endure the experience of publication, it was brutal.”American Dirt had been expected to be one of the buzziest books of 2020, having reportedly earned Cummins a seven-figure advance. Copies of the novel, about a mother and son fleeing a drug cartel in Mexico, arrived in bookshops emblazoned with a quote from the thriller writer Don Winslow, who called it “a Grapes of Wrath for our times”, and it was chosen as an Oprah’s book club pick.“The kind of praise that it got was so over the top,” Cummins says now. She wasn’t used to the attention – her three previous books had not received anywhere near that level of hype – and she certainly wasn’t prepared for what came next: a string of bad reviews, one calling the book “trauma porn”. Whether Cummins had the right to tell the story of Mexican migrants, being neither Mexican nor a migrant herself, was called into question, and 141 writerssigned a letter to Oprah Winfrey, asking her to remove it as a book club pick.None of this was helped by the way Cummins’s publishers marketed the book, with barbed-wire centrepieces decorating a launch event, or the novel’s author’s note, which the writer now thinks opened the door to scrutiny.In it, Cummins, whose grandmother was Puerto Rican, wrote that she “wished someone slightly browner than me” had written the novel, but added: “if you’re a person who has the capacity to be a bridge, why not be a bridge?” She also explained that her husband had been an undocumented immigrant in the US – but didn’t mention that he was white, and that his country of origin was Ireland.“I was trying to justify my right to write that book and I didn’t need to justify it. It’s a novel. I’m allowed to write it.” She will continue to write characters who share different experiences from her, she says, and “would encourage every other writer out there to do the same”, as long as they do so with tremendous care.It was her publisher who encouraged her to expand on the author’s note, which in the original manuscript was a one-line statistic about the number of migrants who had died in the US-Mexico borderlands. Before the book was sold, when she was taking meetings with the numerous editors who were interested in buying it, “every single one of them said: ‘Why did you write this book? Why?’” She felt she was being pushed to come up with a personal link to the story, when really she was thinking, given what was going on at the border: “Why isn’t everyone writing this book?”The notion that I was writing trauma porn or that I was unqualified to write about grief was really absurdAddressing “this enormous humanitarian stain on our national conscience” was the real reason she wrote American Dirt, Cummins says – and the reason she remains proud of it.For her, it was “a very personal book”, because it was written just after her father died suddenly while out with friends. It was only later, after someone pointed it out to her, that she realised all the book’s major characters are grieving for their fathers. “So the notion that I was writing trauma porn or that I was unqualified to write about grief was really absurd,” she says.Much was made at the time of the fact that she had referred to herself as white ina 2015 New York Times opinion pieceabout the murder of two of her cousins, the subject of her first book, the memoir A Rip in Heaven. “I have always been white. I will always be white,” she says now. “I have always been Latina. I will always be Latina. Those things are not mutually exclusive. I couldn’t believe that in 2020 I had to say Latino people come in different colours.”The question of which ethnic group the author belongs to is one that has come up throughout her life, and is a major theme in her latest novel, Speak to Me of Home, in some ways a product of her post-American Dirt “soul-searching”. The intergenerational saga follows an Irish‑Puerto Rican family that closely reflects Cummins’s own – nobody can this time accuse her of writing outside of her own experience. “It’s unassailable in that particular way, which is a comfort,” Cummins says, though “that’s not why I wrote it”.The character of Rafaela is partly based on Cummins’s grandmother, who was born into a well-to-do family in Puerto Rico, a “cherished and coddled oldest child” until her father “lost everything” when she was a teenager, and she was sent to the US naval base in Trinidad to work. There, she met Cummins’s grandfather, and the couple “ended up in St Louis with eight kids”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In the end, she is allowed to become a member, but must change in the staff locker room. “That’s a true story,” Cummins says – the same thing happened to her grandmother. Rafaela’s children being banned from speaking Spanish at home in order to fit in better at school is also taken from real life – Cummins herself was only allowed to speak English at home. And like Rafaela’s daughter Ruth, the writer felt like a fraud in all of the social groups at university, where everyone seemed to gravitate towards sororities or fraternities “where everyone looked exactly like them”.Having grown up in Gaithersburg, Maryland, widely recognised as one of the most racially diverse US cities, Cummins was shocked by the way her fellow students at Towson University in Baltimore segregated themselves. “I’ll never forget being in the dining hall for the first time,” she says, where Black students were sitting in one room, white students in another. “And then there were a few tables in the corner for whoever was Asian or Latino, not Afro-Latino. And I was like, where do I sit?”She and her boyfriend at the time, who was Black, tried to set up a club, “Target Unity”, with a view that it could be “a social outlet where people could mix and mingle with people who were not from their same racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic background.” They rented a room in the student union, but “no one came … no one wanted that”.Cummins went on to work in publishing for a decade, so she was “acutely aware that publishing had a race problem”, but it “felt very weird” to be a focal point of that criticism – American Dirt sparked a wider global conversation about race and publishing, out of which the #DignidadLiteraria campaign for greater Latino representation in US publishing was launched.Now her feelings about the book are bittersweet. Commercially, American Dirt was a huge success, something the author wasn’t able to feel excited about at first. She was “relieved” rather than happy every week it continued to be a No 1 bestseller. Though she doesn’t read media coverage or online reviews, occasionally her husband will send her a screenshot “if there’s something really lovely”. Yet so often these positive reviews “are defending my right to author the book”, she says, which she finds “really bothersome”. When reviewers say things like “it doesn’t matter that she’s not Latina”, they are still viewing her identity differently from the way she identifies herself: IrishandPuerto Rican; whiteandLatina.“The book won,” she says. “It’s sold three and a half million copies and continues to sell.” But “in those moments, I realise I lost”.Speak to Me of Home by Jeanine Cummins is published by Tinder.

Similar folk music clubs have since started in other cities including Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø.Musician Tuva Syvertsen started Tuvas Blodklubb, which she describes as “Norway’s, probably the Nordic region’s, and maybe even the world’s first pure folk music nightclub”, seven years ago with the aim of opening up the kinds of experiences she was having at folk music festivals to more people, particularly among the LGBTQ+ community.View image in fullscreenTuvas Blodklubb in concert.Photograph: Knut UtlerInspired by Oslo’s techno music scene, she wanted to make folk music less “stiff” and create an event that attracted younger people. “I wanted to have a place that you could go and get wasted and dance to folk music on a Saturday,” said Syvertsen, 41, who is in the band Valkyrien Allstars. “So that’s what we did.”Part of its gen Z appeal, she believes, is the sense of rootedness it offers in an uncertain world. “Young people feel that the world is unsteady as it is and they seek something real, something warm and close to them. So maybe that has something to do with it,” she said.Valkyrien Allstars.Norwegian folk music, which dates back hundreds of years, is played using traditional instruments including Norway’s national instrument,hardingfele(the hardanger fiddle),bukkehorn(an instrument made from a goat’s horn) andlangeleik(a stringed instrument similar to a dulcimer).The Sámi vocal tradition ofjoiking, which for a long time was banned in schools as a result of racist assimilation policies by the Norwegian government, is also being revitalised by younger generations and artists such as Marja Mortensson, 30, gaining mainstream recognition.The Sámi people are the Indigenous population of Sápmi, a region covering northern Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden, who have been subjected to widespread discrimination.“As long as you know the tradition it’s very important that joiking also lives in popular music or where young people listen to music because that’s how traditional music will live on and be passed on to younger generations,” she said.It is especially important, she added, to have spaces for traditions to live where people can be exposed to traditional folk music. “It gives you some kind of strength to know your own music tradition,” she said.View image in fullscreenPeople dancing at a Tuvas Blodklubb concert.Photograph: Knut UtlerDance is a big part of the Tuvas Blodklubb nights. Before each club night, Syvertsen puts on sessions to teach people the basics beforehand, which she said are also “packed with young people that want to learn”.Many young clubbers, she said, are not used to dancing to live music, but with folk music the interplay between musician and dancer is key.“An actual person sitting there playing for you, that is way different to dancing to a DJ. It’s much more sensitive. Not on the dance itself but in the chemistry between the dancers and the musicians, that’s really essential.”As well as booking live performers and DJs from around the world, she has a house DJ, DJ Sissyfus, who plays electronic music and makes remixes of old folk music recordings. Sometimes she also books singers who sing along to fiddle tunes. “We put microphones under the stage so it’s just the sound of the voice and the foot-stomping. It’s really amazing,” she said. They also have folk music karaoke sessions.Norwegian mashups.In the future Syvertsen hopes to take the event to cities outside of Norway such as London or Berlin. “This [club night] is extremely exotic for Norwegians, so I guess it would work just as well somewhere else,” she said.Syvertsen, who plays the hardanger fiddle and grew up with folk music, said a big part of her own fascination comes from the power of a single instrument and its survival over so many hundreds of years. “There is something about those melodies and those stories that are so still so relevant,” she said.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicNorwayEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sick of reporting on Love Island, she wants to write about something worthy of a Pulitzer prize: death. Specifically, our societal reluctance to broach the subject.She visits a hospital to get the inside scoop from dying people. But she’s also having symptoms of her own and when she’s diagnosed with a rare illness, primary sclerosing cholangitis, things unravel.Olive’s journey echoes Madeley’s – she’d been interviewing terminally ill people for a show about death when her diagnosis arrived – and there are fun intrusions from the real story, this self-awareness cutting through Olive’s self-absorption.While Olive was ready to probe strangers about their mortality, she struggles to face her own. She pushes away supportive fiancée Tess, and starts partying, running and behaving increasingly recklessly.It’s just Madeley on stage, but other characters appear as audio clips, Madeley seamlessly interacting with them in a sparky and charismatic performance. She’s in gym gear, a treadmill and exercise ball as props, and pointedly runs away from her feelings until she can’t run anymore.This is all played for comic effect, Olive’s existential crisis spiralling into farce. Olive’s well drawn as a self-congratulatory young woman, blinded by her ego, but unable to get a handle on her feelings and how her inability to confront them is affecting those around her. There are plentiful solid punchlines – “It occurs to me that my early death could be not the worst thing for my career” – and a great pull-back-and-reveal when Olive’s left questioning her sanity.The extreme comic escalation somewhat dulls the emotional resonance, a sense of jeopardy is missing. But the pace of the show, directed by Madelaine Moore, keeps us invested, the closing scenes imploring us to appreciate the love in our own lives.At Park theatre, London, until 7 June.Explore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Dating from 1916 and written for 24 solo players, it is cast in the form of a ceaselessly evolving single movement, though its four sections echo and approximate conventional symphonic structure. Strauss and early Schoenberg lurk behind the scoring, which has an ornate, jewelled glamour, sometimes described as being like a Klimt painting in sound. Elder, clearly fond of it, lingered, sometimes a bit too much, over its sensuous textures, teasing them out with exquisite finesse and eliciting some gorgeous playing from the BBCSO in the process.The same attention to textural detail characterised the performance ofMahler’s Das Lied von der Erde that followed after the interval, an interpretation of unsparing intensity, magnificently controlled. Speeds were carefully calibrated, and Elder’s slightly slower than usual tempo for Von der Jugend captured a poignant nostalgia behind the surface elegance, while the almost reckless momentum for the horsemen in Von der Schönheit immeasurably heightened the sense of yearning their appearance provokes. The sheer weight of orchestral sound was electrifying at the start and the ending immaculate in its reflective beauty. Elsewhere instrumental solos, played with exceptional refinement, seemed to call and echo across open spaces and voids, heartbreaking and desolate.Alice Coote and David Butt Philip were the soloists. Coote’s voice has lost some of its opulence of late, and a hint of metal occasionally creeps into her upper registers. Her artistry remains intact, however, and she has always been superb in this work, slightly declamatory in her delivery, words and emotions deeply felt, yet etched with restraint and great dynamic subtlety. Butt Phillip, meanwhile, was simply revelatory, tackling some of the most demanding music ever written for tenor with astonishing ease, ringing fullness of tone and verbal clarity, even in the most implacable high-lying passages, all of it balanced with soft singing of immaculate warmth and sensitivity – a truly outstanding achievement in a very fine concert.Broadcast on Radio 3 on 27 May then available on BBC Sounds for 30 days.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Symphony OrchestraBarbicanMark ElderreviewsShareReuse this content"

A battered mannequin lies splayed on a bare stage. A huddle of women carry on bodies, gashed, broken-boned and in one case, headless. These are their children, grown-up, lifeless, eternally loved. Sometimes you think their words are coming, in pregnant pauses when they stand before microphones, as if about to speak. Yet no words emerge. The meaning of this becomes apparent: how do you find language to express the maternal anguish featured in the eviscerated space here?Milk was conceived by Bashar Murkus in 2022 but it could just as well have been made in response to the current killings of Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces – so many of them mothers and children inGaza. That this production feels so hauntingly relevant to the present moment says something about the circularity of violence for those living under occupation in the region.But the production is not so much concerned with the politics of conflict as its psychological effect on mothers. The show, directed by Murkus and produced by Khulood Basel, takes us into the realm of the emotional, and eternally repeating, in which these mournful mothers are caught. Lactation is a powerful visual tic, signifying the life-giving force of a mother, as well as the pain and waste of this milk in the face of death. There are moments of joy and fecundity amid the desolation, but the memory of child-loss always returns.View image in fullscreenSearing images … Milk.Photograph: Eid AdawiThe language of music, movement and visual imagination is deployed with visceral effect. A cast of six women (Salwa Nakkara, Reem Talhami, Shaden Kanboura, Samaa Wakim, Firielle Al Jubeh, Samera Kadry) and one man (Eddie Dow), give extraordinarily physical performances. But most devastating is the stillness that reflects their anguished paralysis and shock.The grieving takes place in non-chronological time: women give birth to grown men or cradle their adult dead, cooing or kissing them as if they were babies. Majdala Khoury’s set design reflects a generalised catastrophe rather than a specific war. The empty blackness gives the sense of a razed space in which smoke and heaped rubble are conjured in symbolic ways. It is eerily reminiscent of the real-life images of some parts of Gaza, flattened and devoid of life. There is melancholic lighting by Muaz Al Jubeh, and music by Raymond Haddad, which gives the production its plaintive poetry.Part of theShubbak festival, numerous searing images resonate: a pregnant woman digging at the rubble, heaped dead bodies and a final, tragic, tableau of the women caught in this catastrophe. It is an appalling register of accumulating and unspeakable pain.

Yes, Faust has celebrated musical moments which are a pleasure to hear sung well. Yes, Gounod’s score eventually becomes more interestingly chromatic as the denouement nears. And yes, David McVicar’s darkly gothic production, now with 21 years’ service on the clock, successfully removes it fromGoethe’s intellectual shadow, turning Faust into a theatrically boisterous Parisian show reminiscent at times of Les Mis or Moulin Rouge.McVicar’s production is revived, amid Charles Edwards’s towering Second Empire sets, by Peter Relton. You immediately grasp why this 1860s French setting is still one of Covent Garden’s most bankable productions. Yet, for all its mix of panache and musical charms, well marshaled under Maurizio Benini’s experienced direction in the pit, Faust struggles to hold the attention, not least because of the final act ballet that Gounod added a decade after the 1859 premiere.View image in fullscreenCarolina López Moreno and Stefan Pop as Marguerite and Faust.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn the end, Faust still depends on singers who can make Gounod’s beguiling music convincing. Over the years, Covent Garden has relied on a steady stream of notables in the roles on which the work’s reputation rests – the restless Faust, the devil Méphistophélès to whom he sells his soul, and the innocent Marguerite whom Faust seduces. There have been exceptional singers of the roles of Valentin and Siébel too. This production, for instance, launched in 2004 with Roberto Alagna, Bryn Terfel and Angela Gheorghiu.The current cast cannot match that vocal star power. That’s particularly obvious in the case of Stefan Pop in the title role, whose singing rarely ascends above the level of reliably solid. Making Faust either believable or sympathetic is tough, and while Pop undoubtedly has the stamina for a demanding role, the voice offers little in the way of elegant tenorial phrasing and grace, while his diction is muddy and his acting minimal.As so often, it is Méphistophélès who commands the attention whenever he is involved, and Adam Palka, deputising impressively for the originally announced Erwin Schrott, has both voice and stage presence to do so most of the time. Boris Pinkhasovich’s big baritone gives a reliable rendering of Valentin’s famous aria in act two, though nuanced it is not. Hongni Wu is an attractively bright voiced Siébel. But it is left to Carolina López Moreno’s Marguerite, the opera’s most interesting role, to bring real vocal distinction to the evening. After a suitably demure start, López Moreno brought contrasts of mood and tone to Marguerite’s ballad, followed by a pinpoint bright Jewel Song before impressively dominating the tragic (though simultaneously banal) final trio.At the Royal Opera House, London, until 10 June.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

On Knipe Scar, at the edge of the Lake District national park, Lowther’s acres sprawl around the shell of a ruined 19th-century castle. Wildflower meadows, bee-friendly tree hives and rambling woodland contrast with a parterre, sculptured hornbeams and a Sleeping Beauty-inspired rose garden designed byDan Pearson. Bikes and ebikes can be rented for pootling around the estate’s trails or perhaps a five-mile cycle to Ullswater. There is a Lost Castle adventure playground and a cafe. Before leaving, visit the west terrace for views across the Lowther valley to distant fells.Open daily, adults £15, children £10,lowthercastle.orgRousham House, OxfordshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Britain Gardens and Flowers/AlamyWhile filming his BBCBritish Gardensseries, Monty Don described Rousham as “one of my favourite gardens of all and one of the truly great gardens of the world”. Rousham is the handiwork of William Kent (1685-1748), whose imaginative use of follies, mysterious “ta-da” avenues and one of the earliest ha-has blur the line between fantasy and reality. A master of the unbroken view, Kent manipulated the landscape to create a harmonious flow between the garden, the surrounding countryside and Rousham’s castellated pile. The estate’s 10 hectares (25 acres) include kitchen gardens, a rill, classical statuary, cascades and a seven-arched colonnade overlooking the River Cherwell. The house is still owned by the family who employed Kent to reshape the garden centuries ago. No cafe or children under 15, but picnics are encouraged. House tours on request.Open daily, £10,rousham.orgParcevall Hall, North YorkshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alex KnightLaid out in 1927, Parcevall Hall Gardens’ 10 hectares surround a Grade II-listed Arts and Crafts-style house set in the Yorkshire Dales national park. The topography and aspect enhance the experience, offering visitors views over the drystone wall-draped contours of Wharfedale to distant limestone crags. Admire plants from around the world, visit the chapel garden, follow a woodland trail, the camellia walk or a cliff trail – or simply listen to the birds and bleating sheep. There are views from the cafe’s terrace to the outcrop Simon’s Seat, part of the adjoiningBolton Abbey estate.Open April-Oct, adults £10, seniors £9, under-12s free,parcevallhallgardens.co.ukPlas Cadnant,AngleseyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Val CorbettOn Ynys Môn (Anglesey) with views to Eryri national park (Snowdonia), Plas Cadnant feels like a portal to another world. As 70 years’ worth of undergrowth was peeled away, the present owner discovered enchanting spaces, including a walled garden that dips in a graceful catenary curve and a woodland garden containing the remains of a 19th-century folly. Steps lead down to an enchanting “valley garden” where four waterfalls splosh into the River Cadnant. Some of the outbuildings and a gardener’s cottage have been converted into holiday accommodation, and guests have full access to the gardens and parkland.Open April-Oct, adults £11.50, concs £2.50-£10.50,plascadnant.co.uk.

Woodland walks lead to the sea, and from February to mid-March there are showstopping carpets of yellow aconites, snowdrops (and possibly snowflakes). In April, blossom and the scent of wild garlic fill the air, followed by the rich collection of alliums. In June, it is the turn of Cambo’s historic roses. There are imaginative spaces for children to explore (think secret doors and fairies) and golden beaches. The Stables Cafe serves vegetarian and vegan food. If you’d like to stay longer, there are cabins to rent, including a bothy with views towards the Fife coast.Open daily, adults £7.95, under-16s free,camboestate.com.

Over three decades, a hectare of agricultural land has been transformed into a flourishing wildlife garden filled with more than 700 flowers, herbs, vegetables and trees planted with biodiversity and natural healing in mind. A rewilding and wetland area has encouraged native flora, such as the Northumbrian bloody cranesbill, to thrive. Visit the “spirit henge”, breathe in the fragrant camomile lawn, wander the labyrinth and buy products made with ingredients from the garden in the shop (proceeds to the registered charity). Dilston is on the Corbridge Heritage Trail, and a scenic 20-minute walk along the Tyne from Corbridge station.Open Wed-Sun, April-Oct, Fri-Sun, Nov-March, adults £8, concs £4,dilstonphysicgarden.comLeonardslee Lakes, West SussexView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stephen Tattersall/AlamyThis tranquil, Grade I-listed garden is home to redwoods, giant oaks and the renowned Loderi rhododendron hybrids. Paths meander around lakes and through sculpture-studded parkland, lawns and forests, and visitors can join daffodil, bluebell and acer walks. In the autumn, the garden is ablaze with oranges, golds and delicate pinks, while winter brings spectacular illuminations. Children will love the wallaby enclosure (introduced in 1889), doll’s house museum and the new play park. You can stay overnight at Leonardslee House, where the Michelin-starred restaurant showcases garden-foraged ingredients.Open daily,adults £15.50, children £8.50,leonardsleegardens.co.uk.

Gardeners here use theVentnor Method, which allows plants to grow where they sow. A vast collection of rare and subtropical species includes the national collection of half-hardy and hardy puya, the giant viper’s bugloss and a renowned collection of red-hot pokers. Follow the Champion Tree Trail and head off the beaten track to find secluded seating areas and clifftop meadows with sea views. Hops grow on the clifftop to the south of the garden.

The result, 40 years on, is a practical and creative triumph featuring beautiful gardens, an enfilade of lawns and an “apple walk”. Some of the traditional – and windproof – wildlife habitat lost to modern farming methods is now restored. The Arizona-inspired Desert Wash garden is planted with drought-tolerant plants such as South American bromeliads, agaves and aloe. The cornfield has self-seeding poppies, corn marigolds and corn camomile, and there are shelterbelts of Monterey pine, Italian alders, holm oak and eucalyptus. A meditative space contains 16 Indian bean trees.Open Wed-Sun and bank holidays, March-Oct, adults £14.50, children £2,eastrustonoldvicarage.co.ukThe Japanese Garden at Cowden, ClackmannanshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyFrom swept gravel and teahouses, to stone lanterns and zigzag bridges, every aspect of a Japanese garden holds meaning. At Cowden you can unpick the symbolism or simply enjoy the garden in its purest sense – as a tranquil space where everything is in its place. Cowden was inspired by the travels of a wealthy adventurer, Ella Christie, who commissioned Japanese horticulturist Taki Handa to design a garden in the boggy grounds of her home, Cowden Castle. A 10-year restoration, completed in 2023, was overseen by Chelsea flower show gold and best in show winner Prof Masao Fukuhara. The gardens undulate through woodland and over gentle hills dotted with cherry blossom, maples and acers. On the Christie Walk, you might spot Indian rhubarb, the heart-shaped leaves of the katsura tree and the petals of the Himalayan blue poppy fluttering in the breeze. Workshops include cyanotype printing and kintsugi (the art of repairing pottery).Open daily except Tue, adults £9.85, seniors £8.75, children £5.75,cowdengarden.comVann, SurreyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Vicki FlynnYou may have seen this 16th-century, English Heritage-listed house and its garden “rooms” on screen in Disney’s Christopher Robin, ITV’s Agatha Christie’s Poirot or the BBC’s 2017 adaptation of EM Forster’s Howards End. A Gertrude Jekyll-designed water garden is a highlight of the 2 hectares. Crossed by bridges and stone paths, the water garden contains 1,500 plants nurtured at Jekyll’s Munstead Wood nursery. Traditional rose varieties bloom in the Old Garden, and an orchard leads to a yew walk where pears fruit on a crinkle crankle wall and ferns sprout from Bargate stone – the medieval quarries that provided it can still be seen in the surrounding hills.Open Aprilto the first week in July, £10 (cash only),vanngarden.co.uk.

Gardens sprawl around medieval buildings including a pigeon house, hop kiln and tithe barn (now a cafe). There is also a glasshouse, water garden and cider orchard. May brings drifts of the rare, goblet-shape Sprenger’s tulip, and the delicate tea rose blooms from early summer into autumn. Garden-grown damsons, plums, apples and raspberries make their way on to the cafe’s menu, and the “secret garden” rewards explorers with views to the Black Mountains across the Welsh border.

Leverhulme went all out by commissioning an unusual seven-arched bridge based on one he had seen in Nigeria, a sitting room at the top of a four-storey pigeon tower, five summer houses set on lawns and a replica of Liverpool Castle. In all, there are 11 Grade-II listed structures to explore (suffragette Edith Rigby burned down Lever’s original house) along with rock gardens and grottoes, a wide variety of fungi, a Japanese garden and an Italian lake, where Leverhulme took daily dips.Open daily, free entry,rivingtonterracedgardens.org.ukTrelissick, CornwallView image in fullscreenPhotograph: travelbild/AlamyWith its small beach, ancient Cornish orchard and pontoon on the River Fal, the National Trust’s Trelissick isn’t your average garden.

Visit the cafe for garden-to-plate “walled garden scallion potato bread” and an afternoon tea featuring a “garden beetroot brownie” and “walled garden raspberry posset with thyme shortbread”. The rest of the garden is full of interest. The lake is fed by a stream which meanders through the gardens, and a pinetum contains a stand of giant sequoias planted in the 1870s. In the grotto, a statue of the Irish warrior poet Ossian and an accompanying bench and stones tell his story and explain the castle’s links to the romantic movement and the Gaelic revival.Open daily, gardens £10.30, children £5.20,castle and garden adults £20.80, children £10.40,hrp.org.ukThe Manor House, Upton Grey, HampshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: AlamyThe Arts and Crafts Manor House at Upton Grey is striking in its own right, but laid around it is a garden with a rare boast: it is believed to be the most complete and authentic existing example of a Gertrude Jekyll-designed garden. When owners John and Rosamund Wallinger purchased the 2‑hectare site in 1984, it was nearly derelict, but after they discovered the eminent garden designer’s original plans for the garden, they embarked upon a remarkable journey of faithful restoration. Situated east of Basingstoke, Upton Grey features wild, kitchen and rose gardens, the nuttery, and a yew-hedged formal garden filled with the hallmarks of Jekyll planting design: lofty hollyhocks and azure delphiniums, billowing phlox, poppies and campanulas.Open Mon-Fri, May-July, entry £7,gertrudejekyllgarden.co.ukIford Manor, WiltshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Peter/AlamyOne of Britain’s premier romantic gardens, Iford Manor meets formality with enrapturing naturalism: euphorbia and catmint soften the stone terraces, roses clamber up the columns; a 200-year-old wisteria romps in unbridled profusion. Located on the edge of the Cotswolds, beside the River Frome in Wiltshire, Iford was the home in the early 20th century of influential architect and garden designer Harold Peto, who augmented its Georgian roots with Italianate flare and finesse. There are intimate cloisters and grand steps, a tranquil Japanese garden, and masterfully positioned statues and architectural fragments, while more modern additions include an award-winning restaurant and bakery. For the last half-century, Iford has been under the stewardship of the Cartwright-Hignett family who, with current head gardener Steve Lannin, are continuing the garden’s expressive legacy.

Rather than being attractive in a sweet, innocent way, as the restaurant’s name suggests, Moffat’s style – or swagger, to be more precise – is elegant but plentiful modern British cooking, featuring a scoop ofFergus Henderson, a nod toMark Hix, a dash of London’sQuality Chop Houseand a teeny touch ofToby Carvery.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Think meaty things, saucy things, big bowls of crunchy roast spuds and exquisite oversized yorkshire puddings. Pork with rhubarb ketchup and freshly baked parker house rolls to drag through warm butter or hollandaise. Asparagus with a dippy egg for starters, or mussels and trotters on toast. Bread-and-butter pudding with brandy custard. You get the gist. This is Cool Britannia wearing a napkin bib with a side portion of rhubarb jelly and custard for pudding.View image in fullscreenA starter with swagger (and a dinosaur egg cup): Winsome’s asparagus with a dippy egg.ButWinsomeis far from a novelty restaurant. Yes, there are little playful touches here and there – dino egg cups, cow-shaped gravy boats and school dinner puddings – but it’s all done in such a sleek, cool and pared-back way. Moffat may be a hugely experienced chef, but this is his first proper bricks-and-mortar venture, working with Owain Williams, who, among many other restaurants, launched Liverpool’s rather brilliantBelzan, and Tom Fastiggi, ex head bartender at Manchester’s bold, glitzySchofield’s. Winsome has taken over a large, cool, airy space clamped to the side ofWhitworth Locke, one of those new-fangled co-working/hotel/gymnasium/cocktail bar/leisure/third spaces populated by bright young things on laptops. What is it exactly? An apparthotel? A cult headquarters? Never mind all that, this restaurant stands fully alone, so let’s just concentrate on Winsome.It is from the outset an attractive and lovable room, with a large open kitchen down one side and blue-aproned staff serving trays of sbagliatos and breakfast martinis laced withDuerr’s marmalade. Tables are large and well spaced, and topped with pale tablecloths topped with pale paper, presumably to protect the linen from spills. No such luck with us. Perhaps your family can share a platter of cylindra beetroot in goat’s curd without someone leaving a CSI Manchester crime scene smear; mine was not so successful. “I do apologise,” I told the staff as we gave back the empty plate after a feast of Tewkesbury courgettes in a glut of excellent olive oil that we’d spilled rather dramatically while grabbing our fair share. There’s something about Moffat’s cooking, however fine and highfalutin it may seem to be, that lends itself to the sheepish dry-cleaning of blouses. A plate of Brixham crab came with celeriac remoulade and a whole heap of mustard cress that weirdly reminded me of growing the stuff back at primary school. Another starter of incredibly rich fried wild mushrooms and shallots on a slick of well-seasoned pease pudding was similarly deeply nostalgic.View image in fullscreen‘Rich and nostalgic’: Winsome’s wild mushrooms and shallots with pease pudding.For mains, we shared a whole john dory, cooked perfectly and served in a pool of pale green pie shop liquor, and aCreedy Carverassiette of duck featuring rare breast, rendered skin and a jug of rich duck jus. It was a Sunday, so both came with all the Sunday lunch trimmings, which here involve cartoon-esque XL yorkshire puddings, carrot puree, roast parsnips and a thick piece of trencher bread topped with stewed beef shin in ale.This is confident, clever cooking that stays just the right side of earnest, or at least as earnest as a chef can be when he also serves up a dessert that is essentially a 1980s school sponge pudding with a scoop of milk ice-cream flecked with multicoloured sprinkles, or hundreds and thousands as they will for ever be known in my heart. In a further nod to the sainted Fergus Henderson, right at the end of the meal eccles cakes are offered with slices of St Sunday’s cheese from Cumbria.View image in fullscreenWinsome is ‘Cool Britannia wearing a napkin bib with a side portion of rhubarb jelly and custard for pudding’.Winsome may well be my new favourite restaurant, and it’s the new, big, generous beating heart of Manchester hospitality. It’s classy but come-all – bring your gran, bring your baby, no one need feel conspicuous. There’s something about the place that makes me want to use it as a canteen, not least out of sheer curiosity as to what Moffat will put on the menu next. Great cooking, and forward-thinking fine dining without any of the faff. Bring your appetite and don’t wear pale colours. Aaah, Manchester, you have so much to answer for.

Many foods are described as melting in the mouth, but these really did.View image in fullscreenThe one that started it all: the Cake Fridge in Bixter’s Viennese whirl. All thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.These relatively plain biscuits are known asSpritzgebäckin German, from the verb “to squirt”, because they’re piped or pressed from a special cookie tool rather than cut or rolled. The dough is, asRavneet Gillobserves in her first book The Pastry Chef’s Guide, “really simple … the knack is in the piping”. Somewhere between a fairy cake and a cookie, they’re fancy enough for a tea party, but easy enough to knock up, though the people at the Cake Fridge were, quite understandably, tight-lipped about their recipe.The flourPlain flour is the thing for a short, rather than chewy texture – readers in the US, Canada and other places that grow high-protein wheat may wish to experiment with specialcake flour, but in the UK, bog-standard plain is ideal. The protein content is relevant because, when hydrated and kneaded with sufficient force, these give dough its strength and elasticity in the form of gluten. Great for bread, but the kiss of death for a biscuit of this kind, which bears more relation to a shortcrust pastry (hence their Italian name,biscotti di pasta frolla).View image in fullscreenLeiths’ take on the Viennese whirl dispenses with a lot of the ‘faff’ involved in other versions.To minimise gluten development, work the dough as little as possible after adding the flour (though I’m not sure patting it together between two sheets of clingfilm, asRose Levy Beranbaum recommendsin her Baking Bible, is really necessary. Stirring it briefly together, as Susan Spaull and Fiona Burrell direct in their rivalLeiths Baking Bible, feels as if it should do the job almost as well, with rather less in the way of faff. Like Gill, bothMary Berryand Delicious magazine replace some of the flour with gluten-free cornflour.The sugarIcing sugar is the name of the game for a smooth, fine crumb, but too much will cause the biscuits to spread in the oven. Instead, keep the dough muscularly plain and add sweetness in the filling, or just give them a generous dusting of icing sugar before serving.The dairyAs pastry chef Nicola Lamb explains on herKitchen Projectsbaking Substack, “piped biscuits need to do a few things – first, be delicious, second they can’t spread too much when baking, and third, the dough needs to be soft enough to be pipeable. Unfortunately, points one and two are kind of mutually exclusive. When it comes to flavouring your biscuits, butter is the MVP. But butter, it melts and spreads. So, limiting the overall proportion of butter without losing flavour or texture is KEY.”View image in fullscreenRavneet Gill recommends filling her Viennese whirls with curd or even Nutella.Her solution is to add much less butter than some of the other recipes. Berry, for instance, uses equal parts butter and flour; Gill,DeliciousandBen Mims’ book Crumbsslightly less; and Leiths slightly less again – Lamb allows just half the weight of butter to the flour, butbrowns it first, to concentrate the flavour. She makes up for the loss by adding egg and milk to bring moisture and flavour to the dough without burdening it with too much extra fat (Leiths’ egg yolk and single cream do much the same job).I love the nuttiness and rich golden hue of Lamb’s browned butter, but my testers prefer the less Germanically precise-looking, but richer-tasting butter-heavy versions. Thanks to the lack of water hindering gluten development, however, browned butter cookies will always spread more than ordinary ones, so I’m happy to yield and go half and half, because taste always comes first, especially when precision piping isn’t really in your skill-set in the first place. That way, I can blame the butter. If you’d prefer a more classically perfect-looking Viennese whirl, skip the browning step.The flavouringsView image in fullscreenMary Berry sticks to the traditional buttercream filling for her Viennese whirls.Gill uses custard powder (cornflour, salt, colouring and vanilla flavouring) to give her biscuits colour, but I’m relying on the browned butter to do that job for me, while I’ll save the vanilla for the buttercream filling I’ve borrowed from Berry. If you’re planning not to fill your biscuits with icing or jam (or the Nutella or curd Gill suggests), or to dip them in chocolate as Delicious does, you may like to flavour the dough with vanilla, Mims’ lemon zest or the ground hazelnuts in the Delicious take. The latter is particularly good, and I suspect most ground nuts would work well here.The pipingMuch easier than it sounds – these biscuits are very forgiving, though, given the high butter content, they do benefit from a brief chill before baking, so they keep as much as their shape as possible in the oven while still tasting great.Perfect Viennese whirlsPrep45 minChill30 min+Cook15 minMakes20, or 10 sandwiches300g butter, if making browned butter or 240g softened butter if skipping that step55g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting¼ tsp fine salt, or a good pinch of coarse salt250g plain flour50g cornflour1 tsp vanilla extract(if not using buttercream filling)A splash of milk(optional)For the buttercream (optional)100g softened butter200g icing sugarA pinch of salt½ tsp vanilla extract, or flavouring of your choiceA splash of milkView image in fullscreenIf making browned butter, melt 180g of the butter in a light-coloured pan over a medium heat, making sure you have a heatproof bowl ready. Once the butter stops sizzling, whisk or stir it regularly to stop the milk solids sticking to the pan and, once it’s turned a honeyed, amber colour, tip into the bowl, solids and all, and leave to cool and set.View image in fullscreenMeasure 120g of the browned butter into a large bowl or stand mixer, add 120g ordinary butter and beat to soften (or, if not making browned butter, beat 240g plain butter instead). Sift over the icing sugar, add the salt and beat again until the mix is soft and spreadable, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.View image in fullscreenCombine the flour and cornflour, then add to the bowl with the vanilla, if using. Stir just until everything is thoroughly combined – do not overwork the dough. It should be firm, but add a splash of milk if the dough looks too stiff to pipe.View image in fullscreenLine two baking trays with greaseproof paper (stick it down with a little oil or butter), and prepare a piping bag with a large star nozzle – I used a 1½cm one. Pipe round swirls (or S shapes or fingers) across the trays, spacing them slightly apart; you can make them as large as you like, but I think about 5cm is perfect. Chill the biscuits on their trays for at least 30 minutes.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, then bake for 14-16 minutes, until the biscuits are very lightly golden. Remove and leave to cool on the trays.Meanwhile, if you’re making the buttercream, beat the butter until soft, then sift in the icing sugar, add the salt, vanilla extract and a splash of milk to loosen, and beat again.View image in fullscreenIf making sandwiches, pair up biscuits of a similar size and shape, then spread the flat side of half of them with the buttercream (or jam or similar). Top with the remaining biscuits, dust lightly with icing sugar and serve.Viennese whirls,spritzgebäck,biscotti di pasta frolla… if it’s a sweet, soft biscuit that melts in the mouth, it’s probably from the same family, so share your favourite relatives!
