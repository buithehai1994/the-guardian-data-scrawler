In an exclusive interview with the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, she explains whyRead an exclusive extract from Ardern’s memoirKatharine VinerSat 31 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 04.57 EDTShareIn 2022, a few months before she quit as prime minister of New Zealand,Jacinda Ardernwas standing at the sink in the toilets in Auckland airport, washing her hands, when a woman came up to her and leaned in. She was so close that Ardern could feel the heat from her skin. “I just wanted to say thank you,” the woman said. “Thanks for ruining the country.” She turned and left, leaving Ardern “standing there as if I were a high-schooler who’d just been razed”.The incident was deeply shocking. Ardern had been re-elected in a historic landslide two years before. She enjoyed conversation and debate; she liked being the kind of leader who wasn’t sealed off from the rest of the population. But this, says Ardern, “felt like something new. It was the tenor of the woman’s voice, the way she’d stood so close, the way her seething, nonspecific rage felt not only unpredictable but incongruous to the situation … What was happening?”View image in fullscreenJacinda Ardern photographed in New York last month.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianThe incident came at a pivotal moment: Ardern sensed that the tide was turning against her and she was grappling with whether to go. “Something had been loosened worldwide,” she says, with rage everywhere, public servants being followed and attacked, as if they were “somehow distinct from being human”. We all recognise this rage, but Ardern was at the centre of it, representing progressive politics, tough Covid measures, empathy, emotion, anti-racism, femaleness; a symbol of a different time, more rational, kinder, when rules still meant something. When there weremany female leaders– Angela Merkel, Theresa May, Sanna Marin, Mia Mottley, Mette Frederiksen, Tsai Ing-wen.For all these reasons, Ardern is now missed by progressives, at home and abroad. At her height she had blazed a global trail, modelling a different way of doing politics –wearing a headscarfand embracing weeping bereaved families after theChristchurch mosque massacre, thenreforming gun laws in 10 days; takingdecisive action on Covidthat meant New Zealanders were able to party again while the rest of the world could barely go out; leaving celebrities fromElton JohntoStephen Colbertstarry-eyed with her poise and wit and humanity. It wasJacinda-mania, and everybody wanted a prime minister like her: young (elected at just 37) and a woman, she offered a different vision of national identity for New Zealand – straightforward, compassionate, diverse, globally desirable – and a different way to lead a country – youthful, human, decent. She had a hunky feminist boyfriend and was pregnant when she became PM; and she was going “to bring kindness back”.And then, out of the blue, after six years in office, in January 2023, she dramaticallyannounced her resignation. How could she have done this to us, her fans wailed, at a time when the world is falling apart before our eyes?View image in fullscreen‘Burnout is very different from making a judgment in yourself as to whether or not you’re operating at the level you need to be.’ Ardern announcing her resignation in January 2023.Photograph: Kerry Marshall/Getty ImagesWe meet to discuss her memoir, A Different Kind of Power, for the first major interview she has given since she resigned. Ardern chooses the cafe, a cavernous bare-boards-and-metal type of place, in a small mall in Cambridge, Massachusetts – she is leading a course in empathetic leadership at Harvard. I arrive very early, to get my equipment ready, but Ardern is already there, drinking a huge black tea and primed with her own recording device. “Girly swot,” I joke, using a line she has used about herself. “Ah well,” she laughs, “why hide who you are?”She has a lovely open face and that famous toothy smile, both emphasised by red lipstick, ballerina-style scraped-back hair and big gold hoops. She is wearing a padded khaki jacket and black clumpy boots.Ardern and Trump always felt like yin and yang; both took power in 2017, and gave their first speeches at the UN eight days apart, but they take directly opposite political and cultural positions on just about everything. So how does it feel to be the anti-Trump living in Trump’s America?“I consider myself an observer, observing someone else’s politics,” she says. She’s enjoying the anonymity of being in the US (quite a contrast to New Zealand). “But increasingly what happens in one place affects other places. And it’s not just political culture, it’s also our economies, our security arrangements.”She chooses her words carefully: once a politician, always a politician. “Political leaders in those moments of deep economic insecurity have two options. One is to acknowledge the environment that they’re in. We’re in a globalised world. We’re in an interconnected world. And we’re in a world of technological disruption. We need a policy prescription that acknowledges all of that. And those are often hard solutions. Hard, difficult to communicate, difficult to implement. But that’s what you’ve got to do. Or …”She pauses. “You choose blame. Blame the other, blame the migrant, blame other countries, blame multilateral institutions, blame. But it does not fundamentally solve it. In fact, all that happens at the end is you have an othered group, and people who feel dissatisfied and angry and more entrenched.”Would she call Trump’s America fascism yet?There is a very long pause – when I listen back to the tape I time it to 11 seconds. “I’m just trying to think about where that takes us,” says Ardern, eventually. “I think probably in my mind, certainly what we’re seeing isn’t anything I’ve ever experienced in my lifetime.”She is gently funny about Trump the man, without ever going too far, saying he is “taller than I expected, his tan more pronounced”. Vladimir Putin is “quiet, often alone and almost expressionless”. She talks about former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s “self-satisfied indifference” and simply rolls her eyes when I mention Boris Johnson. The only really mean comment I can find in the book is about the very rightwing New Zealand politicianDavid Seymour, and it’s laugh-out-loud funny: she was overheard on camera calling him “an arrogant prick”, and is relieved when her aide tells her about it. She thought she’d called him a “fucking prick”.View image in fullscreenArdern: ‘I would not describe myself as cool.’ Stylist: Marisa Ellison. Stylist’s assistant: Lennon Goldsmith.

Earrings and cuff, Patricia Von Musulin.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianDame Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern was born in 1980 in the North Island of New Zealand, and she describes herself as “a very ordinary person who found themselves in a set of extraordinary circumstances”. Ardern and her sister were the first in her family to go to university, and lived at home while studying, to save on costs. Her dad was a police officer; her mother a school dinner lady. She was brought up a Mormon – long skirts, no caffeine and “door-knocking on behalf of God”. A tomboy with a “relentless sense of responsibility”, Ardern famously worked in a fish and chip shop called the Golden Kiwi – already an over-preparer, she got ready for her first shift by endlessly wrapping a cabbage in newspaper.Throughout her memoir, Ardern reminds us that she was always extremely sensitive and emotional, as well as a “chronic overthinker”. The book is dedicated to “the criers, worriers and huggers”; her thesis is that these people can make great leaders, too. Her father said she was “far too thin-skinned” to be an MP. “Sensitivity was my weakness, my tragic flaw, the thing that might just stop me sticking with the work that I loved,” she writes.Still, in retrospect, some kind of political career looked inevitable. She witnessed unfairness as a child and couldn’t bear it, particularly when it concerned her town’s Māori community. She was a champion debater at school, studied politics and communications at university, was a researcher for leaders of the NZ Labour party, and even worked in London as a policy adviser at a unit called the Better Regulation Executive (“a job title that would end conversation with most polite company”). She became an MP at 28.She always had progressive politics but believes being surrounded by people with different points of view helped her. “I have a very diverse family, lots of diverse views, and we haven’t lost any relationships, we’ve always talked,” she says. There’s a bit in the book when a woman in her home town says: “Jacinda, I wanted to tell you that there are a lot of people in Morrinsville who are praying for you … They’re notvotingfor you, but theyarepraying for you.” Even her loving grandma admitted that she probably wouldn’t vote for her.By the time she entered politics, she had stopped being a Mormon; she says the gulf between her religion and her values (especially around LGBTQ+ rights) became too wide. But she won’t speak badly of the church, and believes it taught her a lot about “service and charity”. And, of course, having a door slammed in your face is excellent preparation for politics.Perhaps it was this upbringing that drove Ardern’s self-effacement – I tell her this is the most modest political memoir I’ve read, and her response is: “Have you read any other New Zealand political memoirs? Because I would not say that’s a trait particular to me.” I say I think she is pretty cool for a politician (interesting ear piercings, likes drum’n’bass, has been seen in Portishead T-shirts). “I would not describe myself as cool,” she says, shaking her head.For about a decade, Ardern worked diligently as an MP, learning the ropes in politics. In the book she tells an anecdote about the time she asked a fellow MP, known as a bruiser, how to toughen up. He begs her not to. “You feel things because you have empathy, because you care,” he told her. “The moment you change is the moment you’ll stop being good at your job.”In 2017, she was elected deputy Labour leader. A general election was called and the party was tanking; the poll numbers were so bad that the party leader resigned, and Ardern was unexpectedly tasked with running for prime minister, even though all the billboard posters still had her as the deputy. Leadership was thrust on her. She had 72 hours to formulate a new campaign plan – at the time, she reckoned ‘“winning wasn’t possible, not when we were seven weeks out from the election and polling at 23%”. But she thought she could at least “save the furniture”. In the end there was no clear majority and, after weeks of coalition negotiations, the centre right New Zealand First party chose to go with Labour. She was to become the country’s third female leader.There was just one thing: in the middle of all this, and days before she became PM, she had found out she was pregnant.Guilt is part of the package. You can’t get rid of it – you just try and suppress itArdern and her partner,Clarke Gayford, had been struggling to conceive and had consulted a fertility specialist; next thing she knew, she was “pregnant, unwed and new to the job”. Gayford presents a popular travel and fishing TV show called Fish of the Day, which has been running for more than a decade, and they met in 2012 at an awards ceremony. A year later he emailed to ask if he could help with her campaign (that old trick). Ardern says Gayford didn’t even own a suit when they met, although he “relished” being part of the group of international leaders’ spouses. He famouslyheld their three-month-old daughter, Neve, in between feeds when Ardern made her debut speech at the UN. When she decided to quit politics, Clarke tried to get her to stay, suggesting she delegate more. “I just don’t want them to feel like they’ve won,” he said. (Gayford makes me think of Margaret Atwood’s husband; he was such a supportive spouse that people used to go round in T-shirts saying “Every woman writer should be married to Graeme Gibson”. Every woman politician should be married to Clarke Gayford.) As Ardern puts it with a smile: “Model of a modern man. Yeah, feminist hero, exactly.”View image in fullscreen‘I think the rehumanisation of people in public life is really important.’ Ardern with Gayford and their daughter, Neve, while in New York for a United Nations assembly, 2018.Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty ImagesArdern was only the second female leader to give birth in office, after Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto. The birth was difficult – she couldn’t stand upright properly for weeks afterwards. She constantly felt she should be somewhere else. “It felt like living with chronic discomfort – half guilt, half disappointment – all the time.” She was doing an important job. Even as PM, there’s still guilt about whatever you’re not doing? “If any role was going to give you a bit of a pass on guilt, it might have been leading a country,” she laughs. But she still felt bad. “So I just think that it’s part of the package. And you can’t get rid of it. You can instead just try and make the best decision you can in that moment and try and suppress the guilt. That’s all you can do.”Why did she leave? “I never wanted to use the line, ‘I’m leaving to spend time with my family’,” she says. “I was very careful not to express anything like that, because I never wanted to convey that you couldn’t have a family or that being in politics meant that you were making a decision to place them on a lower bar, or vice versa.”Many assume it was because of burnout – on the day Ardern quit, she said she didn’t have “enough gas in the tank” to carry on. But burnout is not to blame, she says today. “Burnout is very different from making a judgment in yourself as to whether or not you’re operating at the level you need to be.” Things were starting to get to her more than usual; and, “of course I was tired, but wasn’t everyone in their 40s?”.No wonder she was tired: Ardern’s time in power may have been short, but it was particularly tumultuous, punctuated by earthquakes, a terror attack and, of course, a global pandemic. Neve was born in June 2018. Nine months later, afar-right Australian mankilled 51 worshippers at a mosque in Christchurch, livestreaming the attack on Facebook. Ardern’s response was instinctive and moving, most notably in the simple statement about the Muslim victims: “They are us.” In a speech that reverberated around the world, she said: “Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home.” She held the families of the dead and cried with them.View image in fullscreenArdern offers comfort to a woman following the terror attack in Christchurch, 2019. When Trump asked what America could do, Ardern replied: ‘You can show sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.’Photograph: Lynn Grieveson/Newsroom/Getty ImagesIn the book, she describes how Trump called her after the massacre, and it’s subtly revealing about both of them. “We discussed what might happen to the terrorist,” she writes. “I used that word, ‘terrorist’, specifically and President Trump asked if we were calling the gunman that.” She said to him: “Yes, this was a white man from Australia who deliberately targeted our Muslim community. We are calling him that.”Trump did not respond, but asked if there was anything America could do. “You can show sympathy and love for all Muslim communities,” she told him. It was the reverse of the politics of division: she says that the terrorist “chose us because he knew that New Zealand openly welcomed people of all faiths. He wanted to destroy that.”What was behind her response, and why does she think so many found it so affecting? She says: “You’re actually leading a collective. They [the public] were deciding how they were responding and I just happened to be in the front of that with them. That’s how it felt to me.” So she believes she was channelling New Zealanders in those moments? “I think it was a reflection of how New Zealanders felt. These things are part of our identity. Perhaps it’s our size, but you can almost feel it. You can feel a response that literally feels like a whole country.”When she says she can feel it, what’s it like? “It sounds unusual, but I’ve always felt like I had a general sense of where New Zealand is at on something. I relied on it a lot while I was in office. You feel an energy.” It sounds almost physical. “It’s a mood thing. A vibe. Sounds a bit woo-woo. I guess politicians use polls a lot to try and understand that. I wouldn’t let staff give me polls.”She moved quickly after the attack, announcing the banning of military-style weapons within days; two months later she co-chaired a summit with Emmanuel Macron for world leaders and tech CEOs to commit to “eliminating terrorist and violent extremist content online”. There are now more than 130 governments and tech firms signed up to the “Christchurch Call to Action”.Christchurch was a massive test. As 2020 came around, she was hoping for a bit of calm. It was not to be.Ardern’s response to the pandemic stood out worldwide. She was careful, rational, guided by data modelling, scientific experts and public health advisers – the opposite, you could say, of the approach taken by Johnson and Trump. This was a tiny, remote island nation with few intensive-care beds. She closed the border on 19 March 2020 to all non-citizens; there was strict lockdown and contact tracing; and, for a long time, she was personally informed of every single Covid death in the country. And, for a long time, there were very few. While people across the world were banned from seeing their loved ones, many New Zealanders were living a life close to normal. At the end of 2020, while English schools were still closed and hundreds of thousands had died in the US alone, Ardern and Gayford were at a festival watching a band called Shapeshifter (for which, as it happens, they had discussed a shared affinity on their first date).View image in fullscreenArdern: ‘I was probably in power in spite of the power bit.’ Top, by Fforme. Earrings and necklace, by Patricia Von Musulin. Top image: Coat and trousers, by Fforme. Earrings and ring, as before.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianBut then came the Delta variant, which was much more infectious. Ardern believed that even with strict rules around mask wearing and proof of vaccination, it would be impossible to contain an outbreak. As the lockdown went into its seventh week, she began to see that “New Zealand’s sense of togetherness was starting to fracture”.Worse was to come. In February 2022, 3,000 anti-vaccine protesters pitched tents and occupied the grounds of Parliament House in Wellington. As she writes of the encampment: “I saw my own image, with a Hitler moustache, monocle and ‘Dictator of the Year’ emblazoned above my face. I saw the gallows, complete with a noose, which people said had been erected for me. I saw the American flags, the Trump flags, the swastikas.” She could hear the protesters shouting, “You stand on the bones of death” through the government doors. And, “We’re coming for you next.”Did these people hound her out? “Absolutely not,” she says. “I left a year after some of those most difficult patches.” But it must have been horrific. She writes that she had always tried to be “human first, and a leader second. I understood that, to the crowd occupying parliament, I was neither.”Does she now think she went too hard with restrictions and vaccination mandates? She says that New Zealand “came out of Covid with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and fewer days in lockdown than nations like the UK, and during this time our country’s life expectancy actuallyincreased”.She gets little credit for this. I guess it’s hard to get credit for things that didn’t happen; you can’t really prove a negative, prove how many people didn’t die. Oh you can, she says, firmly. “Twenty thousand. Four times my old town. It’s a lot of people.” There’s a long pause. “How do you feel remorse about that?”It sounds as if she feels she has been unfairly attacked over her approach to Covid. At this suggestion, Ardern goes very still and quiet, and I suddenly realise she has tears in her eyes. “I find Covid really hard,” she says, swallowing her words. “I had a conversation up north, after I’d left office. I was wandering around some markets and I could feel this young woman looking at me, so when she caught my eye I said hello, and we struck up a conversation, and it turned out that she was a teacher who’d had an adverse reaction to the vaccine. And because she didn’t get the second dose, she had stopped working in teaching.”The New Zealand vaccine mandate meant that people in some professions were required to have it.“We talked about the fact that we, of course, had an exemption regime, but for some reason it hadn’t worked out for her. It was the kind of conversation that I just wish I could have with everyone: when everything isn’t distilled down into black and white. But the world leaves so little space for that now. And I feel very sad about that.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s distressing when you’re misunderstood, or feel misunderstood.’ Ardern giving an update on coronavirus measures, 2020.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty ImagesShe’s fighting back tears again. Her tone is so sad. Why does she think it’s still so hard? “People only see the decisions you made, not the choices you had. The first part of Covid, people saw all the choices and decisions. And the second half, it just got hard. It got hard. Vaccines bring an extra layer that’s really difficult.”I apologise for taking her back to a dark time. “One of the things that still stands out in my mind – I can’t remember if it was a meme or a genuine cartoon – but it was an image of Winnie-the-Pooh and Christopher Robin,” she says. “It was at the tail end of Covid, and Christopher says, ‘How will we know if we succeeded?’ And Winnie says, ‘Because they’ll say we did too much.’ And it captured this idea that there probably isn’t a sweet spot. Maybe there were only two options in the end. Maybe it was: you’ll be attacked for doing too little or you’ll be attacked for doing too much. And I know what I would choose.”She faced extreme reactions from fellow New Zealanders. “There’d be some people who would spontaneously cry because they absolutely believe that you saved their lives,” says Ardern. “And then there’s someone else on the other end of the spectrum who mirrors that level of emotion, who felt that somehow you ended theirs.”I’d read a comment and think, holy heck, if half of that was true, I’d dislike me, tooHardly anyone talks about Covid any more, but it changed our economies, children’s relationships with school, adults’ relationships with work, citizens’ relationship with the state.Ardern nods. “It disrupted our own sense of security around what we could fundamentally expect.Covid disrupted the baseline.”And maybe she was a fall guy for that. “It’s distressing when you’re misunderstood, or feel misunderstood,” she says. “Sometimes I’d read a comment and I’d think, holy heck, if half of that was true, I’d dislike me, too.”Another former PM of New Zealand, Helen Clark, said Ardern had faced“a level of hatred and venom that I believe is unprecedented in this country”.She was trivialised, called vapid, vacant, even “pretty bloody stupid”. She writes about how women are held to “some unspoken, impossible standard”; how she is careful not to be seen as “humourless and too sensitive” in her response to a cartoon portraying her as a boxing-ring girl in a bikini with black stiletto boots.Does she think women face particular vitriol? “There’s a magnified impact on women in public life,” she agrees. “And also on those of different ethnic backgrounds and also our LGBTQ+ communities. And I say public life, because I don’t think it’s just politicians; it’s journalists, academics.”As she left parliament, Ardern said that she hoped her leaving would “take the heat out of politics”; that it “might make our politics feel calmer, less polarised”. That didn’t work, did it?“I didn’t take the heat out,” she admits; she knows it’s obvious. “What felt more important to me were the things that we’d done, rather than me staying on to do more of them.” When I ask for examples, she says she succeeded in “removing the politics from climate change” with the Zero Carbon Act, and points to “child poverty measures, that we’ve also got consensus on. Both of those have lasted. Abortion law reform has lasted.”But there’s a wistfulness when she talks about these achievements, and many New Zealand progressives were frustrated with the amount of change she managed to implement, especially considering the landslide she won in 2020.Their disappointment is particularly acute in light of the current government, which is the most rightwing ever elected in New Zealand and is trying toundo years of progress on Māori rights, for example. Ardern refuses to talk about New Zealand politics now, but what’s happening must appal her.The “politics of empathy” might not be in vogue, but Ardern remains committed to it. Is it a strong enough weapon against authoritarianism? Elon Musk recently said that “the fundamental weakness of western civilisation is empathy”. She snorts. “What does that even mean?”Attacking empathy is all the rage with the right, I point out, especially in the US. There are popular books called Against Empathy and The Sin of Empathy. “Well, in that environment, saying loudly and proudly that you believe in empathy and that you’ll govern in that way is an act of strength.”But public life today is so horrible, so brutal. Why would anyone go into politics? “I think the rehumanisation of people in public life is really important,” she says.I love politics, but that’s because I love peopleAfter our interview, bothAnthony Albanese in AustraliaandMark Carney in Canadaare elected in defiance of Trump’s authoritarian politics; Albanese even mentioned “kindness” in his victory speech. With these victories looking likely, I had asked her what she thought they would show about Trump’s kind of power.“I think people swinging in the other direction [from America] is almost making the point. I don’t think that form of leadership is what people seek.”So she still believes in politics? “Ilovepolitics,” she laughs, “but that’s because I love people.”She loves democracy and people more than power, she says. “In fact, I was probably in power in spite of the power bit. I would have been very happy to be a minister, a wider member of a team.” It’s a profound comment in a world of strongmen and autocrats.Ardern wanted to be a different kind of leader, and for six years she was. She feels an almost mystical connection to her country. Covid made it stronger. Then Covid destroyed it. And she still can’t believe it. She plans to move back home soon.We have talked for a while, well over our allotted time; the teas are cold and she wants to get back to her daughter. She walks me to the appropriate junction and tells me the most scenic route to take, then strides out anonymously in the Massachusetts streets, clumpy boots grounding her. Decent, resolutely human, and only 44, Jacinda Ardern still believes modesty, kindness and compassion will win the day.A Different Kind of Power by Jacinda Ardern is published globally on 3 June byPan Macmillan in the UK,Crown (US),Penguin Random House NZandPenguin Random House Australia.

Its pleasure lies in watching the detectives slowly reveal the truthRebecca NicholsonSat 31 May 2025 16.45 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 17.23 EDTShareIt’s never a good sign, is it, to see a young woman going for a run in the woods at the start of a gritty European crime drama? The Black Forest Murders takes the real-life killing of two young women in the south of Germany as its basis, and turns it into an extremely thorough police procedural. The detective work here is complex, precise and painstaking, and there is a sense that the film-makers have no wish to spare viewers any of the intense slog it takes to track down the perpetrator (if indeed the police manage to do so).Nina Kunzendorf is senior detective Barbara Kramer, who grew up in the area but moved to Berlin to make her name in the police force. Now that her father is getting older, and more infirm, she has moved back to her (fictional) small, rural home town in the south, where she is treated as an outsider. Kramer seems like a loner, smokes a lot and is the sort of cop who will slam down the phone when she doesn’t like what she’s hearing on the other end of it. She is your classic TV lead detective. The force at her command are local people who have remained local, and they largely resent her Berlin ways and lack of community knowhow. But she, too, is contemptuous of their amateur methods, small-town gossip and the low hum of sexism that threatens to rear its head again and again. It’s a standard culture-clash setup.When 27-year-old Stefanie Berghoff fails to come home from a jog, it sparks an enormous search for her. Her husband, Tobias (David Richter), could only look more shifty if he started waving around a murder weapon and winking at the camera, but surprisingly, he has a rock-solid alibi. The hunt for Stefanie is complicated by the fact that the entire village has been out to help, even before the police manage to arrive in the area, which means evidence could have been trampled. Kramer is not having any of it.View image in fullscreenUnder suspicion … Tobias Berghoff, the victim’s husband (David Richter).Photograph: Luis Zeno Kuhn/ArdmediathekGiven the title, and the fact that “Murders” is not singular, it isn’t much of a spoiler to say that Stefanie’s body is discovered, and towards the end of the first episode, so is that of another young woman. Both were killed and moved a short distance, leaving “drag marks”, a small detail that I found particularly horrible. The question is whether the two cases are connected. I tend to judge dramas about the violent deaths of women by how much the camera lingers on their naked bodies during the inevitable autopsy scenes, but this is not that kind of drama. It avoids salaciousness, seemingly as a matter of principle.In many ways, The Black Forest Murders shares a modus operandi with The Breakthrough, the Swedish procedural, also based on real-life events, that was a hit on Netflix at the start of the year. Like The Breakthrough, this has a linear and essentially straightforward narrative: crimes are committed, the police investigate, gather up all the evidence they can find, and then we get our answers. Kramer notes that it could be a long road, and tells a story about a 12-year hunt for a killer in Berlin. The drama is essentially forewarning viewers to settle in for the long haul.So we see officers carefully combing the branches of a shrub, under a magnifying glass, in the hope that they might find a speck of something that could offer up DNA. Suspects are interviewed and eliminated, based on rough times of death, which is ascertained in Stefanie’s case through the contents of her stomach, the time that her phone stopped working and reports of screams. On the other hand, Kramer counters her own list of evidence, explaining the flaws, or the counterarguments, in the information that has been gathered. Perhaps Stefanie ate later than usual? Perhaps her phone battery died? Perhaps those who heard a scream got it wrong? Something isn’t adding up, but over the first two episodes, it’s not clear what’s wrong, or why.The levels of precision and detail that worked in The Breakthrough’s favour are not quite as convincing here. Partly, that is because The Black Forest Murder’s tropes are familiar and well worn. There is the conflict between rural and urban, between village and city. There is the outsider looking in, who has her own past to contend with, and must relearn the local knowledge that she has lost. There is even a bit of the female boss being undermined by her male colleagues, Prime Suspect-style. Its attention to every single moving part means that the drama itself moves very slowly, and it is not so much a thriller as a satisfying puzzle, steadily coming together. Not a bad drama, then, but not a revolutionary one, either.The Black Forest Murders aired on BBC Four and is available on iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Then came a text message from the bar’s owner, sayingthe gig was cancelled. Why? Because the real Bruce Springsteen hadlambastedDonald Trump.“He said to me his customer base is redder than red and he wishes Springsteen would just shut his mouth,” Hobicorn recalls by phone. “It was clear that this guy was getting caught up in that and didn’t want to lose business. The reality is we would have brought a huge crowd out there: new customers that are Springsteen fans that want to see a band locally.”The culture wars have arrived in New Jersey, the state of Frank Sinatra, Jon Bon Jovi, Whitney Houston,comedian Jon Stewartand TV hit The Sopranos. Springsteen – revered for songs such as Born In The USA, Glory Days, Dancing In The Dark and Born To Run – has long been a balladeer of the state’s blue-collar workers. But last year, many of those same workers voted for the president.Bruce Springsteen says Trump is running ‘rogue government’ and ‘siding with dictators’Read moreNow their split loyalties are being put to the test. Opening a recent tour in Manchester in Britain,Springsteen told his audience: “The America I love, the America I’ve written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.” He repeated the criticisms at later concerts and released them on a surprise EP.Trump responded by calling Springsteen highly overrated. “Never liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,”he wrote on social media. “This dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country.”Trump, 78, also posted a video edited to make it seem as if he had hit 75-year-old Springsteen with a golf drive. Trump called for a “major investigation” into Springsteen, Beyoncé and other celebrities,alleging that they had been paidmillions of dollars to endorse his Democratic opponent in the 2024 election, Kamala Harris.Harris beat Trump by six percentage points in New Jersey, significantly less than Joe Biden’s 16-point winning margin in 2020. In Toms River, a township along the Jersey Shore, Trump receivedtwice as many votesas Harris, helping explain why Riv’s Toms River Hub got cold feet about hosting a Springsteen cover band.The bar and restaurant cancelled the 30 May gig byNo Surrender, a nine-person band that has played Springsteen songs for more than two decades, despite it being scheduled months in advance. Contacted by the Guardian, owner Tony Rivoli declined to comment.Hobicorn, 59, from Livingston,New Jersey, says the band suggested a compromise of playing classic rock other than Springsteen’s but Rivoli rejected the idea. Hobicorn also received some criticism from Springsteen fans for offering the partial climbdown.But he explains: “That’s where I made the point that not everybody in the band is aligned with Bruce Springsteen’s politics. Everybody’s got a different point of view but that’s OK. You can still be in a Springsteen cover band and not 100% agree with everything he says.”He adds: “My band is split. We’re half red, half blue. We have civilised conversations and then we go and play the music and it’s never been about politics. This thing got made into a political situation.”Springsteen is not new to the political arena. When former president Ronald Reaganreferenced the singer’s “message of hope”at a campaign stop, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. Later, he was a regular presence on Barack Obama’s presidential election campaign.He has also challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements.Born in the USAtold of a Vietnam war veteran who lost his brother in the war and came home to no job prospects and a bleak future. My Hometown described the kind of economic decline and discontent that Trump has exploited: “Now Main Street’s whitewashed windows and vacant stores / Seems like there ain’t nobody wants to come down here no more.”Springsteen’s1995 albumThe Ghost of Tom Joad bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants, including those from Mexico and Vietnam. His 2001 song American Skin (41 Shots), criticised the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fanbase.But taking on Trump is a cause of a different magnitude. His “Make America great again” (Maga) movement has proved uniquely polarising in US culture, forcing many people to choose whether they are on the blue team or red team. The clothes people wear, the food they eat and the music they listen to have become signifiers of Maga. Even some in New Jersey, where Springsteen grew up and now lives in the town of Colts Neck, are having doubts.Hobicorn reflects: “As the country has become more and more divided, there’s certainly a real disdain for Springsteen and his politics in New Jersey. Most New Jerseyans are supportive of who he is, what he’s done for the state, what he’s done for our culture, what he’s done for music.“I feel like it’s not a lot of stuff in the middle like, yeah, he’s OK. It’s one way or the other. In New Jersey it’s mostly in a positive way: people love and respect Bruce for everything.But some are going to paint the picture of him: he’s a billionaire and he doesn’t give a crap about anybody but himself. That’s what they do.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at a campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesNo Surrender has found an alternative venue. After the cancellation of its Toms River gig, Randy Now’s Man Cave, a record shop in Hightstown, New Jersey, stepped in and will host the bandon 20 June. The shop will producers flyers and T-shirts that say: “Free speech is live at Randy Now’s Man Cave.”Owner Randy Ellis, 68, says:“The state is proud of Bruce Springsteen. He should become the state bird for all I know.”But he admits:“In the last election, Harris won the state but there were many more people for Trump than I ever expected in New Jersey. It’s so polarised now. We may have people in front of my store saying Springsteen sucks and all that. Who knows?”At a time when many of Trump’s critics have kept quiet, Springsteen is arguably his leading cultural foe. In 2020 he said: “a good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotised, brainwashed by a conman from Queens” – knowing the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan.‘This dried out prune of a rocker’: Donald Trump attacks Bruce Springsteen after musician’s fiery speechesRead moreDan DeLuca, who grew up in Ventnor, New Jersey, and is now a popular music critic at the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper, says:“The thing about Bruce that people love is this idea of being a truth teller. You see what you see and you need to speak on it. There’s a lot of people who are muttering things or speaking in private about what’s going on in America who are not speaking out for whatever reason. Maybe they don’t believe that politics and art should mix. Maybe they’re worried about their fanbase or something.“As he said, there’s a lot of crazy shit going on and it’s happened since he was last on the road.It’s good that he’s speaking his mind and he’s speaking what a lot of people want to hear but maybe are afraid to hear and it’s maybe giving some people courage.”But as the case of No Surrender demonstrated, there is a significant minority in New Jersey who see things differently in this hyper-partisan era. DeLuca reflects: “I grew up in south Jersey, which is less densely populated, less urban, and it’s Trump country now.“Springsteen has been true to what he sings about and the people he sings about and the blue collar concerns but then he’s open to target because he’s rich or hangs out with Obama. They probably think that Bruce has turned into a knucklehead socialist or something. I’m sure there are plenty of people who probably do have some divided loyalties.”Explore more on these topicsBruce SpringsteenDonald TrumpNew JerseyUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is adult-only a luxury or a necessity?After it emerged this week that hotels and campsites could face prosecution, we hear opposing views in the debateRachel ObordoSat 31 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 09.02 EDTShareHospitality venues inFrancesuch as hotels, restaurants and campsites that do not admit children could face prosecution under proposals for a crackdown that emerged this week.Laurence Rossignol, a socialist senator, plans to introduce a private member’s bill to make it illegal to ban children from such establishments, theTimes reported, while the French high commissioner for childhood, Sarah El Haïry, said government lawyers were looking into whether it would be possible to take legal action against places that exclude families.She told the French international radio station RFI that the move would address the “no kids trend”, which amounted to “violence against children”, adding: “A child shouts, laughs and moves … we are institutionalising the idea that silence is a luxury and the absence of children is a luxury.”Here, four people from acrossEuropeshare their thoughts on the idea.‘Adults can’t build a parallel society that is free of children’View image in fullscreenEmilie says family life is important in FranceEmilie, who is a stay-at-home mother, thinks it’s “healthy” that French politicians want to stop the trend that “turns children into pariahs” but does not think a ban would deal with the root cause.“I think it’s more about the French relationship with children,” says the 39-year-old, who is French but lives in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. “There is a popular saying in France about children:Les enfants doivent être vus, et non entendus,which means children should be seen, not heard.”From her experience, family life is important in France and children are taught manners when they are young and become used to eating in restaurants from an early age. There is, therefore, an expectation that children are well-behaved in public.Emilie is in two minds about a ban. One one hand she feels that people who do not want to be around children “are not suddenly going to show patience because they are forced to cohabit with them”. However, she also believes children are part of everyday life and that “adults can’t build a parallel society that is free of children”.“It’s difficult but it’s one of the reasons I want to stay in the UK. I think my son would be much happier growing up here than in France.”‘We didn’t want to constantly be faced with children and the reminder of what we wanted but couldn’t achieve’After each one of Jo’s six IVF attempts were unsuccessful, she and her husband took a break to an adult-only hotel for a few days. “We didn’t want to constantly be faced with children and the reminder of what we wanted but couldn’t achieve,” says the 40-year-old project manager from Lancashire.For Jo, the French proposals do not consider those who are childless not by choice. “It’s been five years since our final attempt at IVF, but my husband and I still get a bit upset sometimes thinking about how we couldn’t have the children we thought we would have.“It’s not that we don’t like them – we have five nephews – but when we’re on holiday it’s nice to know that we’ve got a somewhat safe space. It’s about protecting yourself a bit.”Since being diagnosed with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, Jo is also more sensitive to noise than she used to be. “Being out somewhere with loud children is not enjoyable for me at all – something I know other people with health issues or neurodivergence also struggle with.”‘Some businesses will adapt but others will close rather than make changes’View image in fullscreenFranz Peter Weeren: ‘One time a 12-year-old tripped over a waitress who was serving a tray full of cocktails.’Franz Peter Weeren, a retired hotelier and chef, thinks a ban would be “absolutely ludicrous”. As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry since the 1980s, he says most of the problems he has faced with children were caused by parents who were unwilling or, more frequently, incapable of controlling their offspring when they misbehaved.“One time a 12-year-old tripped over a waitress who was serving a tray full of cocktails and the parents just said: ‘Oh well, they’re children.’ They kicked up a fuss when I upped their bill for damages,” recalls the 68-year-old from Paderborn, Germany.At the time, when Weeren was running an inn in Austria, he considered not allowing children under-14 in but realised he couldn’t if his business was to be successful.Attracting more than100 million visitors in 2024, France is the world’s top tourist destination. However, Weeren thinks a proposed ban on adult-focused venues might cause a dip in its popularity. “Some businesses will adapt but others will close rather than make any changes, and others just won’t go to France because they want to enjoy a child-free environment.”‘Better to have specific child-tolerated placesthan adult-only ones’Sara Lewis thinks a ban would be a “totally unreasonable deprivation of people’s liberty” and that the plan is too extreme.“It amounts to forcing people to accept others’ kids, of which there’s more than enough of already,” says the retired copyeditor from Brussels. She believes it’s time to end the stigmatisation of people who prefer to avoid children, and instead of adult-only venues she thinks “specific child-tolerated places” might be better.For Lewis, the problem is not from children themselves but parents letting them do what they like and expecting others to put up with their behaviour. She feels parents should “teach their children to be unobtrusive in public”.“If I go to a restaurant, cafe or hotel I would expect other people, adults or children, to respect me as I would respect them,” Lewis says.“Children by nature want to be lively and run around but that’s not always appropriate, depending on the environment. In the same way that I wouldn’t play opera music very loudly in public, as much as I like it.”Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryChildrenFranceEuropeFamily holidaysFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was taken aback: was this a new habit adopted from social media or some lifestyle guru?Kit is not obsessive, but she is house proud. She lives in the country, her house surrounded by muddy lawn near a beach, so it makes sense not to drag dirt on to her beautifully polished parquetry or scratch it with sand. She goes about barefoot year-round: slippers are not her style. She keeps a pair of rubber slides at the back door for putting the bins out, or going to the veggie patch.I had no choice but to comply, relieved that I had on good clean socks and that Kit’s house is well heated. I felt a bit awkward at first, slipping and sliding like a shaky beginner skater on an ice rink. But by the end of the evening, I was persuaded that we too should adopt this more hygienic approach, despite misgivings about dropping boiling water or cooking fat on my feet.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningManynon-Anglo-Celtic households, of course, have a long-held tradition of removing one’s shoes at the door. In Japan, indoor house shoes calleduwabakiare usually provided to keep tatami floors, where you sit, sleep and eat, pristine. It is actually illegal to wear outdoor shoes in rental properties and can incur a fine. In Scandinavia, felt and wool indoor slippers are stylish accessories. In Canada,where the severe cold requires heavy footwear such as snow boots, houses usually have a wet room in which to remove all waterproof gear and leave it out of the way.Shoes on at home or shoes off? If you care about your health, it’s a no-brainer | Polly HudsonRead moreAbit of readinginformed me that shoes carry in germs, bacteria, pesticides and a variety of other nasties such as carcinogenic asphalt sealants that are invisible but can linger in domestic dust. As just two adults at home, we weren’t worried about small children crawling at ground level, nor do we have a pet, but this relatively minor adjustment sounded healthy and sensible.The decision proved to besurprisingly divisive and complicated. When I raised it with friends, some said they disliked being asked and avoided houses where it is required.Even small changes demand thought. Unforeseen decisions suddenly have to be made: how best to suggest this new approach? On the phone, when inviting people round? Or at the door? And then: where to take off the shoes? Outside, where spiders and other critters might make their home in them? Inside, where they will look messy? (Should we get a box to contain them? Or a rack?)Enthusiastically embracing our decision, we buy stylish slip-ons so as to avoid the kind of tartan woollen footwear our grandparents wore (one friend with a shoeless home told me his partner said he’d leave him if he ever adopted slippers); we try to remember not to step outside in them on any account, not even to go to the bins or pick a herb; we keep separate shoes for outside by the back door. The key is not to have to bend down or lace them up. It takes a few weeks to adapt, with a few stumbles evidenced by muddy sole tread marks on the stairs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I presented a morning show on Radio Kraków twice a week for about two years. It was only one part of my work, but I really enjoyed it. It was about culture and cinema, and featured a range of people, from artists to activists. I remember interviewing Ukrainians about the Russian invasion for the first programme I presented, back in 2022.I was let go in August 2024, alongside a dozen co-workers who were also part-time. We were told the radio station was having financial problems. I was relatively OK with it, as I had other income streams. But a few months later I heard that Radio Kraków was launching programmes hosted by three AI characters.Each had AI-generated photographs, a biography and a specific personality. They called it an “experiment” aimed at younger audiences.One of the first shows they did was a live “interview” with Polish poet Wisława Szymborska, winner of the 1996 Nobel prize for literature, who had died 12 years earlier. What are the ethics of using the likeness of a dead person? Szymborska is a symbol of Polish intellectual culture, so it caused outrage. I couldn’t understand it: radio is created by people for other people. We cannot replace our experiences, emotions or voices with avatars.One of my colleagues who was laid off is queer. One of the new AI avatars was called Alex, a non-binary student and a “specialist” in queer subjects. In Poland, we are still fighting for queer rights, and as journalists it’s incumbent on us to have real representation when reporting on this. For my colleague and the LGBTQ+ community, it was shocking and damaging to hear their lived experience and knowledge being imitated by AI.Some of us who had been laid off started a petition against the station, calling for regulation and to get the AI shows taken off air. We got tens of thousands of people to sign – actors, journalists, artists, but also listeners. Hundreds of young people didn’t want to listen to an AI show.The station has since scrapped the avatars, largely because of the success of our campaign. It’s now student-run. The station claim this is about offering mentorship, but it’s also a cheaper alternative to hiring qualified journalists. I guess it’s better than AI, though.There are still no clear regulations covering its use in Poland. I’m not campaigning for regulation because I lost my job to AI: I’m campaigning because I’m worried about the ethics of all of this; about misinformation and deceiving listeners.I’m a realist – I’m not completely against AI. I think it can be used responsibly to do the boring bits of our job. But we can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence.‘Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced’Lina Meilina, 30, illustrator, Bandung, IndonesiaView image in fullscreenLina Meilina: ‘Since AI took off, my workload has plummeted.’Photograph: Muhammad Fadli/The GuardianI’ve been drawing and painting since I was a kid. Even in kindergarten, I was doodling. By elementary school I was drawing comics and my teachers knew I had potential. I have strict, traditional parents who told me art wouldn’t make me any money, but I wanted to follow my dreams. Now I make anime-style illustrations, and most of my income comes fromcommissions: I draw bespoke characters for clients, and also create my own.Even before AI tools arrived, it wasn’t easy. Indonesia doesn’t take artists seriously and copyright laws are weak. I’ve seen people steal my work and put it on merch to sell on retail websites such as AliExpress. I have to get them taken down myself, screenshotting pages one by one to report them to the site’s admin. Now, AI makes it harder to prove ownership, because it can take your art and make slight changes, so it’s not a direct copy.I first learned about generative AI a few years ago, watching a YouTuber introduce viewers to the software Midjourney, which generates images based on prompts. He asked the program to produce an image in the style of comic book artist Alex Ross. The finished work was good, with Ross’s distinctive hyper-realistic style and colour palette. I remember thinking, “Oh shit, this is going to be a disaster.”Since last year, when AI really took off, my workload has plummeted. I used to get up to 15 commissions a month; now I get around five. People can take your art and feed it into an AI program to create work. A follower of mine recently used AI to portray my characters doing something inappropriate. I tried to report it, but the platform said it didn’t violate its copyright policy.One of the main platforms freelance artists use to get work recently launched a campaign called “Nobody cares if you use AI”, encouraging clients and artists to embrace AI tools. Well, I care, as do a lot of my colleagues.Even the Indonesian government is using AI art: they recently released a video promoting a scheme that provides free lunches for students. It’s a great initiative, but it breaks my heart that they used AI instead of commissioning a talented Indonesian artist.I used to work in a small studio as a storyboard artist for TV commercials. Since AI appeared, I’ve seen colleagues lose jobs because companies are using Midjourney. Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced – and pay in south-east Asia is already low.Maybe my mum was right that I shouldn’t be an artist. I’ve had to look for other sources of income – at the moment, I make cosplay props on commission. I love illustrating, but if I keep losing clients because of AI, I’ll probably go into  prop-making full-time.‘I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs’Annabel Beales, 49, copywriter, Southampton, UKView image in fullscreenAnnabel Beales: ‘Losing my dream job was devastating.’Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianI landed my dream job in 2023, writing content for a garden centre. I mostly did search engine optimisation, and wrote gardening tips for their magazine and blog. My colleagues were friendly and the hours were flexible.I’ve always loved reading and writing. I was brought up on a farm with no television, so I was always at the library, reading Judy Blume books. If I didn’t like the ending, I would rewrite it. But I never thought then that I could pursue writing as a career: where I’m from, it was hard to break into anything creative – people either worked as nurses or at the local car manufacturer. Even though I wanted to be a writer, my mum had always told me to have a back-up plan.Copywriting didn’t come to me straight away, so I did secretarial work for years, and admin roles in the public sector. I’d heard of some friends who needed a copywriter for their businesses, and I was interested in writing professionally, so I enrolled on an online course. It cost a month’s wages and took eight months to complete, but I enjoyed the creativity.I got the gardening centre job a few months later. I’d interview different experts to write blogs on topics such as growing potatoes or planting trees. I threw myself into it and passed my probation.Around eight months in, I noticed I was getting less work. One day, I overheard my boss saying to a colleague, “Just put it in ChatGPT.” The marketing department started to use it more often to write their blogs, and they were just asking me to proofread. I remember walking around the company’s beautiful gardens with my manager and asking him if AI would replace me, and he stressed that my job was safe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They told me they were letting me go immediately. It was just before Christmas. Thankfully, I got a temp role doing admin work in January, but going back to that after having my dream writing job was devastating.The company’s website is sad to see now. It’s all AI-generated and factual – there’s no substance, or sense of actually enjoying gardening. AI scares the hell out of me. I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs.I’m now a PA in cancer research in the university sector. I feel more settled, but I regret going into copywriting. I got the job at the gardening centre at a time when my mum was terminally ill. I remember asking her whether I should take it, as it would mean I wouldn’t be able to spend as much time with her. She told me to follow my dreams and go for it. I thought I’d be there for years, working as a copywriter until I retired. Looking back, I wish I had spent more time with my mum instead.‘Listening to a series I’d recorded, I heard my character say a line – but it wasn’t my voice’Richie Tavake, 31, voice actor, San Francisco, USView image in fullscreenRichie Tavake: ‘When characters are voiced well, people relate to them.’Photograph: Cayce Clifford/The GuardianI’ve spent 10 years training to be a voice actor. It takes skill–it’s my job to bring honesty to the story I tell. I recently played the main character, Jessie, in a survival video game. Jessie crash-lands on a snowy mountain – as his voice, I have to consider whether he’s injured, how he feels and the shock he’s in.My mum encouraged me to try acting classes while I was at university, as it was something I had always talked about doing. Immediately, I was hooked, and after a few semesters I decided to pursue it professionally. I started training seriously while taking customer service jobs to support myself. My first gig in a professional studio was an Animal Farm audio drama in 2023, in which I played Napoleon. It was a great experience to get mic’d up and perform with a whole cast.The effect of generative AI in my industry is something I’ve felt personally. Recently, I was listening to an audio drama series I’d recorded and heard my character say a line, but it wasn’t my voice. I hadn’t recorded that section. I contacted the producer, who told me he had input my voice into AI software to say the extra line. But he hadn’t asked my permission. I later found out he had uploaded my voice to a platform, allowing other producers to access it. I requested its removal, but it took me a week, and I had to speak to five people to get it done.The Screen Actors Guild, SAG-AFTRA, began a strike last year against certain major video games studios because voice actors were unhappy with the lack of protections against AI. Developers can record actors, then AI can use those initial chunks of audio to generate further recordings. Actors don’t get paid for any of the extra AI-generated stuff, and they lose their jobs. I’ve seen it happen.Better at everything: how AI could make human beings irrelevantRead moreOne client told me straight out that they have started using generative AI for their voices because it’s faster. But when characters are written and voiced well, people relate to them. Take Batman, who was voiced by the late Kevin Conroy in the animated series. People appreciated his work because he brought the character to life. When done right, people will value it and pay money for it.There is also the issue of diversity. I’m American-Samoan and I wouldn’t be happy to hear a Samoan voice generated by AI – it could be inaccurate and even offensive. It’s just a bunch of numbers and words imitating a culture I was brought up in. A great example of this is Ghost of Tsushima, a video game that’s based in Japan. All the cast were of Japanese heritage: they were in tune with the culture and they brought so much honesty to the story. AI can’t replicate that. It’s a machine; it doesn’t have that background and it never will.‘I never anticipated they’d get rid of me’Jadun Sykes, 28, graphic designer, Wakefield, UKView image in fullscreenJadun Sykes: ‘My advice? Learn as many skills as possible.’Photograph: courtesy of Jadun SykesAs a kid I was always arty – sketching, making Play-Doh sculptures. I studied game design and art at college, and went down an Adobe Photoshop rabbit hole. It was fun and I was good at it, so I decided to turn it into a career, starting at the company when I was 21. They sell a platform that creates landing pages and email layouts. I’d design the templates and do bespoke work for clients.When generative AI came along, the company was very vocal about using it as a tool to help clients get creative. As a company that sells digital automation, developments in AI fit them well. I knew they were introducing it to do things like writing emails and generating images, but I never anticipated they’d get rid of me: I’d been there six years and was their only graphic designer. My redundancy came totally out of the blue. One day, HR told me my role was no longer required as much of my work was being replaced by AI.I made a YouTube video about my experience. It went viral and I received hundreds of responses from graphic designers in the same boat, which made me realise I’m not the only victim – it’s happening globally, and it takes a huge mental toll. I went to college, I studied, I did six years of work. Was it all for nothing?After I was let go, I spent months looking for a job. I didn’t find work in graphic design, but did get a job as a content creator at a PC manufacturer. I make videos of the production line, interview staff members and do some social media. I’m not worried here: my employers don’t agree with replacing human roles with AI. I may use it to edit pictures but only to enhance something a human created – say, to remove cables in the back of a product image. We would never post an image entirely generated by AI, which is what my old company is doing. My advice to every graphic designer is to learn as many skills as possible. You have to be prepared.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Graphic designComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The videos also over-emphasised therapy. “While there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of therapy, it’s important to emphasise that it’s not magic, a quick fix or a one-size-fits-all solution,” he said.Dan Poulter, a former health minister and NHS psychiatrist who reviewed the videos about severe mental illness, said some of them “pathologise everyday experiences and emotions, suggesting that they equate to a diagnosis of serious mental illness”.“This is providing misinformation to impressionable people and can also trivialise the life experiences of people living with serious mental illnesses.”Amber Johnston, a British Psychological Society-accredited psychologist who reviewed the trauma videos, said that while most videos contained a nugget of truth, they tended to over-generalise while minimising the complexity of post-traumatic stress disorder or trauma symptoms.“Each video is guilty of suggesting that everyone has the same experience of PTSD with similar symptoms that can easily be explained in a 30-second reel. The truth is that PTSD and trauma symptoms are highly individual experiences that cannot be compared across people and require a trained and accredited clinician to help a person understand the individual nature of their distress,” she said.“TikTok is spreading misinformation by suggesting that there are secret universal tips and truths that may actually make a viewer feel even worse, like a failure, when these tips don’t simply cure.”TikTok said videos were taken down if they discouraged people from seeking medical support or promoted dangerous treatments. When people in the UK search for terms linked to mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, autism or post-traumatic stress disorder, they are also directed to NHS information.Chi Onwurah, a Labour MP, said the technology committee she chaired was investigating misinformation on social media. “Significant concerns” had been raised in the inquiry about the effectiveness of the Online Safety Act in “tackling false and/or harmful content online, and the algorithms that recommend it”, she said.“Content recommender systems used by platforms like TikTok have been found to amplify potentially harmful misinformation, like this misleading or false mental health advice,” she added. “There’s clearly an urgent need to address shortcomings in the OSA to make sure it can protect the public’s online safety and their health.”The Liberal Democrat MP Victoria Collins agreed the findings were “damning”, and urged the government to act to keep people safe from “harmful misinformation”.Paulette Hamilton, the Labour MP who chairs the health and social care select committee, said mental health misinformation on social media was “concerning” . “These ‘tips’ on social media should not be relied upon in place of professional, suitably qualified support,” she said.Prof Bernadka Dubicka, the online safety lead for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that although social media could increase awareness, it was important that people were able to access up-to-date, evidence-based health information from trusted sources. Mental illness could only be diagnosed through a “comprehensive assessment from a qualified mental health professional”, she added.A TikTok spokesperson said: “TikTok is a place where millions of people express themselves, come to share their authentic mental health journeys, and find a supportive community. There are clear limitations to the methodology of this study, which opposes this free expression and suggests that people should not be allowed to share their own stories.“We proactively work with health experts at the WorldHealthOrganization and NHS to promote reliable information on our platform and remove 98% of harmful misinformation before it’s reported to us.”A government spokesperson said ministers were “taking action to reduce the impact of harmful mis- and disinformation content online” through the Online Safety Act, which requires platforms to tackle such material if it was illegal or harmful to children.In the UK, the charityMindis available on 0300 123 3393 andChildlineon 0800 1111.

Before this season, it had been 12 consecutive qualifications for the knockout rounds and 12 assorted sets of heartbreak, some scarcely believable. A first success in the competition consistently eluded them.This was the night when the French champions broke through, when they delivered on the obsession of their owners, of everybody connected to the club; 13th time lucky. All of the emotion came pouring out as Luis Enrique’s swashbuckling team tore into Inter, the result not in doubt from the moment that Désiré Doué made it 2-0 before the midway point of the first half. The 19-year-old was nervelessly brilliant.Game is up for Inter after Champions League journey ends in bitter humiliation | Jonathan LiewRead moreIt had been possible, in fact, to fear for Inter from the first whistle. PSG were in that kind of mood. They have been the dominant team in Europe since the turn of the year, sweeping all before them, and they were determined to drive it home. It would become impossibly grisly for Inter, Simone Inzaghi’s team powerless to resist the PSG waves, slumping to the widest margin of defeat that this competition has known in a final.After Doué had scored his second for 3-0, teed up by the irrepressible Vitinha, and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia made it four with another one-on-one breakaway, there was a moment when the substitute Bradley Barcola tied the veteran Inter defender Francesco Acerbi in such a knot before surging past him that it felt cruel. Barcola would blow the chance.PSG toyed with Inter. When a fan of the Serie A club was pictured on the big screen in floods of tears, it was the defining image from their point of view. It was not so long ago Inter were on for a treble. Top of their domestic league, they were into the Coppa Italia semi-finals against Milan. More broadly, they had designs on avenging their loss to Manchester City in the 2023Champions Leaguefinal, on winning Europe’s biggest tournament for the first time in 15 years. They have finished empty-handed; utterly broken.View image in fullscreenAchraf Hakimi watches his shot go in to open the scoring past Inter’s Yann Sommer in the Champions League final.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/ReutersPSG were not finished at 4-0. Doué had made way and it was another 19-year-old, Senny Mayulu, on as a substitute, who made the final incision, shooting home from a Barcola pass. For PSG, it added up to a treble; at long last, they have their grail. And there were few dry eyes when their fans unfurled a tifo shortly after the trophy lift. It was to honour the memory of Luis Enrique’s daughter Xana, who died of cancer in 2019 at the age of nine.The PSG fans spilled on to the pitch in their thousands after that but the thick police line held, although the situation felt good-natured, unlikely to spiral out of control. Those supporters simply pinched themselves because their team had been so good from the first whistle – the positional interchanges, the unusual overloads, the fizz of the passing. PSG brought a fierce press, too, and Inter struggled to get out. The goalkeeper, Yann Sommer, was repeatedly pressured when he had the ball at his feet.Vitinha was the architect of so much, including Achraf Hakimi’s breakthrough goal. Vitinha watched Kvaratskhelia and Fabián Ruiz make moves off the left, pulling at the seams of the Inter defence, and when he got the ball back, he fizzed it up to Doué on the left of the area. Hakimi was on the move from right-back, attacking the six-yard box. Doué took a touch as he spun and found him. It was all ping-perfect.View image in fullscreenPSG fans grab the goal nets as a souvenir after their victory over Inter in the Champions League final.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPSG tightened their grip in the 20th minute and, at that point, Inter were gasping. Nicolò Barella thought he had won a corner but that was before Willian Pacho jumped into a challenge on him, hooking the ball away, and the end-to-end PSG counter was devastating. Kvaratskhelia and Ousmane Dembélé were prominent, the latter going right to Doué, whose shot deflected off Federico Dimarco to beat Sommer.Inter fought to clear their heads. Maybe a set piece could offer them a lifeline? Acerbi went close from one, Marcus Thuram thumped a header from another just wide having got above Kvaratskhelia. Barella also took a heavy touch in open play when well placed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dembélé dropped deep from his central attacking role. He went right. He went pretty much wherever. Doué’s licence to roam off the right was pronounced. Then again, it does help when you have Hakimi thundering beyond you.‘Always in my heart’: Luis Enrique pays tribute to late daughter after PSG triumphRead moreThe contrasts were everywhere. It was PSG’s youthful swagger v Inter’s experience. It was 4-3-3 without a pure centre-forward v 3-5-2 with twin No 9s. It was attack v defence. And it was big budgets v tight economics, cuteness in the market. In Simone Inzaghi’s four years at Inter, his most expensive signings have been Benjamin Pavard and Davide Frattesi, each for a little more than €30m. Only two of the PSG starting XI cost less than that.Inzaghi needed a punch to land after the restart but Inter laboured to get into the positions. Their only clear chance of the second half came for Thuram on 75 minutes, which Donnarumma saved and, by then, PSG had four.The alarm bells sounded for the third when Vitinha got on the ball and started to scuttle and probe, the ball under his spell, his markers close and yet far away. The give-and-go with Dembélé was lovely, his teammate finessing it with a back-heel and Vitinha was in business. The pass to Doué was measured to perfection. Game over, even if there was still time for Kvaratskhelia and Mayulu to salt Inter’s wounds.View image in fullscreenKhvicha Kvaratskhelia celebrates after scoring the fourth goal for PSG.Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainInternazionalematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Due to be unveiled by Keir Starmer on Monday, it will draw heavily on lessons learned from the war inUkraine.Plans to step up munitions production are a response to the review’s call for an “always on” capacity that can be scaled up quickly if needed.Healey said: “The hard-fought lessons from Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them. We are strengthening the UK’s industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.”He said theUK defence industrywould become “an engine for economic growth” and boost skilled jobs. The new £1.5bn funding will see spending on UK munitions hit £6bn during this parliament and support 1,800 jobs across the UK, according to the Ministry of Defence.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said that “a strong economy needs a strong national defence, and investing in weaponry and munitions and backing nearly 2,000 jobs across Britain in doing so is proof the two go hand-in-hand”.As part of the review, the Ministry of Defence will be urged to lay the industrial foundations for an uplift in munitions stockpiles to meet the demand of“high-tempo” warfare.Ministers have also announced more than £1.5bn to improvethe condition of military homesby carrying out urgent repairs such as fixing boilers and roofs and tackling damp.“Our forces make extraordinary sacrifices to keep us safe and to serve this country and yet for years, we’ve forced their families to live in substandard homes,” Healey said on a visit to military accommodation in Cambridgeshire.Starmer launched the strategic defence reviewshortly after entering office last yearand said it would help prepare the UK for “a more dangerous and volatile world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Figures out this week show that the size of the army has dropped below the target to the lowest level since the Napoleonic era and earlier, with the number of full-time trained soldiers at 70,860 on 1 April, down 2.3% over the preceding year.The review is not expected to set out fresh commitments for defence spending, but will instead reiterate a commitment made by Starmer in February to increase the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament.It was written by former Nato secretary-general George Robertson, former US presidential adviser Fiona Hill and former joint force commander Richard Barrons.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryMinistry of DefenceJohn HealeyRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

Return the fathers to our children. Don’t make them orphans.”A statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said: “We call upon the prime minister from here. The time has come for a deal. For the sake of our children’s future. One comprehensive deal to bring them all home. Right now.”Earlier on Saturday the Israeli military confirmed that it killed Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza chief, on May 13.Sinwar was the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza earlier this month. Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he had been killed.He was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian militant group’s deceased leader and mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel. Hamas has not confirmed his death.The Hamas response to the US proposal appears close to a previously reported version of the deal, which specified that the group would release 10 hostages, as well as a number of hostages’ remains, during the ceasefire in exchange for 1,100 Palestinian prisoners.The Hamas statement said: “This proposal aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to our people and our families in the Gaza Strip.”It said its response came “after conducting a round of national consultations”.“There are some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the US guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,” a senior official with the group told the Associated Press.The US ceasefire proposal reportedly involves a 60-day pause in fighting and a redoubling of efforts towards long-term peace, as well as guarantees from Israel that it will not resume its offensive after Hamas releases hostages, which the country did in March.Israeli negotiators accepted the deal, but Hamas’s initial reaction to the proposal was lukewarm. On Friday, the militant group said it was holding consultations with other factions operating under its rule in Gaza including Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Hamas’s response came after two days in which the militant group had indicated that the US proposal was more biased in favour of Israel than previous ones.A leading Hamas official, Basem Naim, said on Thursday that the US proposal “does not respond to any of our people’s demands”, including lifting the humanitarian blockade on the Gaza Strip that has led tofamine-likeconditions among the population of 2 million.The group’s reaction provoked the ire of their Israeli counterparts. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, threatened the group on Friday with “annihilation” if it did not accept. “The Hamas murderers will now be forced to choose: accept the terms of the ‘Witkoff deal’ for the release of the hostages – or be annihilated,” said Katz.Israel has not yet officially responded to Hamas’s response, but an officialtold Israeli reporterson condition of anonymity that Jerusalem was treating Hamas’s changes as an “effective rejection”.Israel’s plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza – podcastRead moreDeep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March after only two months.Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force, and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza be returned before it will agree to end the war.The Israeli government fears that a lasting ceasefire and withdrawal would leave Hamas with significant influence in Gaza, even if it surrenders formal power. With time, the Israelis worry Hamas might be able to rebuild its military and launch more 7 October-style attacks.On the other hand, Hamas fears that Israel could break the ceasefire – as it did last March – and resume the war, which the Israeli government would be permitted to do after 60 days under the terms of the deal.Aprevious ceasefire collapsedin mid-March after Israel refused to move to a planned second phase that could have led to a permanent end to the war, and instead restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip. Negotiators have met in the months since in an attempt to reach a ceasefire, with little progress to show for it.More than 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the besieged Palestinian territory on 7 October 2023. The Israeli offensive was in retaliation for a Hamas attack on the same day, which saw the group kill about 1,200 people and take 250 hostages. About 20 hostages are believed to still be alive and their return is a key demand of ceasefire negotiations.As negotiations over a ceasefire continued, Israel’s offensive in Gaza has ramped up. At least 60 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the last 24 hours, health officials said, while 72 people were killed on Thursday.Israel stopped allowing almost all humanitarian aid into Gaza when it resumed hostilities in the Palestinian territory. The nearly three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of more than 2 million to the brink of famine. While pressure has slightly eased in recent days as Israel allowed some aid to enter, aid organisations say far from enough food is getting in.“After nearly 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving – and they are no longer willing to watch food pass them by,” the World Food Programme said on Saturday. The UN aid agency had been allowed to bring 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza overnight, but the trucks were stopped en route by crowds of hungry people.Explore more on these topicsMiddle East and north AfricaGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The designer cells are then infused back into their bloodstream to fight the disease.The therapy has already proved successful in treating blood cancers. Now results from the world’s first randomised controlled trial of Car T-cell therapy in solid tumours suggest it could be transformative in the fight against these cancers too.Solid tumours represent about 90% of all cancers, including breast, lung and pancreatic cancer.In the trial hailed as a “milestone” by experts, patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer treated with Car T-cell therapy lived on average approximately 40% longer than patients who received standard care.The results were published in The Lancetand presented at the world’s largest cancer conference, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco), in Chicago.Dr Carl June, a leading expert on Car T-cell therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved with the trial, said: “This is an exciting study showing the first positive results from a randomised trial testing Car T-cells for a solid cancer.“The study shows that satri-cel Car T-cells provide significant benefits to advanced gastric cancer patients who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy. This represents a groundbreaking milestone for the field of Car-T therapies against solid tumours.”In the trial, more than 100 patients in China with advanced gastric or GEJ cancer were randomised to receive either Car T-cell therapy or one of the standard-of-care medications. Patients who received Car T-cell therapy lived an average of 7.9 months after randomisation, compared with 5.5 months through standard care.Patients receiving the designer immunotherapy also experienced 3.3 months without the cancer advancing compared with 1.8 months in the standard care group.The researchers, from Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute in Beijing, said Car T-cell therapy “showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival”. The results suggest Car T-cell “could represent a paradigm shift” in care, addressing a crucial unmet need for some patients, they added.Dr Jason Luke, an Asco expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, said the results were “exciting”. He added: “This is a very important ‘plant the flag’ publication that should rally the cancer research community to push forward toward improving the lives of patients [with] solid tumours.”A second study on Car T-cell, led by the University of Pennsylvania and due to be presented at Asco on Sunday, suggests the approach can also be used to treat brain tumours.Results from that trial are expected to show Car T-cell can shrink tumours in glioblastoma, an aggressive and fast-growing brain cancer, and help patients live much longer.Car – chimeric antigen receptor – T-cell therapy works by genetically engineering a patient’s T-cells to recognise and destroy cancer cells.NHS could start offering breast cancer checks to women in their thirtiesRead moreT-cells are a type of white blood cell that can recognise and destroy foreign cells, including cancer cells, but because cancer is able to evade immune detection, they often miss their mark. Car T-cells are engineered to make them better at detecting cancer cells.Oncologists in Chicago said they were increasingly optimistic that Car T-cell therapy could revolutionise treatment of solid tumours, after dramatic success with blood cancers.“For solid cancers, there is clearly now not only an interest but evidence that this treatment can benefit patients, making this an important new development that should be shared,” said Dr John Haanen, of the Netherlands Cancer Institute, who will give a presentation on Car T-cell therapy at the Asco meeting. “I think this [is] a new generation of treatment that wasn’t there for medical oncologists before.”Dr Catherine Elliott, the director of research and partnerships at Cancer Research UK, said it was “encouraging” to see early signs that Car T-cell therapy could help patients with solid tumours. The therapy will need to be trialled in larger numbers of patients before being rolled out widely, Elliott said, but “could mark an important step forward for patients with limited treatment options”.Explore more on these topicsCancer researchMedical researchCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The rescue team said his family have been informed of the discovery.The pair’s last known location had been a mountain hut called Casina Dosson, close to the town of Tione Di Trento, near Riva Del Garda on Lake Garda on 1 January.The alarm was raised when the pair missed their return flight on 6 January.Firefighters and a volunteer group had also been involved in the search operation.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British national who died in northern Italy and are in contact with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsItalyWalkingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Thank you, Ncuti! As his final words say, this has been an absolute joy, and the team in Cardiff and everyone who has worked on this show for the past few years are so lucky to have been part of Ncuti’s great adventure as he shoots off to stratospheric new heights.”In a statement released by theBBC, Gatwa said: “You know when you get cast, at some point you are going to have to hand back that sonic screwdriver and it is all going to come to an end, but nothing quite prepares you for it.“This journey has been one that I will never forget, and a role that will be part of me forever.”Piper, 42, starred as the companion to the ninth Doctor in 2005, playing Rose Tyler alongside Christopher Eccleston’s Time Lord.She said of her shock return: “It’s no secret how much I love this show, and I have always said I would love to return to the Whoniverse as I have some of my best memories there, so to be given the opportunity to step back on that Tardis one more time was just something I couldn’t refuse, but who, how, why and when, you’ll just have to wait and see.”The finale also saw Whittaker, the 13th Doctor, make a guest appearance as Gatwa’s Doctor appeared to be travelling through alternate universes.The final episode of this year’s series, The Reality War, was simultaneously broadcast on BBC One and shown in cinemas around the UK, as well as receiving a streaming release on iPlayer and Disney+ internationally. The BBC had not allowed previews for reviewers in an attempt to preserve secrecy around the ending.Gatwa was the 15th main lead of the show, which originally ran from 1963 to 1989, and was then revived by Davies in 2005, with Eccleston in the role. Since then David Tennant, Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Whittaker have been the Doctor, with Jo Martin and John Hurt also guest starring as mysterious versions from the Doctor’s past. Piper, Catherine Tate, Karen Gillan, Jenna Coleman, Bernard Cribbins and Bradley Walsh have been among the Doctor’s companions during the modern era.View image in fullscreenDavid Tennant as the Doctor and Catherine Tate as Donna Noble in 2008.

Since 2023 the show has been co-produced by Bad Wolf and BBC Studios, and has been distributed internationally by Disney+, in a deal which dramatically enhanced the budget for a series that during the 1970s had a reputation for wobbly sets, primitive VFX and monsters made with bubble wrap.The current era of the show has endured historically low ratings for the series, with the most-watched episode this year –The Interstellar Song Contest, which aired just before the Eurovision song contest it was modelled on – beingwatched by 3.75 million peoplein the UK during its first seven days on iPlayer.The casting of the first woman to play the role, and the first Black actors to pilot the Tardis, have dragged the show into online culture wars about diversity, which the cast and crew have pushed back on.Varada Sethu, who plays the Doctor’s companion Belinda and who also recently appeared in the Disney+ Star Wars series Andor,said of people calling it “Doctor Woke”that “Woke just means inclusive, progressive and that you care about people. And, as far as I know, the core of Doctor Who is kindness, love and doing the right thing.”ADoctor Whospin-off series, called The War Between the Land and the Sea, starring Russell Tovey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jemma Redgrave, is expected to air later in 2025.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoFantasy TVTelevisionBBCNcuti GatwaRussell T DaviesShareReuse this content"

In 2001, an enterprising Scotland Yard borough commander empowered his officers in Lambeth to caution rather than arrest those carrying small amounts of the drug for personal use – freeing them, according to the scheme’s proponents, to concentrate on more serious crimes.The softly-softly approach wascontroversialin some political and policing quarters, but wildly popular in the borough – and some of its results were dramatic. Over six months,more than 2,500 hours of police officers’ timewere saved on processing cannabis arrests, while arrests for dealing class A drugs rose by almost a fifth.Non-drug crimefell by 9%overall, withsharpdeclines in burglaries and street robberies. Almost two-thirds thought it had improved relations between the police and the community.The Lambeth experiment would end after a year, however, after the man behind it, Brian Paddick, was transferred following newspaper allegations about his private life –later acknowledged to be false. Lambeth’s residents may have been dismayed, organising public meetings and petitions to call for Paddick’s reinstatement (“He’s not a very naughty boy, he’s the Messiah,” readone poster) butMetropolitan police plansto introduce the measures across the capital were quietly shelved.View image in fullscreenBrian Paddick outside Brixton police station in 2002.Photograph: Johnny Green/PAAlmost a quarter of a century on, could decriminalisation be back on the cards for London?Sadiq Khan this weekindicated his support, after an independent commission into cannabis regulation, promised by the mayor in his 2021 election manifesto,published its findings.Classifying cannabis as a class B drug was disproportionate to its harms, it said, and the sanctions users were subject to for personal possession “cannot be justified”.Instead, the panel recommended, “natural” (but not synthetic) forms of the drug should be re-classified, allowing Londoners to use small quantities without penalty. They did not, however, call for full legalisation: those producing or supplying the drug would still be breaking the law.View image in fullscreenSadiq Khan walks through cannabis plants being legally cultivated at a licensed factory in Los Angeles during a visit to the US in 2022.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAThe move, the report said, would have the important added benefit of addressing racial inequalities in the way the Met polices cannabis possession by stop and search.Black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police, accordingto 2021 figures– but are no more likely to be carrying cannabis.“It is clear a fundamental reset is required,” said the commission’s chair, Lord Falconer, and Khan agreed: “I’ve long been clear that we need fresh thinking on how to reduce the substantial harms associated with drug-related crime in our communities.”As both men know, however, the mayor has no power to change drugs laws in the capital, and the government was quick to slap down any such suggestion. “We have no intention of reclassifying cannabis from a class B substance under the Misuse ofDrugsAct,” the Home Office said in a statement.The fact that, 24 years after the Lambeth experiment, the debate over cannabis feels so familiar may be a feature of the drug’s ambivalent place in British consciousness. Legislators may be immovable on the issue today, but cannabis was briefly reclassified as a less harmful class C drug in 2004, only to be moved back to class B five years later – arguably, the report suggests, for political reasons.The British public are broadly in favour of loosening restrictions – but not overwhelmingly so. AYouGov pollthis week found 54% supported decriminalising cannabis possession for personal use, with 34% opposed and 13% unsure. Askedif decriminalisation would lead to more drug use, almost exactly the same proportion (42%) said yes as those who said it would make no difference (43%).While almost a third of people have tried it at some point,cannabis use is actually falling across England and Wales– particularly sharply in London, where the proportion of those aged 16-59 who had used the drug in the past year was 6.2% in 2022-3, compared with 14.3% in 2001-2.‘The vast majority … have not come to any real harm’View image in fullscreenCannabis enthusiasts gather for the annual 420 event in Hyde Park in London on 20 April to light up in a tradition dating back to 1968.Photograph: Krisztián Elek/Sopa Images/Rex/ShutterstockFrom a health point of view, discussion of the harms of cannabis is nuanced. “If you’re looking at harm at a population level, the vast majority of the millions of people who’ve ever smoked cannabis in this country since the Beatles have not come to any real harm,” noted Harry Shapiro, director of the drug information serviceDrugWise.But while most health professionals agree that a low or moderate use of the drug is likely to be minimally harmful for most people, others are anxious to emphasise the risk to a minority, especially from the much stronger forms of the drug that increasingly dominate the market.Dr Emily Finch, chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), said: “It’s obvious to say that many people with cannabis have no problems at all, but there are several circumstances where it can be incredibly dangerous.” Most seriously, for a small proportion, she continued, cannabis greatly increases the risks of developing psychosis, but even among other users, there can be other risks.“People say – would tell you – that cannabis isn’t addictive. There’s really good evidence that that isn’t true, and that there is a significant group, maybe 5% of cannabis users, who do become dependent on cannabis use.” In addition, she said: “We need to understand that it’s not helpful for 11- to 15-year-olds to use large amounts of cannabis.”About a third of people who use cannabis develop a problem with the drug at some point in their lives, according to the RCPsych.The drug’s increasing potency in the market has significantly increased the risk of it causing psychosis and other harms, agrees Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King’s College London.“People need to know that cannabis, particularly modern cannabis, is a risky drug to take every day … Probably a couple of joints at the weekend is not going to do you much harm, but certainly daily cannabis carries an increased risk. If you take skunk-like cannabis every day, you’re about nine or 10 times more likely to go psychotic.”Finch broadly rejects the suggestion that cannabis is a gateway drug to stronger substances, however: “For some people, it might be part of a pattern of overall illicit drug use but I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. For many people, it isn’t.”The UK is increasingly an outlierPerhaps the most striking thing about Britain’s agonised discussions of its drug laws is the degree to which the country is increasingly an international outlier.In recent years,Portugal,South Africa, andLuxembourg, theAustralian Capital Territoryand many states in the US are among places to have partially decriminalised or fully legalised recreational cannabis use and, in some cases, permitted the development of a new, entirely legal market.“Cannabis is a commodity, it is circulated in markets and has a supply chain,” said Toby Seddon, professor of social science at University College London, who has researched international models of regulation and advised Khan’s commission.“The question we have as societies is: how do you want to regulate this? For the last 100 years, we’ve regulated it through using the criminal law. And we’ve observed how that’s worked and not worked.“If you prohibit something, you’re trying to reduce it to as close to zero as possible. And that manifestly hasn’t worked because it’s still really easy under prohibition to get hold of cannabis.”View image in fullscreenA man dances, holding a Canadian flag with a marijuana leaf in the middle instead of maple leaf on the day cannabis was legalised in the country, 17 October 2018.Photograph: Shawn Goldberg/Rex/ShutterstockWhich has led many other countries to try another way. Non-medical cannabis islegal in Canada, where the federal government controls production licences but each territory can decide how it manages its sale.InUruguay, the first country to legalise cannabis sales in 2013 to counter drug-related crime, there is a state-run, not-for-profit model, in which the government issues licences, sets prices and oversees the potency of products.Germany legislated last year to permit individual consumption and cultivation, though critics say its implementation has beenhampered by red tape. A similar critique has also beenlevelled in New York, where recreational marijuana use waslegalised in 2021.For a measure of how far apart the UK and US are on this issue, it is striking to recall that Kamala Harris, three weeks before last year’s presidential election,pledged to fully legaliserecreational marijuana at the federal level if elected;Donald Trump too has saidhe would support the measure in Florida.Any move towards that position in Britain, let alone Seddon’s suggestion that the UK should nationalise cannabis production and control its sale as a state-run enterprise, seems inconceivable at present, as he acknowledged. As a result of that, he said, “you might think, this [report] is just a waste of time.“But you could also make a case that these things, in the long run, contribute to turning the dial a little bit,” he added.A similar critique, Seddon pointed out, was made ofa major study in Canadain the 1970s that recommended legalising personal use and was largely ignored by the then prime minister, Pierre Trudeau. Decades later, his son Justin steered a similar measure into law."

With a backdrop of the City of London behind him, from the 34th floor of the Shard, theReform UKchair laid out an economic policy designed to show his party meant business.In a briefing over a full English breakfast for some of the nation’s journalists on Friday morning, Yusuf reiterated an announcement the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, had made overnight from another hotel 5,000 miles away in Las Vegas: the party would now acceptdonations in bitcoin, and if elected to power would make tax and regulatory changes to bolster Britain’s adoption of cryptocurrency.As far as settings go for a press conference, commanding views over St Paul’s Cathedral and the banks and asset managers of the Square Mile, it is straight out of the Westminster playbook, even if the policy idea is pure Donald Trump.However, the trouble with Yusuf’s message to the City was not the questionable credibility of crypto – viewed with unease at the Bank of England as thewild west of finance– but the party’s broader tax and spending policies.Riding high in the opinion polls, scrutiny of Reform and its plans for the economy is growing – led this week byan attack from Keir Starmerwho claimed that Farage’s tax and spending policies were grounded in the same “fantasy economics” used to devastating effect by Liz Truss.The accusation Labour makes is that Yusuf and Farage would spook the City with unfunded tax cuts, sparking a meltdown akin to theill-fated former prime minister’s mini-budget. And despite the posturing from the heights of the Shard, the verdict from many economists is that Starmer could have a point.Reform has made expansive tax pledges worth at least £60bn – with most of the costs relating to a promise to raise the income tax personal allowance to £20,000 a year, a substantial increase on its current £12,570. Reform has also pledged to increase the threshold for the 40% higher rate of income tax in England from £50,271 to £70,000.In the argument about whether Reform’s sums add up, Richard Tice, the party’s finance spokesperson, hassuggested most politicians have no idea about the Laffer curve. Named after the US economist Arthur Laffer, it is an illustration of a theory that there are optimal tax rates at which government revenue is maximised.The idea is that tax cuts could stimulate economic activity, thus bringing in more revenue. While a tax rate of 100% would clearly stop dead economic activity, the idea that tax cuts pay for themselves has also been widely debunked including by Greg Mankiw, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W Bush, who has described Laffer advocates as “charlatans and cranks”.Tice acknowledges that there is an “optimum point”, while Yusuf said that in government Reform would prioritise tax cuts “in the right sequential order and make sure that the numbers add up”. Many economists, too, warn tax rises announced by Labour will undermine economic growth.However, the criticism remains that Reform has mostly promised sweeping tax giveaways without credible corresponding measures to avoid widening the country’s already £100bn-plus budget deficit and £2.7tn debt pile.Add to this Britain’s low economic growth rate, above-target inflation, elevated national debt and rising borrowing costs for governments around the world linked to investor fears over Donald Trump’s trade war, and the argument is that room for additional borrowing is pretty slim.After Farage’s welfare pledges this week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Reform’s announced fiscal policies so far would cost the exchequer between £60bn and £80bn a year in foregone income and additional outlays. The IFS warned this was not yet balanced by corresponding spending cuts or tax rises elsewhere, which it said would be needed for the plan to be implementable.Yusuf said Reform’s plans were a work in progress and were liable to change as the party developed its 2029 manifesto. “You shouldn’t just transfer or copy and paste all of that [policies from the 2024 document] into an assumption about what the manifesto would be for the next general election,” he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour also stands accused of reneging on its early 2024 promises. However, voters may expect better from a putative party of government – especially one trading on public anger at politicians for moving the goalposts.However, Yusuf insisted that savings could credibly be made from “scrapping net zero”, slashing overseas aid to zero, stripping 5% from “quango spending” each year and removing all funding for “asylum hotels”.“The numbers I just gave you there add up to 78 odd billion, right? And that would be £350bn-£400bn over the course of Nigel’s first term,” he said.“Economists at the Institute for Government have questioned whether these savings would ever be deliverable, highlighting that most of the £45bn of net zero savings promised by Reform was money being spent not by the government, but the private sector.When Truss brought forward her mini-budget, she used a Treasury document running to more than 40 pages to justify her tax plans – yet still tested the confidence of City investors.For Reform, there could be a danger of history repeating.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesNigel FarageEconomicsReform UKPensionsBenefitsWelfareanalysisShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When Baz Luhrmann called the body “the greatest instrument you’ll ever own” in his 1997 song, Everybody’s Free (to Wear Sunscreen),he was on to something. Alongside a nutritious diet and good sleep, how fit we are is perhaps our greatest tool to live a long and healthy life. But what constitutes optimum physical fitness? According to David Vaux, osteopath and author ofStronger: 10 Exercises for a Longer, Healthier Life, it’s measured across different pillars of health, including cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, strength, mobility, stability and balance.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Research showsthat those who do regular exercise are less likely to succumb to premature death, as well as reducing the risk of developing anumber of diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mental health disorders. But fitness is about much more than just warding off ill health. Being able to move functionally – whether that’s picking up our grandchildren, hauling boxes around or going on long hikes – is crucial to enjoying life and feeling energised, mobile and able to take care of ourselves into our later decades.The old adage “use it or lose it” couldn’t be more applicable, but where to start? Here’s how to reach peak fitness in every decade of your adult life.20s: focus on functional movesView image in fullscreenShorts, £26, andvest, £20, both Marks and Spencer. Trainers, £49.99,Zara. Model: Blake at Nevs. Grooming: Celine Nonon at Arlington Artists.Photograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianYour body is adaptable and hormones are on your side, so focus on building lean muscle mass and a healthy nervous system with a broad diet of activity.From contact sports to tennis, sprinting and hiking, making movement a consistent habit is helpful for long-term adherence, with strength training – any form of exercise that involves lifting weights or resistance (including body weight) to build muscle – a priority to stimulate bone growth and density.“This is important because bone health at age 30 determines what it will be in later life,” says consultant physiotherapist Florence Penny. Aerobic capacity naturally declines in our mid-30s, so do plenty of walking, running and/or jogging to create a higher baseline and ensure your heart, lungs and muscles are stronger and more efficient. The improvements you make at this age will remain well into your later decades.The sky’s the limit for peak fitness in this decade, but Vaux says that if you can nail the foundational movements – including the shoulder pull, press-up, plank, squat and lunge – using just your body weight, then you’re off to an excellent start. Aim to complete four to five sets of eight to 12 reps. You can add weights afterwards – if you can do a minimum of three squats with a weight equivalent to your body and overhead press three-quarters of your body weight, you’re doing well. Test your aerobic fitness by doing a 1½-mile run; women and men should aim for 13 and 11 minutes, respectively.30s: hiit training is a great optionStrength training becomes more critical to guard against natural muscle depletion and keep metabolic health strong. “Focus on compound movements – think squats, dead lifts, push/pull movements and carries – to work multiple muscle groups at once,” says personal trainer and performance coach Niki Bird, adding that you should work out about four times a week for between 30 and 60 minutes. Concentrate on building power by adding fast spurts of these movements using lighter dumbbells during your sessions.Make sure you get your cardio in, too – it’s great for energy, recovery andreducing risk of cardiovascularand respiratory diseases. When performed properly (at 80% effort during “work” phases) high-intensity interval training (Hiit) is a great option for the time-poor and can improve hormonal responses and boost fitness, without putting the body under excessive stress. Although rather odious, sprint intervals – 30 seconds sprinting, 90 seconds walking – are incredible for quick improvements, especially when done twice a week.To test your fitness? “Aim to hold a 60-second plank, perform 10-15 full push-ups and deadlift your body weight (ie those who are 75kg should build up to that), with strong awareness of doing the movement correctly,” says Penny.One studyfound that the more press-ups individuals could do in a minute, the less likely they were to suffer from cardiovascular disease – those who could do 40 saw a huge 96% reduction in risk.40s: try a ‘grip and lean’View image in fullscreenVest, £20, Marks and Spencer. Model: Blake at Nevs. Grooming: Celine Nonon at Arlington Artists.Photograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianIt is about the age of 40 that our muscle mass really starts to decline – at3-8% each decade. The key is to continue (or start, if you haven’t already) with strength training, while ensuring minor injuries including tightness, aches and pains, get treated professionally.“With hormonal shifts, energy fluctuations and changes in metabolism, this decade is about working smarter, not harder, and focusing on workouts that deliver maximum benefits,” says Penny. “Lift weights regularly and incorporate lower impact cardio options, such as cycling, rowing and swimming, to protect joints.”Grip strength is an excellent indicator of how fit you are in your 40s. “It is independently associated with longevity and health span,” says Vaux. Try a “grip and lean”, an isometric exercise in which you tie a towel or firm band around a banister and lean back with straight arms – start with two sets of 15-30 seconds, and build up to two minutes.When you can do that, upgrade to an overhead bar hang – a minute and a half is a great target for women, while men should aim for two.50s: incorporate eccentric exerciseIf you can do 10 controlled body-weight squats and walk 400 metres in under six minutes, you’re on track for optimal fitness in your 50s. “The ageing process is notable by this decade, with most people experiencing natural sarcopenia (loss of skeletal muscle mass), and a decrease in maximum strength, power and metabolism as a result,” says Penny. The perimenopause in women and a drop in testosterone in men mean that building muscle and quick recovery after a workout are harder than before.Do not slow down – midlife is a pivotal time and dictates how you’ll fare in later life – but rather, train with intention. Continue with regular resistance training, ensure you’re doing some Hiit to keep cardio health high, and honour two rest days a week.Challenge yourself with a farmer’s carry, which involves holding and walking with kettlebells or dumbbells by your sides for a minute to improve core and shoulder stability and grip strength. Women and men should aspire to carry 75% and 100% of their body weight (half in each hand) respectively, says Vaux, who adds that you have to build up to it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Assess yourself using the 60-second “old man” test, which is a good indicator of functional strength, balance, coordination and flexibility: “If you have a stiff back or hips, then it’s tricky,” says Vaux. Lift one bare foot, put on a sock and shoe, then tie your shoelaces while it’s still elevated. Repeat on the other side. If you can do both sides with ease (and without dropping your foot) you’re doing well.If you find it tricky, now might be the time to incorporate more mobility, balance and fall prevention work into your routine. That could be lifting alternate legs up while you clean your teeth, or trying some tai chi which is gentle but great for balance. Bird also recommends including isometric exercises (where you hold a static position) to improve tissue health and strength – try a wall sit for 45 seconds, holding your legs in a 90-degree “chair” squat shape, while leaning against the wall.View image in fullscreenVest, £45, andleggings, £80, both Sweaty Betty.Trainers, £49.99,Zara. Model: Larraine at Body London. Hair and makeup: Celine Nonon at Arlington Artists.Photograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianDon’t underestimate the power of small movements done in pockets of time throughout the day, either: “Whenever you sit down, whether that’s on your sofa, the toilet or at work, do it in slow motion,” advises Vaux. “Then you’re also enjoying the benefits of eccentric movement throughout the day, which can transform your ageing experience.”Arecent studyfound that just five minutes of eccentric exercise (movements that work to lengthen the muscles, such as lowering into a squat or heel drop) a day can improve strength, flexibility and mental health in sedentary adults in just four weeks.Activities such as gardening also count – short, sharp bursts of manual labour are brilliant for our strength at every age.70s: get your resistance bandsIn your 70s, peak fitness is even more about preserving independence than in previous years. Strength training, once again, is the gold standard, says Dr Michael Sagner, director of the European Society of Preventive Medicine. For decades, experts assumed aerobic training was essential to improving health in those over 65, butnew researchproves thatstrength trainingis one of the most effective age-related interventions there is.Working with weights, resistance bands or body weight has been shown to combat age-related frailty, significantly decrease the risk of falls, fractures and disability, stimulate tissue regeneration and improve walking speed, to name just a few. Beyond physical fitness, it also improves our mental agility, boosting “brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which improves memory while combating cognitive decline”, adds Sagner. Try doing a chest pull, biceps curl, leg press and bent-over row with a resistance band (placing a long band underneath a foot, then pulling upwards), and aim for three sessions per week. If you’re using weights, lifting 7-9kg for these is excellent.A good measure of how fit you are right now? Try the 30-second sit-to-stand test. With your arms crossed and held against your chest, sit on a kitchen chair, then stand up and sit down as many times as you can within 30 seconds. You should expect to complete this 14 times if you’re moderately fit.80s: walk unaidedCan you walk unaided for 10 minutes? If the answer is yes then you’re in good form. The one-legged balance test, in which you lift a foot an inch or two off the floor, then keep it there for 10 seconds, is a good test of physical health in your 80s. Whatever level you’re at, try adding some gentle exercises using a resistance band – think seated rows, banded side steps and overhead side bends – alongside some short walks every day.Flexibility and joint mobility is of the utmost importance to prevent falls –which are responsible for approximately two-thirds of all injury-related deathsduring this decade. Try a dedicated low-impact practice, such as yoga or pilates, once or twice weekly to help you maintain independence and confidence in your body’s ability.Explore more on these topicsFitnessHealth & wellbeingInterval trainingRunningAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It invites theatregoers to journey back to 1976 and “plug into the electric atmosphere as one up-and-coming rock band record the album that could propel them to superstardom. Amid a powder keg of drugs, booze and jealousy, songs come together and relationships fall apart.”View image in fullscreenSarah Pidgeon as Diana, Juliana Canfield as Holly and Tom Pecinka as Peter in the Broadway production of Stereophonic.Photograph: Julieta CervantesIf that sounds remarkably similar to the story of how Fleetwood Mac recorded Rumours, then that’s exactly what the album’s producer Ken Caillat thought:he sued the producersfor the play’s similarity to his memoir, settling out of court earlier this year, though Adjmi has always denied his play is purely about Fleetwood Mac, regardless of the many parallels.But Stereophonic is just the tip of the Mac iceberg that has come into view in recent years. Novel readers and TV viewers have enjoyedDaisy Jones and the Six, which also used the Fleetwood Mac template as the basis for its story. Their smooth, adult-oriented rock sound also permeated music throughout the last decade, present in records by artists such as Sharon Van Etten, Julien Baker, the Weather Station and more. If you want a dancier version of the band, you can go to the club night Fleetmac Wood, playing beefed-up remixes.And Mac themselves are as popular as ever: in last week’s album chart, the compilation 50 Years – Don’t Stop sat at No 6 (after 340 weeks on the chart), while Rumours is at No 22 (after 1098 weeks on the chart). Nearly half a century on from Rumours’ release, Fleetwood Mac are still very big business.Partly that’s down to the continued resonance of the story of the album: two couples tearing themselves apart and committing their feelings to tape. (It is perhaps not a coincidence that Abba, another 70s band whose troubled relationships were set to lush pop, are also undimmingly popular.) But it’s also down to the music: Rumours still sounds like a treat when you play it.In a lot of ways it was a band led by women – of course young women are showing up for them“I think Dreams in particular feels very modern sonically,” says Tamara Lindeman, the Canadian musician who records as the Weather Station. “The naked kick/snare/bass line; the way that there almost no instruments inhabiting the mid-range, just a voice; the really tight short reverb; the super short and compressed drums.”“That’s really modern, and sonically resembles a lot of R&B and hip-hop in a way – it’s similar in how that modern music inhabits those frequency ranges. Also I would say Stevie Nicks’ internal sense of rhythm feels so modern – the way she hangs around the beat, often a little behind and kinda swung. It’s not like how other singers of the time sang.”Dreams had a flush of viral fame after being mimed to bycranberry-juice swigging skateboarder Dogg Faceon TikTok in 2020, and those who attended Fleetwood Mac shows during this century have noticed a change in the band’s audience. Twenty years ago, their live crowd had been predominantly ageing couples, but by the time they played what turned out to be their final London shows at Wembley Stadium in 2019, the presence of a great many young women was startling.View image in fullscreenChristine McVie and Stevie Nicks perform at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta Georgia, June 1977.Photograph: Rick Diamond/Getty ImagesFor Lindeman, that development came as no surprise. “Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie both wrote incredible hits. In a lot of ways it was a band led by women – two really powerful voices and writers. For me in particular the songs by Nicks and McVie are the ones that resonate and last – those are the ones you think of when you think of Fleetwood Mac, more than Lindsey Buckingham’s hits. Of course young women are showing up.”Nicks, whose failing relationship with singer/guitarist Buckingham was one of the themes of Rumours, has become a particular hero in recent years. “She does that thing of writing personally and vulnerably about her experiences, but with this strength that comes through anyway – it’s totally vulnerable but she stays tough, like a superhero of the heart,” Lindeman says.Hard rock, ambient weirdness and UFOs: exploring the greatness of early 70s Fleetwood MacRead moreThere are more prosaic reasons for Fleetwood Mac’s continued presence in the culture though, not least the appetite for work they displayed during the first 20 years of this century. While most veteran superstar bands begin to ration their appearances as time passes, Fleetwood Mac stayed on the road for months on end, keeping their name alive. Not for them the handful of stadium shows in major markets: their touring schedules show their willingness to work. Nor did they complicate their message by releasing new music: the focus was always firmly on the past.It has paid off. Now, two and a half years on from the death ofChristine McVieand the final passing of the group (for now: drummer and founder Mick Fleetwood would be open to a new iteration), Fleetwood Mac are the hippest old people in music.Explore more on these topicsFleetwood MacPop and rockBroadwayTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The next casualty? Men’s shorts.In-seams are rising with retailers reporting a surge in interest for short shorts featuring a 5in and even 3in inside leg measurement. Now the trend is having a knock-on effect on swimwear. This week, GQ magazine posed the question: “Are Straight Guys Ready for Speedo Summer?”Google searches for Speedos are up 41% year on year in the UK, while the swim brief category is up 17% globally.The fashion stylist Luke Day, who owns more than 50 pairs of swimming briefs, isn’t surprised. “Shorts have become so short it’s like: what is next? The answer has to be swimwear.”It’s not even June but already a so-called thigh guy summer is well under way in Europe. Earlier this week, the actor Alexander Skarsgård appeared on the British breakfast TV show Lorraine in a pair of checked shorts with a 5in in-seam from the designer S.S. Daley. Curtseying before host Ranvir Singh, Skarsgard said: “I wanted to be sexy today.”Elsewhere, the latest edition of the art and design magazine Cultured, stars the 53-year-old White Lotus star Walton Gogginson its cover, manspreading in a pair of canary yellow Speedos.Some are calling it the Mescal effect. Five years ago, the Irish actor Paul Mescal became a household name after his role in the TV drama series Normal People. But it was a photograph of Mescal wearing a pair of micro shorts, snapped when leaving a supermarket in east London, that really thrust him into the spotlight. Overnight, shorts were shortened.This season’s catwalks were dominated by short shorts with versions appearing at Gucci, Hermès and Dior. Celebrities including Harry Styles, Pharrell Williams, Jeremy Allen White and Donald Glover have all channelled John Travolta in Pulp Fiction with maximum leg-bearing short shorts. Now the trend is going mainstream.On Thursday, Marks & Spencer launched its summer campaign, which positions a pair ofbanana-printed swim shortswith a 3in in-seam as a wardrobe staple. At John Lewis, bestsellers in its short category include 5in in-seams from Under Armour, while it is micro shorts from Paul Smith and Lacoste are trending in swimwear.Day’s preference for short shorts predates Mescal and Gucci by a decade. “As a gay man I feel we are often pioneers of trends. I’ve been wearing short shorts for 10 years. But now straight men are wearing them. They want to show off their thighs.” He credits the boom in popularity to a wider interest in health and wellbeing. “The biggest flex at the moment isn’t a designer item. It is your body. People want to show how hard they have been working out.”Orlebar Brown, a British resort wear brand whose swim shorts have been worn by everyone from Hugh Jackman to David Cameron, offers four different in-seam lengths ranging from 6in that hits just above the knee to 3in that grazes the upper quads. Its chief marketing officer, Trevor Hardy, says the shortest style, called the Springer, is “already becoming more prevalent this year” among its customers. “Men are becoming more adventurous. Even the most non-fashion conscious man is dressing with more confidence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traditional trunks cannot be worn under wetsuits. Briefs and tighter fitting swim shorts also absorb less water making them more suitable for moving between plunge pools. In Australia, yellow and pink styles from AussieBum are a go-to.Speedo’s new Jetstream collection takes inspiration from the 1980s with drawcord briefs measuring 3.5in, compared with the 13.5in fit of its standard training briefs.For first-timers taking the plunge with briefs, Day recommends choosing a thicker fabric and sizing up. “You want a bit of room. It’s not about compression.” But his biggest tip is not to make a big deal about them. “I hate when someone walks out and everyone is like ‘Oh he’s got budgie smugglers on.’ It’s like: what year are we living in?”Explore more on these topicsMen's fashionSwimmingnewsShareReuse this content"

As Désiré Doué glided in on goal, all alone suddenly in a wide open patch of green, he was found by a deliciously weighted through pass from Vitinha.From there Doué allowed the ball to run across him as the retreating Inter defenders closed at his back, a perfect little screenshot of time, space, angles, ground speed allowing him to open his right instep and shoot with the path of the pass, wrong-footing Yann Sommer and easing the ball into the far corner.The celebration, andindeed the game itselfto that point, felt coronational. Doué took off his shirt, saw it placed it on the corner flag and stood in clean-cut gladiatorial pose in front of the Paris supporters, before slightly sheepishly – this is also very Doué-like – going to retrieve his shirt and accept his yellow card.PSG win Champions League for first time with record 5-0 final hammering of InterRead moreBy then the game was gone, as was Doué shortly after, replaced by Bradley Barcola. And really it was his opening 20 minutes that decided thisChampions Leaguefinal.Doué is a very distinct kind of attacking tyro, with a martial artist’s precision in his close-quarter fast-twitch movements, always just enough of a feint and a snap of the heels, always purposeful, never gratuitous. Watching him on nights such as this, it is as though somebody has taken Neymar and boiled him for eight hours until all the waffle and frippery have disappeared, then sent him on to the pitch crisp and starched and purified. This is a Neymar without the madness, the weight, the excess appetite, a post-therapy Neymar.Plus, of course, Doué has that thing all the best players have, the compound eye vision, the ability to freeze, rewind, judge the space and angles around him in the tiniest flicker of everyone else’s analogue time. How do you get like this, aged 19, on this stage, a goal and an assist in the opening 20 minutes of the Champions League final, for a team that have never won it, and who you joined only last summer?Doué has been a late-breaking story this season after his move from Rennes. He didn’t score his first goal at the Parc des Princes until March. He hadn’t scored or assisted in eight games coming into this final. But he is without question the high-ceilinged real deal. Lamine Yamal may be more obviously, cinematically effective. But Doué is at the same level, just more compact and less lavish, the further maths version to Yamal’s bold strokes of fine art.View image in fullscreenDésiré Doué is undoubtedly the real deal for PSG.Photograph: Matthias Schräder/APBy the end here, as another 19-year-old, Senny Mayulu, made it 5-0 against a frazzled Inter, this had become the perfect night for PSG and for the Paris Project, overseen by the unclosing hand of Qatar Sports Investments.First we take the world. Then we take Europe, via Paris, Doha and now Munich. For the state of Qatar and its interests this is football pretty much completed. In the space of three years the world’s most relentlessly efficient gas state’s outreach arm has won a home World Cup, led by its star player, the emir’s tailor’s dummy Lionel Messi, and now the greatest club prize.PSG are currently the best team in the world, treble winners and champions of Europe, the scalps of three recent finalists dangling from their belts on that run. And really this was just too easy most of the time, a flaneuring kind of victory against opponents who were always either chasing, panting for breath or windmilling away just out of reach.Munich had spent Saturday baking in the sun, a city already on its summer holidays, green fringes thronged with picnickers, sunbathers and knots of Italian men sweating across the white heat of the Englische Garten in blue and black nylon shirts.The Allianz Arena is an epic, widescreen kind of stage, those steeply tiered stands curving towards a perfectly puckered oval of powder blue above the lip of the roof. Ten minutes before kick-off it was still hot and heavy, the kind of evening that makes you sweat just sitting still.Linkin Park, who must have a very good agent, put on an agreeably energetic pre-match rap-metal stomp-about. A celebrity violinist performed a hideous screeching Seven Nation Army fiddle-along. The giant Parisian tifo was scrolled away. And from the start this was just pain for Inter, a time to run and harry and chase younger and fresher opponents as the Mendes-Vitinha midfield pivot, PSG’s velcro-touch directors of traffic, just took the ball away.Physical and mental intensity were always going to be key. PSG have been able to replenish the stocks, let the bruises heal, rest their best players. Inter have been all-in, flailing through a series of crunch end-of-season dates, limbs sloshing with lactic acid all the way to the line.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For 12 minutes this was a kind of smothering. After that it became an extended execution, led by Doué. The first goal came from a lovely piece of applied geometry, all clean crisp lines, made first by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia easing inside two defenders. From there the blue shirts completed a high-speed passing triangle, the key ball from Vitinha pinged hard into the feet of Doué, who had found space by not moving, holding his position while Inter’s defenders went to cover. He clipped the ball back for Achraf Hakimi to side-foot into an empty net.The second goal eight minutes later was a break the full length of the pitch, PSG funnelling out from their own corner flag, finding Ousmane Dembélé in space, there to gallop away, all easy grace, head up, before curling a crossfield pass into the run of Doué. He controlled with his torso, then hit down on the ball at the top of its bounce, a deflection taking it past Sommer.Either side PSG were immaculate. This was box-fresh elite club football, possession, counterpress, swift transitions. At times it’s like watching a team of head prefects, a supremely drilled exhibition the Iberian-Catalan Style, with just the right bolt-on parts in every role.‘Always in my heart’: Luis Enrique pays tribute to late daughter after PSG triumphRead moreThis is of course the work ofLuis Enrique, who has won 11 out of 11 finals, and who was up from the start at the edge of his rectangle, all in black with white trainers, lithe and animated, revolving both arms, shuttle running left to right, like a mime artist taking part in a gruelling military fitness drill.It has been said Luis Enrique turned to Paris two years ago after being appalled by the despotic owners of Chelsea and Spurs, which is certainly an interesting take on the extraordinary freedoms inherentin the Qatari propaganda project. But he has been the perfect man at the perfect time, the ideologue, the data-based strongman, here just as the years of celebrity overdose are finally cashed in, brand leveraged, income vast enough to leave PSG with a free hand to build a brilliant, hungry, youthful modern team.The idea has been to create a group of anti-stars. Good luck with that. Doué will now take his place, up there floating in his tin can high above the world, the latest addition to the global A-list. From Paris via Doha, with Catalan style, Asturian brains, past the scars of all those glitzy late stage slumps, PSG now stand at the summit.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainInternazionaleLuis EnriqueanalysisShareReuse this content"

In 2018 Simon Yates was leading the Giro d’Italia by 3min 22sec but became the victim ofChris Froome’s imperious rideon the same slopes. That day, Yates collapsed and ultimately finished 38 minutes behind Froome but on Saturday, seven years later, the rider from Bury would have his redemption by pulling the same trick on Isaac del Toro and Yates will now – barring accidents – win his second Grand Tour on Sunday.This was billed as Del Toro v Richard Carapaz and even pre-stage Yates was playing down his chances, he said those two riders were a “step above”. This was clearly a bluff. Over the last 38.5km of almost entirely uphill racing, Yates overturned his 1min 21sec pre-stage deficit and created an insurmountable time gap of 3min 56sec to Del Toro.What happened in 2018 has clearly stayed with Yates ever since and from the moment the Giro released its route for this year he has been targeting some kind of redemption.Giro d’Italia: battle for overall title in mountains on stage 20 – liveRead more“Once the parcours was released I always had it in the back of my mind that maybe I could come here and close the chapter. Maybe not to take the pink jersey and the race but at least win the stage win or something,” the 32-year-old told TNT Sports after the stage, almost through tears. “To try and show myself, the way I know I can do and to pull it off – I really didn’t believe it. I have to thank the guys, the team. They believed in me and even during the stage they were saying ‘just give it a try’ and I did it in the end.“I’m not really an emotional person but even coming over the finish line I couldn’t hold back the tears. It’s something I’ve worked towards throughout my career, year after year and I’ve had a lot of setbacks. I’ve finally managed to pull it off.”The stage itself was won by Chris Harper of Team Jayco-AlUla, who pulled clear on the Finestre and let all the drama unfold behind him. And it was some drama.What should not be overlooked in this whole piece is the role of Wout van Aert, Yates’s Visma–Lease a Bike teammate, who snuck into a huge breakaway by the virtue of being part of the final 19-man group that chased down the first 12 riders who sped off from Verrès. Yates had a GC lead of 1min 40secs on the road when he found Van Aert on the descent down the Finestre and by the time the Belgian turned off the gas the gap back to Del Toro was almost four minutes.View image in fullscreenA glum Isaac del Toro crosses the line.Photograph: Luca Zennaro/EPAVisma–Lease a Bike have followed a similar tactic of sending a man up the road on almost every stage, but few are as good at this job as Van Aert, who Yates described as crucial in the victory.However, the Briton had done a lot of the hard work himself. Yates was not even part of the original attack on Del Toro at the bottom of the category one climb up the Finestre. EF Education-EasyPost had set up the slingshot for Carapaz to fire off from a crumbling peloton as the gradient reached 14%. Yates responded to successfully bridge the 20-second gap to Carapaz and Del Toro, who looked comfortable on the back of the Ecuadorian’s wheel, to form the group of protagonists who would decide the GC battle.Yates and Carapaz took it in turns to attack Del Toro, but the Mexican seemed less bothered when the Briton would get out of the saddle. Even when Yates made a move that stuck Del Toro seemed more interested in Carapaz than chasing down the man who would go on to steal away the Giro.As Yates increased the time gap on the gravel track up the mountain, Del Toro just followed Carapaz and by the time the man riding in pink realised he might have a problem it was far too late.Questions will have to be answered by UAE Team Emirates XRG as to how they let their rider, who always looked as if he had more in the tank, simply watch Yates ride off with the pink jersey. Apparently Yates was the only man who did not think he could pull off the remarkable turnaround, even as the UAE riders on the road fumed into their radios when it became clear the race was over on the final climb up to Sestriere.“Two hundred metres to go,” said Yates when asked when he believed he could win the Giro. “I was on the radio blabbing, asking for the time gap because I never truly believed until the very last moment.”This is a redemption story for the ages and earns Yates a second Grand Tour win(after his Vuelta a España triumph in 2018)that must elevate him into the upper echelons of British cycling greats. After the processional stage into Rome he will officially become the third Briton to win the Giro in the last decade, after Froome and, two years later, Tao Geoghegan Hart. Few have claimed one of cycling’s big three races in such a remarkable manner and having been the victim of one of those dramas, it is fitting that Yates can now move on from 2018 so definitively.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaSimon YatesCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

From the unparalleled defensive capabilities of the 38-year-old Gaël Monfils, Draper examined the 18-year-old João Fonseca’s nuclear forehand.No matter the challenge or conditions, Draper continues to show his ability to adapt to all obstacles in his path. He eased into the fourth round of theFrench Openfor the first time in his career with an utterly devastating performance, by far his best of the tournament so far, dismantling Fonseca 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.Jannik Sinner eases past Lehecka to stay on track for first French Open titleRead moreDraper was joined in the second week by Cameron Norrie, who continued his impressive resurgence in Paris by outworking Jacob Fearnley 6-3, 7-6 (1), 6-2. It is the first time Norrie has made the second week at Roland Garros, with his reward being a meeting with Novak Djojovic. It means there will be two British men in the fourth round of the French Open for the first time since 1963.Since Fonseca marked his grand slam career with a stellar top-10 victory over Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open in January, the hype surrounding him has been overwhelming, with the Brazilian’s emergence reawakening one of the most passionate tennis fanbases in the world. At Roland Garros, where the legendary Gustavo Kuerten triumphed three times, the Brazilian fans were always going to be at their loudest.“He’s an incredible young player,” said Draper. “So much to come from him. Today it was maybe a bit of inexperience. I don’t think he has played as many grand slams as myself. But he’s got an unbelievably bright future. He will be right at the top of the game. So good luck to him.”View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie has reached the fourth round at Roland Garros for the first time.Photograph: Christian Hartmann/ReutersIn the aftermath of his victory on Thursday night in painfully slow night conditions on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Draper noted that the balls were so heavy it felt like he was playing with depressurised orange balls for children. He was uncomfortable until the end. Despite the humidity, the warmer daytime conditions provided a far more optimal platform for him to show just how effective his game can be on these courts.“My first two rounds, I played at night time,” said Draper. “Playing against Gaël the other night, I didn’t feel like I could hit the ball past him. It was so cold and I couldn’t do much. Whereas here the ball was getting up more, it was so quick, and the faster conditions definitely suit me. Either way, I will be ready for my next round.”As he rolled through the first set, Draper’s forehand was devastating. His brutal weight of shot – the combined force of his extreme top-spin and immense ball speed – and unrelenting depth completely smothered the Brazilian, making Fonseca’s ball-striking look lightweight by comparison. Draper only continued to grow in confidence behind his forehand and by the second set he was striking it with total freedom and changing directions down the line at will. Under constant pressure from Draper’s forehand and unable to break through the Briton’s defence, Fonseca’s forehand error count piled up as he aimed closer and closer to the lines.This was a spectacular, complete performance from an increasingly complete player: Draper also served superbly, maintaining his pressure on Fonseca’s service games by rolling through his own, and he returned with immaculate consistency and depth. As he continued to push Fonseca far behind the baseline with the force of his forehand, he peppered his opponent with a stream of well-timed drop shots. Having arrived in Paris still seeking his first victory at Roland Garros, Draper heads into the second week looking stronger than he has ever been.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a straight-sets win over Federico Agustin Gomez on Thursday, he was similarly too solid for Fearnley, his countryman and fellow alumni of Texas Christian University. Norrie gradually broke Fearnley down with his consistency and discipline in three gruelling sets.“I am happy I played a solid match,” said Norrie. “It was a great atmosphere. I went through about seven shirts in three sets. I was sweating a lot and had to work really hard for that. So, it feels good to get through.”As the battle between Fearnley, the British No 2, and Norrie, the British No 3, unfolded, it soon became soundtracked by loud fireworks from a nearby congregation of PSG football fans before the Champions League final. The Parc des Princes, PSG’s home stadium, sits just 600 metres away from the Roland Garros tournament grounds and it hosted a Champions League viewing party for fans unable to attend the final in Munich. “I think the toughest part was managing the fireworks,” said Norrie. “That was difficult for both of us.”While Draper will next face Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan, Norrie will have to tackle Djokovic in the fourth round. Djokovic’s bid for a record 25th grand slam title gathered pace with a straight-sets win over Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025French OpenJack DraperTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

No, no, not again, all but the most phlegmatic of a raucous crowd must have been thinking, asHarlequinsthreatened to overturn Bristol’s early lead in all-too-familiar style, midway through the second half.Memories ofthat extraordinary semi-finalhere four years ago were at the forefront of everyone’s minds, including, surely, those in blue out there on the greensward, lungs burning, minds twisting. Had they succumbed, the entire Pat Lam project might just have gone up in smoke, so yawning the flaws would have seemed.Cotgreave hat-trick gives Gloucester win over Northampton but no playoff berthRead moreAs it is, players, coaches and staff held their nerve. Only five points ahead with more than 25 minutes remaining, having been 19 ahead midway through the first half,Bristolfinished strongly to claim the fourth playoff spot – and with it a tie at deeply beloved rivals Bath on Friday night. They can move on to that now with confidence and little to lose.“I don’t have to do anything [to motivate them],” said Lam. “The local boys take over and sort it out. We’ve played Bath 14 times since we’ve been back in thePremiershipand won 11. We know how to beat them. But they’ve spent close to £3m more than we have on our squad.”The pressure is off Bristol now, their recent slump with the line in sight averted. But it had been very much on here with the hour approaching. The response this time was decisive.The telling moment was a searching touch-finder from AJ MacGinty, the man-of-the-match and such a vital hand on the tiller for this wild, free-flowing team. His 50-22 just shy of the hour set up the attack from which Bristol replied to Quins’ questions in a way that proved beyond them in 2021. When Santiago Grondona drove over at the second attempt, for Bristol’s sixth try of the day, the visitors, albeit this time playing without the prize on offer the year they wenton to win the title, fell away.Gabriel Ibitoye, once of Quins himself, scored his second a few minutes later, his 13th try of the season, before Benhard Janse van Rensburg crashed over with 10 minutes remaining. In a match that was a microcosm of their season – so rich in tries and flair for the first half, before dwindling alarmingly in the second – Bristol had rightedthemselves to deny Gloucesterand Saracens, who both registered bonus-point wins behind them.View image in fullscreenBenhard Janse van Rensburg celebrates scoring Bristol’s final try.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesWhen Bristol scored their fourth try in the 24th minute, they had their 16th try bonus point of the season, a new record. It is worth thinking about that for a moment. They have scored four tries or more in every match bar two.At times, they have practically defied belief with the outrageousness of their rugby. That24-54 win at Welford Roadjust before Christmas springs to mind. Had they not made the playoffs after that, where would they have gone?Quick GuidePremiership roundup: Leicester at home while Sarries miss outShowLeicestersecured a home semi-final with a 42-20 victory over bottom-placedNewcastleat Welford Road. The Tigers were always expected to secure second spot against opponents with just two league victories all season and ran in six tries to book a date with third-placed Sale next Saturday.The Falcons opened the scoring in the 17th minute through a Brett Connon penalty from in front of the posts but Leicester’s response was swift as they took the lead two minutes later when good hands from Joseph Woodward and Freddie Steward led to the back-rower Hanro Liebenberg stepping inside to score, with Handre Pollard converting. Further tries followed for Josh Bassett, Solomone Kata, Joe Heyes, Matt Rogerson and Ollie Hassell-Collins. Connon landed a second penalty and two conversions after late Falcons tries for Ollie Leatherbarrow and Sammy Arnold.Michael Cheika, the Leicester head coach, said: \"I'm really pleased for the fans, that they get another opportunity to see the team this year, and for the players to have a chance to play in front of their people and their families here next weekend. Obviously, it's a semi-final of the Premiership, it'll be a tough battle and that'll be good.\"Salebooked their place in the playoffs after they were pushed all the way by second-bottomExeterin an enthralling 30-26 contest at Sandy Park.There seemed little doubt over the Sharks’ destiny at half-time – when they led 20-5 - but Chiefs got within four points with just over two minutes left. However, the visitors hung on.Saracensovercame a heavily weakenedBathbut their limp 36-26 victory was not enough to secure a place in the playoffs. Bath had already booked a home semi-final on Friday, enabling them to pick an entirely new matchday 23 to the one that defeated Lyon in the Challenge Cup final last weekend, and they were duly dispatched. But victories for Sale and Bristol meant a top-four finish was out of Saracens’ reach and they finished a disappointing campaign in sixth.Bath's head coach, Johann van Graan, said: \"Bristol are a good side … We played them a few weeks ago in the Principality so I think the beauty of a semi-final is, it doesn't matter what you've done. It doesn't matter what happened before, it's a new venue, new ball, new referee, two totally different teams and it's the knockouts. It's what we've worked the whole season for and we can't wait.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.And again here. As expected, they raced into that early lead. Not quite the 28-0 lead after half an hour they held in 2021, but 26-7 up, bonus point in the bag, within 25 minutes is going some.

Bristol’s lethal wings Ibitoye and Kalaveti Ravouvou combined down the left, paving the way for George Kloska to drive over after barely a minute. Joe Batley followed up a few minutes later in similar style, through a thicket of Quins defenders.The visitors are another team far more comfortable in attack than defence. The electric Cadan Murley scored the first of his two first-half tries, but tries by Ravouvou and Viliame Mata, Fijians more than comfortable with Bristol’s style, maintained the hosts’ dominance for the time being, despite a wonder try by Murley from his own 22. When Ibitoye finished a counterattack from Bristol’s 22 five minutes into the second half, all seemed set fair at 31-12.But then came Quins, without a care in the world. Jamie Benson, confident and clever in Marcus Smith’s boots, had set up Murley’s first, and his break sent Alex Dombrandt away to the line. Three minutes later, with the replacement hooker Nathan Jibulu running amok, Quins scored again through George Hammond. Ashton Gate practically gasped.“When you’ve coached the Bears for eight years, you find yourself in this situation a lot,” said Lam. “The big one is not to panic. No doubt we’re underdogs in everyone’s eyes. We’ll just go to Bath and see what happens.”The answer to that is pretty much anything.Explore more on these topicsPremiershipBristolHarlequinsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Indeed, such has been the dominance and the nonchalance with which he claimed this pole and his wins this season, it was put to him that he was taking on Kimi Räikkönen’s mantle as the Ice Man, albeit in the somewhat less flattering form for the 24-year-old of Ice Boy.Piastri’s pole was imperious at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, beating his teammate Lando Norris into second by a huge two-tenths of a second, the biggest margin of the season, with Red Bull’sMax Verstappenin third, three-tenths down.George Russell was fourth for Mercedes andLewis Hamilton, who has struggled in Spain this weekend, found his pace when it mattered, taking fifth place for Ferrari and hoping to challenge for a podium place.Piastri took the top spot with the same almost preternatural calm that has defined his four wins and three previous poles this season, the Australian repeatedly demonstrating immense calm and control under pressure. He was pushed into a shootout by Norris over their final laps and there was nothing between them, but, whereas the British driver went to the limit and in so doing made two minor errors, Piastri was on rails and his car flowed with insouciant ease around the sweeping high-speed turns.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri’s McLaren was two-tenths of a second faster than his teammate Lando Norris.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesAt its close he was asked if he felt it was fair his nonchalant cool in almost any circumstances justified the new nickname. “I’m not sure I want to go under the name Ice Boy,” he said, with a laugh that was joined heartily by Norris and Verstappen. “Certainly there’s been qualifiers and races where it’s not been nonchalant and there’s been a lot of emotion behind them.“I’m just not a particularly emotional person. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still moments that I am emotional but you know I also know that it’s a nice thing to have, starting on pole. But it’s not the end of the weekend, the points are tomorrow.”It was a fair evaluation, given every point might prove vital as he leads the world championship by only three from Norris. The latter was clearly disappointed and he held his hands up for his errors but the gap was an ominous chasm between teammates in identical machinery.That machinery has very much been under the spotlight all weekend. Yet for all that the question of whether the FIA’s clampdown with a new technical directive on the flexing of front wings had dominated the buildup to this meeting and the potential for the pecking order to be reset, it was very much business as usual in Barcelona. It is a circuit that perhaps better than any other demonstrates which team has the best aerodynamic package.McLaren have always insisted they were gaining no advantage and the running in Spain suggests they were spot-on. “It clearly slowedMcLarendown a lot,” was the caustically sarcastic assessment of Mercedes’s George Russell after practice.It was the almost resigned evaluation of a driver who knows that short of some form of miraculous development, itself a vanishingly slight chance given all the resources are already pointed at the 2026 cars and the new regulations, McLaren will not be stopped.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton will start from fifth on the grid.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesPerhaps the only question that remains will be if the change affects the McLaren’s ability to be so easy on its tyres, which will be evident in the race, but nothing indicates there will be any material effect on this either, as the team principal, Andrea Stella, indicated.“The technical directive [TD] was a big talking point, [but] quite immaterial, I would say,” he said. “Formula One is numbers, is technical. When you look at the numbers associated with the TD it was always going to be minor. It entertained to have this kind of debate but in our numbers, in our simulation, everything was very small, we weren’t concerned.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If, as it appears, the championship is between the pair, then Norris must find a way to match his teammate’s icy precision.Several hours after qualifying concluded, the Aston Martin team issued a statement announcing that Lance Stroll, who qualified in 14th, would not take part in the race.

Most have discarded their losing medals by the time the pyrotechnics go off and Marquinhos raises the European Cup into the muggy Munich night. There is a watery smattering of applause. Then, with a turn of pace so sadly lacking during the game itself, they turn and head for the tunnel, past a battalion of photographers whose lenses are facing in the opposite direction.What does it feel like tolose a Champions League final 5-0?Right now, and possibly for many years to come, this Inter team will be the only ones who know. Many of their fans were weeping uncontrollably in the stands, in the concourses, all along the road that leads back to the Métro station. For the 22 players and thousands of supporters who crossed the Alps so full of dreams, this is the sort of sporting trauma that defines generations.PSG win Champions League for first time with record 5-0 final hammering of InterRead moreIt will not matter now, or ever, that this team have reached two finals in three seasons and lost them both to state-owned investment funds. There can be pride in the journey, but the greatest Inter sides were never satisfied with a journey, least of all a journey that now feels like a cruel trick of the light. What happened here was nothing less than a humiliation, a playground hazing on the biggest stage, and there is frankly no way of saying how any human, let alone any team, really gets over that.Inter will make you sweat and suffer. Inter will run you down. Inter will fight and scrap for every last inch of turf. Inter will defend their penalty area with blood. Inter’s last three games in this competition: 3-3, 4-3, 0-5. The age and weariness of this squad we knew about. The sense in recent weeks of a team coming apart at the edges, this we knew too. But rarely have any club, in a match of this magnitude, found their veryideaso violently shattered. Inter did not just lose a final here; they lost a piece of themselves.And so we finally discovered the limits of old-school grit and guts against a kind of footballing superintelligence, simply a more highly evolved form of the game.Paris Saint-Germaindid not simply attack more inventively and defend more intelligently; they won all the bits in between. The tactical fouling (13 fouls to seven despite dominating possession). The shithousery. They won the contact and the second balls. In a way this was a kind of machine warfare, total football in its most literal sense, against which Francesco Acerbi’s lucky white boots – with a hole in the big toe – proved desperately inadequate.The plan, such as it existed, was to cut off the supply to Ousmane Dembélé whenever he dropped deep. So Dembélé simply stopped dropping deep. Instead he peeled wide, into the spaces behind the wingbacks, decoy runners darting and shifting around him, a team defined less by technical skill than a kind of tactical fission. Barcelona, whomInter beat in the semi-final, will keep doing the same things again and again. Paris will do something new with every attack, will try every key on the ring until it locates the one that will dismantle you.View image in fullscreenSimone Inzaghi may now head for Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesIn possession, Inter were simply devoured. The back three were sadistically hunted, the midfield had too much ground to cover and, with Inter having two underemployed strikers up the pitch, PSG always had numbers over. Their first goal came from the right-back Achraf Hakimi tapping the ball into an empty net from six yards. Already you could see Inter’s players shooting each other puzzled looks. Hang on. If their right-back has a tap-in from six yards, then what exactly is the point of us?Perhaps Inter’s only hope was to sit in, to soak up pressure, to keep the score down for as long as possible. Instead they kept getting caught on the counter, a recurring waking nightmare in which Désiré Doué kept running clear on goal. Later Bradley Barcola came on and basically ended Acerbi’s career, a sensational piece of skill that sent him wriggling and sprawling across the turf like a giant woodlouse turned over on to its back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Inter, the end of the road, and in more ways than one. Simone Inzaghi said he would consider his future after this game, but what future does this team really have? Acerbi is 37, Yann Sommer and Henrikh Mkhitaryan 36. Even their “young” players – Alessandro Bastoni, Marcus Thuram – aren’t actually that young. Sooner, and not later, a new side will have to be assembled on the bones and ashes of this.The rebuild will be long, painful and fitful. The investment fund owner, Oaktree Capital, is operating a trimmer, more sustainable youth-focused model. Inzaghi may well end up in Saudi Arabia before long. Inter are now a small fish, feeding in a pond of nation states and super-marques. And now they will have to reinvent themselves in the shadow of one of their greatest humiliations. If ever a night encapsulated their new, smaller place in the world, it was this.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainInternazionaleanalysisShareReuse this content"

Due to an unique registration period for the expanded Club World Cup, the window will open on Sunday 1 June until Tuesday 10 June before closing for a few days. It will then reopen on Monday 16 June until Monday 1 September. Here are a selection of players who could be on the move.Joan García (Espanyol)It’s been another spectacular season for García, who was part of Spain’s squad thatwon the gold medalat last summer’s Olympics. In March, he became the first player to win La Liga’s award for save of the month twice in a row and that has only added to his long list of admirers – especially given the 24-year-old has a €25m (£21m) release clause. Arsenal were thought to be leading the race even if García would be expected to be an understudy to David Raya, with Barcelona, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Inter among those hoping to persuade him otherwise.Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace)The England international has only 12 months left on the contract he signed when he joinedCrystal Palacefrom Chelsea in 2021 and is widely expected to leave Selhurst Park this summer. The big question is where he will end up after seeing four massive bids from Newcastle rejected last year and another worth up to £70m from Tottenham in January. Liverpool have also been strongly linked amid uncertainty over Ibrahima Konaté’s future, while Chelsea are thought to be considering an attempt to bring Guéhi back to Stamford Bridge. There were reports that the 24-year-old is considering running down his contract at Selhurst Park after leading them to the FA Cup but can Palace afford to turn down big money again?View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi is thought to be coveted by his former club Chelsea.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianJobe Bellingham (Sunderland)With playoff hero Tommy Watson’s departure to Brighton already signed and sealed, the Black Cats could be facing the prospect of losing one of their other talented teenagers in the coming weeks. Bellingham was in Germany this week to hold talks withEintracht Frankfurt– who have qualified for next season’s Champions League – and is also being courted by his older brother Jude’s former employers, Borussia Dortmund, as well as RB Leipzig. Sunderland are understood to be determined to keep Bellingham and are likely to demand more than €30m (£25m), with his former club Birmingham also due a sell-on fee.Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal target Liverpool duo Luis Díaz and Darwin NúñezRead moreHugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)A hat-trick for France’s Under 21s against England in March and the goal he scored against Tottenham in the Europa League underlined the former Paris St-Germain striker’s potential. Ekitike stepped up for Eintracht Frankfurt when Omar Marmoush joined Manchester City in January, ending the season with 22 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions. But a reported asking price north of £80m for the 22-year-old who started his career at Reims might prove too high for most potential suitors, who are thought to include Chelsea, Liverpool andManchester United.Jonathan David (Lille)His future has been a regular source of speculation over the past few windows and the Canada striker has already confirmed he will finally leaveLillethis summer when his contract expires. Newly crowned Italian champions Napoli appear to be in pole position to sign David having held several rounds of talks with his representatives, although Aston Villa, Tottenham, West Ham and Juventus are also thought to have shown interest. The 25-year-old has previously made no secret of his desire to play in the Premier League.View image in fullscreenLille’s Jonathan David’s contract expires and Napoli appear to be in pole position to become his new club.Photograph: Stéphanie Lecocq/ReutersAlejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)It’s unlikely that the latest academy graduate who could be shown the door at Old Trafford will be short of offers. After being left out of Manchester United’s matchday squad against Aston Villa on the final day by Ruben Amorim, Garnacho’s potential availability has alerted several clubs looking for a potential bargain. The Argentina forward is expected to cost around £40m if United allow him to leave, with Napoli – who tried to sign him in January – thought to be the early frontrunners. Chelsea have also been monitoring his situation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mbeumo still has a year of his contract remaining plus an option to extend it by 12 months, even if manager Thomas Frank admitted after their win over Leicester that “we are a selling club so if someone comes in with the right price …”. That is probably in the region of £60m, with Manchester United and Newcastle thought to be his most likely destination. Yoane Wissa – who just missed out on matching Mbeumo as they would have become the first duo to score 20 goals for the same club in a single season since Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané in 2018-19 – is also expected to attract interest.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Bryan Mbeumo can leave Brentford this summer for a fee in the region of £60m.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPABenjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)“I want to play for a club that suits me and brings out the best in me,” said the Slovenia striker this week. Whether that is finally Arsenal three years after Sesko first appeared on Mikel Arteta’s radar when he was starring for Red Bull Salzburg as a teenager will be answered soon enough. The 21-year-old only managed 13 goals – one down on last year – asRB Leipzigstruggled in the Bundesliga but fits the profile required at the Emirates given Arsenal’s need for more firepower. Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres is also on Arteta’s shortlist, while Chelsea have previously shown an interest in Sesko and could try to get involved if they miss out on other targets.Rayan Cherki (Lyon)Once seen as the bad boy of French football, some impressively mature performances forLyonthis season earned him a first senior call-up from Didier Deschamps and have also caught the attention of a certain Pep Guardiola. Manchester City are thought to have registered their interest in the 22-year-old as a potential replacement for Kevin De Bruyne, with Cherki available for just €30m (£22m). Morgan Gibbs-White of Nottingham Forest would be a much more expensive alternative and with Cherki understood to prefer to join a team playing in the Champions League, that could rule out a move to the red half of Manchester.Nico Williams (Athletic Bilbao)At one time he was in the shadow of his elder brother, Iñaki Williams, but it is the 22-year-old winger who is now the wanted man, Williams Sr having stayed in the Basque Country past his 30th birthday. While the elder brother now players for Ghana after gaining a single Spain cap almost a decade ago, Nico is familiar to English audiences as scorer of the first goal in the Euro 2024 final, in which he was named man of the match. That success came three months after he helpedAthletic Bilbaowin their first Copa del Rey. As the summer window approaches he has been linked with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Arsenal and Chelsea, among others, and has two more seasons on his contract with a release clause of €58m (£49m).Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowEspanyolCrystal PalaceSunderlandEintracht FrankfurtLilleManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The supremely talented Hannah Hampton had slowly moved into pole position for the starting spot in Switzerland, with Sarina Wiegman having said the Chelsea keeper was a little ahead of Earps, the Euro 2022 and 2023 World Cup No 1. Hampton has performed well when given the chance to start, but how she will cope with the pressure of being first choice long-term? Portugal were perfect opponents to ease her way in, England’s utter domination in the 6-0 win leaving her very little to do. Spain will offer a far greater test on Tuesday but Hampton, whose distribution is superior, was preferred to Earpsagainst the world champions in February.Returning heroes show their worthThe sight of Lauren Hemp in the starting XI against Portugal was welcome. As was that of Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway, who were on the bench, coming on. All three have been battling to be fit for the Euros and they showed what England have been missing this year. Hemp was electric on the left and her teammate Grace Clinton said: “Out of possession, in possession, she’s an unbelievable player. She’s got one-v-one, she’s got dribbling, she’s got pace with her runs in behind, she’s got everything.” Wiegman said: “It’s really nice to see them back. They have worked so hard to get to where they are … if you haven’t put all the work into getting to this point then you cannot put in the performance they showed tonight.”Wiegman shows her ruthless streakWiegman is a winner and she wanted a big victory against Portugal, a team England have struggled against havingdrawn 1-1 in the reverse fixturein February and been held toa 0-0 draw in a friendlyon the eve of the 2023 World Cup. Aggie Beever-Jones said: “As cliched as it sounds, Sarina said: ‘It’s a new kit, new England today. Go out there and put a graft in.’ I think her words were ‘destroy them’, in her Dutch accent.” That edge and hunger to win aren’t always positive, Wiegman’s reaction to Earps’s retirement reportedly having been a very angry one, but when it comes to putting together winning formulas on the pitch there are few better managers.Steps forward up frontEngland have had limited attacking options since Euro 2022, withBeth Mead injuring an anterior cruciate ligamentand Lauren James more recently having hamstring problems, while Chloe Kellywas frozen out at Manchester Cityin the first half of this season. However, things seem to be coming together at the right time: Mead is looking closer to her best, she and Kelly – after a loan move – areChampions League winnerswith Arsenal and Hemp is well and truly back. Throw in the youngsters Beever-Jones, who scored a hat-trick against Portugal, andMichelle Agyemang, who scored 41 seconds into her debutagainst Belgium last month, and the forward choices look strong. “We have so many options,” said Wiegman. “What we also hope for is LJ [Lauren James] coming back too. She’s still in rehab and doing good.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Roberts, a grandmother of five, tends not to take note of such things.When she does go for a run – an occurrence of surprising infrequency – she prefers to be guided by feel; distances and times forgotten upon return to her front door. The fastest 75-year-old woman in history – a multiple world champion and world-record holder – possesses no training logbook, no coach and, most intriguingly, almost zero running pedigree for most of her life.Asked by the hastily stretching Guardian journalist – foolishly attempting to keep pace for a few miles – how she is capable of launching straight into a run without any semblance of a warm-up, she reveals she only stretches before races “so that I don’t look unprofessional”. Her Great Britain Masters singlet reveals taut muscles and supple limbs that would never have been employed for their current purpose were it not for a holiday to South Africa eight years ago.0:48World's fastest 75-year-old woman: 'Never think that you're too old' – videoTrips there had been a frequent occurrence long before a Cape Town-based friend asked whether Roberts and her husband George would like to join their regular Saturday morning parkrun – the wonderful innovation that welcomes all comers to undertake 5km at whatever pace they choose. Sheltered under trees at the foot of Table Mountain, they savoured this one at no more than a pleasurable amble.The following week they went again, only this time Roberts ran small segments. On their return to their Hertfordshire home, the couple decided to sign up to their local parkrun. For three years, almost every Saturday morning involved a 5km run, with Roberts converting from running novice to regular attendee, whittling her time down from just shy of 30 minutes to less than 23. Just a few weeks off her 70th birthday, she then took a plunge by joining her local athletics club, Dacorum, and signing up for an 800m race at the end of the summer.“I was discovering I was really quite good,” she explains after our canal run, while sitting in front of an antique mantel clock in a living room adorned with furnishings from decades gone by.“That made me think I ought to see whether I could do other things, so I put myself in for an 800. I’d never even been on a track before.

These girls just shot off in the distance looking like gazelles and I ran round. I was way last and didn’t know what time I’d done, but someone told me it was rather good for my age.”The Covid pandemic dashed almost all running opportunities over the next two years, aside from irregular parkruns when permitted. So, it was not until early 2022 that she was able to contest another 800m, unexpectedly taking the scalp of a multiple global age-group champion in the process. “Nobody had heard of me or expected me to do anything,” says Roberts.By 2023, she was a double British champion in the 70-74 age group. The following year she won three world titles over 800m, 1500m and 5,000m, before adding four more indoor golds this March.Quick GuideSarah Roberts’ 75+ world recordsShow800m outdoor:2min 58.12sec800m indoor:2.57.321,500m outdoor:6.06.201,500m indoor:5.58.15Mile outdoor:6.40.323,000m indoor:12.28.825,000m outdoor:22.40.155km road:21.3310,000m outdoor:45.59.8110km road:44.33Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since her birthday last October, she has swept the board of 75+ world records over every track distance from 800m to 10,000m indoors and outdoors, as well as 5km and 10km on the road. Last weekend, she added mile and 10,000m world records to her bulging haul despite less than 90 minutes between races. It is a staggering array of accolades for someone whose running experience never previously extended beyond chasing primary school friends around the playground.Upstairs in their smart detached home, off a hallway lined with photos of their children and grandchildren, sits a room that used to function as an office but is now primarily occupied with Roberts’ late-blooming running career. Surrounded by cardboard boxes marked with such mundanities as “sewing”, “Scrabble” and “wrapping paper” lie an assortment of athletics paraphernalia, from certificates to printed race results, and photo albums to a frankly overwhelming number of medals.How much does running now occupy Roberts’ life, I wonder? “Only 95%,” says George, joking, who happily travels around the country and abroad to watch his wife of almost 54 years race.By this point, there is an obvious question that needs answering. How on earth does a woman who had never run until she was 67 become the fastest of all time?Despite not taking part in any organised sport beyond the briefest of social netball stints many decades ago, Roberts has always been a keen gym goer. Initially just the odd circuit class here and there during her days working as a solicitor and raising two children; latterly, post-retirement, every day and all conceivable options, from boxing to Zumba, and yoga to legs, bums and tums.View image in fullscreenShow us your medals: Sarah’s collectionPhotograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianA few years ago, when her gym held a contest to see who could hold the longest plank, Roberts, then just shy of her 70th birthday, tapped out victorious after 10 minutes and 15 seconds. Only boredom, and a lack of genuine challengers, made her stop.Recently, while hoovering up world titles in Florida, she was approached by researchers who asked to conduct some tests on her. They found her resting heart rate drops as low as 38 beats per minute and her VO2 max, which measures the body’s ability to use oxygen during exercise, is 54 – both comparable to an elite athlete generations younger. She awaits full MRI results, but the radiographer who conducted the scans was instantly stunned by the lack of fat running through her legs.“I feel fitter than I’ve ever felt before, which is fantastic,” she says. “You don’t expect to feel that when you’re 75.”View image in fullscreenSarah Roberts on the canal near her home in King’s Langley.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianHer formal running training remains minimal. Other than a track session on Mondays and intervals on Tuesdays, her only other regular outing is the trusty Saturday morning parkrun. The remainder of her fitness is cultivated through those daily gym visits. Remarkably, given her advancing years, she is only getting quicker, so far improving her best times every summer since starting to compete. “Whatever I’m doing seems to be working,” she says, smiling.Having braved that initial 800m race at an age when most would never consider it, she hopes her story may inspire others. What unknown talents lie dormant, just waiting for a chance to emerge?“I’d like people to think that they should always try something,” she says. “You never know what you can do until you try it. Never think you’re too old. Give it a go. You will surprise yourself at what you can do if you really try to do something.”Earlier, as we left the towpath and wound our way through the village towards home – one of us sweating considerably more than the other twice his age – two scenarios sprang to mind. One was the thought of what she might achieve with the aid of a properly conceived full-time running regime – a suggestion that Roberts gives short shrift, fully content as she is, with sufficient honours to validate her current approach.The other was what might have been. Given her apparent physiological advantages – and notwithstanding the paucity of middle and long-distance events open to women until the latter decades of the 20th century – does she wonder what she could have accomplished if made aware of her running prowess at a younger age?“No, I don’t,” she says. “I’m just very grateful that I’ve discovered it now. I’ve had a good life and enjoyed whatever I’ve done in the past. I don’t go into what-ifs because all the other factors would have been different anyway. But I’m very happy for the current situation.“I’m just amazed really. I could always run for a bus, but I never thought I would ever be anywhere near the best in the world. It never would have crossed my mind.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This time the issue isautomated license plate readers (ALPRs), which capture (no prizes for guessing!) license plate data and allow law enforcement to build a picture of where a particular vehicle has been. There’s no opting out of being tracked: if you drive, you should simply assume that these cameras, which are sometimes hidden in objects such as traffic cones, are logging your movements. And you should assume that this license plate data can be combined with other surveillance data to paint a very detailed picture of your life. Privacy only exists for ourbillionaire overlordsthese days. The rest of us are just data points.There are obviously plenty of legitimate uses to ALPRs. Their proponents will wax lyrical about how they can help solve carjackings and kidnappings. But, like all technology, they are ripe for abuse. They are particularly ripe for abuse in an increasingly authoritarian US, full of lawmakers who want to control women’s bodies.Back in 2022, a few months after Roe v Wade was overturned, the Guardian published a piece on ALPRs warning that “an expanding web of license plate readers could be ‘weaponized’ against abortion”. It focused on a company called Flock, one of the big players in this space, which promises a “holistic solution to crime”.Flock’s technology could be used to “criminalize people seeking reproductive health and further erode people’s ability to move about their daily lives free from being tracked and traced”, one expert told the Guardian at the time. Another civil rights expert warned that Flock, which has stated that it is happy to provide technology to help enact whatever laws have been passed, “illustrates how surveillance isn’t actually about benefiting society or protecting people – it’s about enforcing the political goals of those in power”.Unfortunately, all these experts have been proved right. This week 404 Media reported that a Texas police officer used Flock toperform a nationwide searchof more than 83,000 ALPR cameras while looking for a woman who had had an abortion. Abortion is almost entirely illegal in Texas but law enforcement reportedly looked at cameras in states such as Washington and Illinois, where abortion is legal.Anti-abortion voices love to argue that they’re not trying to control women, they’re trying toprotectwomen. Funnily enough this same talking point came up in this case. Sheriff Adam King of Johnson county,Texas, told 404 Media that the woman had self-administered the abortion “and her family was worried that she was going to bleed to death, and we were trying to find her to get her to a hospital.” He added: “We weren’t trying to block her from leaving the state or whatever to get an abortion. It was about her safety.”Perhaps this was true in this case. Many of the details are still unclear so it’s hard to tell. But even if this was purely benevolent surveillance, you can certainly see where all this is headed. “This incident is undeniably a harbinger of more AI-enabled reproductive surveillance and investigations to come,” Ashley Emery, a senior policy analyst in reproductive health and rights at the National Partnership forWomen& Families, told 404 Media. “Especially for women of color who are already over-surveilled and over-policed, the stakes couldn’t be higher.”“Texas is the land of freedom,”Governor Greg Abbottrecently proclaimed. If you’re a woman in Texas, however, “freedom” seems to have quite a strange definition. Not only are you not allowed freedom over your reproductive decisions, a number of Texas city councils (some of which are composedentirely of male lawmakers) have been trying topass travel bansthat would stop Texans from driving to abortion appointments in other states. Abortion bans, attemptedtravel bans, and a network of surveillance technology that can be used to enforce these bans: this is what “freedom” for women in Texas looks like.Sexual exploitation and domestic violence soared after Hawaii wildfireIn the weeks and months after the 2023 Lahaina fire, “one in six female fire survivors surveyed felt forced to engage in sexual acts in exchange for basic necessities such as food, clothing and housing”,reports Nina Lakhani.Women and girls in Sudan’s Darfur region are at near-constant risk of sexual violence“Sexual violence has become so widespread in Darfur that many people chillingly speak about it as unavoidable,” Médecins Sans Frontières statesin a horrifying updateon the crisis.Saudi Arabia’s secretive rehabilitation ‘prisons’ for disobedient women“While Saudi Arabia celebrates beingawarded the Fifa men’s World Cupand meticulously promotes itself on the global stage as reformed, women who have dared to publicly call for more rights and freedoms have faced house arrest, jail and exile,”the Guardian reports.

His instincts about Black Americans are clearSat 31 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 16.54 EDTShareThis week,Donald Trumpissued two dozen presidentialpardonsto a motley crew of wrongdoers, including shady politicians, fraudulent CEOs and other wealthy ne’er-do-wells. On that list were the Louisiana rapper NBA YoungBoy (whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden) and the Chicago gangsterLarry Hoover.Regardless of where you stand on American carceral culture and what we know about the ways the criminal justice system squashes Black people who have the misfortune of interacting with it, Trump handing out pardons to Hoover and Gaulden isn’t the magnanimous or justice-focused move he wants us to believe it is. Instead, it’s a clear effort to garner support from the Black community by way of its big names.Gaulden, for his part, was convicted on gun-related charges and sentenced to just under two years in prison. He hadalreadybeen released and this pardon just means he won’t have to follow through with his probation conditions.We demanded justice after George Floyd’s death. Donald Trump made things worse, but we fight on | Al SharptonRead moreFor Hoover, Trump granted a commutation of his federal prison sentence; the former Gangster Disciples leader was serving six life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, drug and other criminal charges. Still, the 74-year-old won’t be coming home (he’s still on the hook for murder in the state of Illinois, a conviction that came with a hefty 200-year jail term).So why is Trump pardoning exactly the kind of people – a gangster and a rapper – whom he despises, and whom he would typically disparage and cast as a danger to American society?The answer is obvious if you’ve been paying attention: he’s done it before – and it seems to have worked.A couple of reasons are often given forTrump’s apparent increase in supportfrom Black voters.Some voters believedTrump’s claims that Black Americans saw an economic boostunder his first presidency, and that he achievedrecord low unemployment– which isn’t thefull story. This is not to mention the fact that Black voters have also become increasingly disillusioned with the Democratic party. Still, one has to wonder just how many of the Black voters who switched sides were won over by disingenuous moves like Trump’s pardons.Probably the most damning indication of the way Trump views Black Americans – and the instincts that drive his political decisions – are his comments about Black people who have experienced the criminal justice system.At a gala in South Carolina in 2024, Trump said he wasgettingmore Black support thanks to his criminal cases, because Black people, like him, have been historically mistreated by the criminal justice system.“And then I got indicted a second time and a third time and a fourth time. And a lot of people said that that’s why the Black people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against,” he said. “They actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against.”Trump’s “aren’t-we-all-just-criminals-at-the-end-of-the-day?” schtick appeals to the kind of famous, moneyed Black people who want to ingratiate themselves with whoever holds power, regardless of who they sell out or what kind of political nightmare they help unleash on the rest of the country. Just look at how many Black male celebritiesshowed upto his 2025 inauguration; from the rappers Snoop Dogg andNelly, to newer faces in the industry such as Fivio Foreign andKodak Black; the latter of whom, mind you, was also granted a presidentialpardonat the end of Trump’s first term. The Trump show is full of these sorts of favors, but is led by a slimy businessman who always comes to collect – with interest.Black folks are disgusted with Trump. This is a fact. But if you thoughtallBlack people would see or acknowledge this for the twisted, insulting, racist grift that it is, think again.Even after the South Carolina gala comments, Trump still managed to secure major cosigns from Black celebrities such as Kodak Black,Kanye West,50 CentandLil Wayne.And he’s doing it again – handing out pardons like Oprah Winfrey giving away cars to her audience.“I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building – as a man, as a father, and as an artist,” Gaulden said in a statement this week after news of his pardon broke. Meanwhile,commentson the news ranged from pleasant surprise, to calls for Trump tofreeother famous people, to wholeheartedsupportof his use of power.We’re minimizing the horror of Trump’s military birthday parade | Judith LevineRead moreSet aside the countless far more worthy cases that Trump could have applied his pardons to. Moves like this are a slap in the face considering everything that Black Americans have specifically said that they need from him, and the ways he and his administration havedirectlymade life harder for them.Black men are the country’s mostunemployeddemographic; Black womencontinueto die with shocking regularity during childbirth, and police continue to harass and abuse innocent Black people simply for existing.The fact that granting a bunch of useless pardons felt like a worthy diversion tells me two things; one, that Trump thinks Black people are stupid or disempowered enough to be distracted by this kind of meaningless breadcrumbing, and two, that the only way he thinks he can relate to Black people is through the lens of criminality and being “wrongfully” persecuted. Either way, these pardons have proven to be a means to an end for Trump – an end where he always comes out on top.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnist.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS justice systemRaceBlack US cultureCelebritycommentShareReuse this content"

What it needs is more money, and lots of it.In particular, the war-torn nation should be handedthe €300bn (£250bn) of frozen Russian assetsstored mostly in accounts hosted by the Euroclear trading system.The Belgian government could confiscate the funds with the support of the EU Commission, or set up a way to use the Russian funds as collateral for a gigantic loan to Ukraine.Either way, Moscow has forfeited its right to the money, which is mostly central bank funds that were left behind after Putin gave the order to invade.As a statement of intent, confiscating the funds would be shock to Putin, hurt his pride and undermine support at home for the war.It would give Ukraine a much needed psychological boost after months of backpedalling through the Donbas while Russian forces exploit the dithering and equivocation in Washington.Donald Trump, who viewsEuropeas weak and indecisive, would be left reeling by such a forceful act, which many have demanded since the start of the war and has gained traction in recent weeks as the bombardment of Ukraine has intensified.A short walk from the EU commission buildings, Euroclear’s HQ is one of the largest hosts to international financial transactions in the world. Understandably, it is keen to hang on to its reputation as a cast-iron guarantor of secure trading to the world’s biggest investors.In this role, the company has warned that a confiscation of the €183bn lodged in its systems would undermine Europe’s role as a safe haven in the eyes of investors from South America to the Indian subcontinent.It has the backing of the French and Belgian governments, which are shareholders in the organisation.Recently another reason for keeping the money frozen and unused has come to the fore. Trump’s tariff war and tax-giveaway budget has undermined the US as the home of free-market capitalism, offering the EU a chance to grab a bigger slice of the financial trading action.One analyst said: “Europe needs to move quickly to take advantage of growing disillusionment in the US economy”.Yannis Stournaras, governor of the Bank of Greece, was another to argue that the prize would be toppling the dollar as the premier reserve currency andinserting the euro in its place.A decade ago, many considered the euro a currency with only a limited lifespan before a north/south split – pitching profligate Greece, Italy and Spain against austere Germany, the Netherlands and Austria – tore the single currency apart.Today the euro is seen as a stable currency while the dollar comes under daily attack. Now is the time to show Europe is the safest of havens in contrast to Trump’s America.There are mutterings in Brussels that to grab this opportunity also means rejecting attempts to confiscate Russia’s frozen billions. How would it look, they ask, if the EU invited more investment in the bloc via jointly issued “stability” bonds, when in the same breath it announced the confiscation of investor funds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s true that a few autocratic despots around the world might withdraw their funds from European trading centres if Russia’s money is taken away, fearing the same would happen to them, but EU banks should not be looking after their money anyway.And the Russia situation is extreme and cannot be thought of as the thin end of any wedge, or a slippery slope.Belgium and the EU have budged a little. The interest generated by Russia’s frozen assets is given to Ukraine, andBelgiumhands its shareholder dividend payments to the Volodymyr Zelenskyy war effort.And earlier this month Euroclear said it plans to seize and redistribute about €3bn of Russia’s funds after Moscow last year grabbed investor cash of the same value. However, the motive was just to compensate investors who were foolish enough to leave their financial assets inside a country that has been explicitly threatening war since the 2014 invasion of Crimea.Such manoeuvring only emphasises how Ukraine needs all the money now, as a show of force and as an expression of unity as much for what it could buy.It matters because, as military chiefs discussed last week in a conference held by the UK’s Royal United Services Institute, Putin has the capacity to invade other parts of Europe within months of success in Ukraine. And Nato is under-prepared.There is broader agreement across Europe as each week passes that Putin needs to be stopped. Military spending is the focus, and governments are promising to ramp up their commitments.Not by €300bn though, which is why the funds in Euroclear and other EU-based financial custodians must be seized. Even Rishi Sunak,writing in the Economistearlier this year, says he agrees that Russia has kissed goodbye to any rights over the funds. We just need chancellor Merz, president Macron and Keir Starmer to say the same.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeEuroEuropean UnionEconomicsBankingcommentShareReuse this content"

However, arecent study suggeststhe figure could be hundreds of millions or even billions higher. This news might sound terrifying, but it is important to remember that anxieties about overpopulation are rarely just about the numbers. They reflect power struggles over which lives matter, who is a burden or a threat and ultimately what the future should look like.The world’s population reached 1 billion just after the turn of the 19th century. The number of people on the planet then began to grow exponentially, doubling to 2 billion by about 1925 and again to 4 billion about 50 years later. On 15November 2022, the UN announced thebirth of the eight billionth human.As it is not possible to count every single person in the world, the UN’s population figures are calculated by dividing the Earth’s surface into a grid and using census data to estimate how many people live in each square. This method provides a rough estimate, but until now it was thought to be reasonably reliable.A recent study by Dr Josias Láng-Ritter and his colleagues at Aalto University in Finland discovered that UN estimates undercount the number of people living in rural areas by more than 50%. This is because census data in the global south is often incomplete or unreliable outside big cities. Consequently, UN figures probably underestimate the world population by hundreds of millions or several billion.Many people argue that our planet does not have the resources to support 8 billion people. “Overpopulation” is seen as the root cause of many of the world’s biggest problems. But these concerns are nothing new.In 1988,the US sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov used what he referred to as “my bathroom metaphor” to illustrate his fears about population growth. “If two people live in an apartment, and there are two bathrooms, then both have what I call freedom of the bathroom.” But if 20 people live in the same apartment, they will impinge on each other’s liberty one way or another.According to Asimov, rapid population growth creates a similar problem. It not only places enormous pressure on natural resources, but also erodes autonomy, dignity and civility. “As you put more and more people on to the world, the value of life not only declines, it disappears.”At the turn of the 19th century, when there were fewer than a billion inhabitants on Earth, Thomas Malthus was already convinced that “the period when the number of men surpass their means of subsistence has long since arrived”. Malthus’s inability to predict that technology would revolutionise food production did not dent his popularity. On the contrary, as the world population grew, the prophets of doom grew ever louder.Neo-Malthusian anxieties reached fever pitch with Paul and Anne Ehrlich’s ThePopulationBomb – subtitled Population Control or Race to Oblivion (1968). This hugely influential, bestselling book warned: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death.”These devastating predictions encouraged governments and international agencies to take drastic action. As fertility rates were already falling in most high-income countries, these efforts concentrated on Africa and even more so Asia. USAID funded family planning programmes across what was then referred to as the developing world. Millions of Indian men were sterilised duringthe Emergencyof the mid-1970s. In 1979, the Chinese Communist party introduced the one-child policy and a few years later launched a mass sterilisation campaign, which focused mainly on women.Today, plenty of people remain concerned about overpopulation, but their apocalyptic visions now concentrate on climate change, resource depletion and biodiversity loss. Despite stark disparities in consumption – Americans consume 360 times more carbon per capita than Somalis, for example – population control still focuses on the majority world.Thankfully, the coercive policies that took place in India, China and elsewhere are no longer in vogue.The new approach to population control focuses instead on women’s empowerment. Educating women and giving them control over their lives has proved remarkably effective at reducing fertility rates. In the 1960s, women had on average five children each. Today, the figure is 2.3 per woman – just over what is needed to keep the population stable. By 2100 the global birthrate is projected to fall to 1.8.According to the UN, the world’s populationwill peak at about 10.3 billionin the mid-2080s. After this it will stabilise, then fall. The exponential growth that gave Malthusians so many sleepless nights has been halted. That many people will put considerable stress on the Earth’s resources, but if consumption is managed responsibly and sustainable technologies are developed, the world will avoid an apocalyptic catastrophe.Returning to Asimov’s bathroom metaphor, as anyone who has crammed into one house with their extended family over Christmas knows, many people sharing few bathrooms creates a suboptimal situation. You won’t be able to shower exactly when you want – and you’d better make it a short one. But this hardly amounts to the end of civilisation. In fact, compromise and sharing is probably closer to most people’s idea of a good life than having the freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want.Population growth varies starkly between regions. In most high-income countries, fertility rates are already well below the replacement level. The African continent isprojectedto account for over half the world’s population growth in the next three decades, with Asia and Latin America responsible for the rest.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage launching an EU referendum poster in 2016.Photograph: Philip Toscano/PAAs the historian Alison Bashford points out, concerns about overpopulation are often not really about there being too many people but too many of the wrong kind of people. Ethnonationalists in Europe and North America see the disparities in birthrates as an existential threat to “western civilisation”. They worry about their countries being indelibly changed by mass migration. But the cold hard truth is that in a few decades our shrinking, ageing societies will desperately need these newcomers to pay taxes and work in healthcare and social care. This vision of the future may be unsettling for some, but the alternative is much worse.To extend Asimov’s metaphor, the populist right advocates a sort of bathroom apartheid. They are en suite isolationists, who want to retain exclusive use over one of the bathrooms in the apartment, and force the 19 other flatmates to share. At first, this approach has its advantages. They can soak in the bath all day. They can sit for hours on the can reading the news.But sooner or later they will come a cropper. Perhaps the other toilet becomes blocked and the whole flat is inundated with raw sewage. The other flatmates might forcibly seize control of the personal bathroom. Or as the en suite isolationists grow old and infirm, they’ll find themselves with no one to bathe them or wipe their bottoms.Jonathan Kennedy teaches politics and global health at Queen Mary University of London, and is the author of Pathogenesis: How Germs Made HistoryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But as power migrates to autocracies, our belief in democracy seems complacentSat 31 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 10.41 EDTShareAfew months ago, I travelled with my six-year-old daughter toHong Kong. As we made our way out of the airport and boarded a train, we shared a brief moment that gave me pause to reflect on how different her conception of the world will be from the one I grew up with. We sat down on immaculate seats, surrounded by LED screens. She looked around and said: “Wow Daddy, we don’t have trains like this back in London.”As the week wore on, and she pointed out other things that she had never seen back home, her comment about the high-speed train took on a broader resonance. Used to Britain’s strained and crumbling public transport, my little girl had identified how economic power has migrated to a different model of capitalism over the past generation.When I was growing up in the heady,Cool Britannia eraof the 1990s, Britain almost seemed like the apex of global civilisation. The only place ahead on its developmental trajectory was the US. And even if MTV or Hollywood presented it as the shining city on the hill, the smart kids knew it was really just Rome to Britain’s Greece.In school, we learned how Britain, the birthplace of industrialised capitalism and parliamentary democracy and long the colonial ruler of placesincluding Hong Kong, had created an ideal form of society that was the model for everywhere else. When we told the story of how capitalism emerged, it was through the enclosure of medieval English villages and the growth of the Industrial Revolution’s “dark satanic mills”. When we spoke of the rise of democracy, it was through the nobles holding King John toMagna Cartaor Oliver Cromwell cementing the power of parliament.Britain, the US and some parts of western Europe were the “developed world”. Everywhere else was “developing”. And development was a one-way road. The various crises we saw on the news engulfing distant lands in Africa, Asia or the Middle East were framed as a painful step in the maturing process that countries passed through in order to become societies like Britain.This is not the world that British children growing up in the 21st century are now experiencing.Our trip to Hong Kong was a stark reminder of this. Back in 2014, the Chinese island city-state was named the overseas destination that most young British professionalswanted to relocate to. In second place was Dubai. Today, entiretelevision programmesare devoted to the subject of young Brits moving to “DXB”, alongside other Arab cities such as Abu Dhabi and Riyadh.In Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman is pushing forward with his sci-fi vision forthe Line– a futuristic, AI-powered linear city, where smart technology will connect inhabitants moving between two parallel mirrored skyscrapers that stretch across 170km of desert. Meanwhile multiple UK governments have been trying and failing for years to advance plans for a high-speed rail line, HS2.View image in fullscreenThe HS2 construction site on Curzon Street in Birmingham, 1 October 2024.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe affection young British influencers show for places that are still ultimately autocratic, no matter how much gloss and ring-lighting they use, is hardly surprising. The football clubs British kids support might be owned by Gulf royalty. The films they watch might look as though they take place in LA but areshot in the UAE. The idea that these are the places you now go to if you want to “make it” has become almost as ubiquitous as the idea of following the “American dream” was a generation ago.What does this shift in the axis of our global order mean politically? As the historian Quinn Slobodian detailed in his 2023 bookCrack-Up Capitalism, Hong Kong long functioned as a utopian ideal for free-market radicals who sought to push a vision of capitalism that worked best without the constraining demands of mass democracy. Even Donald Trump, in his nativist justification for a trade war with China, often betrays the envy he feels towards itsability to crush dissentand suppress wages in a way that US constitutional traditions make more difficult.In Britain, it has become more common for our politicians and journalists to cite their admiration for the emergence of technologically advanced, politically repressive states in what was once called the “developing world”. The former British prime minister Boris Johnson travelled to Riyadh in Februaryand stated: “Saudi Arabia is a country where things are happening with incredible speed and decisiveness. Frankly, we need to learn that in the UK.” About the same time, the Telegraph journalist Isabel Oakeshott wrote a gushing piece about moving to Dubai for cheaper private school fees, saying that “unlike angry, divided Britain, Dubai is the ultimatemulticultural success story”.The real story isn’t young men supposedly voting far right. It’s what young women are up to | Cas MuddeRead moreThe idea that capitalism might work best with limited, or even nonexistent, democracy is quietly becoming more acceptable. Just last week, Oakeshott’s partner, Reform UK’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, said Britain should “aspire to” the low crime rate and widespread national pride found in Dubai. That the Emirati city is an absolute monarchy – regularly criticised byhuman rights organisationsfor imprisoning journalists, lawyers and political dissidents with little concern for the public’s right to freedom of expression – appeared to be of little concern to Tice or others on the conservative right who celebrate the city’s “booming metropolis”.With our political and media elites now openly celebrating draconian regimes, it is likely that my daughter’s generation will grow up receiving a different message about the importance of Britain’s democratic “traditions”. According to a Channel 4 study from earlier this year,52% of gen Zersfelt the UK would be a better place “if a strong leader was in charge who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”. Unless our leaders start to promote an alternative vision of how society could function, and Britain’s place in a world where the west is no longer “best”, more and more of our young people will have the feeling that the future lies elsewhere.Kojo Koram teaches at the School of Law at Birkbeck, University of London, and writes on issues of law, race and empireExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionDubaiHong KongYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Her thuggish tormentors – all white male politicians on the infrastructure committee – took turns to publicly belittle the 67-year-old black woman, who has done more than anyone to protect the natural wealth of the country – theAmazon rainforest, Pantanal wetlands, Cerrado savannah and other biomes – from rapacious abuse.One by one, they lined up to attack her for these globally important efforts. Decorum gave way to name-calling and sneering: “Know your place,” roared the committee head, Marcos Rogério, a Bolsonarist who cut Silva’s microphone as she tried to respond. The leader of the centre-rightPSDB, Plínio Valério, told her she did not deserve respect as a minister. The Amazonas senator Omar Aziz – from the Centrão party and a supporter of president Lula – talked over her repeatedly.Their motives appeared to be partly ideological, partly misogynistic and largely self-interested. All of them were trying to force through economic projects – roads, oilfields, dams or plantations – that are under scrutiny by Silva’s environment ministry. Never mind that this is her job, they seemed to say, how dare she not allow them to have their way?But she did dare. Despite her frail physique, Silva is a fighter. Born in the Amazon rainforest, she helped to found the Workers’ party alongside Lula during the era of military dictatorship. She campaigned against deforestation alongside Chico Mendes, who was assassinated in 1988. In her first stint as environment minister, between 2003 and 2008, she established a monitoring-and-penalty system that she said reduced forest clearance by 80%. Later, she ran as president for the Green party, securing nearly 20m votes – more than any other Green candidate in world history. Twelve years ago, she founded her own party – the Sustainability Network.Silva refused to tolerate being abused and silenced, and walked out of the senate meeting. Outside, when she finally had a chance to speak, she turned on her tormentors: “My place is the place to defend democracy, my place is the place to defend the environment, to combat inequality, sustainable development, to protect biodiversity, and infrastructure projects that are necessary for the country,” she said defiantly. “What is unacceptable is for someone to think that because you are a woman, black, and come from a humble background, that you are going to say who I am and still say that I should stay in my place. My place is where all women should be.”View image in fullscreenBrazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva (left), arguing with Senator Marcos Rogério during a committee session at the Senate in Brasilia.Photograph: Geraldo Magela/Brazilian senate press officeAFP/Getty ImagesThis version of what happened has been reported widely in the Brazilian media, but it tells only part of the story. What is missing – and more important – is why the pack of senators felt Silva was vulnerable. That is because over the previous few days, Lula had taken the side of the oil industry rather than the Amazon rainforest, and then – not by coincidence – the Brazilian environmental movement suffered one of the biggest legislative defeats in its history.At the centre of everything is a long-running row over oil exploration in the Foz do Amazonas. BP and the French oil company Total used to hold most of these rights, but they baulked at the political and environmental challenge of drilling so close to the world’s biggest centre of terrestrial biodiversity. Instead, Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, stepped up. For Lula – and the senators in nearby regions – that meant potential votes, jobs and export earnings. The only thing standing in their way was the environment ministry, which has delayed a licence for years due to the risks of a possible spill in such an ecologically sensitive area.That handbrake was lifted earlier this week, when the head of the environmental regulator, Ibama, ignored the warnings of 29 expert advisers by moving on to the next stage of the approval process for operations in the Foz do Amazonas. Thiscapitulationfollowed pressure from Congress and the president.This was followed by the biggest legislative setback for the environment in more than 40 years. To the delight of the mining, construction and farming industries, thesenate has passed a long-pending billthat strips a range of environmental licensing powers from Silva’s ministry. This piece of legislation – dubbed the devastation bill by opponents – allows companies to self-license or avoid environmental licensing for road construction, dam-building and other projects. It is a shift of control from the representatives of the people to the executives of big companies.Lula could yet wield a veto on this bill. But so far thepresident’s response has been tepid. His party has a weak presence in congress, so he depends on a broad and fractious coalition, many of whose members are enmeshed in agribusiness or mining. Next year’s presidential election seems to be weighing on his mind more than November’s Cop30 climate summit in Belém.In the wake of the attacks on Silva by the senate infrastructure committee, Lula publicly came to her defence. He said she was right to walk out in the face of so much provocation. But he has not faced up to his responsibility for leaving her exposed. Nor has he faced up to the contradictions of his own promise to achievezero deforestation by 2030and his support for evidently incompatible projects, such as oil drilling off the coast of the Amazon, an upgraded BR319 road that would open up the forest between Manaus and Porto Velho to greater clearance activities, and a new grain railway that would increase pressure for more soya bean plantations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Soon after, at Cop28 in Dubai, his government shocked many of its supporters by announcing it would join the Opec+ oil cartel. Lula can argue that this is pragmatism as Brazil depends on petroleum sales for a growing share of its GDP. Fossil fuel realpolitik is likely to be evident at a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro in July, where the Brazilian president will rub shoulders with China’s Xi Jinping of China, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, India’s Narendra Modi and other world leaders.Lula has thrown Marina Silva under a cement mixer once before – in 2008, when she was forced to leave his second-term government because too many ministers saw her as a drag on economic development. He may feel reluctant to do so again before Cop30, because he knows she is vital for Brazil’s environmental credibility in the eyes of much of the world, and he does not want his country to return to the pariah status it endured during the Bolsonaro years. But the sands are shifting and Lula seems unsure of his footing.His base – the working class and poor – are already suffering the brunt of climate impacts. The south of Brazil has been deluged by devastating floods. Thenorthern Amazon has been stricken by record droughts and fires.Civil society and progressive thinkers – almost all of whom usually support Lula – have been far more active than the president in opposing the devastation bill and defending the environment minister on social media, where many public figures have posted “Marina is not alone” messages of support.But like many other centre left leaders in the world, Lula is struggling in the age of Trump, of rightwing extremism, of warmongering, of geopolitical realignment and corporate backtracking on the environment. As Silva showed, it takes courage to face those forces. Lula has often stood by her in that fight, but does he still have the stomach and the inclination to continue?Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentView from the AmazonBrazilAmericasAmazon rainforestDeforestationTrees and forestsConservationcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s 2003:the band thatlater becomes MGMTare performing their song Kids to their peers, years before they become a pop sensation, in a dusty quad at Wesleyan University, Connecticut. Social media doesn’t exist yet. There is something about the way people look and behave and inhabit the space that tugs at my heartstrings and fills me with nostalgia. No one is dressed that well; the camera zooms unsteadily to capture the crowd’s awkwardness, slumped shoulders and arrhythmic bopping. Beyond the footage we’re watching, no one seems to be filming.I was only four when the video was filmed, so why does watching it make me feel as if I’ve lost a whole world?A recent surveysuggests I’m not alone –that almost half of young people would prefer a world without the internet. If anything, I expected a higher percentage. This doesn’t mean my generation really would like to reverse everything that’s happened in the last few decades, but there’s clearly something we feel we’re missing out on that older people have had, and we attribute it to the internet – or at least to its current form, dominated as it is by social media.What exactly do we think we’re missing? Personally, I assume that before the social internet people behaved in more authentic and idiosyncratic ways.Social mediahas sped up trend cycles, resulting in an eerieuniformity across styles and personalities: we buy the same products, wear the same clothes, act in the same way, reference the same memes – even quirkiness itself or more “unique” behaviour can be ascribed to trends.I also imagine that if we weren’t on display all the time, our friendships and interactions could be less commodified. Now, spending time with friends is material to be documented and then demonstrated to a faceless audience.Is doom scrolling really rotting our brains? The evidence is getting harder to ignore | Siân BoyleRead moreI’m sure these are rose-tinted assumptions, and I’m conscious too of the things I take for granted about an age of connectivity.Having to trawl through a few measly books and encyclopedias to find anything useful, or growing up in a remote area with little connection to the wider world, surely must have felt both inhibiting and claustrophobic.But it may be that these “negative” aspects are what young people yearning for disconnectivity actually want – we have a sense that there was a value, now largely lost, in the practical effort required for social interaction, for finding good music, or joining a subculture. Life now in comparison seems streamlined, efficient, moreyassified, in a phenomenon that writer Michael Harris calls a “loss of lack”.Recently, my office manager showed me the technology he and his friends used to “watch” the football on:Ceefax. The football score would load on a television screen via the changing of a single digit. They would spend the afternoon just sitting on the sofa, waiting for the digit to change (or not). I felt envious of this. Why? If anything, this is clearly a case where an experience has improved exponentially. And yet I’m captivated by the sense of mystery: if they weren’t watching the game or reading the updates, what were they doing? What were they occupying their thoughts with?The reality might be that they were bored, another scarce experience in a connected age. At least, if bored, they would have entertained themselves with internal rather than external resources. It doesn’t even matter if that was really the case - it is precisely because this experience is unknowable that it is compelling to me. I am haunted by the feeling that spending so much time on our phones has stolen something human and vital from our lives.It is of course true that each era experiences a crisis about the new wave of tech destroying people’s souls – when it wasn’t the internet, it was TV, or the radio, or the printing press, even papyrus scrolls, and nostalgia is common across every generation. But I don’t think any previous generations were ever so down on their own era, in such large numbers, to the point they’d erase its major salient feature. We feel nostalgic for a world that can’t be brought back. As Donald Trump said, now “everything is computer”.Ironically, my nostalgia for a pre-internet age is being fed by the internet itself: the machine constantly feeding me clips of the past, footage of young people operating decades ago where everything seems refreshingly unobserved and carefree.So the very engine of this nostalgia is the thing half of us wish to do away with, despite the fact that it’s an incredible resource, that has allowed unparalleled access to older music, knowledge, ways of living – and is also by nature democratic, questioning traditional media outlets on global affairs and challenging convention.If this survey is a canary in the mine, what should we do? Enjoyable as it is,I don’t think being misty-eyed about the past is the solution; neither is fetishising a perceived authenticity of the past. “Authenticity”, I think, looks like the power to opt in or out, perform or not, when you want to – in other words: freedom. So when it comes to the internet, if switching off entirely isn’t possible any more, then surely the words of MGMT can be useful: control yourself, take only what you need from it.Isabel Brooks is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionInternetDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

So the horror can be grasped by our celebrity-driven society: are we removing the next Mozart?Sat 31 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 13.06 EDTShareTwo children – a nine-year-old boy and his six-year-old sister – are playing at “house”, pretending to be their father and mother. Absorbed in the game, they repeat the words their parents have been whispering to each other when they thought their progeny were not listening.Playing like innocent children all over the world play and have played since the beginning of history. But, here and now, in America, the words some endangered children may be exchanging are far from innocent.What do we do if they come for you, my love, if I never see you again? Who do I call, who do I turn to? What if they also take me? And the children, what if they also come for the children?I can sadly envisage many boys and girls in this country today playing that game, asking each other questions like these while their undocumented family awaits the knock on the door, alert to the sound of a van outside ready to transport them away and rush them off to a distant land.It is not the first time I have had to imagine such a distressing situation. Almost 50 years ago, while in exile in Amsterdam, I wrote a story, My House Is on Fire, featuring a pair of siblings who ask precisely those questions while playing a similar supposedly naive game. I set the story in Chile, a land then under the savage boot of the military, using my fiction as a way of returning to the country forbidden to me as I tried to figure out how those children would cope psychologically with the threat of agents of the state roaming the streets in search of dissidents to arrest and disappear, what sort of permanent scars of dread would be carved into the souls and bodies of those kids forced to become adults before their time.I’ve seen the reality of the new Israel-backed ‘aid’ for Gaza. It’s nothing more than a deadly PR stunt | Eyad AmawiRead moreIt is tragic and disgraceful that the fate of a boy and a girl in yesteryear’s dictatorial Chile can resonate so perversely in today’s America, that their Latin American destiny of apprehension and mistrust echoes what is being perpetrated in so many homes across this land that once beckoned to foreigners to come and build a different sort of future.Though it is, alas, the current United States on to which I am projecting the Chilean experience of those conjectured children, other countries and other youngsters have come to mind over the past half-century as suffering parallel afflictions: Jewish children in the time of the Nazis and Palestinian children in the time of Israeli onslaughts, and Sudan and Brazil, Iran and Belarus, Turkey and Rwanda and Egypt and on and on, a deluge of nations where so many children have asked, at one time or another, what happens if they take away my parents, what happens if they come for me?It is likely that my identification with, and sympathy for, that array of unfortunate young victims may have stemmed from my own life experiences. Even if I had no recollection of what it meant to leave my Argentinian homeland at the age of two and a half when my rebellious father had been forced to flee to New York to escape the wrath of that country’s fascistic military, memories of that trauma must have resurfaced when – by then I was nine years old - the red scare in the United States instilled fear in so many families with leftwing ideas or activities, leading our own family to once again take flight, this time to Chile. And history was going to repeat itself when, after AugustoPinochet’s coup of 1973, my six-year-old son, Rodrigo, followed his father and mother into remote realms, became himself a refugee. And the curse of banishment plagued us yet again in 1986, when I was arrested at the Santiago airport by Pinochet’s secret police, who proceeded to expel me from the country along with our seven-year-old son, Joaquín, already born into expatriation during our Dutch exile.Not strange, then, that I should be haunted by the tragedy of so many forsaken youthful lives being irreversibly twisted, what it does to each boy, each girl, to live in perpetual terror of deportation or death. But I have recently been troubled by a question about another kind of social repercussion: what do we lose, those who watch such persecution and do little or nothing to avert it, what does society lose by hunting down these children and, ultimately, removing them from our midst?We would, needless to say (and yet it must be said), find ourselves depreciated by the vanishing of even one of these defenseless minors, forfeiting the cosmic galaxy of skills and dreams and endowments that each of them promises, how they might enrich us for generations to come. Given that this self-evident truth has been insufficient to stir enough public opinion to get such maltreatment to cease, it might make sense, in our celebrity-driven and success-soaked society, to exemplify that loss in a more dramatic and spectacular fashion.Faced with that ominous question,what do we lose?, I answer with a name that cannot be indifferent or unrecognizable to anyone: Mozart, we risk losing future Mozarts. Can we deny that each deported child has within himself, within herself, the potentiality to become another Mozart?You are not only committing a crime against humanity, Mozart would warn. You are committing a crime against beauty and the compassionate imagination of our speciesInstead of that musical genius I could, of course, suggest any number of other amazingly gifted human beings. There could be an Albert Einstein lurking inside the head of one of the boys being whisked right now to some unknown destination, there could be a Madame Curie inside one of the girls going through that ordeal. A Cervantes, a George Eliot, a Bob Dylan, a Taylor Swift, a Nelson Mandela, an Abraham Lincoln, a Harriet Tubman, a Simón Bolivar, a Garibaldi, a Monet, a Sappho, a Meryl Streep – who knows what miracles are being snuffed out with each stalked child?Let me insist, however, on Mozart as the most luminous paragon in this experiment bent on rattling consciences. True that, during his childhood, he never faced the threat of harassment by cruel authorities. And yet, I am sure he would understand the anxieties and uncertainties that trouble today’s migrant youngsters in the US. One can imagine, as I have done in my novel Allegro, what such a sensitive child must have felt when he was separated from his family and was forced to accept adult tasks and responsibilities, pondering who to trust in a world suddenly full of strangers. Like me at his age, like my own children, like so many imperiled children in the US, Mozart also must have worried about death, must have feared being abandoned at an early age.Who could better represent the latent aspirations and possible talents of many of those contemporary youngsters whose violent passing from among us should fill us with shame and grief? The most famous child prodigy of all time, composing music at the age of five, playing the piano for monarchs once he was seven: I can conjure up no more eloquent and renowned spokesperson for vulnerable children everywhere.Let us, therefore, call on the ghost of Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart to return to Earth and excoriate those victimizers who are ordering and carrying out such acts of merciless repression against his young outcast counterparts in the US and beyond its frontiers.I can hear him telling them to beware of the consequences of terrorizing and deporting a child. You are not only, I can hear him say with that voice which once sang to the world some of the most immortal and consoling melodies ever created, committing a crime against humanity. You are, Mozart would warn them, committing a crime against beauty and the compassionate imagination of our species.Ariel Dorfman, an emeritus distinguished professor of literature at Duke University, is the Chilean American author of the play Death and the Maiden and, more recently, the novels The Suicide Museum and Allegro.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionTrump administrationMigrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

He will seek to agree a timeline for implementing the deal agreed to lower steel, aluminium, auto and other product tariffs.A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK was the first country to secure a trade deal with the US earlier this month and we remain committed to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel.”“We are engaging with the US on the implications of the latest tariff announcement and to provide clarity for industry.”The Guardian reported thatBritish officials were intensifying trade talks with the US and hope to see the deal implemented within weeks.A government source said: “Some countries are viewing the court ruling as an indication that they were right not to negotiate over tariffs. We’re taking the opposite view, and trying to get this deal implemented as soon as possible.”Trump and Keir Starmerannounced a US-UK trade deal earlier this monthunder which on British steel and aluminium will be reduced to zero, and tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars a year will be reduced from 25% to 10%.The deal did not cover Trump’s blanket 10% tariffs on all foreign imports, which afederal court overturned last week, arguing that the US president had overstepped his powers. Anappeals court paused the rulingand said Trump’s tariffs could continue while it examines the arguments.The European Commission said on Saturday that it “strongly” regretted Trump’s decision to double steel and aluminium tariffs, and warned that the EU was prepared to retaliate.“This decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” a spokesperson for the commission said, adding that “the tariff increase also undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution”.“The EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase.”“The European Commission is currently finalising consultations on expanded countermeasures. If no mutually acceptable solution is reached, both existing and additional EU measures will automatically take effect on 14 July – or earlier, if circumstances require.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policySteel industryBritish SteelJonathan ReynoldsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 200 settlements in the region were already under evacuation orders.The attacks came as Ukrainian diplomats continue to discuss participating in a fresh round of peace talks proposed by Moscow in Istanbul next week.Ukrainian cities ‘terrorised’ by North Korean weapons in Russian hands – reportRead moreThe Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskyy, has said that about 50,000 Russian troops were gathered on the border near the Sumy region, which he said was a sign that Moscow is preparing a renewed offensive.The Russian ministry of defence said on Saturday that it had taken control of the village of Novopil in the eastern Donetsk region, as well as the village of Vodolahy in the northern Sumy region.Russia’s military also launched 109 drones and five missiles atUkraineovernight and in the early hours of Saturday, many of which were intercepted, the Ukrainian air force said.The missile salvo killed a nine-year-old girl in the Zaporizhzhia region, eastern Ukraine, as well as injured a 16-year-old, the governor of Zaporizhzhia, Ivan Fedorov, said. Another man was killed by Russian shelling in the port city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine. “One house was destroyed. The shock wave from the blast also damaged several other houses, cars and outbuildings,” Fedorov wrote on Telegram.Ukraine also launched drone attacks in western Russia on Saturday, injuring 14 people.The back and forth attacks came as the prospect of continued peace talks between Russia and Ukraine remain uncertain. Moscow had proposed direct peace talks between the two countries in Istanbul on Monday, but Kyiv insisted that Russia should first provide a promised ceasefire proposal before it agreed to attend.Russia had previously said it would share a memorandum stating its position on what it wants to end the three-year war between the two countries, but has yet to do so. Ukrainian officials said that they had already handed a proposal to Russia setting out its terms.Zelenskyy accused Russia on Friday of “undermining diplomacy” by not giving Ukrainians its position paper.“For some reason, the Russians are concealing this document. This is an absolutely bizarre position. There is no clarity about the format,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Moscow has said that it will provide its peace terms in person on Monday.Both Russia and Ukraine have come under increasing international pressure to achieve a ceasefire, particularly after the US president, Donald Trump, made a ceasefire a key foreign policy priority.Trump has called for direct talksbetween the two countries, while Turkey has played a mediation role, offering to host summits between them.Diplomacy has had small gains, with an unprecedented prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine leading to1,000 prisoners being exchanged earlier in the month. The prisoner swap, meant to be a confidence-building measure, has yet to lead to greater breakthroughs.The EU has accused Russia of stalling ceasefire talks while it makes gains on the battlefield, a claim that Moscow has rebuffed. Moscow has said it is Ukraine that is delaying a ceasefire, though the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, has declined to agree to calls for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Bannister says it can load and off-load a ferry “with 120 trucks, 1,000 passengers and a couple of hundred cars in 45 minutes, faster than an A320 at Gatwick”.He is confident the biometric check regime being built will add just six minutes to a car journey.The new regime has presented particular challenges in Dover because the port is hemmed by the cliffs and there is no safe space for car passengers to be checked amid the flow of 10,000 trucks a day crossing the channel.“In an airport you have a nice, air-conditioned, well-lit hall, and an orderly queue of foot passengers going through. But we needed to cater for a carload of four people on a large, stormy night. So we couldn’t have people exit their vehicles [in the ferry queues]. That would be dangerous.”View image in fullscreenLand reclaimed next to the western ferry docks to create space for biometric checks. The white prefabricated structure is where coaches will disembark for fingerprinting.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianIn an extraordinary solution supported by the UK and French governments, Dover will create a virtual frontier system, 1.4 miles across town for border checks on 12 hectares of reclaimed land.Peering down from the western cliffs, the first building to cater for coaches is already in place on a vast swathe of built-up ground currently topped with golden sand.A second bus and a separate car building will be installed in the coming months.To ensure the integrity of the border, buses will have their doors physically sealed with tape while they rejoin regular traffic across Dover town and continue a 1.4-mile journey from the western ferry to board the ferry at the eastern docks.Irregular movements between the biometric border and the ferry board will be monitored by a combination of AI and automatic number plate recognition.It isn’t the only change Bannister is expecting in the coming months.He is also hopeful that the reset in the relationship between the UK and the EU will end the environmentally and economically damaging issue of trucks returning to the continent empty.Another byproduct ofBrexit, it is estimated that on some days 30% to 40% of trucks have no cargo on them when they return to the continent because of strict checks on fresh food and farm products. These are expected to be scrapped as part of Keir Starmer’s reset.With £144bn worth of goods traded over the channel every year, the Port of Dover is of critical economic interest to France and the UK, representing half of the total of UK goods exported to Europe, Bannister said.The EU and the UK have pledged to negotiate a new deal eliminating the checks on food, which will allow small food and farm producers to export to Europe once again.Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeKentTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

I have lots of happy, peaceful memories here. It’s serene and soothing, and it seems selfish to close it off.”Landscape photographer Rachel Baker has been visiting for 10 years. “I first stumbled on it when we did a day trip to westDorsetand stopped off in Littlebredy on our way home. It was such a beautiful, tranquil spot with hardly a human in sight.“The waterfall is particularly stunning at autumn as it is framed by a Japanese maple, and the leaves go from golden yellow to a deep red. It became a bit of a pilgrimage to visit and photograph the waterfall every autumn.“It feels a tremendous shame that the access that has been given to the public for so many years is being taken away.”View image in fullscreenPeople on their last pilgrimage to Bridehead Estate lake and waterfall.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianKevan Manwaring, a university lecturer in creative writing, said it was culturally important. Hardy knew this area well, thus one of the main characters in his novel Jude the Obscure was named Sue Bridehead.The artist David Inshawpainted the cricket pitch on the estate in the 1970sand, more recently, the waterfall was used as a setting for a crime scene in the television show Broadchurch.Manwaring said: “We should be encouraging people to spend more time in nature, not less.”The history of the estate stretches back centuries. According to an information notice inthe village church, St Michael and All Saints, the “bredy” in “Littlebredy” comes from a Celtic word meaning to throb or boil, thought to be a reference to the stream.For more than 400 years, the estate was owned by Cerne Abbey until the dissolution and at the end of the 18th century, it was bought by Robert Williams, whose family grew rich from furniture making, banking – and a stake in the East India Company.The stream was dammed to create Bridehead Lake. Acer, tulip trees and pines were planted and at the western end of the lake, and water spilled out into the mossy waterfall.The house and estate were passed down through the Williams family and villagers and visitors were given access to the lake and waterfall in exchange for a donation to the village church. Over the years, people have scattered ashes of loved ones – and pets – at the site.View image in fullscreenThe ‘bredy’ in ‘Littlebredy’ comes from a Celtic word meaning to throb or boil, thought to be a reference to the Bridehead estate stream.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianLast year the16-bedroom houseand 2,000-acre estate came on to the market with a guide price of £30m. Country Lifedescribed it as a “joyous home, full of surprises”.The house and estate is believed to have sold quickly. The identity of the new owner has not emerged but a notice saying that “permissive access will be withdrawn as of Monday 2 June 2025” appeared on a fence beside the path.TheRight to Roam campaignhas said it will challenge and “defy” the ban.Nadia Shaikh, from the campaign, said: “Bridehead’s beauty and tranquillity should continue to be accessible to all, not locked away behind estate gates. This landscape is more than just scenery – it’s part of the cultural and natural heritage of Dorset, intertwined with local identity and community life.“This closure epitomises the precarious nature of public access to the countryside acrossEngland. It is part of a growing trend of micro-enclosures and the paywalling of the countryside. The government urgently needs to pass new legislation to protect access to places like Bridehead and extend access to the countryside elsewhere.”Shaikh said the estate’s history was “deeply tied to colonial exploitation” through the East India Company, adding: “Maintaining public access is a positive step toward accountability, community healing, and celebrating a more inclusive, shared heritage.”Explore more on these topicsDorsetAccess to green spaceThomas HardyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Campaigners would like to see ecocide listed as a fifth crime against peace, targeting the very worst harms to the environment, usually on an industrial scale or over a large area, and making key decision-makers accountable.Is ecocide not already a crime?Actually, yes, it is – at least in the context of war – according to a rather obscure sub-clause of the Rome statute. Article 8(2)(b)(iv) of the ICC’s Rome statute stipulates as a war crime, within the context of an international armed conflict, the act of: “Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause […] widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated”.However, no charges under the provision have ever been filed. Experts suggest that is because the article sets a high threshold, requiring that such an attack on the environment must be “intentional”, and that the damage must be “widespread, long term and severe”, as well as “clearly excessive”.How will making ecocide a separate crime against peace help?The proposal seeks to lower the threshold to “unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and either widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts”.This would apply most importantly outside the context of armed conflict, with corporations and states potentially held liable for their roles in environmental destruction, no matter the circumstances.But it would also help during armed conflict, according to Jojo Mehta, chief executive of Stop Ecocide International, who says it would “create a clear tool for justiciability in wartime”.What would the legal process be?Cases under the Rome statute are heard by the ICJ in The Hague, the same court that heard South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, either via a case brought by the UN security council, or because states or even private individuals have petitioned the court’s prosecutor to begin an investigation.However, the ICC is intended only as a course of last resort, so any states or organisations wanting to bring cases before it would first have to exhaust all domestic opportunities to bring cases. This is what is under way in Ukraine, where the state prosecutors are using the country’s own domestic courts to seek justice for the immense environmental damage caused to the country since it was invaded by Russia.Is it likely to happen and what are the obstacles?Ecocide was very nearly included in the Rome statute at its inception in the 1990s; its current revival, says Mehta, is very much down to the efforts of Ukraine since Russia’s invasion three years ago.Around the same time, an independent panel of legal experts convened by the Stop Ecocide Foundation came up with its own international definition that has become an inspiration for a host of countries introducing their own laws at a national level. “There are dozens of countries talking about this, and there are, I think, probably nine or 10 proposals around the world that are in progress in individual jurisdictions, [and] there are one or two that are now in place, like in Belgium and in France.”Meanwhile, the EU recently passed an environmental directive which, while it only mentions ecocide in its preamble, provides strong protections that member states will have to harmonise with their own laws.The key obstacle, Mehta says, is public understanding.Which countries support and oppose it?“I think about two or three years ago, we passed the point where any government wants to be seen publicly objecting to this law, because they will just look crap,” Mehta said. Instead, what is more likely is that some states would try to sidestep the introduction of such a law, either with weaker versions or by claiming there is already enough legislation on the books.The countries that have most strongly supported the introduction of the law are those that are most affected by environmental destruction. They include: Ukraine, reeling from its war with Russia; Vanuatu, Fiji and Samoa, which are struggling with sea-level rises; and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has been outspoken over biodiversity.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWar crimesInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceexplainersShareReuse this content"

These are essentially centuries-old libraries containing records of preindustrial greenhouse gases, pollutants, pollen and bacteria that provide information about historic temperatures and the impact humans have had on the changing environment.The deeper they manage to drill, the greater the potential for older ice and its rich archive to emerge. Anexpedition on the Grenz glacieron Monte Rosa in 2021 yielded ice cores containing climate information dating back over the last 10,000 years, including pollutants from the Roman era.View image in fullscreenIce cores contain climate information dating back over 10,000 years.Photograph: Riccardo Selvatico/Ca’ Foscari University“A glacier is like a book made up of many pages,” said Jacopo Gabrieli, a glaciologist at CNR. “The pages are layers of ice, with the first few already unreadable because of the melt. It’s like throwing a glass of water on an old manuscript and watching the ink quickly disappear. We know the deepest layers are still readable because it is cold enough. But it is an absolute race against time.”The Corbassière drilling expedition is the first of three planned by Follow the Ice, a scientific and educational project supported bySea Beyond, an initiative led by the Prada Group. A week into the expedition, the team of 13, which includes mountain guides, a videographer and a nurse who doubles as a cook, welcomed a small group of journalists who were brought to base-camp by helicopter.The team extracted two ice cores from the glacier, although they won’t know the secrets they hold until analysis is done.Along with greenhouse gases, previous glacier drills have enabled scientists to study cores for the DNA of ancient viruses that could resurface amid global heating, along with frozen insects and plants that could give insight into the history of forests and their ecosystems.View image in fullscreenThe Grand Combin massif.Photograph: Riccardo Selvatico/Ca’ Foscari UniversityThe mission on the Corbassière, backed by the Ice Memory, a nonprofit organisation aimed at preserving and analysing ice cores from the world’s most at-risk glaciers, is incredibly daring.For the first few days, the squad had to adapt to the altitude, many struggling to breathe or suffering headaches and nausea. Sleep has been scant, with hours spent clearing snow out of tents and away from pathways.Unexpected changes in weather have stalled progress, as did the sudden breakage of a cable powering the drill. Victor Zagorodnov, a scientist who, at 75, is the oldest on the team, said: “Constant signs of danger play with your mind, but you have to resist.”Almost 40% of world’s glaciers already doomed due to climate crisis – studyRead moreZagorodnov has been leading drilling expeditions on glaciers around the world since the 1980s. “The first time was in Bolivia,” he said. “The mind is telling you it’s dangerous, and to leave. It causes nightmares. But you persevere.”Zagorodnov, who is also a glacier-drilling technology specialist, compared the experience to “learning to ride a bike”. “You get used to it,” he said. “Plus, when I first started the equipment was basic, today it is much more advanced.”Gabrieli is more than used to witnessing the evidence of the climate crisis on glaciers. In 2020, during test drilling on the Corbassière, water was found at a 30m (98ft) depth. “We put our hands in the water,” he said. “It was like touching climate change.”Another thing that dismayed him during that visit was rain. “I didn’t think it was possible to have precipitation at this altitude,” he added. “It was only a small amount of rain but it was really depressing.”The experience made the team realise even more that they needed to act quickly, and so returned to finish the work.This time, the team came equipped with the more advanced electro-thermal drill, a device that penetrates glacier ice through melting. The thermal drill had reached about seven metres deep when a burning stench overwhelmed the scientists.“We thought something was wrong with the drill but then realised it had hit a plastic bag,” said Carlo Barbante, a professor at Ca’ Foscari who co-founded the Ice Memory Foundation. “It must have been left there by climbers years ago, and really proved the impact of human activity on the climate. Plastic is everywhere, pollution is everywhere. It is very disappointing.”After six days, the drill successfully reached a depth of 55m (180ft). But then the power cable breakage forced the team to revert to using an electromechanical drill.Still, the device helped them to finish the job, and by day nine they were euphoric after making a major breakthrough: the drill hit “bedrock” – the solid rock lying beneath the glacier – at a depth of 99.5m (326ft). The first of the two ice cores was extracted and transported down the mountain, and the second followed a week later.The ice cores will be dated and the plan is for one to be analysed in Italy, while the other will be shipped to Antarctica, where a cave is being excavated to store ice extracted through glacier drills, providing a library of information for future climate scientists.Apart from Europe, the Ice Memory foundation has so far drilled on glaciers in Bolivia and Russia. The missions are costly and intense, but crucial, said Barbante.“Glaciers, especially in non-polar regions, are very much at the forefront of global warming,” said Barbante. “They are water reservoirs for millions of people, so if the ice completely disappears there will be huge problems. We are are witnessing what is happening and it must be documented so we can leave something for future scientists. This is our duty.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGlaciersPolar regionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If housing was included, it would make it easier for spending on it to be excluded from normal fiscal rules, as it would be categorised as investment in infrastructure and would not count against government debt.The letter from London-based associations including L&Q, Peabody, ClarionHousingand Notting Hill Genesis said: “It is important to be honest about the scale of the problems and the solutions needed. You have inherited the worst housing situation in living memory. There is a housing emergency, with London at the epicentre, and new supply in the capital has already fallen off a cliff.”It said that there were more households in London on a social housing waiting list than double the entire population of Cambridge.The temporary housing crisis and its effects on people’s lives was “almost impossible to articulate”, the letter said, warning it was costing councils in London alone almost £4m a day. But it said changes to government rent policy since 2016 had taken almost £6.6bn out of the sector, which could have been invested in new and improved homes.“By the end of the parliament affordable housing completions will have fallen to the lowest levels since the second world war without urgent and specific interventions for London,” it said.Shelter and National Housing Federation have suggested about 90,000 social homes a year would be needed to hit the government’s manifesto target of 1.5m new homes, at a cost of about £11.8bn each year. But the investment is estimated to support almost 140,000 jobs and generate significantly higher economic output, breaking even within three years.McDermott, who takes over chairing the G15 group of London’s leading housing associations from June, said the 1.5m homes target was “very stretching” but the sector could play its part in achieving it.“We own land that could potentially build 20,000 homes. Can we build it? Yes, we can. It is definitely possible. There is an issue about workforce and about skills. But can we bring about that generational change? Yeah, we can,” he said. “But we need the government to be sympathetic and supportive of our asks.”McDermott said the economic case for investment in housing was “unarguable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s national infrastructure because if you look at what makes contented, thriving communities, at the core of those things is decent housing. And unless you recognise it as an essential element to a productive Britain and a thriving Britain and a contented Britain, then actually you’re going to miss the point.”The Guardian view on social housing: invest boldly to tackle ‘simmering anger’ about substandard homesRead moreThe housing ombudsman recently warned of a“simmering angerat poor housing conditions” which he said could boil over into social tension, with a 474% increase in complaints about substandard living conditions since 2019/20.Richard Blakeway said it was “neither fanciful nor alarmist” to suggest the growing anger at housing conditions could become “social disquiet”, saying the “shock ofGrenfell TowerandAwaab Ishak’s deathresonate still”. He said there had been a “really serious fracturing of trust, which in some cases is irreparable,” with housing providers.McDermott said that he understood the anger and that the sector had to do better, but said it was wrong to say providers did not care. “England has some of the oldest housing in Europe and the ombudsman is right to say that our not-for-profit sector is under intense pressure. Looking after residents’ homes well is our top priority and needs to be funded through rental income,” he said.“This is heavily regulated and was subject to government-imposed cuts for five out of seven years, which eroded our capacity to invest. As a sector, we’re catching up but with inflation and the cost of living crisis it has been a perfect storm.”Ministers are facing increased pressure to unlock more funds for housing in the runup to next month’s spending review. In a speech at an event in London on Saturday, Andy Burnham, theLabourmayor of Greater Manchester, was to call for a timetable by which time more new social homes were being built than sold off, calling housing “the single biggest cause of Britain’s modern malaise”.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We’ve taken immediate action fix the housing crisis we’ve inherited and kickstart the biggest expansion to social and affordable housing in a generation. This included, they said,£800m for affordable homes, and changes to right to buy, with a proposal for a long-term rent deal for social home providers to provide certainty on income.Explore more on these topicsSocial housingHousingAngela RaynerCommunitiesLabourInfrastructureRachel ReevesShareReuse this content"

It’s a Friday treat at a decent price.”“I’ve noticed it’s becoming a bigger thing,” says Gemma Saunders, 46, who’s just bought gelato with her daughter Elizabeth, 13. “It’s a nice alternative to going out drinking and more and more people aren’t drinking. It’s quite a family place.”“I can meet my friends in places like this,” adds Elizabeth. “It’s less expensive than going out for pizza.”The last couple of years have been challenging, as the rising cost of dairy products plus higher energy and wage bills have combined with falling visitor numbers to high streets and shopping malls.However, Creams – which has 93 outlets, almost all of which are run by franchisees – is back on the expansion trail with plans for about 10 new outlets this year, and a similar number next year.The menu features the Hot ‘n’ Cold Chocolate Fudge Volcano, the Lemon Meringue Cheesecakundae, the Birthday Cake Loaded Shake and hot waffles topped with Oreo, Bueno and Speculoos.The company – which opened its first outlet in Southall in 2011, has its own Gelato factory in Dagenham and makes its waffle mix in Dunstable – is exploring new types of venues in cinemas and travel hubs, such as train stations. It is also testing two sites in Tesco supermarkets and is in talks to go international, with the Middle East or the US a likely first step.Rival company Kaspa’s, which has about 100 outlets, has also been on the expansion trail, opening its first central London venue last year, while younger challenger Heavenly Desserts, which has 60 outlets in the UK after recent openings in London and Middlesbrough, is aiming for 100 by next year, with plans for outlets in Bedford, Basildon and Manchester.At the more upmarket end of the scene, Bristol company Swoon Gelato has expanded to Oxford and Bath, and now has a spot in Selfridges department store in London, putting dessert firmly on the fashion menu.Arguably, the concept of a dessert specialist goes back to the early 20th century with the likes of Bettys in Harrogate or Lyons Tea Rooms, or the ice-cream parlours that began opening across the UK from the late 19th century.However, the likes of Creams, Kaspa’s and Heavenly Desserts have given desserts-only venues a youthful twist – with a mix of cakes, waffles, crepes and gelato – aimed at those who want an alternative to the pub or more staid atmosphere of coffee shops and tearooms, which often close at 4pm.View image in fullscreenSwoon Gelato on College Green, Bristol.Photograph: Mr Standfast/AlamySince Creams opened its first outlet in 2011, the dessert shop has become a meeting point for a wide array of British society, from kids and teens, who take over such venues as a place to hang out after school or in the early evening, to family groups and other non-drinkers searching for an alcohol-free place to socialise into the evening, to gen Z mates who increasingly favour booze-free venues and have an eye for the pop of colour an elaborate dessert can add to their social media feeds.At Creams, the decor is reminiscent of a night club, with black walls and spotlights helping to highlight the bubblegum-bright colours of its gelato.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During the day there can be a cosy club crowd of older people who want an unthreatening place to have a treat.”A spokesperson for Heavenly Desserts said it primarily attracts 18- to 35-year-olds. “While we welcome guests of all ages, it’s this younger demographic that most strongly connects with the brand and continues to drive our growth. As a brand, we benefit from the growing desire among younger people for mindful, alcohol-free social experiences,” a spokesperson said.Everett Fieldgate, the chief executive of Creams, says you might find a different demographic attacking the waffles and ice-creams depending on the time of day you enter one of the company’s outlets, which open as late as 3am in some locations.The Australian is giving the brand a new spin with a lighter look intended to appeal more to twentysomethings, families and daytime punters. He has also introduced a healthier range of items – including fruit skewers, albeit drizzled in chocolate – as families try to dial down their sugar intake.“Consumers are definitely holding back, and they’re being very careful with where and how they’re spending money,” says Fieldgate.He says some consumers are looking to cut their spending on their favourite treat while others are downsizing from a meal out to just dessert and Creams is “benefiting from both”. Fieldgate says Creams is also benefiting from the trend for some consumers to take time out – permanently or temporarily – from drinking alcohol, saying to friends, as he puts it: “Let’s go somewhere where I’m not going to be tempted.”In the cost of living crisis, such dessert places may not be cheap, with Creams’ Hot ‘N’ Cold Chocolate Fudge Volcano Sundae costing £10.95, but they are so massive they can be shared and the whole experience is likely to cost less than a full meal out.Fieldgate says 2025 has started well, with sales helped by the warm sunny weather, although he says the group is “keeping a close eye on costs” and being careful to ensure new sites are viable amid higher business rates and wages.He says the hospitality industry needs more help from government to revive high streets and help it fight back against online shopping.“People are holding on by the skin of their teeth because of poor consumer confidence and the constantly increasing cost of doing business,” he says.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryRestaurantsRetail industryDessertUK cost of living crisisIce-cream and sorbetnewsShareReuse this content"

It went on to add that during a hearing in April, Bednar and his attorney “acknowledged that the petition contained fabricated legal authority, which was obtained from ChatGPT, and they accepted responsibility for the contents of the petition”.‘One day I overheard my boss saying: just put it in ChatGPT’: the workers who lost their jobs to AIRead moreAccording to Bednar and his attorney, an “unlicensed law clerk” wrote up the brief and Bednar did not “independently check the accuracy” before he made the filing. ABC4 further reports that Durbano was not involved in the creation of the petition and the law clerk responsible for the filing was a law school graduate who was terminated from the law firm.The outlet added that Bednar offered to pay any related attorney fees to “make amends”.In a statement reported by ABC4, the Utah court of appeals said: “We agree that the use of AI in the preparation of pleadings is a legal research tool that will continue to evolve with advances in technology. However, we emphasize that every attorney has an ongoing duty to review and ensure the accuracy of their court filings. In the present case, petitioner’s counsel fell short of their gatekeeping responsibilities as members of the Utah State Bar when they submitted a petition that contained fake precedent generated by ChatGPT.”As a result of the false citations, ABC4 reports that Bednar was ordered to pay the respondent’s attorney fees for the petition and hearing, refund fees to their client for the time used to prepare the filing and attend the feeling, as well as donate $1,000 to the Utah-based legal non-profit And Justice for All.Explore more on these topicsUtahChatGPTLaw (US)Artificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent.”Taiwan president calls for peace and dialogue with China amid heightened military activityRead moreHe said Donald Trump’s administration hadpushed European countries to boost their defensive spending, taking on a greater “burden” of responding to conflicts in their region, and it was time for Asian nations to do the same.Hegseth, who in March was revealed to have tolda Signal group chat that Europe was “pathetic” and “freeloading”on US security support in the region, told the Singapore conference it was “hard to believe” he was now saying this, but Asian countries should “look to allies in Europe as a newfound example”.“Deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap … time is of the essence.”A new study by the organisation running theSingaporeevent, the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, found that Asian spending on weapons and research is currently spiking, on top of what it said was a relatively consistent annual average spend of 1.5% of GDP.Hegseth said the renewed European focus on their region – particularly the Russia-Ukraine war – allowed the US to shift focus to its “priority theatre” in the Indo-Pacific.Hegseth said the US did not seek to “pressure” Asian countries to “embrace or adopt policies or ideologies”, but instead wanted to “work with you where our shared interests align for peace and prosperity”.“We’re not here to preach to you about climate change or cultural issues,” he said. “But a threat gathers.“We do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not seek to instigate, subjugate or humiliate China. President Trump and US have an immense respect for China and their civilisation. But we will not be pushed out of this critical region.”In his speech Hegseth also took a swipe at the absence of any senior Chinese delegate at this year’s conference. “We are here this morning and, notably, someone else isn’t,” he said.Hegseth also appeared to referencecomments by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the conference on Fridaythat a “sense that [the US’s] promise might not be so ironclad is ushering in a new instability”.Europe and Asia should form ‘positive new alliance’, says Macron in SingaporeRead more“An alliance cannot be ironclad if in reality or perception it is one-sided,” Hegseth said on Saturday. “As allies share the burden we can increase our focus on the Indo-Pacific, our priority theatre.”He said the US would conduct its “first-ever live-fire test of its mid-range capability system in Australia” in coming months, and had expanded cooperations and joint exercises. It would also establish repair capability and capacity programs in the region, including for P-8 radar systems in Australia for the US and its allies, while expanding contracts for regional ship repair.Hegseth’s speech reiterated much of the Trump administration’s defence and security position – blaming the previous administration for problems, pledging to strengthen the US military and secure the US border against unregulated immigration, while repeating plans to “take back the Panama canal”.He said Trump was spending $1tn – a 13% increase – on defence next year, citing advance weapons plans including the controversial Golden Dome.Speaking in Singapore after Hegseth’s address, US Democratic senator Tammy Duckworth told reporters – including the Guardian – that his comments about the US remaining in the Indo-Pacific region were welcome but he found his words “patronising of our friends in the Indo-Pacific in particular”.“I’ve gotta say his idea that we’re going to wrap ourselves around you – we don’t need that kind of language. We just need to stand together,” Duckworth said.“The US is not asking people to choose between the US and [China] … But we will make sure international norms are maintained and ask our friends to help us uphold them.”Duckworth, who is co-leading a bi-partisan delegation which also visited Taiwan, said the Trump administration “acts very quickly, but very incompetently”.“The point I’m making on this trip is that it’s not just about secretary Hegseth and the Trump administration,” she said. “Bipartisan support for the Indo Pacific in the legislature is actually growing.”Explore more on these topicsPete HegsethUS foreign policyUS defence spendingAsia PacificSingaporeTaiwanTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They are attacked in their own homes, when fleeing violence, getting food, collecting firewood, working in the fields. They tell us they feel trapped,” said Claire San Filippo, MSF emergency coordinator, who called on the warring parties to hold their fighters to account.“These attacks are heinous and cruel, often involving multiple perpetrators. This must stop.Sexual violenceis not a natural or inevitable consequence of war, it can constitute a war crime, a form of torture, and a crime against humanity.”Several women who gave testimonies to MSF described raids where fighters killed all the boys and men in a place before raping women and girls.A 27-year-old nurse said she was raped last year by fighters who accused her of treating Sudanese army soldiers.“I want protection now; I don’t want to be raped again … I was too afraid to go to the hospital. My family told me, “Don’t tell anybody”. I don’t have any more pain. But I have nightmares about it,” she said.MSF said that 56% of the sexual violence they documented was perpetrated by non-civilians.Women and girls having to walk long distances to gather food and water put them in particular danger, the report said. A third of women and girls were attacked while travelling to or working in fields.View image in fullscreenPatients queue for treatment next to an MSF health post in Tawila Umda.Photograph: Thibault Fendler/MSFSince April 2023, Darfur has witnessed asurge in human rights abusesas it has been taken over by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary and allied militias as they fight for control against the government’s Sudanese armed forces.The fighting has recently been concentrated around the city of El Fasher, where conditions have deteriorated rapidly for civilians.

Why has the west turned its back on Sudan?Read more“Sexual violence has become an everyday reality for women and girls in Darfur, along with the rise in sexually transmitted diseases,” said Siha’s head, Hala al-Karib, who said the international community had abandoned women in Darfur.Karib said the violence had been escalating since before the current conflict because of the withdrawa of a UN and African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur that had provided some protection to local communities.“The peacekeeping mission primarily contributed to the safety and security of women by patrolling roads and enabling them to access their farmlands, while also securing displaced camps,” said Karib.“The level of neglect toward women in Darfur is staggering. This region is experiencing active genocidal acts, horrific war crimes, and famine due to a siege on livelihoods by all actors.

Subsequent findings that some video was AI-generated have called into question his story.Peng told the investigators thatabout 20 minutes into his practice hewas caught in a strong updraft, which sent him soaring more than 5,000 metres higher, in line with flight paths and nearly the height of Mount Everest.In a video filmed on the ground, Peng said: “My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio.”A new start after 60: I dreamt of paragliding for 30 years. When I took to the skies at 80 I felt completely freeRead moreVideo purported to be from Peng’s mounted camera went viral, but has since been challenged over its veracity. At least some parts of it are believed to have been AI generated. NBC News said the first five seconds of the footage provided by China’s state broadcaster CCTV, and distributed by Reuters, had been determined to be AI-generated.Authorities praised Peng’s survival, conceding it was an accident. A “normal person cannot be exposed at 8,000 metres without oxygen [so] this is not something that can be done voluntarily” said a sports bureau official, according toSixth Tone.But Peng, who has about five years’ experience paragliding, never intended to leave ground level and so had not registered any flight plans, meaning his ordeal was “not subject to relevant approvals”, the report said. In response, he was banned from flying for six months.The bureaureport, based on an interview with Peng, said he was in the air for more than an hour, and had stayed in radio contact with his friend, Gu Zhimin, who was still on the ground.The report said he had attempted to descend but his efforts were “ineffective”, and as he flew higher he became confused and briefly lost consciousness.Peng said hewas eventually able to land about 30km from the launch site, where he was met by Gu and another friend.Gu later posted a composite video to Douyin, China’s domestic version of TikTok, where it soon went viral.The video drew the ire of authorities.“Gu Zhimin posted a flight video without permission, which had a bad impact,” the report said. “He was grounded for six months and asked to write a report to deeply reflect on the negative impact of his behaviour.”The bureau said any record broken by Peng’s flight would not be officially counted because his flight was not registered.If Peng did fly to the reported height, there is precedent for survival, including the world record of 9,946m set by German paraglider Ewa Wiśnierska in 2007, whenshe was caught in a similar updraftwhile paragliding in Australia. Wiśnierska was unconscious for about 40 minutes, only learning how high she had flown after safely landing and checking her flight data.Additional research by Lillian Yang.This article was amended on 31 May 2025 after it emerged that some of the video of the flight appears to have been AI generated. A video that accompanied the earlier version of the article, and which included the since-disputed content, has also been removed.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificExtreme sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

During the days after the announcement of my new small press, Conduit Books, the conversation about the balance and representation of women and men in publishing roared back into life. The reason was that, initially at least, Conduit Books will publish literary fiction and memoir by male authors; a modest attempt to address the relatively recent scarcity of young or new male writers in the small world of UK fiction.By and large, the response to the press has been positive and encouraging, with more than 1,000 submissions from around the world (some of which are from men called Reaper Hound or Silent Oath, names their parents might not have given them). We’ve received support from many female novelists (and vocal feminists), as well as women working in publishing. There have been comment pieces across the media.Inevitably, there has been pushback, but also valid criticism asking whether such a press is necessary. There has also been a very small amount of abuse, and attempts to align the press with the toxic axis of Donald Trump and Andrew Tate and the so-called men’s rights movement. This was wearying, though perhaps predictable. My own politics are certainly not anti-woke and do not align in any way with that sorry swamp of hate. I turned down a TV interview withGB Newsas I felt they wanted to talk less about literature and more about the spurious culture wars, with the danger that the debate might have been twisted into an adversarial contest between male and female authors and how much space they have been afforded, now and historically.The fact is, a cursory look at the current literary scene will reveal that new male authors, for complex reasons, are not getting through. In April 2025, the Bookseller’s top 10 fiction picks for the month included no men whatsoever. The all-female literary prize longlist or shortlist has become more common – current examples are the longlist for the inaugural Climate fiction prize, and the shortlist for the 2025 Encore award for a second novel. Having just judged a literary prize (the Republic of Consciousness prize for small presses), I know that all those long- and shortlisted entries were the best books. It’s too important (for both author and publisher) for it to be otherwise.There are liberal and progressive narratives addressing fatherhood and masculinity that are simply not getting publishedThere was never any nefarious plot to exclude male authors, but the judges can only draw books from what’s available. The situation is merely symptomatic of the way publishing has evolved over the last 15 years. Roughly 80% of fiction commissioning editors are women, and it’s understandable they want work that resonates with them. And this often divides along gender lines. After all, to publish literary fiction, which doesn’t usually sell unless it has been prize-nominated or gains word-of-mouth traction, is often to put your job on the line.Fifty-two years ago, the brilliant Virago began publishing books by women with the intention of addressing inequalities in the wider society, many of which are still with us. Conduit Books doesn’t have a political or polemical dimension. After 3,000 years of patriarchy, no one is pretending men are hard done by or not represented in the arts. But there is the pressing problem of what young men read, especially given the current political climate. There are liberal and progressive narratives addressing fatherhood, masculinity, working-class male experience, and negotiating the 21st century as a man, that are simply not getting published. I would like to read them. I would also rather young men read these than the internet. I have an eight-year-old son. I worry about what he will be reading in a few years’ time.I’m still not sure whether Wilde was right. To the trolls I say, there’s no shortage of real misogynists and racists out there. Maybe go after them instead? In the meantime, grown-up debate is welcome. Conduit Books was started in good faith, and I’m excited at the prospect of bringing some outstanding fiction and memoir into the world that might otherwise have been passed by.Jacob’s Advice by Jude Cook is published by Unbound.Submissions to Conduit Books are open until31 May atconduitbooks.co.ukView image in fullscreenAnne Enright, authorI am sure other people will point out that women doing well, or even better, for two good seconds after millennia of oppression should not be declared a crisis in masculinity – why would it be? Also that male writers continue to do very well when it comes to prestige (there were more men called Paul on the 2023 Booker shortlist than there were women, and all that). The majority female readership is generous to male writers, while male readers continue to be reluctant about reading and praising women. My own feminism has always included men, however the conversation about gender has been one-sided for too long, so I am delighted to see them joining in.The majority female readership is generous to male writers, while male readers continue to be reluctant about reading and praising womenYou could argue that one of the purposes of fiction is liberation, and men need that too. As a form, the novel loves going beneath the surface and it loves an underdog – Irish writers have always known it is great at lifting people up. So I would say to a men-only press, “Go for it!”, with one or two thoughts on the side.More books are being published today than ever before, and this includes more books by men. I have seen publishers eat up novels by younger men (especially Irish men, I am glad to say). I have seen them fall on such books with relief that they exist and that they are good. I don’t see any problem with men getting published, when those men are not misogynistic, because it is actually misogyny that has gone out of fashion, not male writers. I worry about men who miss all that, and who miss the inflated, undeserved feeling of importance of the good old days. That said, all writing involves an amount of self-belief, even of self-aggrandisement, and I have also seen sadness and uncertainty in young male talent looking to find a way through.Given the fact that there are a gazillion books by men out there already, the men-only thing may be less a statement about gender in late capitalism than a marketing ploy. I hope it is more than that. I hope this new press brings something to the party. I hope it captures and reinvigorates a male readership. It will be interesting to see which authors are keen to be published by such a press, and what they have to say.The Wren,the Wren by Anne Enright is published byVintage.View image in fullscreenNikesh Shukla, authorIf you want to know how young men are engaging with fiction, with books, with popular culture, ask children’s writers, ask YA writers. We do weekly visits up and down the country, and I honestly don’t know who is better placed than a teacher or school librarian to talk about men’s reading habits.I remember once visiting a boys’ school to talk about my novel The Boxer. My talk, about the racist attack that spurred me on to learn to box, about mental health, about softness and vulnerability, about how anger can be a positive force when channelled by the right people, always goes down well. That one day, I was told to use up the full hour with talking because the boys wouldn’t really be interested and they wouldn’t be asking questions. However, I could feel the energy in the room, them leaning forward as I told my story. And so, halfway through, wanting to bring them into the conversation, I asked if any of them had any questions. A kid put up his hand and asked what product I used in my hair, and before I could answer, someone at the school sent the boy out of the room. Apparently that wasn’t a question to ask an author. I asked that he not be sent out, and noted that he was just making a connection, and I told him I used [redacted] in my hair.It struck me as an interesting moment. The position of author is a revered one. An elite one. I was told afterwards that not many authors visited this school because it couldn’t afford to pay them. And I understood that perhaps the thing that’s acting as a barrier to boys is the institution of literature itself. It’s seen as elitist. As white, middle class, something for other people. Because not enough authors are going into schools and talking to these kids and making connections.I’m interested in what Conduit Books does and how it plans to engage with its audience. Finding and publishing the books isn’t even half the battle; if anything, it’s only a small fraction. It’s finding the audience and engaging with them on their terms that’s most of the battle. Ask any children’s or YA author.Brown Baby by Nikesh Shukla is published by Bluebird.View image in fullscreenLeo Robson, authorAnyone who knows anything about anything, or at least about the English novel, knows that it can never be “too female”. When the literary critic FR Leavis set out his “great tradition” in the late 1940s, he identified four “great English novelists”, only two of whom were English: Jane Austen and George Eliot. He was using his favoured formulation to mean something quite specific: “the tradition to which what is great in English fiction belongs”, something native and distinctive which he called “a vital capacity for experience, a kind of reverent openness before life, and a marked moral intensity”. Leavis named one, more recent, writer: DH Lawrence. Finally, an English-born male! But Angela Carter, writing a little over a decade later, insisted on Lawrence’s “‘feminine’ qualities: sensitivity, vulnerability and perception”. (Lawrence’s tragedy, she wrote, is that “he thought he was a man”.)There are stories addressing fatherhood and masculinity that are simply not getting publishedThere have been periods when male novelists consumed most of the attention: notably in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it was deemed necessary to found a women’s prize for fiction. But everyone knew that the leading English novelists were Penelope Fitzgerald and Iris Murdoch, who wrote often and brilliantly about men (all six of Murdoch’s first-person novels are written from a male perspective). Any such list today would include Deborah Levy, Zadie Smith, Gwendoline Riley, Claire-Louise Bennett, Bernardine Evaristo.Of course I am exaggerating, slightly. There have been some decent male novelists. If this were not the case, it would have been somewhat presumptuous or arrogant to have attempted writing a novel myself. When I judged the Goldsmiths prize, we ended up with an all-male shortlist, and refused to apologise. Perhaps it’s true that fiction has recently been dominated by female writers: publishing is too amorphous to determine these patterns with real authority, and certainly no one could read enough to decide if the dominance is legitimate. But as a male reader and writer, I feel no cause for complaint, or hunger for correction.The Boys by Leo Robson ispublished by Riverrun.View image in fullscreenSarah Moss, authorThe idea of “correcting” women’s domination of literary fiction is troubling. Since Frances Burney and Jane Austen, women have been the novel’s primary readers and writers. As Austen points out in Northanger Abbey, fiction was often disparaged for its femininity. The more serious genres of sermons and self-improvement handbooks of her era fret that young women waste too much time hiding in their bedrooms reading romances that lead to unrealistic expectations of men and marriage, and there’s deep suspicion about what women might get up to between the printed sheets. Novels have always been where women go wild.The idea of ‘correcting’ women’s domination of literary fiction is troublingI suspect that if there is a problem with men’s literary fiction, it’s as much to do with reading as writing. The gender (im)balance of audiences at book events suggests that men much prefer to read nonfiction: mostly rational, quantifiable truths about science, history and politics, though also sometimes travel and life writing, almost always by men. If patriarchy means that some men miss out on the joys of literature, that’s quite low on the list of its harms and also unlikely to be fixed by setting up a men’s publishing house. I wonder also how much this is a British problem, because I can immediately think of dozens of Irish men, established and emerging writers, publishing very well-received novels.I’ve sometimes offered students a false binary (all binaries are false): some novels are mirrors, showing us ourselves in a different light; some are windows, letting us in to unfamiliar worlds. As a teenager I read the big dicks of the 1990s, partly, in retrospect, because I wanted to know how men thought, though also because some of them wrote excellent sentences. I could not see that their perspective was so normalised I had no need to go looking.That reading might have been less harmful to me had my interest been reciprocated. Mostly men don’t read fiction by women and they certainly don’t buy it. (There are exceptions, don’t write in. I live with three of them.) Older men sometimes write to me saying that while they would never normally dream of picking up a novel and especially not one by a woman, their wife insisted that they try mine and actually it’s surprisingly good. They thought I’d like to know. Many men, it seems, experience no curiosity about the female gaze, or women’s experiences. Maybe women, who always used to read men and buy their books, are beginning to return the compliment.All binaries are false. Intersectionality matters, and gender is rarely our most important characteristic. It’s easier to think and write from another gender than another class or national or racial perspective.That said, I’m all in favour of men doing the work on masculinity, toxic and otherwise. Men need space and support to explore emotions beyond anger, to be open and curious about their own and others’ lives, to try out other eyes and other voices, all of which fiction might plausibly do. I’ve no objection to men having a room of their own, as long as they do their own housework.Ripeness by Sarah Moss is published by Picador.Explore more on these topicsBooksFictionPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He’s perfect in this gentle, humane tale of a washed-up sportsman trying to regain his mojo as a mentorRhik SamadderSat 31 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 02.02 EDTShareGolf is – apologies to fans, the ground is gonna get a little rough – inert material for TV and film. It’s not explosively combative like say football, either American or actual. In golf, players interact with the environment, not each other. There is no time pressure. Physical adjustments are minute, the airborne ball impossible to see. For casual spectators, the experience mostly amounts to watching a middle-aged man shuffle above a tiny ball, like an emperor penguin sitting on an egg. The sound of even a world-beating putt is a soft plop.However, a lack of basic knowledge brought me late to Friday Night Lights, a show that became one of my favourites. I’d like to avoid making that mistake with Stick (Apple TV+, from Wednesday 4 June), so let’s see. Wisely, the show isn’t aiming at FNL’s grit and spunk, blue-collar catharsis. Stick is funny, in a gentle, humane way. Clearly, Apple+ is attempting to hit its own marker again, the one with “Ted Lasso” written on it in gold.Owen Wilsonplays Pryce Cahill, a former pro golfer reduced to coaching retirees and pulling short cons in bars. When he catches Latino teenager Santi (Peter Dager) sneaking on to the range where he works, to ragefully hammer balls, Pryce realises the boy is a prodigy and offers to coach him. Together with his old caddy and the boy’s mother, they road trip between tournaments in search of fortune. But do you know what? I think they might find something deeper.Stick’s credit sequence features a ukulele playing over a series of watercolours, so you know this isn’tThe Wire. It’s feelgood! Expect light bickering and dissolvable disputes! Frequent sporting metaphors for emotional growth! LikeCommunity– a comedy that offered a self-aware take on the inspirational speech – Stick is aware that if you stretch such metaphors too far, they snap back into parody. “I used to think she liked me, but she loves you,” whispers Pryce to his protege, very much in the vein of “playing golf is like making love to a beautiful woman”. The show just about manages to have its cake and eat it.You don’t need Google to enjoy Stick. I let references to knockdowns, casting and holding the finish wash over me like suds in the bath. Dager looks good swinging a stick, while Mariana Treviño, as his forthright mom Elena, improves every scene she’s in.Marc Maronis winning as Mitts, a curmudgeonly caddy with a hidden heart – a trope he’s made his own. The show finds its groove with the addition of Lilli Kay as Zero, a defiant club worker and love interest. With a she/they character on board, the show gets to prod at generational tension, and the problematic imbalance of mentor relationships. When Pryce admonishes Santi for his discipline, Zero warns him to stop “prescribing late stage capitalist ideology to your great brown cash cow”. Elena advises Pryce to back off, without backing down. “They smell fear, the gen Z-ers.”Driving it all, like a high MOI titanium club, isOwen Wilson. Something about Wilson’s hair invariably makes me wonder when a weed pipe is going to appear on screen (the answer is seven minutes into the first episode). It’s easy to forget he’s also an Oscar-nominated writer and subtle actor. With his goofy voice, broken nose and wounded smile, he excels at playing characters who are both boyish and washed-up, full of good cheer dented by time. He’s perfect as the broke, dragging-his-heels-through-a-divorce Pryce, whose Ryder Cup career ended with a televised mental breakdown on a fairway years ago.Aficionados will enjoy debating the finer points of Santi’s swing. The directors get round the invisible ball problem with soaring drones and POV shots, to inject visual flair and kineticism. The show promises cameos from real-life pros including Max Homa, Wyndham Clark and Collin Morikawa for a frisson of authenticity. With Happy Gilmore 2 coming to Netflix in July, golf fans are spoilt for choice.Which doesn’t leave the rest of us out in the cold. Sport in dramas is a vehicle for storytelling, rather than being the story itself. Another tricky mentor relationship is fathering, the show’s real theme. A few episodes in, I care enough to see how it plays out. Can Stick stick the landing? I wouldn’t bet against it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherOwen WilsonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The children are the stars and they are going to be on screen all the time.“I can’t imagine many days filming when you haven’t got any children on set, so I think they are going to be in there most of the time and working very hard. They will be out of school for a period of six to nine months to film and complete each series.”Nathaniel McCullagh, a co-founder ofSimply Learning Tuition, who has worked on both sides of the camera as a tutor and a director, predicted: “They’ll probably have a school at Leavesden that is essentially a series of classrooms with subject tutors, and they’ll wheel the children in and out of class just like a mini-school.“When you start building that level of establishment you’ll need management – a head teacher, a director of studies, individual tutors. It’s far more complex than a typical on-set tutor who is tasked with looking after a couple of kids for a few hours each day for a month.“I don’t know who is going to get the gig, but it’s a wonderful opportunity to look after maybe 30 children for months at a time and maybe longer ... They have got those children for 10 years or thereabouts, and they’ll be responsible for their entire education.”View image in fullscreenEmma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint starred in the Harry Potter film series for 10 years from 2001.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAJudith Phillips, who worked as a tutor on the original Harry Potter films, has previouslytold the Guardianthat the aim is for children to get at least 15 hours of teaching a week, with tutors on call from 8am. For crowd scenes such as Quidditch matches, up to 400 children could be involved.“Time is money on the film set, so when you get a knock on the door saying they need your pupil on set, it’s not a case of finishing up what you’re working on – it’s put your pen down and go,” Phillips said.Austin said the child actors she worked with were usually eager to be tutored. “The students we meet are very hard-working in general, I’ve yet to meet one who is a precocious brat. There are long, very boring days on film sets. Maybe in Hollywood it might be different but we’ve worked with a wide range of child actors and we’ve never had an issue with any of the students.”McCullagh, whose company has tutored child actors in Hollywood blockbusters, said chaperones played a vital role in managing children’s workload and making sure productions stick to the legal time limits on work, which vary with age.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lighting changes, the actors don’t quite pull off the performance they need or the director wants something different. So there’s always the temptation to say to a child: ‘Can you just do another take?’ That’s when the chaperone has to step in and say: ‘No’.“If children are on set being filmed two hours a day, they’ll be in makeup and wardrobe for another two hours,” McCullagh added. “They’ll be transported from wherever they are staying, but as soon as they get in the car or step into makeup, the clock starts ticking. It’s an enormous race against time to try and get them in front of the camera and do some acting.”A ‘Black Snape’ in the new Harry Potter seems designed to cause controversy – but it could work | Jason OkundayeRead moreCharles Bonas, the founder ofBonas MacFarlaneeducation consultancy, worked with some of the child actors on the original Harry Potter films. He said that while those playing the major roles had “basically hit the jackpot”, they were still having to give things up – as were those with smaller but still time-consuming parts.“There’s a wide point to make about what is in the best interest of the child,” Bonas said. “With these kids, like it or not, their academic education is going to take a back seat. And if you said that to almost anyone else they’d ask: ‘Is it worth it?’“There’s a lot of childhood they’ll miss out on because they are sitting in these studios all day working with adults.”Explore more on these topicsTutoringTelevisionHarry PotterSchoolsChildrenHBOWarner BrosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was made up of 24 squares, bright blocks of colour, each crafted with simple, uneven purl stitches. Looking at it, I could imagine the small hands still learning to master their needles and could almost hear the adult voice leading them. “The prime minister is having a baby. Shall our class make a gift for her family?”The response to the announcement about my pregnancy in January 2018 was almost overwhelming. It began with so many emails. In the 24 hours after the news broke, the person who managed correspondence for me said she’d never seen such an influx.I had braced for the worst. I was a public figure, used to judgment and scrutiny. Now I was pregnant and unwedHandmade gifts arrived at the office, too. The correspondence team created a display table, and within days it overflowed.I had braced for the worst. I was a public figure, used to judgment and scrutiny. Now I was pregnant and unwed. I was also new to the job. If people wanted to have a go at me, they had plenty of reason to. But I hadn’t considered a fundamental truth: that politicians are humans first, and perhaps the public hadn’t lost sight of that. And so maybe in the beautiful country ofNew Zealand, the happy news of a baby could be just that: happy.But for all this support, my pregnancy added a new kind of pressure. I was only the second world leader in history to have a baby in office. The first was Benazir Bhutto. She was the first woman to lead Pakistan, and in 1990, two years into her first term in office she had a baby girl. I didn’t think the world’s eyes were on me, but I did think naysayers’ were. Those who might be waiting to say: See, you can’t do a demanding job like that and be a mother.Not long after I’d made my announcement, I was at an event, speaking with a woman who’d had an impressive career in the corporate sector. While we were talking, I’d forgotten something minor – a word, or a name, perhaps – and I’d laughed off my memory lapse. “Baby brain,” I said.She hadn’t laughed. Her eyes were serious, her voice firm. “You absolutely cannot say that.” She was warning me: if you give your opponents any opening whatsoever, they will use your pregnancy to say that you – or any woman – shouldn’t be given a position of authority. I knew this, but suddenly I was reminded how easy such a lapse could be. From then on, I treated my pregnancy like a test, a set of hurdles to get through without breaking a sweat.View image in fullscreenAttending Polyfest – the largest Polynesian festival in the world – in Auckland, March 2018.Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty ImagesBy March, I was six months pregnant on a Pacific mission with a group of delegates to Tonga, Samoa, Niue and the Cook Islands. The goal was to position New Zealand as the Pacific nation we were, shifting the relationship with these countries away from a donor and recipient dynamic toward one of partnership.The media were with us around the clock. They travelled on the plane with me. They were on the ground with me, at every event, meeting and meal. I decided that if they were going to be my constant companions, then I would show them, pregnancy or not, that I had stamina.The air was sweltering throughout the tour, and at one press conference I could see streaks of sweat trickling down journalists’ faces. I was dressed modestly, my arms and knees covered, and before long my feet began to swell, and my shoes dug into my skin painfully. Rather than wrap things up, I kept going until there were no more questions, long after the time available had passed. Only then, when I was certain I hadn’t been the one to cave, I hobbled away to shove my feet into a cold bath.A month later, now seven months pregnant, I picked up a letter from my obstetrician confirming, should an airline ask, that I was fit to fly so late in my pregnancy. The Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) was being held in London. Queen Elizabeth II, our head of state, would preside over it. We gathered at Buckingham Palace for the opening session and a formal photo. Before the leaders filed into the room with its bright red carpet, white and gold pillars framing the royal ensign that hung as a backdrop, ushers ordered us into lines. I jokingly asked whether the lines would be organised “boy, girl, boy, girl”. They looked at me for a moment, perhaps trying to decide whether to take the comment seriously, before moving on to the next leader. Of course I hadn’t been serious. There were 53 leaders at the meeting. Only five of us were women.Clarke relished being in the group of international leaders’ spouses. He enthusiastically joined the formal programme, which included afternoon teas and garden toursMy partner, Clarke, meanwhile, was having the inverse experience, as one of very few men in the group of international leaders’ spouses, and he was relishing it. He enthusiastically joined the formal spousal programme, which included afternoon teas and garden tours. He made a studious effort to get to know “the wives”. One night, I told Clarke I needed to have a conversation with a leader I had been struggling to connect with. “Well, if it helps,” he told me, “his wife has an extensive orchid collection.”The opening night for the meeting was a formal affair. To accommodate my bump, I’d had a gown specially made by a New Zealand designer, Juliette Hogan – a flowy mustard number, which I wore with a kākahu, a traditional Māori cloak woven from flax and covered with feathers. Next to me, Clarke, who hadn’t even owned a suit when we first met, looked handsome in his tuxedo. As we walked through the halls of Buckingham Palace, we marvelled at the beauty and the history of everything we saw. I looked over at him. He was every bit the statesman, but just 20 minutes earlier he’d been standing in front of a mirror and screaming blue murder at the person back in New Zealand who told him a freestyle bow tie was a good idea.View image in fullscreenWith Queen Elizabeth II, 2018.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesThat was life in those first few months: incredible, unreal moments, mixed in with the daily reality of having a job to do. Like any job, there was a tremendous amount to get done: papers to sign, press conferences, events, shoes to strap on, bow ties that won’t do up. It was all still life – just a very different one.While in London, we met Queen Elizabeth. She had, of course, raised children in the public eye, so in our private meeting I asked if she had any advice. “You just get on with it,” she said simply. She sounded so matter of fact, just as my grandma Margaret might have.I squeezed the package I was holding, a gift for the queen. It was a framed image of her during a royal tour to New Zealand in 1953, her head back in a full relaxed laugh. You just get on with it. Of course you do.This is an edited extract from A Different Kind of Power: A Memoir by Jacinda Ardern, published globally on 3 June byPan Macmillan in the UK;Crown in the US(a division of Penguin Random House LLC);Penguin Random House NZ; andPenguin Random House Australia.To support the Guardian, order a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

But if you happen to walk by a Smyths toy shop at midnight on 4 June, you may encounter a blast from the past: excitable people, most in their teens or 20s, possibly discussing Mario Kart.They will be waiting to buy the Nintendo Switch 2, the first majorgames console launchsince 2020 and potentially the biggest of all time.What’s particularly notable about this launch isn’t the queues but just how few there will be. About 10 years ago, the midnight launch fad started to fade away. More and more players were buying digital copies of games, which meant they could download and start playing them straight away without leaving their homes.View image in fullscreenThe Nintendo Switch 2 could be the biggest games launch of all time.Photograph: Richard Drew/APIt means that this time around, Smyths is the only UK chain taking part. Even in the States, the home of frenzied launch-day consumerism, only Best Buy and Nintendo’s own stores in San Francisco and New York have confirmed midnight openings.This is a stark contrast to the noughties and early 2010s. Back then, thanks to the vast global success of the PlayStation, Wii and Xbox consoles, video game launch events for titles such as Call of Duty, Halo and Grand Theft Auto were supported by thousands of stores around the world, and the biggest were extravagantly stage-managed.Microsoft’s Halo 3 launch events in the US were accompanied by dozens of actors dressed as space marines; Bill Gates himself showed up at the Seattle branch of Best Buy. In the UK, the Call of Duty Ghosts event at the Westfield in Stratford hired a drill sergeant to yell at customers.I got to play Nintendo Switch 2: hands-on with 2025’s gaming must-haveRead more“My favourite was Skyrim,” says Greg Weller, who was then the UK marketing manager for Bethesda Softworks. “We got the specs of Game’s flagship store on Oxford Street and covered the whole front with Elder Scrolls artwork. We put a snow machine on the roof, so we made it snow in November on Oxford Street. We had press there, we had a cosplay competition, there was a humongous queue, and so many people were dressed up – they wanted to be part of the story, part of the community.”Console launches were a major phenomenon on a par with any movie premiere. For the launch of the Xbox One in 2013, Microsoft took over Leicester Square, building a vast Xbox-branded globe in the centre where the musicians Plan B and Katy B performed. A fortnight earlier, Sony took over the Standard High Line hotel in New York and turned it into a giant video game arcade with developers showing off their wares to thousands of gamers.For the stores and game publishers, these lavish launch events increased footfall and generated word of mouth and press coverage. For the fans, they were a way to feel part of something. “Growing up as a gamer in the 90s, we were quite ostracised for the hobby,” says Rich Thompson, now a developer and founder of Black Rose Studio in Hull. “But then having shops opening at midnight, it was mind-blowing. When Fallout 4 came out, our local Game store hired a DJ; it was a party atmosphere, there were hundreds of us there. I vividly remember people swapping contact details in the queue – you were among your people.”It wasn’t all fun and games, however. Midnight launches sometimes descended into chaos. “The problem was, you’d have one shop open in a city centre that’s full of people coming out of the pub,” says Thompson. “Drunk people would come into these launches, cause a scene and refuse to leave. I remember a huge fight breaking out at one Fifa launch night. Getting thrown out of a midnight game launch became a badge of honour.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(He later told a local newspaper that, though seriously injured, he still staggered into the store to pick up his console.) In London, the Metropolitan police were so concerned about violence that they banned PlayStation 3 midnight launch events at all shops throughout the city apart from the Virgin Megastore on Oxford Street.The transition to digital media, stiff competition from online firms such as Amazon and the disaster of the Covid lockdowns meant specialist high street chains began to close. Game once had more than 600 shops in the UK; now it has about 240. According to data from the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association, UK physical game sales dropped by 35% last year.Will theNintendo Switch2 launch turn things around? As we’ve seen with the vinyl revival and the unexpected incline of Blu-ray sales (due in part to consumer frustration with ad-riddled streaming sites), physical media is gaining popularity once more.There does seem to be a growing revival of interest in physical games. Boutique publishers such as Strictly Limited and Limited Run are producing beautifully packaged editions of modern and classic titles, while game cafes and retro arcades are on the rise.And, after all, the experiential nature of the launch event, the buzz, the social pleasures, is not something that can be replicated by an online purchase.“I got my dad to drive me to a store at midnight for the Xbox launch,” recalls Thompson. “He’d just finished a 12-hour shift. He thought it was just going to be us, but there was a huge queue. The staff were handing out drinks, Limp Bizkit were playing on a stereo system – for 13-year-old me it was just the coolest thing I could imagine. I looked up at my dad and he wasn’t a gamer but he was excited too – there was an energy. All these people just turning up at midnight for a party in a shop.”Explore more on these topicsNintendo SwitchNintendoGames consolesGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Picture Post’s unique characteristic was that it was accessible to all, but did not patronise the ordinary people whose lives were reflected in its pages.The magazine documented the postwar social change that resulted from the Beveridge report of 1942. Among other examples, Chillingworth contributed images of a social worker in Nelson, Lancashire, in 1954, showing her engaged in the delicate task of combing out the newly washed hair of an elderly woman seated at the kitchen table. As if in contrast, he followed up with a feature on elegant fashion models in Paris and London. A picture of the Leigh rugby player “Nebby” Cleworth at work as a labourer on a weekday between games celebrated the dignity of labour rather than the glamour of winning a match.View image in fullscreenChillingworth at work on a beach, August 1952.Photograph: Daniel Farson/Getty ImagesChillingworth delighted in a sense of place and character, encountering the specific in the general, and local identity in a capital city. He developed a naturalistic style, and was able to pass unnoticed on assignment. Elements of the past often entered his photo stories, however contemporary. Jewish Whitechapel (1952) shows a news agency, its windows boarded and broken and an ad for the Jewish Evening News painted on the frontage, too high to deface. Nearby is a Jewish tailor’s shop beside a large advert for a local theatre company, its text in Hebrew, offering the real sense of a distinct London community.Although he worked at Picture Post for only a short time – around nine years, on and off – it was an important period for Chillingworth. During the 1990s, when he regularly visited the Centre for Journalism Studies at Cardiff University, where I was working at the time, his conversation remained very much focused on his time at Picture Post and its “family” of photojournalists.View image in fullscreenRugby player “Nebby” Cleworth working as a labourer between games, 17 December 1949.Photograph: John Chillingworth/Getty ImagesBorn in the working-class district of Upper Holloway, north London, Chillingworth shared and understood the background of many of his subjects. His father, John, was an official with the National Union of Journalists. His mother, Georgina (nee Winterbourn, and known as “Mabs”), was a housewife. The eldest of four children, John attended St Mary’s Church of England primary school in Hornsey, then St David and St Catherine’s secondary, which he left, like many of his peers, aged 15.Although he scarcely knew what the job would involve, he signed up soon afterwards as Picture Post’s tea maker. On finding the darkroom more interesting than the office kitchen, he began spending his spare time learning and assimilating all he could.Picture Post photographers generally brought their camera films to be developed in the office. Alongside and observing the likes of Bill Brandt, Thurston Hopkins, Merlyn Severn and Bert Hardy, and a growing influx of émigré photographers including Gerti Deutsch, Felix Man (Baumann) and Kurt Hutton (Hübschmann), Chillingworth was an eager and adept tutee. Hutton in particular took Chillingworth under his wing, encouraging him to experiment with a camera, and remaining a lasting friend and mentor. Through Hutton, Chillingworth acquired the skill of passing unobserved in a crowd. Like him, he transitioned to becoming a staffer rather than an occasional contributor.According to the author and publisher Dewi Lewis in his monograph John Chillingworth: Picture Post Photographer (2013): “He was soon producing a vast range of photo stories of a very high quality. Encouraged by Picture Post’s legendary editor Tom Hopkinson, Chillingworth learned to combine “storytelling” images with the written word, and worked with some of the finest magazine journalists of the age.View image in fullscreenA 1954 Chillingworth photo of a social worker with her elderly client.Photograph: John Chillingworth/Getty ImagesHaving been too young to serve during the second world war, in 1946 he undertook national service with the Royal Engineers, returning to Picture Post’s office in Holborn in 1949. He left only a year before its demise in 1957.A picture taken of Chillingworth by Dan Farson on a beach in 1956 shows him clad only in shorts under a burning sun. All Chillingworth is wearing above the waist are a pair of cameras: a Leica strung around his neck and a Rolleiflex around his midriff. It is a fine example of Hutton’s advice taken to heart: a high-speed Leica for shots taken of moving or changing subjects; a weightier Rollei to capture a portrait, pose or perspective taken with careful preparation.On leaving Picture Post, he continued his photographic career as a freelance. He established his own business and freelanced abroad, in locations from Japan and Laos to Siberia and India, on commissions for the press as well as major industrial and advertising clients. Later he became visual communication partner in an advertising consultancy, and a marketing consultant for the Hulton picture archive (now incorporated into Getty Images), which holds images for more than 400 of the picture stories featured in Picture Post.In 1989 a selection of Chillingworth’s work was exhibited in 150 Years ofPhotographyat the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford. In the same year he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, described as “one of the makers of photographic history”.He is survived by his third wife, Ros (nee Taylor), whom he married in 1987, four children from two earlier marriages, and his sister, Ann.John Chillingworth, photographer, born 18 January 1928; died 6 April 2025Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMagazinesobituariesShareReuse this content"

The red flags were there from the start, but I ignored them all. When I stayed at his, he didn’t have a towel to offer me, and he never changed his sheets. It became obvious that he didn’t know how to look after himself. Even though, in reality, he could survive without me (similar to how a teenage boy would survive on his own, eating burgers in bed), I felt like, if I wasn’t there to buy groceries, cook and clean, he might die. He would disappear for days, on a drink- or drugs-fuelled bender, and I’d assume he’d overdosed in a basement somewhere. I lived in fear that something terrible would happen to him. I became his boyfriend and his caregiver.This was a familiar role for me: I’d done it in all my previous relationships. I needed to be needed. If the person I was dating didn’t need me, then what value did I have? I found safety in taking care of someone. This started as a family dynamic: as the eldest child, I had to look out for my younger brothers, and learned to overlook my own needs. Then, when I was 14, my girlfriend died in a drug-related car accident. My therapist helped me to see the connection; that because I couldn’t save her, I sought romantic relationships with men or women I thought I could save instead.I hadn’t seen how much I was damaging myself by trying to help him. And that I never would never be able toOne evening, after being recommended it by Netflix, I began watching Beautiful Boy, a film about the breakdown of a father’s relationship with his son, who is an addict. It was about halfway through that I decided to leave my relationship. When Steve Carell’s character (David) hangs up onTimothée Chalamet(Nic), saying, “I wish I could help you, but I can’t do that,” I knew I couldn’t either. I admired the strength it took to end the cycle of trying (and failing) to save his son.Even though he was my boyfriend and three years older, I related to the father-son dynamic in Beautiful Boy. I felt responsible for him, and he would tell me that he would die without me, threatening to take his own life. Until then, I hadn’t seen how much I was damaging myself by trying to help him. And that I would never be able to, not really. He had to learn how to take care of himself. As David says: “I don’t think you can save people.”Despite deciding to end the relationship in September 2023, I didn’t take action until October, when I cheated on him. I felt I had to do something irreparable that would make it impossible for us to stay together. I told him what I’d done over the phone, then I called his mum to tell her about his drug problem. I don’t think she knew: she lived in another country and he hid it from her. Finally, I called a psychiatric facility and did all of the admin to make sure that he would be taken care of, and then never spoke to him again. The guilt I felt was overpowered by the feeling that this was something I had to do.That was my last codependent relationship. I have a new boyfriend, who tells me that my company alone is enough. I’m the most peaceful I’ve ever been, but sometimes the voice that says I’m only lovable if I’m useful comes back. If I try to cook for my boyfriend when I’m tired and he tells me I don’t have to, I can spiral. But slowly, with help, I’m building a sense of self that doesn’t rely on being of service. Beautiful Boy helped me see that I don’t need to take care of someone else to have value.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

High above Wengen, the village they were staying in, they noticed the Grindelwald–Männlichen mountain gondola cableway. Despite pouring rain, sunshine was forecast for later in the day, so they decided to give it a go.‘The rising smoke and setting sun made a magical backdrop’: Jurica Galić’s best phone shotRead more“The rain stopped shortly after we arrived at the small cable car station, and we began the 15-minute walk to the summit. Because of the conditions, we had the mountain to ourselves for a while. As we explored, we noticed this huge cow.”The pair were enchanted by the scene; the cow sat, unmoving, just staring at the cars going by. Newitt believes the animal is probably a Simmental or Swiss Fleckvieh. “We wondered if this was the usual spot for this particular cow to sit, or if the cows fought over it.”Newitt is a high school biology teacher and took up photography a couple of years ago as a hobby. She says this image, made on her iPhone 14 Pro, is the most satisfying photo she’s taken to date. “I love the way your eyes are first drawn to the large, warmly coloured cow, then to the cable cars as you work out what the cow is looking at, and then to the gorgeous, moody clouds hanging over the valley. My husband had a jigsaw puzzle made of this image because he knows how much I love it.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtFarm animalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She appeared in all 11 series, from 1972 to 1983 – longer than the conflict that inspired it – taking over the role played bySally Kellermanin the 1970 film.Misogyny ran throughout the big-screen version of M*A*S*H in a way that was not present in the 1968 novel by Richard Hooker on which it was based.In the TV version, too, Major Houlihan, a strict disciplinarian, was the butt of sexist jokes from the surgeons and other men in the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital unit, particularly “Hawkeye” Pierce (played by Alan Alda). Swit – who had the only leading female role in the show – took a stand before the fifth series began. She was then allowed to contribute to her character’s development, making Houlihan more three-dimensional, warm and brave. “I am a feminist, from the top of my head to the bottom of my toenail, and I favour playing strong women,” she told the American magazine Closer Weekly in 2022.Actors are always identified with certain parts. That's just how it isFrom then on, Swit’s character was referred to mainly by her real name rather than as “Hot Lips” and a more human side emerged when Houlihan broke down in front of her nurses, confessing she was hurt by the disdain they held for her because of her stern manner. The character’s long-running relationship with Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) ended and she married Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott (first played by Beeson Carroll and then Mike Henry), whom she later divorced when he cheated on her. Swit’s performance won her two Emmy awards as outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series, in 1980 and 1982.She might have had global recognition for a second TV role, in a programme that was groundbreaking for its portrayal of women, if the M*A*S*H producers had not refused to let her out of her contract. Swit played the police detective Christine Cagney, alongside Tyne Daly as Mary Beth Lacey, in the feature-length 1981 pilot of Cagney & Lacey. It was the first American police drama to feature women in the two lead roles. In Cagney & Lacey, there was gritty realism and the authenticity of women balancing their work and home lives but, as Swit was unavailable, Meg Foster took over as Cagney when the series began, replaced after six episodes by Sharon Gless.Swit never had another starring vehicle. “Actors are always identified with certain parts,” she said. “To some, Marlon Brando will always be the Godfather. That’s just how it is.”Perhaps her best film role was as the first female American president – succeeding a former circus clown, a parody of Ronald Reagan – in Whoops Apocalypse (1986), the writers Andrew Marshall and David Renwick’s variation on their British sitcom.Loretta was born in Passaic, New Jersey, to parents of Polish descent, Nellie (nee Kassack) and Lester Szwed, an upholsterer, who anglicised the family name to Swit. She attended Pope Pius XII high school, Passaic, where she appeared in school plays, and Gibbs College, Montclair, New Jersey, then had various secretarial jobs. Moving to New York, she trained in acting with Gene Frankel at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1959. Her break in New York theatre came off-Broadway, at the Circle in the Square in 1961 when she joined the cast of the long-running Actors’ Playhouse production of The Balcony, by Jean Genet.View image in fullscreenLoretta Swit in Los Angeles, California in 1983.Photograph: Wally Fong/APShe spent the rest of the decade exclusively on stage until travelling to Hollywood in 1969. Then, she began to get small roles on television, including three in Hawaii Five-O (between 1969 and 1972) and two in Gunsmoke (both in 1970).Later, she starred on Broadway as Doris in Bernard Slade’s “annual adultery” play Same Time, Next Year (Brooks Atkinson theatre, 1975-76), taking over the role originated by Ellen Burstyn. The New York Times observed that she gave a “stylish impersonation” of Burstyn, who had won a Tony award for her performance.Swit was on Broadway again in Rupert Holmes’s musical version of Charles Dickens’s unfinished novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood (Imperial theatre, 1985-86), replacing Cleo Laine in the dual roles of the Princess Puffer and Miss Angela Prysock. One stage part that seemed made for Swit was the title character in the British playwright Willy Russell’s one-woman show Shirley Valentine, which she took first in Chicago (Wellington and Wisdom Bridge theatres, 1990), then on an American tour (1995) and Canadian stages (1997 and 2010). The role of the bored Liverpool housewife escaping her humdrum life and uncaring husband had been played in the West End of London and the film version by Pauline Collins, who also took it to Broadway. Swit said of the character: “A lot of her experiences are universal – her ambition and desire, her lust for life and feelings of frustration at not fulfilling certain aspects of her own potential. I had kinship with her the moment I read the script.”Eve Ensler’s comic and at times seriously political playThe Vagina Monologueshad Swit as one of the three women taking multiple roles, first at the Westside theatre in New York (1999), then in the West End (Arts theatre, 2001-02) and on an American tour (2002-03).The actor was a passionate animal activist and supported many charities, as well as setting up her own, SwitHeart Animal Alliance. Her book SwitHeart: The Watercolour Artistry & Animal Activism of Loretta Swit was published in 2017.Swit’s 1983 marriage to the actor and lawyer Dennis Holahan ended in divorce 12 years later.Loretta Jane Swit, actor, born 4 November 1937; died 30 May 2025Explore more on these topicsTelevisionUS televisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

A short walk away, the limestone facade ofthe Creameryhints at its past lives – as a stagecoach stop, a dairy, a roadside inn. Tonight, it’s a pub.Inside, Bríd O’Gorman plays the fluttering melody of The Cliffs of Moher on her flute, accompanied by Michael Landers on guitar – a quiet moment before the small crowd erupt into applause as Cian Lally pulls our pints.

Along the bar, visitors from the US and France lean in, quietly captivated – likely having their first experience of an Irish music session.View image in fullscreenIt’s no coincidence that County Clare is the centre of Ireland’s famous music scene. Clare is as close as any county comes to being an island. Hemmed in by the Atlantic on one side and the Shannon – the country’s longest and widest river – on the other, it was, for centuries, a place almost adrift from the mainland. Until the 18th century, when bridges finally tethered it fully to the rest of the country, Clare was reached mostly by boat or by traversing the Burren’s stony, unyielding landscape.That isolation also shaped Clare’s culture. Beyond the reach of the capital, this corner of the west became a stronghold for language, music and tradition that flourished in the twilight on its own terms. You can feel that independence in villages along the coast, where the land abruptly falls into the sea at theCliffs of Moher– or farther south, where Loop Head Peninsula stretches defiantly into the Atlantic, a windswept outpost that feels like the end of the world.View image in fullscreenBríd O’Gorman and Michael Landers playing at the Creamery in Bunratty.Photograph: Megan RogersYet even within Clare, there are really two stories, as distinct as the landscapes from which they emerge. Draw a line from Bunratty, through the county town of Ennis, all the way to the northern tip of the county, and you’ll see the divide. Locals speak not just ofClare, but of east Clare and west Clare – each with its own rhythm, character and musical soul.I catch Bríd as she packs away her flute, and the audience turn back to their conversations and pints. She knows this music intimately. A native of east Clare, she is a firm believer that the soul of Irish traditional music doesn’t just echo through the well-trodden pubs ofGus O’Connor’sorMcGann’sin west Clare’s Doolin; it pulses quietly and powerfully through the hills, lakes, and tucked-away venues of the east.You hear east Clare music and you can almost feel the landscape it comes from. The gentleness of the hills, the stillness of the lakes“East Clare music has a character all of its own,” she tells me. “It’s known for being slow, expressive, understated – soulful, even. You hear it, and you can almost feel the landscape it comes from. The gentleness of the hills, the stillness of the lakes of east Clare – it’s a stark contrast to the jagged landscapes of north and west Clare.”The east Clare landscape may have a soft lilt, but its voice carries enormous weight. The monastic ruins onHoly Island(Inis Cealtra) – a round tower and churches – lie just off Mountshannon on Lough Derg, often shrouded in mist. It’s the final resting place of the great writer Edna O’Brien, a place where the sound of the breeze is carried through limestone walls with the same quiet dignity echoed in her prose. There’s something about this part of Clare that holds on to the lyrical, whether it’s in words or music. The land is lush and rolling, threaded with narrow roads and bright streams offering their own soft melody. AtQuin Abbey, swallows call as they dart through the roofless cloisters, while in the pretty marina town of Killaloe, the cathedral bells mingle with the cry of gulls above the great lake. Like the land, the music isn’t loud or dramatic, but quiet, confident, waiting for you to tune in.View image in fullscreenMonastic ruins on Holy Island or Inis Cealtra.Photograph: Fáilte Ireland“People often look north-west when they think of music in Clare – Doolin, Ennistymon, Miltown Malbay,” says Bríd. “But east Clare is just as alive. You just need to know where to look.”One such place is Feakle, a single-street hillside village lost in east Clare’s brilliant green landscape. It was once home to the famous herbalist and wise womanBiddy Early. However, it’s a 19th-century singer, Johnny Patterson, who is commemorated with a plaque in the village square. At a fork in the road on the village approach standsPepper’s Bar, a distinctive yellow-and-green vernacular building that has served the community since 1810. Its compact main room features a homely fireplace, dance-worn flagstone floors and low-hanging beams.On a Wednesday evening, the space fills with the pulse of jigs and reels performed on fiddle, bodhrán, tin whistle or accordion. The music is sometimes frenzied, hypnotic, even mesmerising: complex arrangements often delivered by some of the country’s finest players, including Martin Hayes, Liam O’Flynn, Matt Molloy, Sharon Shannon and Kevin Crawford. It’s in these east Clare villages, such as Feakle, Tulla or Scarriff, that you might realise you’re the only one in the room who doesn’t play, sing or dance.View image in fullscreenDurty Nelly’s pub and Bunratty Castle.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyOn Thursday nights, Ger Shortt of Shortt’s Bar in the heart of Feakle picks up the guitar, joined by a full musical accompaniment. Meanwhile, it seems as if anyone not playing is likely taking part in the Siege of Ennis, a céilí dance performed with spirited energy.Farther afield, Irish-language sessions are held at Gallagher’s in Kilkishen, while occasional music nights at Gleeson’s in Sixmilebridge also contribute to the rich musical tapestry of east Clare. Even the Honk Bar – hidden away on a bramble-filled lane near Shannon airport, not far from where Johnny Fean, one of the founding members of Celtic rock band Horslips, grew up – is known to host the occasional session. But eventually, all musical roads lead to Ennis.The roll call of regulars reads like a Who’s Who of traditional music. Ennis is home to globally in-demand players“It’s the heartbeat of Clare’s music scene,” Bríd says. “There’s a session most nights at Ciarán’s, Knox’s, Cruises, the Diamond, the Poet’s Corner in the Old Ground, Nora Culligans. And don’t forget PJ Kelly’s – it’s a great spot too.”Not every tune is played in a pub. “One of my favourite places to play isGlórin Ennis,” Bríd adds. “We run an open session there once a month – myself and Eoin O’Neill on bouzouki. It’s in the foyer, free to all, and open to musicians of every age and level. It’s spacious, welcoming and it’s been running for years. People love it.”Ennis’s music scene is among the richest in Ireland, thanks to its deep pool of local talent, lively pub culture and a spirit that blurs the line between performer and audience. Mike Dennehy, owner of the red-and-black-frontedKnox’s Pubon winding Abbey Street, says: “Knox’s has a wealth of musicians of various styles from all over Clare playing daily. We’re known not just for the quality, but for our open sessions, with up to 20 musicians at once.”View image in fullscreenA session outside Knox’s Pub in Ennis.Photograph: Brian Morrison/Fergus Mac SweeneyThe roll call of regulars reads like a Who’s Who of traditional music. Ennis is home to globally in-demand players such as uilleann piper Blackie O’Connell, accordionist Murty Ryan and banjoist Kieran Hehir. One of the scene’s crown jewels isPiping Heaven, Piping Hell, a weekly uilleann piping session hosted by Blackie O’Connell. “It started as an afternoon session,” says Mike, “and has become a weekly gathering of pipers from all over the world.” Held in Ciarán’s and Lucas’s pubs, it features a guest piper joining the regulars for an afternoon of music, laughter and storytelling.Ennis also plays a key role on the festival circuit, hostingFleadh Nuain May and theEnnis Trad Festin November – events that have drawn legends such as Moving Hearts, Sharon Shannon, Andy Irvine and Lankum, and cemented the town’s status as a musical capital.The west Clare scene is more relaxed, more immediate, the music blending with the conversation, and one tune flows easily into the next. Events such as theRussell festivalin Doolin kick off the year in February, and by July, theWillie Clancy summer schooltransforms peaceful Miltown Malbay into a bustling, welcoming village of sound. It’s where my own daughter, Síofradh, honed her harp skills in a chaotic makeshift class.That’s the thing about Clare. Whether it’s a gentle melody in Bunratty, a fireside session in east Clare or the lively pull of Doolin, the music – and the welcome – are always there.Bunratty Manorhas doubles from €119 and singles from €109,room-only.Clare Eco Lodgein Feaklehasdoubles from €90and singlesfrom €50, room-onlyExplore more on these topicsIreland holidaysCultural tripsLearning holidaysEurope holidaysFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Gluten-free flour is commonly considered in two ways: there are individual flours, such as rice and buckwheat (and that includes starches such as corn, potato, tapioca), and then there are blends. Blends are a mix of those singular flours in varying ratios, and for familiarity’s sake are usually labelled as either gluten-free plain, self-raising or bread flour. These blends are more versatile, and it’s the plain flours that we’ve got under the microscope today.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To test their mettle, I made a batch of gluten-free cookies with each product. And, seeing as gluten-free food can be extortionately expensive, cost is factored into my ratings, too. A slight caveat: different gluten-free flour blends work better (or worse) depending on the recipe involved. Most will do just fine as a thickener for sauces or as a coating, but when it comes to baking, some are better suited to cakes, others to pastry and others still to bread. That means it’s very hard to say which flour is the “best”, but I’ve done my best to figure it out.The best gluten-free plain flourBestall-rounder:Freee gluten-free plain white flourView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 1kg at Sainsbury’s (20p/100g)£1.95 for 1kg at Ocado (20p/100g)★★★★★Gluten-free flour blends were originally created to emulate wheat flour (so you can use them to adapt recipes to be gluten-free), and this one produces a similar performance to wheat for everything outside of bread baking. Of course, it’s not magic; you still need good recipes and, in some cases, the addition ofxanthan gum.Best bargain:Asda Free From Gluten plain flourView image in fullscreen£1.10 for 1kg at Asda (11p/100g)★★★★☆A solid performance for the price, and certainly a blend that will produce satisfying results for baking. It’s a bit less absorbent than I’d expect, which might mean your dough ends up a little stickier, but if you know what consistency you’re looking for, that shouldn’t be hard to remedy by adding a little more to compensate.The best stand mixers to make baking easier – and even more funRead moreBest splurge:Caputo gluten-free flourView image in fullscreen£8 for 1kg at Ocado (80p/100g)£8.29 for 1kg at Amazon (83p/100g)★★★☆☆This blend contains gluten-free wheat starch so, while it’s gluten-free, it’s not suitable for people with a wheat allergy. As such, its strengths lie in bread-making, rather than your average cake or bake. For bread, it would be five stars, but for pure versatility (and considering the sky-high price), it’s not a panacea.And the rest …Eurostar gluten-free premium plain white flourView image in fullscreen£3.90 for 1.5kg at Ocado (26p/100g)★★★☆☆While this boasts an unconventional range of ingredients, such as vegetable flour and fibres, it produced results comparable to my best buy.

However, considering it’s nearly twice the price (and while the Asda flour exists), there’s not much justification for buying this.Shipton Mill gluten-free all-purpose flourView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 750g at Shipton Mill (33p/100g)★★☆☆☆This was less able to bind and absorb common baking ingredients, making it feel as if you hadn’t added enough – of course, adding too much can result in heavy, dense or dry bakes. The biscuits weren’t all that far from expectations, but they were a little greasy.Middleton Food gluten-free plain flourView image in fullscreen£13.71 for 3kg at Food Angles (46p/100g)£20.82 for 3kg at Amazon (69p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Even if this was considerably cheaper, the dry and grainy results wouldn’t persuade me to use it in the average recipe. Its absorption and binding are far off expectations – although still not the worst of the bunch – and the finished result gave me the feeling that the balance of the blend must be completely off.Holland & Barrett gluten-free plain white flourView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 1kg at Holland & Barrett (25p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Despite having almost identical ingredients to my best buy, the results this produced were extremely disappointing. It lacked binding power and absorption to the point where it made the dough greasy, sticky and difficult to handle. Sadly, the end results were also excessively greasy and too far away from that of the average flour blend.Becky Excell is a gluten-free cook and author of Quick + Easy Gluten-Free (Quadrille, £20).

He was a year older than me, and we must have passed each other thousands of times, but I have no memory of ever talking to him. We knew of each other, but we didn’t know each other’s names.We met properly for the first time at a pre-drinks when I was in my first year of university. He was holding a six-pack of beer and looked vaguely familiar. I introduced myself, he offered me one of his drinks and we got talking.Not long after, we started dating. We’d walk on the beach in St Kildatogether, cook meals and grab coffee whenever we could. It was simple, easy and just felt right.View image in fullscreenNomi and Daniel in 2014I quickly realised Daniel and I could dive deep into a shared passion of ours – Australian politics – without it ever turning into a fight. At the time, I was studying politics as part of my arts/law degree, and Daniel had been a member of the Labor party since he was 16.In Daniel, I found someone who spoke the same language and shared similar values. Politics wasn’t the sole foundation of our relationship, but when something big happened, we weren’t shy about debating it.While we were still at university, Daniel landed a job working for a politician. I decided to copy him, and I emailed every member of parliament in Victoria until one of them offered me a role. If he could do it, so could I. We pushed each other forward like that, and we still do.When Daniel decided to run for federal parliament at just 21, I campaigned with him every step of the way. We door-knocked together and handed out his flyers. People would do a double take when they met him, looking at his scuffed Converse sneakers.He ran in a safe Liberal seat, against a candidate who later became Australia’s trade minister. Slim chances didn’t bother Daniel, though. He ran for office because he had the time and believed in the cause.I remember being so proud of him for trying his best, even in the face of great odds.The night of the election, we hung out and watched the results roll in live on TV. Daniel was exhausted after handing out how-to-vote cards all day, and we both knew he’d lost. Despite that, he still had a big smile on his face, and in that moment, I knew this was my guy. I felt so moved watching how much Daniel gave of himself – not for praise, but because he truly cared. It was one of those quiet, powerful moments.View image in fullscreenNomi and Daniel at home, where they live with their five childrenWhen I ran for parliament, years later, Daniel returned the favour. He hung my posters around our neighbourhood and helped me letterbox. When the votes were counted and I didn’t win, he knew exactly what to say, because he’d been there too.The moment I knew: we were running late, but his optimism was contagiousRead moreWe’ve been married for a decade now and have five kids together. Despite the chaos of our busy life, Daniel and I regularly have animated discussions about what’s going on in the country.Our garage is still a jumble of old campaign signs wedged between prams and half-empty tins of paint. The kids sometimes drag one out, asking if we really did run for parliament and if we won. We laugh, because that was never the point. For us, politics is about trying to make Australia a better place.These days, we’re more likely to be caring for our children than campaigning, but the ideas that motivated us back then still drive us. We did it for the children we were dreaming of, and now we’re raising them.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

That’s something truly special: an outside that is an inside. When Tara Fraser and Nigel Jones first came to view this semi-derelict Regency house in 2016, they had no ideaAshley Courtincluded a walled garden. “We saw this wooden door and pushed it open – and there it was. Just like The Secret Garden. Total jungle.”Nine summers and countless hours of labour later, and it is transformed. Nigel opens the door; I follow him and have to stop at the threshold as I catch sight of it.The garden is Tardis-like, bigger on the inside somehow, andbounded by high walls– stone on the outside and lined with brick – in a loose squareish shape that undulates with the lift and dip of the land. The veg beds and paths give it the feel of a patchwork coverlet laid over a sleeping giant.“No self-respecting Victorian kitchen garden would be so ridiculously slopey,” saya Tara. It’s one of the reasons why they believe the garden predates the house to before the 1800s.View image in fullscreenA path through the walled garden.Photograph: Anita RoyNot only do the high walls act as a physical barrier against deer and rabbits, they retain the heat and shelter the plants from the wind, such that the garden sits in its own microclimate. In winter, the cold air can escape through a rectangular frost window at the lower end (it pours out, apparently, like a white ghost, into the surrounding woodland).Hard to imagine on a day like this, with bees and demoiselles zipping about, buttercups shining, bathed in warm spring sunshine. Beans have begun spiralling their way up bamboo wigwams, gooseberries are as hard as marbles but growing plumper, more translucent every day. Ancient espaliered pear trees reach out to each other with gnarled fingers. Clumps of chives have gone to flower, their purple tufted hairdos like something out of Dr Seuss.Filled with all of these photosynthesisers feasting on the sun, this garden really is paradise. The word itself comes from the Avestan wordpairidaēza,meaning walled enclosure. How fitting that the walled garden is both how we imagine heaven, and the very place on earth where that image took root.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentCountry diaryRural affairsGardensInsectsAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I hate having my working day interrupted, even when I’m not actually doing any workTim DowlingSat 31 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 12.44 EDTShareI am sitting in my office shed, marvelling that an email from a car hire company I last used six years ago feels entitled to employ the subject line DROP EVERYTHING.“It’s hard to imagine,” I say, “how a 20% reduction in rental rates for the month of June could be sufficient cause for anyone to suddenly abandon their present business, be it knee surgery, adoption proceedings or, in this specific case, Wordle.”The dog, which is lying on the step in front of the open door, lifts its head to look at me – an emboldening reminder that as long as I’m sharing space with an animal, I’m technically not talking to myself.“Then again, I have sort of dropped everything to read this email,” I say.My wife walks up to the door, leans in and hands me a small box.“I found these in the car,” she says. “You requested them at some point.”The box contains wooden plant labels – essentially ice lolly sticks with one pointed end – which would have served a definite and supportable purpose about three weeks ago.“Yeah, a while back,” I say.“Not at all,” my wife says, turning for the kitchen.I examine the box: the back bears a photographic illustration of a properly deployed plant label, stuck pointy end down into some soil next to a seedling. On the label someone has helpfully written “Plant Name” in a neat cursive hand. The accompanying instructions say: “Simply push in.”“Can it really be that simple?” I say, looking up to find that the dog has followed my wife back to the house.I gaze across the rows of seedlings I planted out in the raised bed in a frantic hurry when they outgrew their trays – some struggling, some thriving, all of them unlabelled. I convinced myself I would remember which row was which – I was wrong. But now, I realise, a solution is at hand: I can write “Plant Name” on all my new labels, and simply push them in.Writing involves some tactical time-wasting – you sometimes have to bore yourself into concentrating. Menial chores like cutting the grass are no helpTen minutes later, my wife returns.“I have someone coming for lunch,” she says. “Could you possibly mow the lawn?” I swivel my chair to look at her.“What, just drop everything?” I say.“What is it you’re actually doing?” she says.“That,” I say, “is not a question I feel the need to answer.”“She’s coming at one, so,” my wife says.“Fine,” I say.All things being equal, I am an enthusiastic supporter of basic safety precautions. That said, I’m pretty certain it’s not a good idea to mow the lawn in flip-flops, and yet I have already made the decision not to change out of them and into shoes.I resent having my working day interrupted, even though I’m not working. Writing involves a certain level of tactical time-wasting – you sometimes have to bore yourself into concentrating. Absorbing menial chores – cutting the grass, say – are no help. I need to get back to doing nothing, and quickly.Anyway, I tell myself as I begin, the lawnmower has a sort of dead man’s handle – if I keeled over from a heart attack the blades would stop turning. What’s the worst that could happen?This question is answered almost as soon as I ask it: pulling the lawnmower backwards from a tight corner, I step out of my left flip-flop and partially run it over. It’s not ruined – just scarred – but the sight of it is immediately sobering.My wife’s guest arrives at one. It’s not clear, from my vantage point at the other end of the garden, how my own lunch plans are affected. Am I invited? Or am I supposed to wait until the guest departs, and then slither over to feed on whatever scraps remain? The dog comes out and resumes lying in front of my office door.“What’s going on in there?” I say. “Are they eating yet?” The dog stares straight ahead, as if it hasn’t heard me. How long, I think, before hunger drives me to go and investigate?The answer is: not that long. The guest, it turns out, is our friend Louise.“Hello,” I say, looking at the plates.“Well done for staying away for a whole hour,” my wife says. “I’ve saved you some food.”“I can’t eat now,” I say, “I’m busy.”“He’s busy,” says Louise.“I just came in to say hi,” I say, turning to leave.“There he goes,” my wife says. “Flip, flop, flip, flop.”Back in my office, I sit at my desk, staring at a blank white screen and thinking about just dropping everything and hiring a car.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I set one up with neighbours to find outTom Duggins sets up a communal shop – and finds big savings are possible for just £3-£6 a weekTom DugginsSat 31 May 2025 06.47 EDTFirst published on Sat 31 May 2025 04.00 EDTShareMost people would jump at the chance to save up to 40% – and more in some cases – on their food shopping each week.Yet if it meant discarding speed and convenience in favour of old-fashioned ideas such as knocking on doors and collaborating with the neighbours, would that enthusiasm remain?As far as the not-for-profit food co-opCooperation Townis concerned, the answer is yes – people just need encouragement.Launched in 2019 on an estate in Kentish Town in north London with the aim of promoting solidarity in place of charity, its founders quickly discovered demand was high.Cooperation Town has since gone from strength to strength. It is now helping more than 40 community UK food co-ops to buy wholesale and acquire surplus groceries from businesses to feed themselves at a significant discount.Everyone typically chips in £3 to £6 a week and the economies of scale help to make that collective pot go much further.View image in fullscreenTom Duggins receives his first order. Typically people chip in £3 to £6 a week and the economies of scale help to make that collective pot go further.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianA few months ago, intrigued by the concept and the potential savings that could be made, I approached Shiri Shalmy, one of the co-founders of Cooperation Town, to talk about setting up my own food co-op. Much as I liked the idea, I wondered how easy it would be to agree on what food to order and I also felt unsure about the time commitment.“Not everyone will get everything they want,” Shalmy told me. “But most people will get everything they need. The specialist stuff, you go to the shop for. I do that because I can’t expect 20 other households to want the same type of dessert that I like. But it turns out most people, no matter where you are in the world, eat rice, pasta, fresh fruit and vegetables.”As for the time commitment, Shalmy said most co-ops ran smoothly and were simple to manage so long as everyone shared the work.The biggest hurdle to creating a food co-op is the initial time and effort involved in setting it up and finding like-minded people. Shalmy recommends keeping things small for the sake of convenience, with the aim of involving perhaps 15 to 20 neighbours and encouraging the development of a separate co-op if more want to join.Shalmy is adamant about one core principle: there is no substitute for knocking on doors and talking to people directly.View image in fullscreenShiri Shalmy, a co-founder of Cooperation Town, says there is no substitute for knocking on doors and talking to people when setting up a co-op.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianSo, over a period of about two weeks, I found an hour here and there to approach my immediate neighbours. Armed with some Cooperation Town leaflets and a quick spiel about the potential savings, I spoke to people to gauge interest.The response was generally positive. After posting in a local WhatsApp group and asking a few friends who live close by too, I soon had about 13 people willing to give it a try.From there, I arranged some meetings to discuss the general idea and air any reservations. Probably the biggest obstacle was finding one evening in the week when 10 to 12 people could all attend.In the end, we hosted several meetings for different groups. I sat in on some to explain what had been discussed in the previous meeting, or shared notes so the next group knew what had been discussed and agreed.We quickly decided to fill in a spreadsheet with the foods we all regularly buy in order to gain a sense of any crossovers and what our first order might look like. It did not take long to realise we all eat roughly the same fruit and vegetables on a more or less weekly basis.Cooperation Town has anonline starter packthat runs through a lot of frequently asked questions and its website is loaded with other resources such as a proposed agenda for a co-op’s first meeting, a template for a weekly shopping list and an example of a co-op constitution.View image in fullscreenCooperation Town is  now helping more than 40 community UK food co-ops to buy wholesale and acquire surplus groceries from businesses to feed themselves at a significant discount.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe organisation recognises that no one wants to sit through long and boring meetings, but also stresses that “consent decision-making” is the most equitable way of reaching decisions. Proposals are raised and discussed until everyone is happy and no one has a strong objection. This is not the fastest way to organise, but it ensures everyone’s needs are being met.In my co-op, we debated whether to buy store-cupboard items such as rice and tinned tomatoes on an irregular basis, or focus on more frequent orders of perishable items. When I looked into the prices offered by wholesalers such as Costco and Booker, I found that buying bulk packages of rice or pasta was not all that cheaper – about 89p for 500g of basmati rice, for example – than buying individual packets of own-brand supermarket products.Instead, the real value seemed to be in buying large boxes of seasonal produce from wholesale grocers. At this time of year, a 500g packet of cherry tomatoes that could cost £1 to £2 in a supermarket is about 60p when buying in bulk.At the time of writing my co-op has 11 members and for our first order everyone chipped in £5.64 each. That sum is not fixed – it would depend on how much fruit and veg we wanted for a particular shop.When we collected our order from Cooperation Town’s hub in north-west London, the quantity of food we were given was hard to believe. Thanks to donations of surplus food from redistribution charities such asthe Felix Project, we were handed entire crates of cauliflowers, pak choi, potatoes and parsnips, along with lots of supermarket hummus, grated cheese, king prawns, cakes, biscuits and other store-cupboard items.View image in fullscreenCooperation Town also receives donations of surplus food from redistribution charities such as the Felix Project.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianFor a contribution of just over £5, every household was easily getting more than £40 worth of food. So on this occasion, you could argue we were saving a lot more than 40% on our usual weekly shop.My co-op is lucky enough to have someone who drives, which meant we could also avoid an additional £10 delivery fee from the wholesale grocer and collect our order from Cooperation Town’s hub. (I’m not sure if other grocers charge the same, but I imagine it’s is probably fairly representative.)I wondered if the delivery fee might be an obstacle for other people trying to set up a food co-op, but Shalmy says: “People measure value in different ways. This is a huge help for people on a lower income. If you don’t have a car, going to three shops on the bus is a huge job.“The main obstacle is that people are not used to co-operating. We’ve been socialised to be insular and a bit suspicious of our neighbours.”But with cost-of-living pressures continuing to squeeze household budgets – three in four Britons have reported an increase in their typical household grocery spend over the past year,according to a recent Ipsos poll– perhaps things are starting to change.How to set up a food co-opView image in fullscreenTom Duggins and neighbours redistribute their first food order.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianKnock on doors, chat to neighbours and talk to friends.Find a space to hold meetings: it could be a village hall, someone’s home or via video conferencing.Hold a founding meeting where everyone can ask questions and discuss what they want to achieve.Divide jobs equally so no individual is shouldering too much responsibility.Use a spreadsheet to help get a sense of the food you all tend to buy.Don’t be afraid to try new things. If some people want to order an item you haven’t tried before – cassava, for example – share recipes and learn from one another.Decide how to collect everyone’s weekly payments. It could be in cash, or you may want to use an app.Approach local businesses to ask about surplus food and get in touch with wholesalers to ask about bulk buying.Find a location where people can collect their orders. This can be someone’s home or, even better, a public space with storage that is accessible throughout the day.Check out the website of Cooperation Town – a network of community food co-ops.

They are attacked in their own homes, when fleeing violence, getting food, collecting firewood, working in the fields. They tell us they feel trapped,” said Claire San Filippo, MSF emergency coordinator, who called on the warring parties to hold their fighters to account.“These attacks are heinous and cruel, often involving multiple perpetrators. This must stop.Sexual violenceis not a natural or inevitable consequence of war, it can constitute a war crime, a form of torture, and a crime against humanity.”Several women who gave testimonies to MSF described raids where fighters killed all the boys and men in a place before raping women and girls.A 27-year-old nurse said she was raped last year by fighters who accused her of treating Sudanese army soldiers.“I want protection now; I don’t want to be raped again … I was too afraid to go to the hospital. My family told me, “Don’t tell anybody”. I don’t have any more pain. But I have nightmares about it,” she said.MSF said that 56% of the sexual violence they documented was perpetrated by non-civilians.Women and girls having to walk long distances to gather food and water put them in particular danger, the report said. A third of women and girls were attacked while travelling to or working in fields.View image in fullscreenPatients queue for treatment next to an MSF health post in Tawila Umda.Photograph: Thibault Fendler/MSFSince April 2023, Darfur has witnessed asurge in human rights abusesas it has been taken over by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary and allied militias as they fight for control against the government’s Sudanese armed forces.The fighting has recently been concentrated around the city of El Fasher, where conditions have deteriorated rapidly for civilians. The RSF’s seizure of the nearbyZamzam displacement campled to further reports of increased sexual violence.The Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (Siha),a coalition of women’s rights groups, said it has verified 14 cases of rape but had received reports of many more,during the Zamzam attackand in the weeks since, as well as dozens of reports of women disappearing or being abducted by RSF fighters.Atrocities mount daily. Promised aid does not arrive. Why has the west turned its back on Sudan?Read more“Sexual violence has become an everyday reality for women and girls in Darfur, along with the rise in sexually transmitted diseases,” said Siha’s head, Hala al-Karib, who said the international community had abandoned women in Darfur.Karib said the violence had been escalating since before the current conflict because of the withdrawa of a UN and African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur that had provided some protection to local communities.“The peacekeeping mission primarily contributed to the safety and security of women by patrolling roads and enabling them to access their farmlands, while also securing displaced camps,” said Karib.“The level of neglect toward women in Darfur is staggering. This region is experiencing active genocidal acts, horrific war crimes, and famine due to a siege on livelihoods by all actors. There is no dedicated support for women survivors … this crisis is unfolding amid complete silence and utter neglect from international actors.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDarfurSexual violenceRape and sexual assaultViolence against women and girlsMédecins Sans FrontièresSudannewsShareReuse this content"

Subsequent findings that some video was AI-generated have called into question his story.Peng told the investigators thatabout 20 minutes into his practice hewas caught in a strong updraft, which sent him soaring more than 5,000 metres higher, in line with flight paths and nearly the height of Mount Everest.In a video filmed on the ground, Peng said: “My hands were frozen outside. I kept trying to talk on the radio.”A new start after 60: I dreamt of paragliding for 30 years. When I took to the skies at 80 I felt completely freeRead moreVideo purported to be from Peng’s mounted camera went viral, but has since been challenged over its veracity. At least some parts of it are believed to have been AI generated. NBC News said the first five seconds of the footage provided by China’s state broadcaster CCTV, and distributed by Reuters, had been determined to be AI-generated.Authorities praised Peng’s survival, conceding it was an accident. A “normal person cannot be exposed at 8,000 metres without oxygen [so] this is not something that can be done voluntarily” said a sports bureau official, according toSixth Tone.But Peng, who has about five years’ experience paragliding, never intended to leave ground level and so had not registered any flight plans, meaning his ordeal was “not subject to relevant approvals”, the report said. In response, he was banned from flying for six months.The bureaureport, based on an interview with Peng, said he was in the air for more than an hour, and had stayed in radio contact with his friend, Gu Zhimin, who was still on the ground.The report said he had attempted to descend but his efforts were “ineffective”, and as he flew higher he became confused and briefly lost consciousness.Peng said hewas eventually able to land about 30km from the launch site, where he was met by Gu and another friend.Gu later posted a composite video to Douyin, China’s domestic version of TikTok, where it soon went viral.The video drew the ire of authorities.“Gu Zhimin posted a flight video without permission, which had a bad impact,” the report said. “He was grounded for six months and asked to write a report to deeply reflect on the negative impact of his behaviour.”The bureau said any record broken by Peng’s flight would not be officially counted because his flight was not registered.If Peng did fly to the reported height, there is precedent for survival, including the world record of 9,946m set by German paraglider Ewa Wiśnierska in 2007, whenshe was caught in a similar updraftwhile paragliding in Australia. Wiśnierska was unconscious for about 40 minutes, only learning how high she had flown after safely landing and checking her flight data.Additional research by Lillian Yang.This article was amended on 31 May 2025 after it emerged that some of the video of the flight appears to have been AI generated. A video that accompanied the earlier version of the article, and which included the since-disputed content, has also been removed.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificExtreme sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was “controlled” by security personnel.The pit he jumped into is up to 5.4 metres (18ft) deep, according to the museum’s website.Built around 209 BC to stand guard over the tomb of the first emperor, the 8,000-strong terracotta army is one of China’s most important archaeological discoveries and considered a symbol of ancient Chinese artistic and military sophistication.A major tourist attraction in Xi’an, capital of the northern province of Shaanxi, it has been a Unesco world heritage site since 1987.A worker at the museum told AFP on Saturday that the display was open as usual.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent.”Taiwan president calls for peace and dialogue with China amid heightened military activityRead moreHe said Donald Trump’s administration hadpushed European countries to boost their defensive spending, taking on a greater “burden” of responding to conflicts in their region, and it was time for Asian nations to do the same.Hegseth, who in March was revealed to have tolda Signal group chat that Europe was “pathetic” and “freeloading”on US security support in the region, told the Singapore conference it was “hard to believe” he was now saying this, but Asian countries should “look to allies in Europe as a newfound example”.“Deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap … time is of the essence.”A new study by the organisation running theSingaporeevent, the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, found that Asian spending on weapons and research is currently spiking, on top of what it said was a relatively consistent annual average spend of 1.5% of GDP.Hegseth said the renewed European focus on their region – particularly the Russia-Ukraine war – allowed the US to shift focus to its “priority theatre” in the Indo-Pacific.Hegseth said the US did not seek to “pressure” Asian countries to “embrace or adopt policies or ideologies”, but instead wanted to “work with you where our shared interests align for peace and prosperity”.“We’re not here to preach to you about climate change or cultural issues,” he said. “But a threat gathers.“We do not seek conflict with Communist China. We will not seek to instigate, subjugate or humiliate China. President Trump and US have an immense respect for China and their civilisation. But we will not be pushed out of this critical region.”In his speech Hegseth also took a swipe at the absence of any senior Chinese delegate at this year’s conference. “We are here this morning and, notably, someone else isn’t,” he said.Hegseth also appeared to referencecomments by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the conference on Fridaythat a “sense that [the US’s] promise might not be so ironclad is ushering in a new instability”.Europe and Asia should form ‘positive new alliance’, says Macron in SingaporeRead more“An alliance cannot be ironclad if in reality or perception it is one-sided,” Hegseth said on Saturday. “As allies share the burden we can increase our focus on the Indo-Pacific, our priority theatre.”He said the US would conduct its “first-ever live-fire test of its mid-range capability system in Australia” in coming months, and had expanded cooperations and joint exercises. It would also establish repair capability and capacity programs in the region, including for P-8 radar systems in Australia for the US and its allies, while expanding contracts for regional ship repair.Hegseth’s speech reiterated much of the Trump administration’s defence and security position – blaming the previous administration for problems, pledging to strengthen the US military and secure the US border against unregulated immigration, while repeating plans to “take back the Panama canal”.He said Trump was spending $1tn – a 13% increase – on defence next year, citing advance weapons plans including the controversial Golden Dome.Speaking in Singapore after Hegseth’s address, US Democratic senator Tammy Duckworth told reporters – including the Guardian – that his comments about the US remaining in the Indo-Pacific region were welcome but he found his words “patronising of our friends in the Indo-Pacific in particular”.“I’ve gotta say his idea that we’re going to wrap ourselves around you – we don’t need that kind of language. We just need to stand together,” Duckworth said.“The US is not asking people to choose between the US and [China] … But we will make sure international norms are maintained and ask our friends to help us uphold them.”Duckworth, who is co-leading a bi-partisan delegation which also visited Taiwan, said the Trump administration “acts very quickly, but very incompetently”.“The point I’m making on this trip is that it’s not just about secretary Hegseth and the Trump administration,” she said. “Bipartisan support for the Indo Pacific in the legislature is actually growing.”Explore more on these topicsPete HegsethUS foreign policyUS defence spendingAsia PacificSingaporeTaiwanTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But her presence was often felt, taking shape in the form of notes she hadwritten to his doctoror in aconversation with a police officer.One of the most striking moments of the inquest was when Michele Cauchi, now in her mid-70s, was filmed via body-worn video camera on a police officer.She was standing outside her tidy home next to blooming hydrangeas, explaining how her son – who spoke multiple languages and had a university degree – had been deteriorating since he stopped taking medication. “I don’t know how we’re going to get him treatment unless he does something drastic,” she says.These moments painted a picture of a mother engaging in a Sisyphean struggle to get her son – then living with untreated schizophrenia – help. But she could keep pushing only so far.Heartbroken mother tells inquest she’s ‘lost her way’ after ‘stuff of nightmares’ murders at Bondi JunctionRead morePerson after person who gave painful evidence at the five-week inquest told a similar story of doing their best in a “fallible system”. It crystallised into a key takeaway: the system is letting down people in a crisis, like Cauchi.‘The state has really just failed them’Cauchi’s attack and the severity of it was a rare occurrence.But the system’s failure to pick up on his slide after he stopped taking his medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia is sadly a familiar story.Psychiatrists who appeared as experts before the inquest said the vision when mental health asylums in Australia were dismantled in the 1970s was for community services to instead support those people in need.But Queensland psychiatrist Prof Edward Heffernan told the inquiry the planned funding for community services “never really followed” the shift.Psychiatrists also told the inquest that services hadn’t kept pace with population growth. Meanwhile, psychological distress was increasing across the population, and patterns of substance abuse and other modern stressors had made things worse.Ian Korbel, a psychiatrist not part of the inquest, tells Guardian Australia he once worked in a mental health outreach team that would respond to people in crisis. But that program stopped running in the mid-2000s.Korbel says the team that worked in Sydney’s eastern suburbs used to check the beaches for people experiencing homelessness. Cauchi was reportedly sleeping rough there before the attack.Korbel says the faltering of services has resulted in the buck passing to police and the justice system. “They’re in the punishment business,” he says. “They shouldn’t respond to this, but the health system isn’t resourced to respond to it.”Police are increasingly responding to such crises.The inquest heard that inNew South Wales, police responded to 40% more mental health incidents in 2022 compared with four years earlier.Sen Sgt Tracey Morris told the inquiry: “We will always look at [those incidents] from a policing lens. That may lead to charges and them going through the court system when [it’s] effectively because of the mental illness.”Morris works as the mental health intervention coordinator in the Queensland police district where Cauchi’s parents live, in Darling Downs. The day Cauchi’s mother spoke to police, they referred Joel to her role – which helps people link in with health services – for a follow-up check. But the officer acting in her role while she was on leave missed the email. This moment to get Cauchi help was described by a psychiatrist at the inquest as a “missed opportunity”.Is the inquest into the Bondi Junction murders further stigmatising schizophrenia?Read moreFighting back tears, Morris told the court this was no reflection on that officer’s capability, but a direct consequence of under-resourcing. At least four people should be doing her job in that particular police district, she said.One of the cruelest ironies of that under-resourcing issue came during the inquest in a blink-and-you-might-have-missed it-moment, where Morris said no one was covering her role while she was at the inquest for the week. She couldn’t find anyone to backfill it.Matthew Morgan, an expert in policing mental health responses who lectures at the Australian Catholic University, says: “The only people really to blame here is the government. If they’re not going to invest in a proactive and responsive mental health system that can provide the community around-the-clock care … then the buck stops with them.”A recent report Morgan co-authored analysed Queensland coronial inquests into people fatally shot by police while experiencing a mental illness.Twenty-four people have been fatally shot in the state since 2008. There is a clear patten, he says. “The state has really just failed them.“There’s just lots of patterns of sporadic treatment, lack of follow-up care, and then the police get blamed for their criminalising and sometimes lethal response to such situations.”‘Years of neglect’The inquest heard there had been multiple improvements in crisis response since police spoke to Cauchi and his mother in January 2023.Police can connect with health professionals to get advice on incidents, and there are co-response models where healthcare workers respond to call-outs alongside police.Those changes – as Peggy Dwyer, counsel assisting the coroner, pointed out in the inquest – have come after multiple inquiries, internal police and government reports and coronial inquests. All make a similar recommendation: health professionals should respond to mental health crises, not police – at least not alone.Joining calls for this change are families whoseloved ones have been shot deadby police while they were suffering a psychosis. One of the loudest recent voices has been Judy Deacon, the mother of Jesse,who police shot dead in Glebein 2023 after reports he was self-harming.But co-responder models have not been rolled out nationwide, despite recommendations to do so. The leading model in NSW, known as Pacer, operates in just 20 of NSW’s 57 police commands.During the inquest, Dwyer asked Dr Brendan Flynn, the executive director of the mental health branch of NSW Health: “Why has there not been an expanded Pacer across NSW where sufficient demand is demonstrated, when this report came out almost four years ago?”Less than 2% of Labor’s promised $1bn mental health funding would be spent next financial yearRead moreFlynn responded: “It’s a resourcing issue. It would require new funds, and that’s a matter primarily for government.”Later Dwyer asked: “Is there a risk that we just then get stuck here for another four years where there’s no rollout of more supports?”Flynn replied: “I hope very much that’s not the case.”Even if a version of Pacer were rolled out across NSW, Korbel says, more work needs to be done.“Nowhere in Australia do we fund mental health as we should,” he says. “NSW is the worst. It gives 5% of its health budget to mental health.”Korbel says that figure “would need to be doubled at least” to match similar programs in countries such as England and Canada.Investment in health services can save money in the long term.Prof Olav Nielssen, a Sydney-based psychiatrist who appeared before the inquest, spoke about a supported housing charity he works at. It supports people revolving between hospital, prison and the homeless sector.He estimated the cost of having people in supported housing was a tenth of what it would otherwise cost having them bouncing around a network of hospitals, prisons and other institutions. He said NSW had “plans” to have 70 of these beds but that there should be 1,000 to meet the need.Elizabeth Young, the mother of Jade Young, a victim of thestabbings, appeared before the inquest and described her 47-year-old daughter’s murder as the “stuff of nightmares”.She also described it as the result of “years of neglect” within the mental health system.“It seems to me that my daughter and five others were killed by the cumulative failures of numbers of people within a whole series of fallible systems.”In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

He declined to comment.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, however, several members of the working group said they advised against the expansion of lethal control and were not informed of the LNPs plans to do so until days before they were announced.“Everyone was shocked and everyone was pretty upset that there wasn’t consultation,” one working group member said.Queensland’s shark control plan facing court challenge and federal intervention, experts sayRead more“We were told there was something coming and it was postponed and postponed and postponed. We kind of had the feeling that it was going to be bad … but it was a gut punch.”AMCS shark scientist and campaigner Dr Leonardo Guida said Simpfendorfer was “unequivocally” Australia’s most renowned and respected shark scientist.“I don’t think anyone would dispute the fact that Colin is, not just Australia’s best and most respected and well known shark scientist but, even globally, he is up there at the top,” he said.Guida said he would like to sincerely thank Simpfendorfer for his expertise and service in the “undoubtedly very challenging role” of providing scientific advice to “what is essentially a state sanctioned marine cull of sharks”.“As to what his resignation says, only a matter of days after Queensland’s announcement to extend the shark cull, my interpretation of that would be that the Queensland government has made a decision that is no longer in line with scientific advice and recommendation,” Guida said.“That this is a clear departure from scientific advice itself”.‘Philosophical’ shiftSeveral sources said that in its nearly eight years the working group had been successful in getting “more science into decision making” around shark management in Queensland and in moving from lethal to non-lethal shark control – but that Sunday’s announcement marked a “philosophical” shift from the top.Some attributed the shift to pressure from commercial and recreational anglers who reportincreasingly having fish taken from their lines by sharks. Many scientists agree this behaviour – known asshark depredation– is on the rise in many places around the world, though none spoken to for this article believe that a shark cull will have any impact on depredation rates, nor improve the safety of swimmers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bribie Island has baited drum lines, while the Keppel islands do not.Shark scientist and Emmy award-winning underwater cinematographer Richard Fitzpatrick, who has been on the scientific working group since its inception, says media reporting around fatal shark incidents may also have contributed to the expansion of lethal shark control measures.“Media hysteria in Australia is one of the biggest problems with the whole shark issue,” he said “Imagine if it were reported at the same level we do with car fatalities”.Fitzpatrick said the expansion of lethal shark measures had “definitely” made him consider his position on the working group, but said that, ultimately, working with the government had allowed scientists to pursue much-needed research into shark tracking and movement.View image in fullscreenThe Queensland primary industries minister, Tony Perrett, said shark nets and drum lines ‘are still the most effective way of protecting swimmers’.Photograph: Jono Searle/AAPIncluded in the government’s shark control plan, he said, was a survey of shark populations which would be “essential”, would “not be cheap” and “must be done properly”.“We haven’t had a stock assessment done on the target species in Queensland properly ever,” he said. “Getting that done is absolutely critical now”.“At the end of the day our approach is to do the best research possible.”Whether that research informs decision making or not, however, is a minister’s prerogative.The primary industries minister said he stood by his comments the shark control plan was backed by science in the wake of Simpfendorfer’s resignation.“The Crisafulli Government makes no apology for reaffirming the purpose of the Shark Control Management Plan 2025-2029 Plan to prioritise the safety of people above all else,” Perrett said.The minister said research showed anda recent KPMG reportconfirmed that “traditional methods (nets and drum lines) are still the most effective way of protecting swimmers”.“Until the new technology is scientifically proven as effective at protecting beach goers as traditional methods, we will continue to invest in what keeps Queenslanders and our beaches safe,” he said.Explore more on these topicsQueenslandSharksMarine lifeQueensland politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody is going to get around that”.Ina social media poston Saturday, Trump clarified the increase from 25% to 50% would be effective from 4 June and would apply to steel and aluminium.Australia will keep pushing US to drop Trump tariffs after court ruling, trade minister saysRead moreAustralia exports relatively little steel to the US. About 2.5% of US aluminium imports by volume come from Australia, but this is less than 10% of Australia’s total exports of the metal.Reiterating Australia’s stance on the tariffs, Farrell said in a statement on Saturday: “Australia’s position has been consistent and clear. These tariffs are unjustified and not the act of a friend.“They are an act of economic self-harm that will only hurt consumers and businesses who rely on free and fair trade. We will continue to engage and advocate strongly for the removal of the tariffs.”Speaking later on Saturday afternoon, Farrell said Australia was calling on Trump to reverse the decision and to drop all tariffs, but said there would be no retaliatory steps.“What we need to do now is to convince the Americans that this is, in fact, the wrong course of action,” he said.“It’s the wrong policy. It simply pushes up prices for American consumers. And that’s not good for the Americans. And it’s certainly not good for Australian steel and aluminium producers.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe shadow trade minister, Kevin Hogan, said on Saturday that Trump’s announcement was concerning for Australian jobs.“The Albanese government needs to double its efforts to protect our steel industry and local jobs for our steelworkers,” he said.“We expect the United States to honour its obligations under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, just as Australia has always done. The strength of our economic partnership has been built on trust and mutual benefit, and any deviation from this agreement undermines the principles of free trade.”Hogan said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, needed to personally meet Trump during the G7 talks in Canada taking place in two weeks “to develop a personal rapport with the United States president and protect Australian industries”.Hogan said: “The Coalition want the government to succeed because that is in the national interest.”Trump’s sweeping tariffs were initially blocked by a US court this week, which ruled them illegal, before the administrationwon a temporary pause on that ruling on Thursday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The council would keep working with the government, she said.Mark Cain, the chief executive of industry group the Australian Steel Institute, said the increase in tariffs was disappointing.He said: “One of the concerns we have is that the subsequent disruptions to global steel trade could see Australia become a dumping ground for imported steel. And it could exacerbate the surge in imported low-priced steel that is damaging the industry.”In March, when the steel tariffs came into force, BlueScope Steel, which exports about 300,000 tonnes of steel a year to the US, said it was disappointed the industry had not received the same tariff exemption that was negotiated during Trump’s first term. The company produces more than 3m tonnes of steel each year at its Ohio plant.BlueScope said at the time it was working closely with the Australian government’s trade and diplomatic staff “to ensure the BlueScope investment proposition is fully understood”.Australian economist Prof Justin Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, told Guardian Australia the steel tariffs would probably have little effect on Australian industry, as demand for steel globally should allow companies to find other customers.He said: “We are talking about very small numbers of people [who work in the steel industry in the US]. But steel is used as an input for a broad array of manufacturing jobs. Steel will be more expensive – even American steel.”Wolfers pointed toprevious analysis of the impact of 2018 steel tariffsduring the first Trump administration, which found they created about 1,000 more steel jobs but about 75,000 jobs were lost from the wider manufacturing sector.Asked why Trump was implementing the increase, Wolfers said: “There are some questions better directed to a psychologist than an economist. Trump likes tariffs.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyTrump tariffsAustralian politicsAustralian economyBusinessTrump administrationTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

These red flags include someone increasing the amount and frequency of their deposits.Burns was 21 at the time of gambling with BetNation and BetDeluxe. Transaction data shows he made deposits of $10,000, $25,000 and $35,000 within eight minutes. Later the same day, he lodged three deposits worth $120,000 during a 17-minute period.Shortly after lodging his complaint with the regulator in mid-March 2024, Burns received a WhatsApp message from a representative of the two bookmakers’ parent company, Amused Group.“Are you free for a brief call now?” the message said. “I wanted to discuss a settlement for your account.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWhen Burns asked how the representative had found his phone number, he was told someone at the regulator had shared it with them.BetDeluxe and BetNation were acquired by Amused Group in March 2023, a few months after the gambling in question, and Amused have said they did not acquire Burns’ account or “any liabilities associated with the conduct of the business before that date”.After the acquisition, Burns said he received an offerfrom Amused Group to settle his claims for $25,000, honouring an offer made to him under the previous owner, on the condition that he withdraw his complaint by the end of the day and agree to make no further complaints to the NTRWC or any other regulator.He also said the gambling company had told him that if the complaint proceeded with the regulator, the agreement and the financial offer would be void.He said he was told he would need to provide the company with an indemnity from all claims in relation to the subject of the dispute, including any adverse media.An Amused Group spokesperson did not comment on the specific allegations made by Burns nor the offer made to him “due to confidentiality and privacy considerations”. But they said the group “takes all customer complaints seriously and handles each matter in accordance with applicable laws”.The Consumer Action Law Centre’s chief executive, Stephanie Tonkin, said conditional settlement negotiations were common in many industries but expressed concern that they could be used to “silence victims and avoid scrutiny”.“In my view, [they] should be used in limited circumstances and should not prevent a complaint to a regulator,” Tonkin said.The Alliance forGamblingReform’s chief executive, Martin Thomas, said people had a right to complain to regulators.“It makes a mockery of the complaints system if this is the process that happens,” Thomas said. “Governments must do more to protect Australians.”Lauren Levin, who has spent decades researching the harms of the gambling industry, said “in the majority of cases, the offer of quick cash proves overwhelming for people in difficult financial circumstances”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they said this did not automatically prevent it from investigating serious allegations.“When the commission receives advice that a complaint is withdrawn due to the parties reaching a confidential settlement concerning the complaint, the commission undertakes an assessment to determine whether the subject matter of the complaint is sufficiently serious to warrant investigation and disciplinary action,” the spokesperson said.“There are a number of examples where the commission has disciplined a licensee after a complaint has been withdrawn.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsGamblingMelbournenewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, barbarians have taken to the streets of Paris to commit crimes and provoke law enforcement.“I have asked the internal security forces to react vigorously to these abuses. I offer my support to the police prefect and all the police officers who are ensuring everyone’s safety this evening.“It is unbearable that it is not possible to party without fearing the savagery of a minority of thugs who respect nothing.”About 5,400 police were deployed across the city for the post-match celebrations, with officers on the Champs-Élysées using teargas and pepper spray to maintain order.A police spokesperson said a car was set alight near the Parc des Princes and several dozen arrests had been made by the time the match ended, Reuters reported.Traffic around the Arc de Triomphe was blocked from midday with the Champs-Élysées boulevard and nearby streets also closed on Saturday evening.Earlier, in Munich, PSG and Inter Milan supporters threw stones at each other at Fröttmaning station while travelling to the Allianz arena for the final, Bild reported.They also caused travel disruption by making their way on to train tracks, according to reports.PSG’s win over Arsenal in the semi-final on 7 May sparked unrest inParis, with 47 people arrested and three others injured after being hit by a car.Explore more on these topicsParisParis Saint-GermainFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Last year itrecognised the Palestinian state, one of a minority of European countries to do so.“For the last one and a half years we have seen very low respect for international law in the war inGazaand in recent months it is worse than ever before,” Åsmund Aukrust said. “So for the Norwegian government it is very important to protest against this, to condemn this very clear violation.”In addition to contributing to the worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, he said Israel’s actions posed a global threat to other and future conflicts.“We are very concerned that there will be a new international standard where food is used as a weapon, where the UN is denied entrance to the war and conflict zone, and other NGOs are denied entrance,” he said. “And Israel is building up something they call Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is to militarise humanitarian aid.”GHF, the controversial Israeli and US-backed logistical group, started distributing food in Gaza this week. Amidchaotic scenes, Israeli forces said they fired “warning shots” at a distribution centre. Gaza health officials said at least one civilian had been killed and 48 injured.A UN-backed assessment earlier this month found that the entire population of the Gaza Strip, approximately 2.1 million people, were at critical risk of famine, with half a million people categorised as in catastrophe.Aukrust said: “We are afraid and very concerned that this might be a new standard in international law and this will make the world a lot more dangerous to all of us.”However, he said it was not up to politicians to decide whether the term genocide applied to Gaza, saying that was a decision for the international court of justice. “Genocide is the worst crime a country can do and the worst crime that politicians can do and this should not be polarised,” he said.However, he said Oslo would be keeping an “open line” to all parties – including Hamas – for dialogue and promised that Norway would be “there for the long run” to rebuild Gaza.“We have no limitation of who we are talking to. I would say the opposite. We would be happy to, and we want to, talk with those who are responsible, whether it is Israel, Hamas or others,” he said. “Dialogue is the most important word when it comes to peacemaking and we want to have an open line with all countries, all groups that might have an influence here.”The Norwegian oil fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund that operates under rules set by parliament, has so far blacklisted 11 companies for assisting Israel’s occupation.Next week, the Norwegian parliament is expected to reject calls to stop the fund from investing in companies that sell products and services in the occupiedPalestinian territories.Aukrust said decisions about the wealth fund were made by the bank, not politicians.“The bank decides where they want to invest. What the politicians do is to decide the rules,” he said. The rules, he added, were “very clear” that the fund should not invest in anything that contributed to a violation of international law.Norway’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine in May 2024 was “to send out a message of hope,” said Aukrust.He urged people acrossEuropeto “continue to protest” and to keep their faith in politics. “As long as the war is going on, from the Norwegian government side we will all the time look into what more can we do. What new initiative can we take. How can we send an even clearer message to those who are responsible for this.”Explore more on these topicsHuman rightsIsrael-Gaza warNorwayGazaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 200 settlements in the region were already under evacuation orders.The attacks came as Ukrainian diplomats continue to discuss participating in a fresh round of peace talks proposed by Moscow in Istanbul next week.Ukrainian cities ‘terrorised’ by North Korean weapons in Russian hands – reportRead moreThe Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskyy, has said that about 50,000 Russian troops were gathered on the border near the Sumy region, which he said was a sign that Moscow is preparing a renewed offensive.The Russian ministry of defence said on Saturday that it had taken control of the village of Novopil in the eastern Donetsk region, as well as the village of Vodolahy in the northern Sumy region.Russia’s military also launched 109 drones and five missiles atUkraineovernight and in the early hours of Saturday, many of which were intercepted, the Ukrainian air force said.The missile salvo killed a nine-year-old girl in the Zaporizhzhia region, eastern Ukraine, as well as injured a 16-year-old, the governor of Zaporizhzhia, Ivan Fedorov, said. Another man was killed by Russian shelling in the port city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine. “One house was destroyed. The shock wave from the blast also damaged several other houses, cars and outbuildings,” Fedorov wrote on Telegram.Ukraine also launched drone attacks in western Russia on Saturday, injuring 14 people.The back and forth attacks came as the prospect of continued peace talks between Russia and Ukraine remain uncertain. Moscow had proposed direct peace talks between the two countries in Istanbul on Monday, but Kyiv insisted that Russia should first provide a promised ceasefire proposal before it agreed to attend.Russia had previously said it would share a memorandum stating its position on what it wants to end the three-year war between the two countries, but has yet to do so. Ukrainian officials said that they had already handed a proposal to Russia setting out its terms.Zelenskyy accused Russia on Friday of “undermining diplomacy” by not giving Ukrainians its position paper.“For some reason, the Russians are concealing this document. This is an absolutely bizarre position. There is no clarity about the format,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Moscow has said that it will provide its peace terms in person on Monday.Both Russia and Ukraine have come under increasing international pressure to achieve a ceasefire, particularly after the US president, Donald Trump, made a ceasefire a key foreign policy priority.Trump has called for direct talksbetween the two countries, while Turkey has played a mediation role, offering to host summits between them.Diplomacy has had small gains, with an unprecedented prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine leading to1,000 prisoners being exchanged earlier in the month. The prisoner swap, meant to be a confidence-building measure, has yet to lead to greater breakthroughs.The EU has accused Russia of stalling ceasefire talks while it makes gains on the battlefield, a claim that Moscow has rebuffed. Moscow has said it is Ukraine that is delaying a ceasefire, though the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, has declined to agree to calls for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022, has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaDonald TrumpVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Bannister says it can load and off-load a ferry “with 120 trucks, 1,000 passengers and a couple of hundred cars in 45 minutes, faster than an A320 at Gatwick”.He is confident the biometric check regime being built will add just six minutes to a car journey.The new regime has presented particular challenges in Dover because the port is hemmed by the cliffs and there is no safe space for car passengers to be checked amid the flow of 10,000 trucks a day crossing the channel.“In an airport you have a nice, air-conditioned, well-lit hall, and an orderly queue of foot passengers going through. But we needed to cater for a carload of four people on a large, stormy night. So we couldn’t have people exit their vehicles [in the ferry queues]. That would be dangerous.”View image in fullscreenLand reclaimed next to the western ferry docks to create space for biometric checks. The white prefabricated structure is where coaches will disembark for fingerprinting.Photograph: Lisa O’Carroll/The GuardianIn an extraordinary solution supported by the UK and French governments, Dover will create a virtual frontier system, 1.4 miles across town for border checks on 12 hectares of reclaimed land.Peering down from the western cliffs, the first building to cater for coaches is already in place on a vast swathe of built-up ground currently topped with golden sand.A second bus and a separate car building will be installed in the coming months.To ensure the integrity of the border, buses will have their doors physically sealed with tape while they rejoin regular traffic across Dover town and continue a 1.4-mile journey from the western ferry to board the ferry at the eastern docks.Irregular movements between the biometric border and the ferry board will be monitored by a combination of AI and automatic number plate recognition.It isn’t the only change Bannister is expecting in the coming months.He is also hopeful that the reset in the relationship between the UK and the EU will end the environmentally and economically damaging issue of trucks returning to the continent empty.Another byproduct ofBrexit, it is estimated that on some days 30% to 40% of trucks have no cargo on them when they return to the continent because of strict checks on fresh food and farm products. These are expected to be scrapped as part of Keir Starmer’s reset.With £144bn worth of goods traded over the channel every year, the Port of Dover is of critical economic interest to France and the UK, representing half of the total of UK goods exported to Europe, Bannister said.The EU and the UK have pledged to negotiate a new deal eliminating the checks on food, which will allow small food and farm producers to export to Europe once again.Explore more on these topicsBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeKentTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

Return the fathers to our children. Don’t make them orphans.”A statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said: “We call upon the prime minister from here. The time has come for a deal. For the sake of our children’s future. One comprehensive deal to bring them all home. Right now.”Earlier on Saturday the Israeli military confirmed that it killed Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza chief, on May 13.Sinwar was the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza earlier this month. Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he had been killed.He was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian militant group’s deceased leader and mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel. Hamas has not confirmed his death.The Hamas response to the US proposal appears close to a previously reported version of the deal, which specified that the group would release 10 hostages, as well as a number of hostages’ remains, during the ceasefire in exchange for 1,100 Palestinian prisoners.The Hamas statement said: “This proposal aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to our people and our families in the Gaza Strip.”It said its response came “after conducting a round of national consultations”.“There are some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the US guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,” a senior official with the group told the Associated Press.The US ceasefire proposal reportedly involves a 60-day pause in fighting and a redoubling of efforts towards long-term peace, as well as guarantees from Israel that it will not resume its offensive after Hamas releases hostages, which the country did in March.Israeli negotiators accepted the deal, but Hamas’s initial reaction to the proposal was lukewarm. On Friday, the militant group said it was holding consultations with other factions operating under its rule in Gaza including Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Hamas’s response came after two days in which the militant group had indicated that the US proposal was more biased in favour of Israel than previous ones.A leading Hamas official, Basem Naim, said on Thursday that the US proposal “does not respond to any of our people’s demands”, including lifting the humanitarian blockade on the Gaza Strip that has led tofamine-likeconditions among the population of 2 million.The group’s reaction provoked the ire of their Israeli counterparts. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, threatened the group on Friday with “annihilation” if it did not accept. “The Hamas murderers will now be forced to choose: accept the terms of the ‘Witkoff deal’ for the release of the hostages – or be annihilated,” said Katz.Israel has not yet officially responded to Hamas’s response, but an officialtold Israeli reporterson condition of anonymity that Jerusalem was treating Hamas’s changes as an “effective rejection”.Israel’s plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza – podcastRead moreDeep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March after only two months.Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force, and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza be returned before it will agree to end the war.The Israeli government fears that a lasting ceasefire and withdrawal would leave Hamas with significant influence in Gaza, even if it surrenders formal power. With time, the Israelis worry Hamas might be able to rebuild its military and launch more 7 October-style attacks.On the other hand, Hamas fears that Israel could break the ceasefire – as it did last March – and resume the war, which the Israeli government would be permitted to do after 60 days under the terms of the deal.Aprevious ceasefire collapsedin mid-March after Israel refused to move to a planned second phase that could have led to a permanent end to the war, and instead restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip. Negotiators have met in the months since in an attempt to reach a ceasefire, with little progress to show for it.More than 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the besieged Palestinian territory on 7 October 2023. The Israeli offensive was in retaliation for a Hamas attack on the same day, which saw the group kill about 1,200 people and take 250 hostages. About 20 hostages are believed to still be alive and their return is a key demand of ceasefire negotiations.As negotiations over a ceasefire continued, Israel’s offensive in Gaza has ramped up. At least 60 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the last 24 hours, health officials said, while 72 people were killed on Thursday.Israel stopped allowing almost all humanitarian aid into Gaza when it resumed hostilities in the Palestinian territory. The nearly three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of more than 2 million to the brink of famine. While pressure has slightly eased in recent days as Israel allowed some aid to enter, aid organisations say far from enough food is getting in.“After nearly 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving – and they are no longer willing to watch food pass them by,” the World Food Programme said on Saturday. The UN aid agency had been allowed to bring 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza overnight, but the trucks were stopped en route by crowds of hungry people.Explore more on these topicsMiddle East and north AfricaGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Due to be unveiled by Keir Starmer on Monday, it will draw heavily on lessons learned from the war inUkraine.Plans to step up munitions production are a response to the review’s call for an “always on” capacity that can be scaled up quickly if needed.Healey said: “The hard-fought lessons from Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine show a military is only as strong as the industry that stands behind them. We are strengthening the UK’s industrial base to better deter our adversaries and make the UK secure at home and strong abroad.”He said theUK defence industrywould become “an engine for economic growth” and boost skilled jobs. The new £1.5bn funding will see spending on UK munitions hit £6bn during this parliament and support 1,800 jobs across the UK, according to the Ministry of Defence.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said that “a strong economy needs a strong national defence, and investing in weaponry and munitions and backing nearly 2,000 jobs across Britain in doing so is proof the two go hand-in-hand”.As part of the review, the Ministry of Defence will be urged to lay the industrial foundations for an uplift in munitions stockpiles to meet the demand of“high-tempo” warfare.Ministers have also announced more than £1.5bn to improvethe condition of military homesby carrying out urgent repairs such as fixing boilers and roofs and tackling damp.“Our forces make extraordinary sacrifices to keep us safe and to serve this country and yet for years, we’ve forced their families to live in substandard homes,” Healey said on a visit to military accommodation in Cambridgeshire.Starmer launched the strategic defence reviewshortly after entering office last yearand said it would help prepare the UK for “a more dangerous and volatile world”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Figures out this week show that the size of the army has dropped below the target to the lowest level since the Napoleonic era and earlier, with the number of full-time trained soldiers at 70,860 on 1 April, down 2.3% over the preceding year.The review is not expected to set out fresh commitments for defence spending, but will instead reiterate a commitment made by Starmer in February to increase the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament.It was written by former Nato secretary-general George Robertson, former US presidential adviser Fiona Hill and former joint force commander Richard Barrons.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryMinistry of DefenceJohn HealeyRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

He will seek to agree a timeline for implementing the deal agreed to lower steel, aluminium, auto and other product tariffs.A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK was the first country to secure a trade deal with the US earlier this month and we remain committed to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel.”“We are engaging with the US on the implications of the latest tariff announcement and to provide clarity for industry.”The Guardian reported thatBritish officials were intensifying trade talks with the US and hope to see the deal implemented within weeks.A government source said: “Some countries are viewing the court ruling as an indication that they were right not to negotiate over tariffs. We’re taking the opposite view, and trying to get this deal implemented as soon as possible.”Trump and Keir Starmerannounced a US-UK trade deal earlier this monthunder which on British steel and aluminium will be reduced to zero, and tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars a year will be reduced from 25% to 10%.The deal did not cover Trump’s blanket 10% tariffs on all foreign imports, which afederal court overturned last week, arguing that the US president had overstepped his powers. Anappeals court paused the rulingand said Trump’s tariffs could continue while it examines the arguments.The European Commission said on Saturday that it “strongly” regretted Trump’s decision to double steel and aluminium tariffs, and warned that the EU was prepared to retaliate.“This decision adds further uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,” a spokesperson for the commission said, adding that “the tariff increase also undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution”.“The EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase.”“The European Commission is currently finalising consultations on expanded countermeasures. If no mutually acceptable solution is reached, both existing and additional EU measures will automatically take effect on 14 July – or earlier, if circumstances require.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policySteel industryBritish SteelJonathan ReynoldsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a Friday treat at a decent price.”“I’ve noticed it’s becoming a bigger thing,” says Gemma Saunders, 46, who’s just bought gelato with her daughter Elizabeth, 13. “It’s a nice alternative to going out drinking and more and more people aren’t drinking. It’s quite a family place.”“I can meet my friends in places like this,” adds Elizabeth. “It’s less expensive than going out for pizza.”The last couple of years have been challenging, as the rising cost of dairy products plus higher energy and wage bills have combined with falling visitor numbers to high streets and shopping malls.However, Creams – which has 93 outlets, almost all of which are run by franchisees – is back on the expansion trail with plans for about 10 new outlets this year, and a similar number next year.The menu features the Hot ‘n’ Cold Chocolate Fudge Volcano, the Lemon Meringue Cheesecakundae, the Birthday Cake Loaded Shake and hot waffles topped with Oreo, Bueno and Speculoos.The company – which opened its first outlet in Southall in 2011, has its own Gelato factory in Dagenham and makes its waffle mix in Dunstable – is exploring new types of venues in cinemas and travel hubs, such as train stations. It is also testing two sites in Tesco supermarkets and is in talks to go international, with the Middle East or the US a likely first step.Rival company Kaspa’s, which has about 100 outlets, has also been on the expansion trail, opening its first central London venue last year, while younger challenger Heavenly Desserts, which has 60 outlets in the UK after recent openings in London and Middlesbrough, is aiming for 100 by next year, with plans for outlets in Bedford, Basildon and Manchester.At the more upmarket end of the scene, Bristol company Swoon Gelato has expanded to Oxford and Bath, and now has a spot in Selfridges department store in London, putting dessert firmly on the fashion menu.Arguably, the concept of a dessert specialist goes back to the early 20th century with the likes of Bettys in Harrogate or Lyons Tea Rooms, or the ice-cream parlours that began opening across the UK from the late 19th century.However, the likes of Creams, Kaspa’s and Heavenly Desserts have given desserts-only venues a youthful twist – with a mix of cakes, waffles, crepes and gelato – aimed at those who want an alternative to the pub or more staid atmosphere of coffee shops and tearooms, which often close at 4pm.View image in fullscreenSwoon Gelato on College Green, Bristol.Photograph: Mr Standfast/AlamySince Creams opened its first outlet in 2011, the dessert shop has become a meeting point for a wide array of British society, from kids and teens, who take over such venues as a place to hang out after school or in the early evening, to family groups and other non-drinkers searching for an alcohol-free place to socialise into the evening, to gen Z mates who increasingly favour booze-free venues and have an eye for the pop of colour an elaborate dessert can add to their social media feeds.At Creams, the decor is reminiscent of a night club, with black walls and spotlights helping to highlight the bubblegum-bright colours of its gelato.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a brand, we benefit from the growing desire among younger people for mindful, alcohol-free social experiences,” a spokesperson said.Everett Fieldgate, the chief executive of Creams, says you might find a different demographic attacking the waffles and ice-creams depending on the time of day you enter one of the company’s outlets, which open as late as 3am in some locations.The Australian is giving the brand a new spin with a lighter look intended to appeal more to twentysomethings, families and daytime punters. He has also introduced a healthier range of items – including fruit skewers, albeit drizzled in chocolate – as families try to dial down their sugar intake.“Consumers are definitely holding back, and they’re being very careful with where and how they’re spending money,” says Fieldgate.He says some consumers are looking to cut their spending on their favourite treat while others are downsizing from a meal out to just dessert and Creams is “benefiting from both”. Fieldgate says Creams is also benefiting from the trend for some consumers to take time out – permanently or temporarily – from drinking alcohol, saying to friends, as he puts it: “Let’s go somewhere where I’m not going to be tempted.”In the cost of living crisis, such dessert places may not be cheap, with Creams’ Hot ‘N’ Cold Chocolate Fudge Volcano Sundae costing £10.95, but they are so massive they can be shared and the whole experience is likely to cost less than a full meal out.Fieldgate says 2025 has started well, with sales helped by the warm sunny weather, although he says the group is “keeping a close eye on costs” and being careful to ensure new sites are viable amid higher business rates and wages.He says the hospitality industry needs more help from government to revive high streets and help it fight back against online shopping.“People are holding on by the skin of their teeth because of poor consumer confidence and the constantly increasing cost of doing business,” he says.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryRestaurantsRetail industryDessertUK cost of living crisisIce-cream and sorbetnewsShareReuse this content"

About 250 million honeybees flew free of the truck around 4am a few miles south of Canada.The truck that was transporting around 70,000lbs of hives and honeybees rolled over on a road in north-westernWashington state. Local sheriff deputies and bee experts swarmed to the scene, where they removed the box hives to help recover and rescue as many bees as possible. The driver of the truck was not injured.Hours later, officials could not bee-lieve that the bees began to swarm and sting the deputies. Some sheriff deputies took refuge in their patrol cars to avoid the stinging swarm.According to a sheriff’s spokesperson, the driver was neither drunk nor buzzed; rather, the driver likely did not navigate a sharp turn well enough, causing the trailer to roll.Allow Facebook content?This article includes content provided byFacebook.

Prior to Noem accusing Morales-Reyes of threatening to kill the president, local investigators in Milwaukee were already reportedly investigating whether the letter was a setup.Morales-Reyes was allegedly assaulted by a man in September 2023, who slashed him with a box cutter before stealing his bike. As the case prepared to go to trial, Ice this month received the letter threatening to assassinate Trump.“I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president,” the handwritten letter says, which was completely written in English and signed with Morales-Reyes’ name.Morales-Reyes was arrested and detained. But local investigators compared Morales-Reyes’ handwriting with the letter and found they did not match.Meanwhile, activists and attorneys began working on his case. Local Wisconsin immigration advocates and attorneys, with Morales-Reyes’ family, said during a press release on Friday that Morales-Reyes did not write the letter.“A family member called our organizers, letting us know that this was impossible, as her father had very little formal education and could not read or write in Spanish – let alone perfect English,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, the executive director of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant advocacy organization.Citing police documents it had obtained, CNN reported that Milwaukee officials on Monday began reviewing jailhouse calls from the individual accused of having assaulted Morales-Reyes and discovered he discussed sending letters to Ice in order to frame his alleged victim. He reportedly wanted to have Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying in the robbery trial.“He outta there,” the person said in a phone call earlier in May, according to the CNN report, and described how Trump’s return to office was increasing deportations.On Wednesday, Noem began sharing the accusation against Morales-Reyes, along with his photo and an image of the letter, which were posted in a press release on the DHS website.

And also that he searched the internet for information about serial killer Ted Bundy as well as for pornography with the keywords “drugged”, “sleeping” and “passed out”. The defense is arguing it now requires more time to prepare for trial because of the publicity around that information.Judge bans use of ‘psychopath’ and ‘sociopath’ in Idaho student murder trialRead moreFurther problems may arise in July with the pre-trial publication of TheIdahoFour, by the crime writer James Patterson and the journalist Vicky Ward, who ran afoul of a judge in South Carolina after obtaining crime-scene photos and documents in a civil claim related to that state’s notorious Alex Murdaugh double murder case.Kohberger’s attorneys have said the blurb for the book “suggests that the apparent Dateline leak was not the only violation of this court’s non-dissemination order” and a delay might mitigate the “prejudicial effects of such inflammatory pretrial publicity”.Idaho judge Steven Hippler has said he is open to appointing a special prosecutor to question people under oath to determine the origin of the leaks. But whether or not a delay is granted, a number of recent court rulings have been going against Kohberger, who has pleaded not guilty.His defense team has tried to keep considerable evidence, including a 911 call alerting police to the crime; the description of a man with “bushy eyebrows” at the house around the time of the murders; and his Amazon shopping history, including the purchase of a knife similar to the one the alleged assailant was said to have used, out of the trial.Amazon records show that an account under Kohberger’s name and email address bought a Ka-Bar knife, sheath and sharpener in March 2022, eight months before the murders, and had them shipped to his parents’ home in Pennsylvania, where he was later arrested. A brown leather Ka-Bar knife sheath was found, police said, next to one victim’s body and DNA on the clasp matched to Kohberger.Kohberger’s defense team claims his Amazon purchase history was “out of context, incomplete and unfairly prejudicial”, but Hippler ruled it was “highly relevant” and “establishes significant connection between the defendant and Ka-Bar knife and sheath”.In another ruling against the defence, Hippler turned down a request to exclude the criminology student’s 12-page master’s essay from being presented as evidence in the trial. In it, Kohberger assessed how to handle a crime scene where a woman has been found stabbed to death.Other rulings going against the suspect involve evidence about his white Hyundai Elantra – a similar make and model of car that prosecutors say the killer drove and which was captured on security video near the home before the murders and leaving soon after.Nor has the judge allowed defense requests that the death penalty option be dropped because their client was once diagnosed with autism. Hippler instead ruled that the defense can only introduce the diagnosis if Kohberger testifies in his own defense or as a mitigating factor is he is convicted.But Hippler has also ruled that Kohberger’s defense was permitted to keep a court filing ‘in support of … alternate perpetrators” sealed from public view. It is not yet clear if defense claims of another perpetrator, or perpetrators, claimed to be in the documents will be permitted at trial.Absent from the prosecutors’ filings to date are any attempts to ascribe a motive for Kohberger’s alleged actions.Forensic psychiatrist Carole Lieberman hassaidshe believes Kohberger’s decision to study psychology and then criminology was because he was “trying to calm the demons inside of him” and simultaneously “trying to learn how to commit the perfect crime”.To the Guardian last week she went further, arguing that the bloody crime scene and use of a knife was evidence that Kohberger harbored rage against young women.Kohberger, she claimed, had held this rage since at least middle school, when he had a crush on a cheerleader – said to have looked like Kaylee Goncalves – only for her to reject him.“I think that’s why he stalked and killed them,” she said.Man accused of murdering four Idaho students fights against death penaltyRead moreAccording to some reports, Kohhberg followed Mogen and Goncalves on Instagram. The defence denies the claim and argues there is no motive to find because Kohberger did not commit the crime.Louis Schlesinger, a professor of psychology at John Jay College, said it should be noted that Kohberger’s alleged crime was a targeted mass killing, not a serial killing, because there were two others in the home at the time, including a surviving roommate, who reported seeing an intruder with “bushy eyebrows”, and were not attacked.“This seems to be situationally based, so you can rule out psychosis or impulsivity,” Schlesinger said, “and it doesn’t appear to be sexually motivated. It could be jealousy or a feeling of rejection or humiliation. But we really don’t know the motive was.”But that doesn’t mean a jury would not want prosecutors to at least imply a motive.“Jurors want to hear a motive before they send someone to the execution chamber,” he said. “They will want to know why he did it.”Explore more on these topicsIdahoUS crimeUS universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

However, most of the people whose DNA has been collected by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), the agency that published the documents, were not listed as having been accused of any felonies. Regardless, CBP is now creating a detailed DNA profile on migrants that will be permanently searchable by law enforcement, which amounts to a “massive expansion of geneticsurveillance”, one expert said.The DNA information is stored in a database managed by theFBIcalled the Combined DNA Index System (Codis), which is used across the country by local, state and federal law enforcement to identify suspects of crimes using their DNA data.Doge gained access to sensitive data of migrant children, including reports of abuseRead moreWired firstreportedthe practice and the existence of these documents, and estimates there are more than 133,000 migrant teens and children whose DNA has been collected and uploaded to Codis. One of them was just four years old.“In order to secure our borders, CBP is devoting every resource available to identify who is entering our country. We are not letting human smugglers, child sex traffickers and other criminals enter American communities,” Hilton Beckham, the assistant commissioner of public affairs at CBP, told Wired in a statement. “Toward this end, CBP collects DNA samples for submission to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System … from persons in CBP custody who are arrested on federal criminal charges, and from aliens detained under CBP’s authority who are subject to fingerprinting and not otherwise exempt from the collection requirement.”Experts at Georgetown University and the Center on Privacy and Technology published areportlast week that found that CBP was collecting the DNA of almost every migrant detained, regardless of how long they were detained. The agency has added more than 1.5m DNA profiles to Codis since 2020, a 5,000% increase in just three years, according to the report. It’s a “massive expansion of genetic surveillance and an unjustified invasion of privacy,” according to one of the authors of the report, Emerald Tse.“The program reinforces harmful narratives about immigrants and intensifies existing policing practices that target immigrant communities and communities of color, making us all less safe,” Tse said in a statement.The documents CBP published, which detail each individual whose DNA was swabbed, their age and country of origin, where they were transferred to, and what they were charged with, date back to as early as 2020. The latest document published is from the first quarter of 2025. There are hundreds of thousands of entries of people whose DNA has been collected by CBP between 2020 and 2024. Of the more than 130,000 individuals who were children or teens, nearly 230 were children under the age of 13 and more than 30,000 were between 14 and 17 years old, according to Wired.CBP first launched apilot programto begin collecting detainees’ DNA data in 2020, in accordance with a Department of Justice rule that gave the agency three years to comply with a new requirement to collect genetic samples and upload it to Codis. At the time, CBP wrote that it was collecting DNA data from non-US citizens who had been detained between the ages of 14 and 79. The Department of Homeland Security and CBP policy generally states that children under 14 are not obliged to have their DNA information collected, though there is some discretion afforded to field officers.However, this pace of genetic data collection would not have been possible in a criminal legal context, according to the Center onPrivacyand Technology and Georgetown report.“Until 2020, almost all the DNA profiles in Codis’s ‘offender’ database were added by state and local police and other criminal law enforcement agencies,” the report reads. “In the criminal context, there are some limitations on when, how and from whom criminal law enforcement agencies can take DNA which make the process of amassing samples cumbersome and resource-intensive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the meaning of the term ‘detained’ in the immigration context is notoriously broad, vague and ever shifting,” the report reads.According to the CBP website, the agency sends the DNA data directly to the FBI and does not store or maintain the DNA data itself. That genetic information is stored by the FBI indefinitely, according to the Center on Privacy and Technology and Georgetown report.“How would it change your behavior to know that the government had a drop of your blood – or saliva – containing your ‘entire genetic code, which will be kept indefinitely in a government-controlled refrigerator in a warehouse in Northern Virginia’?” the report reads, quoting CBP’s documents. “Would you feel free to seek out the medical or reproductive care you needed?

For his administration, and the world, they have proven anything but. Now an obscure New York court has blocked his signature trade policy, setting up a battle that looks sure to end up in the supreme court.The plan was simple. For decades, Trump hasmade the case for tariffs. Now, in his second term, he would dramatically hike them on the world; raise trillions of dollars for the federal government; cut taxes for Americans; and lure manufacturers to the country’s industrial heartlands, creating millions of jobs.But this drastic bid to overhaul the global economy has proved far more complicated.Time and again over the past four months, reality failed to match the rhetoric. Threats werefollowed by delays. Exemptions werecarved outof supposedly universal tariff waves. Even when they were imposed, it wasdays, if not hours, before pauses were announced.Trump’s tariff threat reruns are as fierce as they are fleetingRead moreTrump returned to office determined to ignore all the warnings that led his first administration to hold back from executing his most extreme ideas.Long before the president had returned to the White House, he had pledged to hike duties on his country’s two biggest trading partners and launch a trade war with the world’s second largest economy. Sweeping levies on dozens of other countries ensued.Each significant economic assault has set the stage for a swift retreat. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico wereall but halted. Steep individual tariffs calculated for a string of trading partners werereduced to 10%. An eye-watering 145% tariff on Chinese goods wasdrastically cut, having been in place for a matter of weeks.Trump’s mind in each case was not changed. His arm was twisted.Panic in the markets prompted his administration, after initially making a show of defiance, to back down. And warnings that the very people who voted Trump back into power would bear the brunt of his tariffs prompted the president, after initiallyplaying down the risks, to reconsider.Trump’s economic agenda, which is aides are trying to ram through without guardrails, has so far been curbed by real-world consequences that failed to match his narrative. And on Wednesday, a further twist threatened to derail the core of his plan.To impose blanket tariffs on nations from Mexico and Mauritius to China and Chad, the administration declared a national emergency and used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law, as legal justification.The flow of fentanyl across borders, and the fact the US imports more than it exports, are emergencies that warrant tariffs under IEEPA, according to the White House. A little-known federal court disagreed.IEEPA “does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders”, the US court of international trade concluded in a ruling. Most of Trump’s tariffs – including a 10% rate on all imports, introduced last month – “exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs”, a panel of three federal judges wrote.An appeals court on Thursdayruledthe decision was “temporarily stayed until further notice while this court considers the motions papers”.But there is no doubt that this was a significant setback. Rather than reluctantly walk back his tariffs himself, and present it as some kind of negotiating coup, as Trump has repeatedly done in recent months, for the first time figures outside his administration were pulling the plug.“This was a novel and expansive use of IEEPA, and an untested one,” said Greta Peisch, former general counsel at the Office of the US Trade Representative under Joe Biden. “It was brand new,” she added. “They were really testing the limits of that power, and the ability of the executive branch to use it to impose tariffs.”The administration’s appealallegedthe ruling was an example of “judicial tyranny” in the US. But a narrower decision on Thursday, when a second US court issued a preliminary ruling against Trump’s tariffs in a case brought by two Illinois toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, presented another legal obstacle.Whatever happens, this process is unlikely to force Trump to fundamentally rethink his economic agenda. The US court of international trade ruling was not about whether the White House should launch a series of tariff assaults on the world, but how.“We’ve got a very strong case with IEEPA,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro claimed during a Bloomberg interview on Thursday. “But the court basically tells us, if we lose that, we just do some other things,” he said. “So nothing’s really changed.”Want to see where Trump’s tariffs are leading US business? Look at GeorgiaRead moreAfter months of uncertainty, these latest legal spats add another layer of confusion, rather than provide clarity, to businesses trying to navigate the world economy under Trump.“We will leave this decision to work its way through the United States courts system,” said Candace Laing, the president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “Ultimately, the end of this trade war with the US will not come through the courts.”Despite Trump’s promises, most Americans are not as“rich as hell”, thanks to the tariffs. Nor have tariffs raised trillions of dollars, or created millions of jobs. But Trump’s view has also not changed. They remain beautiful, at least in his eyes.“Don’t project that this is going to be where we end up,” Peisch, now an attorney at law firm Wiley, said of the current legal limbo. “There’s going to be lots of ups and downs before we get to wherever the final resting place is for tariffs under this administration.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsUS economyEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The president has thrown his full support behind the deal, months after insisting he was “totally against” a $14.9bn bid by Nippon Steel for its US rival.The United Steelworkers union had previously urged Trump to reject Nippon’s bid, dismissing the Japanese firm’s commitments to invest in the US as “flashy promises” and claiming it was “simply seeking to undercut our domestic industry from the inside”.Speaking to steelworkers,Trumpinsisted that US Steel would “stay an American company” after what he is now calling “a partnership” with Nippon.ButUS Steel’s websitelinks to a standalone site with the combined branding of the two companies that featuresa statementdescribing the transaction as “US Steel’s agreement to be acquired by NSC”.On thewebsite touting the deal, there were also multiple references to “Nippon Steel’s acquisition of US Steel” and the “potential sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel”.Even pro-Trump commentators on Fox expressed bafflement over the exact nature of the deal.“This is being described as ‘a partnership’, this deal between Nippon and US Steel – but then it’s described as an acquisition on the US Steel website,” Fox host Laura Ingrahampointed outon her Friday-night show.She asked a guest from another pro-Trump outlet, Breitbart: “Who owns the majority stake in this company?”When the guest said he did not know, Ingraham suggested Trump might not be aware of the details. “I don’t know if he was fully informed about the terms of the deal. We just don’t know.”Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, hadblockedNippon’s acquisition, citing national security concerns, during his final weeks in office.During his remarks at the rally, Trump gloated that the Nippon investment would once again make the American steelmaker “synonymous with greatness”. He said protections were included to “ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving” and said Nippon had committed to maintaining all of US Steel’s currently operating blast furnaces for the next decade.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Praising the president, Jason Zugai, vice-president of Irvin local 2227, said he believed the investments would be “life-changing”.But the powerful United Steelworkers union remained wary.“Our primary concern remains with the impact that this merger of US Steel into a foreign competitor will have on national security, our members and the communities where we live and work,” the United Steelworkers president, David McCall, said in a statement.“Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard.”Trump framed the administration’s drive to boost domestic steel production as “not just a matter of dignity or prosperity or pride” but as “above all, a matter of national security”.He blamed “decades of Washington betrayals and incompetence and stupidity and corruption” for hollowing out the once-dominant American steel industry, as the jobs “melted away, just like butter”.“We don’t want America’s future to be built with shoddy steel from Shanghai. We want it built with the strength and the pride of Pittsburgh,” he said.In his remarks at a US steel plant, Trump also repeated many of the false claims that have become a feature of his rallies including the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. He gloated over his 2024 victory and, gesturing toward his ear that was grazed by a would-be assassin’s bullet last year at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, said it was proof that a higher power was watching over him.He also called on congressional Republicans to align behind his “one big, beautiful bill”, urging attendees to lobby their representatives and senators to support the measure.Lois Beckett and Callum Jones contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsSteel industryDonald TrumpPennsylvaniaTariffsEconomicsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

He aims to eradicate “gender ideology” by enforcing a two-sex binary determined at conception, reinstating and expanding the militaryban on transgender service members, and directing agencies to preventgender-affirming carefor youth.The best US exhibitions and art events for Pride month 2025Read moreThis leaves the LGBTQ+ community feeling apprehensive about losing further rights and protections.The Guardian spoke with four queer business owners, and one message was clear: queer businesses are here to support the community now more than ever and spread joy as resistance.Uptick in weddingsBusiness is surging for New England-based wedding photographer Lindsey “Lensy” Michelle as queer couples decide to take their vows, fearing theTrump administrationwill go after marriage equality. Michelle says she’s only getting louder and even “more queer”.“I’m not changing anything about my business, no matter what the government says,” Michelle said. “We elected a president who doesn’t support this type of marriage, or at the very least doesn’t care enough to try to protect it.”View image in fullscreenLindsey ‘Lensy’ Michelle.Photograph: Lindsey WilliamsShe is seeing queer couples accelerate their wedding plans in fear of Trump and the supreme court overturning2015’s rulingon Obergefell v Hodges,which recognized same-sex marriages. Michelle currently offers accessible pricing for queer couples.“[Pride] is a good time to remind wedding vendors to stop advertising to only brides or using very gendered language, or assuming that every couple has a bride and a groom,” she said. “Performative allyship is really dangerous, and for businesses June can be a time of greater reflection on how they can be more clear and inclusive.”According to Michelle, there is an emerging trend for queer couples to distinguish legal marriage from a wedding ceremony. Many of her clients explained that they are registering their marriage now out of an “abundance of caution” because they don’t feel like “their rights will be protected”, she said.“It’s a privilege when you’re able to celebrate instead of protest and queerness is always rebellious,” she said. “You protest when things aren’t welcoming to begin with and you celebrate when you’re able to but I think also you have to do both. Otherwise, it becomes quite sad.”After noticing an uptick in demand, she created an LGBTQ+ wedding directory of more than 130 businesses. She didn’t stop there: Michelle then teamed up with five other vendors to throw a queer mass wedding ball for six lucky couples on 5 January.“We don’t really feel like celebrating. We feel like crying and we feel helpless and all we’re trying to do is get married,” Michelle said. “We just wanted to throw a party. This event is coming out of the time of fear and uncertainty, but that’s always been the queer story.”View image in fullscreenAmber Weiss and Sharon Papo at city hall in San Francisco on 17 June 2008.Photograph: Michael Macor/APThe team behind the wedding ball are “open to the idea” of hosting a similar event in other states, particularly in Republican-led ones.Ninestates are urging the supreme court to reverse Obergefell v Hodges.“We’re scared, and I don’t put that lightly,” Michelle said.We will surviveIn Decatur, Georgia, Charis Books & More aims to alleviate the fears the queer and trans community are experiencing.“My job is to support young people and those with children and to say: ‘Look, we have spent most of our history as queer and trans people as outlaws and we can be outlaws again. But, we will survive, we are very creative and we’ll figure out how to get through this time,’” said Errol Anderson, the executive director of Charis Books & More’s non-profit arm, Charis Circle.View image in fullscreenThe mass wedding at Charis Books & More in Decatur, Georgia.Photograph: Kara Hunter PhotographyCharis Circle hosts events like story time and offers support groups, especially for the trans community. They have four support groups for trans and gender non-conforming individuals across ages. Georgians in less welcoming parts of the state see Charis “as a beacon”, according to Anderson.“We’re seeing these particularly aggressive attacks on trans people for the past couple years now being mirrored in national legislation and it’s very scary,” Anderson said. “A lot of people right now feel very hopeless, but we need to remember we do actually have a lot of power to speak up for what we believe in and our voices do matter.”Joy as resistanceNew York’s 34-year-old queer bar Henrietta Hudson is returning to its roots as a political activist space, especially as Pride approaches.View image in fullscreenHutch Hutchinson outside Henrietta Hudson in New York City.Photograph: Courtesy of Jean Ding“Acutely since the inauguration, but really since the election, there’s a different tone to how people come to [the bar]. It feels more necessary,” Hutch Hutchinson said. “People are craving to be around other queer people and to be in a safer space. We have to buckle down for the family we have here.”Hutchinson, who uses he/they pronouns, is the director of operations at Henrietta Hudson. He said Pride is already in the air as the bar has seen a surge in energy and purpose.Scared advertisers, flag bans and Trump: the US is in for a troubled Pride 2025Read more“[Pride] often does feel like a protest and we call our Pride as occupying Hudson, a very definitive statement on us taking up space in the West Village,” he said. “The general feeling at Henrietta Hudson is that we’ve just become more political. This place has been through so many eras of queer resistance and uprising. We are relighting that fire.”They lend their bar to vetted non-profits and local grassroots organizations for events giving back to the LGBTQ+ community, such as a Pride week fundraiser benefiting the BTFA Collective for Black trans femme artists and the annual NYC Dyke March.Hutchinson explained that the bar will always take explicit stances to protect and support the community. Itposteda message on their Instagram, calling out the “immoral”, “dangerous” and “unlawful” attacks by Trump’s administration.“We talk, as a [staff] about, what does resistance look like? Sure, resistance is showing up to rallies and supporting the ACLU, learning your rights, marching and protesting,” he added. “But it’s so important for us to dance and to see each other smile and laugh and sing. Our joy is resistance.”Being visible is more importantDown in St Louis, Missouri, art collective Swan Meadow plans to be a safe third space for the community where members can “simply exist as who they are”. Partners Fern and Mellody Meadow, who both use they/them pronouns, emptied their savings to open the collective last fall after a close presidential election.View image in fullscreenThe Cubbyhole, a ‘friendly neighborhood bar’, in Manhattan, on 27 May 2021.Photograph: Caitlin Ochs/Reuters“We are always trying to craft events and spaces for people to come to and to sit with complicated emotions and thoughts and to talk to people about them,” Fern said. “It can be isolating and so frustrating to know that things are wrong that are outside of our control, but when you come together as a community, so much positive change can happen.”They open their workshop multiple times a month for free community-focused events such as “crafternoons”. ​Some events act as fundraisers for local mutual aid organizations such as the Community Closet, which distributes free household, cleaning and hygiene items. The collective also offers branding, photography and printing services.The Meadows envision Swan Meadow taking on a larger role in political advocacy for the community.“As pushback becomes more prevalent and discrimination becomes more normal, being visible is more important than ever,” Mellody said. “I’m tired of living through history.”Explore more on these topicsPrideSmall businessLGBTQ+ rightsTrump administrationUS supreme courtUS politicsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The political swing state has a $900bn economy – somewhere between the GDPs of Taiwan and Switzerland.The hospitality industry is facing an existential crisis. Wine merchants wonder aloud if they will survive the year. But others, like those in industrial manufacturing, will carefully argue that well-positioned businesses will profit. Some say they’re insulated from international competition by the nature of their industry. Others, like the movie industry, are simply confused by the proposals that have been raised, and are looking for entirely different answers. So far, it’s a mixed bag.In a state Trump won by two points and with yet another pivotal US Senate race in a year, Republican margins are thinner than those of the retailers with their business on the line here.Trump claimed ‘tariffs are easy’ – he’s learning the hard way that’s not the caseRead moreCarson Demmond, a wine distributor inGeorgia, finds herself looking at seaborne cargo notices for her wine shipments from France with the nervousness of a sports gambler watching football games. She’s betting on her orders of French champagne and bordeaux getting to a port in Savannah before tariffs restart.It’s a risk. Demmond put a hold on orders after Trump enacted sky-high tariffs on European goods last month. When he paused the tariffs days later, Demmond began to assess what she might chance on restarting some purchases.But her wine isn’t showing up on a ship in France yet, she said.“I don’t see them booked on ships yet, and normally they would already be booked, and I would already have sail dates,” she said. “I see a lot of my orders now collecting in consolidation warehouses in Europe, which says to me that there’s something wrong.”Demmond suspects that shipping is suffering from a bullwhip-like effect from uncertainty around tariffs and the economy: so many buyers are trying to get ahead of tariffs that there aren’t enough shipping containers to go around to meet the short-term demand.I see a lot of my orders collecting in warehouses in Europe, which says to me that there’s something wrongCarson Demmond, wine distributor“It means that as strategic as I’m trying to be with regards to timing my orders so I don’t get hit with lots of tariff bills at the same time, I feel like now all of that is out of my control,” Demmond said. “I never want to face a situation where I have too many orders that all sail and land at the same time, and then getting hit with really large tariff bills in one fell swoop.”US courts, meanwhile, are vacillating on the legality of Trump’s tariffs. The stock market rallied this week after the US court of international trade (CIT)ruledthat Trump’s use of extraordinary powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) exceeded his authority. Less than a day later, an appellate court lifted the lower court’s block on the tariffs while the case plays out.Unpredictability is driving volatility, and volatility is poisonous to businesses built for stable markets and stable prices.Georgia’s ports have not yet witnessed the massive slowdown occurring on the west coast. Shipping at the port of Los Angeles isdown by a thirdas buyers cancel orders from China. But Savannah – the third-busiest port in the United States behind the Los Angeles area and New York/New Jersey ports – just came off its busiest month.“We’re still watching how this goes,” said Tom Boyd, the chief communications officer for Georgia’s ports authority. “We still are having 30 to 32 vessels a week. Most everybody has been front loading to avoid any supply chain disruptions. Volumes are strong, but we expect volumes to decrease.”Savannah’s port sees more ships from the Indian subcontinent, Vietnam and Europe than from China, because it’s a few days shorter from India through the Suez Canal than across the Pacific, he said.Demmond, who runs the wine distributor Rive Gauche, watches the reports up and down the eastern seaboard carefully because many of the ships from Europe dock in New Jersey before coming south, she said. About 60% of her business is in French wine. Shipping volumes are making logistical planning difficult, she said. Amazon has hired away warehouse workers, which slows down unloading and can leave her wine on a ship for longer periods.We still are having 30 to 32 vessels a week. Volumes are strong, but we expect volumes to decreaseTom Boyd, Georgia’s ports authorityShe likened the logistical disruption today to the effects of Covid-19 shutdowns.“There’s going to be a crazy ripple effect through multiple industries,” Demmond said. “In normal times, I could count on approximately eight weeks from the time I send my purchase order to the winery for them to prepare it, to the time that it arrives at port. Now, you know, I have no idea, because everything is different and unpredictable. I have a hard time quoting arrival times to people.”Demmond is a wine merchant, not a political economist. Predicting the course of trade negotiations has become a business hazard. She and other Georgia wine distributors met with the representative Hank Johnson last month to describe the effect of a 200% tariff on European wine imports on their business.Many restaurants derive half of their revenue or more from alcohol sales. If the cost of spirits triples, many people will change their dining habits. Domestic supply can’t make up the difference, she said. A decision to expand a domestic winery made today wouldn’t produce a bottle of wine for three to five years. By then, Congress or a new president may have rescinded the tariffs, blowing up the investment.If it were just European liquor, a conservative might dismiss the disruption as something affecting well-heeled wine snobs. But the problem has wide applicability, Demmond said.“There are no American coffee growers. There are no coffee farms here,” she said. “That’s an impossibility. All you’re doing is increasing prices. You’re not helping create jobs by taxing that stuff. Some of it is impossible to re-shore.”Georgia calls itself the Peach state, but California has long eclipsed Georgia’s peach production. Instead, the most widely exported Georgia peach has been the one moviegoers see at the end of the credits: Georgia had $2.6bn in film and television production in 2023.Georgia’s tax incentive program is among the most aggressive in the US and the reason Georgia has become a rival to Hollywood. It’s an economic development strategy that has unusually bipartisan support in a state famously split down the middle politically. Studios have invested billions in Georgia over the last 10 years.Between Disney’s Marvel movies such as The Avengers, Tyler Perry’s studios in Atlanta and Netflix productions including Stranger Things, Georgia has overtaken Hollywood as a center for cinematic production. In any given year, studios spend $2-$4bn making movies in Georgia, according to figures from the Georgia Film Office.But the tax-incentive-chasing film industry is fickle. Acres of shiny new studio space springing up across the state have not prevented the movie business from slowing down a bit over the last couple of years. With the release of Thunderbolts*, for the first time in more than a decade no Marvel movies are slated for production in Georgia. Disney has shifted to studios in England and Australia.So when Trumpsaidhe wanted a 100% tariff on foreign-produced films, Georgia Entertainment CEO Randy Davidson did a double take.“It kind of took people by surprise,” Davidson said. “You know, on the one hand, you have people that have been struggling with their jobs here already, thinking initially that was going to be like a quick-fix answer to get production back here. … And then there was the other side: how is politicizing movies into the tariff discussion beneficial? Because it doesn’t make sense.”How is politicizing movies into the tariff discussion beneficial? Because it doesn’t make senseRandy Davidson, Georgia EntertainmentTrump’s tariff talk emerged after a meeting at the White House with actorJon Voightand independent film producer Steven Paul. Voight proposed to support the domestic film industry with federaltax creditsand international cooperative production agreements, not with a tariff, said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Sag-Aftra’s chief negotiator and national executive director.“You know, we haven’t had a federal tax incentive in the United States,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “It’s quite common in a lot of major production centers around the world now, and I think it’s definitely time for us to have that conversation.”Films are largely a digital service today. Setting aside the logistical difficulty of assessing a tariff on intellectual property, doing so would violateAmericanlaw.Crabtree-Ireland suggested that Trump’s rhetoric might be an aggressive negotiating ploy, starting out with an extreme stand that moves a compromise point to a more favorable position. But a workable plan would have more nuance, Crabtree-Ireland said: “Which is what I think ultimately would be under consideration.”Crabtree-Ireland said he wouldn’t expect a federal tax incentive to supplant state tax credits. But any international agreement to level the incentive playing field would have to address it.“What Georgia can hope for is that this topic does not get entangled in a charged-up political atmosphere where it will have a shot to be an actual bipartisan effort and initiative that would actually be good for the country,” Davidson said.As Georgia companies try to manage inventory before a tariff deadline, warehouse space is only one issue. Capital is another.“Most companies can’t afford to get two years’ worth of inventory to manage their business while we figure out what’s going to happen, right? So, they’re going to buy a little time, but not a lot,” said Carl Campbell, an executive director for business recruitment at the Dalton chamber of commerce.Not that there’s a warehouse to be rented in Dalton right now. The north Georgia mill town of about 34,000 in far-right representativeMarjorie Taylor Greene’s district is a longstanding center of the carpet-and-flooring industry in the US. But it has had competition for warehouse and industrial space in recent years from solar panel manufacturers, spurred by state tax incentives, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and federal incentives for the semiconductor industry.Tariffs are sometimes a tale of winners and losers ... It can create an opportunity, but it can also crush business plansCarl Campbell, Dalton chamber of commerce“Everything’s full, you know.” Campbell said. “We’ve got companies that are going to grow manufacturing capacity. They’re currently deciding where to do it, and so the tariffs may swing it to the US. Sometimes that’s swinging that our way. Sometimes it’s making that decision happen sooner rather than later, and sometimes it makes it not happen at all.”Campbell notes that both Democrats and Republicans can lay claim to Dalton’s industrial successes. Qcells, a solar panel manufacturer owned by the Korean conglomerate Hanwha, is an example, he said.“When Trump was in office the first time, he implemented tariffs on goods from China,” Campbell said. “They suddenly got very,veryserious about doing panel production and assembly in the US. And they had to do that quickly and as fast as possible.” The same tariff regime began imposing costs on imported flooring from Asia, which boosted Dalton’s flooring manufacturers.Why Trump does not suffer Congress when it comes to his prized tariffsRead moreThree years later, the Inflation Reduction Act – enacted under Joe Biden – addedincentivesfor clean energy manufacturing, and Georgia’s two Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, worked to make sure some of the benefit landed in Georgia. About$23bnhas been invested in clean energy production in the state since the act passed. Qcells used those incentives to expand in 2023, and employs more than 2,000 people today.“Tariffs are sometimes a tale of winners and losers. And so, yeah, we won a little bit on that,” Campbell said. “And of course, some of our companies got hurt, and they lost a little bit on that.”The problem, again, is uncertainty, he said.“It can create an opportunity for folks like me and companies like ours, yeah, but it can also crush business plans – if you’re reliant on foreign goods and suddenly you just took a 25% hit on your cost. It’s made some people sit on their hands and not move forward on some efforts that we were thinking would happen soon. It’s made some other folks, you know, escalate plans and have to do them faster.”Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaTrump tariffsSmall businessUS politicsTrump administrationTariffsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before this season, it had been 12 consecutive qualifications for the knockout rounds and 12 assorted sets of heartbreak, some scarcely believable. A first success in the competition consistently eluded them.This was the night when the French champions broke through, when they delivered on the obsession of their owners, of everybody connected to the club; 13th time lucky. All of the emotion came pouring out as Luis Enrique’s swashbuckling team tore into Inter, the result not in doubt from the moment that Désiré Doué made it 2-0 before the midway point of the first half. The 19-year-old was nervelessly brilliant.Game is up for Inter after Champions League journey ends in bitter humiliation | Jonathan LiewRead moreIt had been possible, in fact, to fear for Inter from the first whistle. PSG were in that kind of mood. They have been the dominant team in Europe since the turn of the year, sweeping all before them, and they were determined to drive it home. It would become impossibly grisly for Inter, Simone Inzaghi’s team powerless to resist the PSG waves, slumping to the widest margin of defeat that this competition has known in a final.After Doué had scored his second for 3-0, teed up by the irrepressible Vitinha, and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia made it four with another one-on-one breakaway, there was a moment when the substitute Bradley Barcola tied the veteran Inter defender Francesco Acerbi in such a knot before surging past him that it felt cruel. Barcola would blow the chance.PSG toyed with Inter. When a fan of the Serie A club was pictured on the big screen in floods of tears, it was the defining image from their point of view. It was not so long ago Inter were on for a treble. Top of their domestic league, they were into the Coppa Italia semi-finals against Milan. More broadly, they had designs on avenging their loss to Manchester City in the 2023Champions Leaguefinal, on winning Europe’s biggest tournament for the first time in 15 years. They have finished empty-handed; utterly broken.View image in fullscreenAchraf Hakimi watches his shot go in to open the scoring past Inter’s Yann Sommer in the Champions League final.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/ReutersPSG were not finished at 4-0. Doué had made way and it was another 19-year-old, Senny Mayulu, on as a substitute, who made the final incision, shooting home from a Barcola pass. For PSG, it added up to a treble; at long last, they have their grail. And there were few dry eyes when their fans unfurled a tifo shortly after the trophy lift. It was to honour the memory of Luis Enrique’s daughter Xana, who died of cancer in 2019 at the age of nine.The PSG fans spilled on to the pitch in their thousands after that but the thick police line held, although the situation felt good-natured, unlikely to spiral out of control. Those supporters simply pinched themselves because their team had been so good from the first whistle – the positional interchanges, the unusual overloads, the fizz of the passing. PSG brought a fierce press, too, and Inter struggled to get out. The goalkeeper, Yann Sommer, was repeatedly pressured when he had the ball at his feet.Vitinha was the architect of so much, including Achraf Hakimi’s breakthrough goal. Vitinha watched Kvaratskhelia and Fabián Ruiz make moves off the left, pulling at the seams of the Inter defence, and when he got the ball back, he fizzed it up to Doué on the left of the area. Hakimi was on the move from right-back, attacking the six-yard box. Doué took a touch as he spun and found him. It was all ping-perfect.View image in fullscreenPSG fans grab the goal nets as a souvenir after their victory over Inter in the Champions League final.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesPSG tightened their grip in the 20th minute and, at that point, Inter were gasping. Nicolò Barella thought he had won a corner but that was before Willian Pacho jumped into a challenge on him, hooking the ball away, and the end-to-end PSG counter was devastating. Kvaratskhelia and Ousmane Dembélé were prominent, the latter going right to Doué, whose shot deflected off Federico Dimarco to beat Sommer.Inter fought to clear their heads. Maybe a set piece could offer them a lifeline? Acerbi went close from one, Marcus Thuram thumped a header from another just wide having got above Kvaratskhelia. Barella also took a heavy touch in open play when well placed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dembélé dropped deep from his central attacking role. He went right. He went pretty much wherever. Doué’s licence to roam off the right was pronounced. Then again, it does help when you have Hakimi thundering beyond you.‘Always in my heart’: Luis Enrique pays tribute to late daughter after PSG triumphRead moreThe contrasts were everywhere. It was PSG’s youthful swagger v Inter’s experience. It was 4-3-3 without a pure centre-forward v 3-5-2 with twin No 9s. It was attack v defence. And it was big budgets v tight economics, cuteness in the market. In Simone Inzaghi’s four years at Inter, his most expensive signings have been Benjamin Pavard and Davide Frattesi, each for a little more than €30m. Only two of the PSG starting XI cost less than that.Inzaghi needed a punch to land after the restart but Inter laboured to get into the positions. Their only clear chance of the second half came for Thuram on 75 minutes, which Donnarumma saved and, by then, PSG had four.The alarm bells sounded for the third when Vitinha got on the ball and started to scuttle and probe, the ball under his spell, his markers close and yet far away. The give-and-go with Dembélé was lovely, his teammate finessing it with a back-heel and Vitinha was in business. The pass to Doué was measured to perfection. Game over, even if there was still time for Kvaratskhelia and Mayulu to salt Inter’s wounds.View image in fullscreenKhvicha Kvaratskhelia celebrates after scoring the fourth goal for PSG.Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainInternazionalematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Due to an unique registration period for the expanded Club World Cup, the window will open on Sunday 1 June until Tuesday 10 June before closing for a few days. It will then reopen on Monday 16 June until Monday 1 September. Here are a selection of players who could be on the move.Joan García (Espanyol)It’s been another spectacular season for García, who was part of Spain’s squad thatwon the gold medalat last summer’s Olympics. In March, he became the first player to win La Liga’s award for save of the month twice in a row and that has only added to his long list of admirers – especially given the 24-year-old has a €25m (£21m) release clause. Arsenal were thought to be leading the race even if García would be expected to be an understudy to David Raya, with Barcelona, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Inter among those hoping to persuade him otherwise.Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace)The England international has only 12 months left on the contract he signed when he joinedCrystal Palacefrom Chelsea in 2021 and is widely expected to leave Selhurst Park this summer. The big question is where he will end up after seeing four massive bids from Newcastle rejected last year and another worth up to £70m from Tottenham in January. Liverpool have also been strongly linked amid uncertainty over Ibrahima Konaté’s future, while Chelsea are thought to be considering an attempt to bring Guéhi back to Stamford Bridge. There were reports that the 24-year-old is considering running down his contract at Selhurst Park after leading them to the FA Cup but can Palace afford to turn down big money again?View image in fullscreenCrystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi is thought to be coveted by his former club Chelsea.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianJobe Bellingham (Sunderland)With playoff hero Tommy Watson’s departure to Brighton already signed and sealed, the Black Cats could be facing the prospect of losing one of their other talented teenagers in the coming weeks. Bellingham was in Germany this week to hold talks withEintracht Frankfurt– who have qualified for next season’s Champions League – and is also being courted by his older brother Jude’s former employers, Borussia Dortmund, as well as RB Leipzig. Sunderland are understood to be determined to keep Bellingham and are likely to demand more than €30m (£25m), with his former club Birmingham also due a sell-on fee.Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal target Liverpool duo Luis Díaz and Darwin NúñezRead moreHugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)A hat-trick for France’s Under 21s against England in March and the goal he scored against Tottenham in the Europa League underlined the former Paris St-Germain striker’s potential. Ekitike stepped up for Eintracht Frankfurt when Omar Marmoush joined Manchester City in January, ending the season with 22 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions. But a reported asking price north of £80m for the 22-year-old who started his career at Reims might prove too high for most potential suitors, who are thought to include Chelsea, Liverpool andManchester United.Jonathan David (Lille)His future has been a regular source of speculation over the past few windows and the Canada striker has already confirmed he will finally leaveLillethis summer when his contract expires. Newly crowned Italian champions Napoli appear to be in pole position to sign David having held several rounds of talks with his representatives, although Aston Villa, Tottenham, West Ham and Juventus are also thought to have shown interest. The 25-year-old has previously made no secret of his desire to play in the Premier League.View image in fullscreenLille’s Jonathan David’s contract expires and Napoli appear to be in pole position to become his new club.Photograph: Stéphanie Lecocq/ReutersAlejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)It’s unlikely that the latest academy graduate who could be shown the door at Old Trafford will be short of offers. After being left out of Manchester United’s matchday squad against Aston Villa on the final day by Ruben Amorim, Garnacho’s potential availability has alerted several clubs looking for a potential bargain. The Argentina forward is expected to cost around £40m if United allow him to leave, with Napoli – who tried to sign him in January – thought to be the early frontrunners. Chelsea have also been monitoring his situation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mbeumo still has a year of his contract remaining plus an option to extend it by 12 months, even if manager Thomas Frank admitted after their win over Leicester that “we are a selling club so if someone comes in with the right price …”. That is probably in the region of £60m, with Manchester United and Newcastle thought to be his most likely destination. Yoane Wissa – who just missed out on matching Mbeumo as they would have become the first duo to score 20 goals for the same club in a single season since Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané in 2018-19 – is also expected to attract interest.View image in fullscreenBrentford’s Bryan Mbeumo can leave Brentford this summer for a fee in the region of £60m.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPABenjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)“I want to play for a club that suits me and brings out the best in me,” said the Slovenia striker this week. Whether that is finally Arsenal three years after Sesko first appeared on Mikel Arteta’s radar when he was starring for Red Bull Salzburg as a teenager will be answered soon enough. The 21-year-old only managed 13 goals – one down on last year – asRB Leipzigstruggled in the Bundesliga but fits the profile required at the Emirates given Arsenal’s need for more firepower. Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres is also on Arteta’s shortlist, while Chelsea have previously shown an interest in Sesko and could try to get involved if they miss out on other targets.Rayan Cherki (Lyon)Once seen as the bad boy of French football, some impressively mature performances forLyonthis season earned him a first senior call-up from Didier Deschamps and have also caught the attention of a certain Pep Guardiola. Manchester City are thought to have registered their interest in the 22-year-old as a potential replacement for Kevin De Bruyne, with Cherki available for just €30m (£22m). Morgan Gibbs-White of Nottingham Forest would be a much more expensive alternative and with Cherki understood to prefer to join a team playing in the Champions League, that could rule out a move to the red half of Manchester.Nico Williams (Athletic Bilbao)At one time he was in the shadow of his elder brother, Iñaki Williams, but it is the 22-year-old winger who is now the wanted man, Williams Sr having stayed in the Basque Country past his 30th birthday. While the elder brother now players for Ghana after gaining a single Spain cap almost a decade ago, Nico is familiar to English audiences as scorer of the first goal in the Euro 2024 final, in which he was named man of the match. That success came three months after he helpedAthletic Bilbaowin their first Copa del Rey. As the summer window approaches he has been linked with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Arsenal and Chelsea, among others, and has two more seasons on his contract with a release clause of €58m (£49m).Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowEspanyolCrystal PalaceSunderlandEintracht FrankfurtLilleManchester UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, barbarians have taken to the streets of Paris to commit crimes and provoke law enforcement.“I have asked the internal security forces to react vigorously to these abuses. I offer my support to the police prefect and all the police officers who are ensuring everyone’s safety this evening.“It is unbearable that it is not possible to party without fearing the savagery of a minority of thugs who respect nothing.”About 5,400 police were deployed across the city for the post-match celebrations, with officers on the Champs-Élysées using teargas and pepper spray to maintain order.A police spokesperson said a car was set alight near the Parc des Princes and several dozen arrests had been made by the time the match ended, Reuters reported.Traffic around the Arc de Triomphe was blocked from midday with the Champs-Élysées boulevard and nearby streets also closed on Saturday evening.Earlier, in Munich, PSG and Inter Milan supporters threw stones at each other at Fröttmaning station while travelling to the Allianz arena for the final, Bild reported.They also caused travel disruption by making their way on to train tracks, according to reports.PSG’s win over Arsenal in the semi-final on 7 May sparked unrest inParis, with 47 people arrested and three others injured after being hit by a car.Explore more on these topicsParisParis Saint-GermainFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The supremely talented Hannah Hampton had slowly moved into pole position for the starting spot in Switzerland, with Sarina Wiegman having said the Chelsea keeper was a little ahead of Earps, the Euro 2022 and 2023 World Cup No 1. Hampton has performed well when given the chance to start, but how she will cope with the pressure of being first choice long-term? Portugal were perfect opponents to ease her way in, England’s utter domination in the 6-0 win leaving her very little to do. Spain will offer a far greater test on Tuesday but Hampton, whose distribution is superior, was preferred to Earpsagainst the world champions in February.Returning heroes show their worthThe sight of Lauren Hemp in the starting XI against Portugal was welcome. As was that of Alex Greenwood and Georgia Stanway, who were on the bench, coming on. All three have been battling to be fit for the Euros and they showed what England have been missing this year. Hemp was electric on the left and her teammate Grace Clinton said: “Out of possession, in possession, she’s an unbelievable player. She’s got one-v-one, she’s got dribbling, she’s got pace with her runs in behind, she’s got everything.” Wiegman said: “It’s really nice to see them back. They have worked so hard to get to where they are … if you haven’t put all the work into getting to this point then you cannot put in the performance they showed tonight.”Wiegman shows her ruthless streakWiegman is a winner and she wanted a big victory against Portugal, a team England have struggled against havingdrawn 1-1 in the reverse fixturein February and been held toa 0-0 draw in a friendlyon the eve of the 2023 World Cup. Aggie Beever-Jones said: “As cliched as it sounds, Sarina said: ‘It’s a new kit, new England today. Go out there and put a graft in.’ I think her words were ‘destroy them’, in her Dutch accent.” That edge and hunger to win aren’t always positive, Wiegman’s reaction to Earps’s retirement reportedly having been a very angry one, but when it comes to putting together winning formulas on the pitch there are few better managers.Steps forward up frontEngland have had limited attacking options since Euro 2022, withBeth Mead injuring an anterior cruciate ligamentand Lauren James more recently having hamstring problems, while Chloe Kellywas frozen out at Manchester Cityin the first half of this season. However, things seem to be coming together at the right time: Mead is looking closer to her best, she and Kelly – after a loan move – areChampions League winnerswith Arsenal and Hemp is well and truly back. Throw in the youngsters Beever-Jones, who scored a hat-trick against Portugal, andMichelle Agyemang, who scored 41 seconds into her debutagainst Belgium last month, and the forward choices look strong. “We have so many options,” said Wiegman. “What we also hope for is LJ [Lauren James] coming back too. She’s still in rehab and doing good.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ten million pounds. What does that work out to in booing, and boo-deletion? What’s the exchange rate here? How much un-booing does £10m get you, in a highly emotive run‑your‑contract-down local‑lad‑departure scenario?This and many more equally strange questions will presumably have to be debated now Real Madrid have agreed a small but significantearly release payment for Trent Alexander-Arnold, which will in turn allow his participation at the most heinous footballing entity yet devised, the new Fifa Club World Cup.Champions League final the calm before storm as Uefa and Fifa battle rolls on | Nick AmesRead moreThe whole thing seems less important now. The Trent-Exit saga was something to talk about because the league was done. Time moves on, often in deeply strange ways. For what it’s worth, I for one had no issue at all with someLiverpoolfans barracking when they realised their favourite player was going to leave for free at the end of his contract. That is, I could see it was illogical and irrational. The answer to which is, duh. Meet: football.This is how the game survives, why absurd amounts of money swill across its decks every day, why the good stuff about connection and collectivism and moments of beauty can also happen. If we all just sat around taking the rational view and refusing to Become Emotional the whole thing would last about three minutes before everyone cleared their throats, looked at their watches and walked off to do some more sensible activity, like picking up litter or preserving hedgehogs.For now Madrid in the mini-window feels like a good thing for everyone. Good for Trent, who is 26, who had those luminous, oddly distant years under Jürgen Klopp, the most creatively brilliant piece of elite tactical freedom in recent times, the invention of a highly new effective role, the flank-libero, the walk‑cross man, the assist-mooch king.Liverpool aren’t really a Trent team in the more orderly champion era. WhereasReal Madridremain an oddly formless entity, a divvying up of roles, super‑strengths, star-freedoms. Madrid want him to play full-back but also to act as a rewilding element, a recreation of the Kroos-era passing range, which already sounds like a recipe for a dreamy kind of chaos.View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander-Arnold was booed by some Liverpool fans after he announced he was leaving the club this summer.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PASo it’s good for the neutral too, good for the basic sounds and colours, the mouthwatering story arc of Trent inside that deeply vicious media‑superstar complex. This is a footballer who will always be an object of confusion, whose passing is brilliant, sui generis and thrillingly odd in its angles, but who continues to wander about the pitch like a man trying very hard not to spill his Pot Noodle.Mainly, though, this is all very good for theClub World Cup, which is of course the real story here. And at bottom this is a Fifa story, the first significant act of the CWC 2.0, a first hum of the destructor ray for this strange new source of gravity.Most immediately, it brings us one step closer to the prospect next month of a mouthwateringly inane Madrid-al-Hilal Trent-Ronaldo celebrity face-off, the descent on the Hard Rock Stadium of a vast ant colony of weeping superfans, lookalikes, holy relic seekers and confused adolescents who really do appear to spend their days poring over the weirdly robotic CR7 Instagram feed as though communing with some plasticised ideal of show, gloss, nature-less acquisitiveness. So, there’s that.Otherwise, being good for the CWC is an issue for anyone who loves the game in its existing form. Because this competition is not just a sporting abomination, a skewer of leagues, a force for stratification with its vast and destabilising income stream for the top clubs, but a kind of top-down heist.Above all, the first significant piece of mini-window business is a wonderful moment for Gianni Infantino, because this really is Infantino’s baby, gestated, midwifed into being and now clasped, damp and slithering, to the Fifa president’s chest through the Trump-centred brand building of the last few months.There is no secret about any of this. The Club World Cup does not need to exist. It is in effect a one-man reordering of the global calendar, a product of Fifa’s unique style of government whereby a single random Swiss man is given an autocratic degree of power over the global game.Infantino even looks at times as if he can’t quite believe how this thing has happened to him, staring out at the world with those flat, startled eyes, as though there is actually another man inside this man, encased in some compacted substance, a blend of processed ham, varnish and mendacity, mummified into a man-shape, squeezed into a blue suit and given the keys to the world.And now we have this, a competition that exists solely because Infantino wants access to the funds currently being harvested by club football. It fails on a basic level of sporting robustness. This is an invite-only star fest, a financial grenade chucked into every league in the world, and something Fifa has no real mandate for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The obvious reason is that interestingly sourced $1bn prize fund, the first chunk of which is now on its way to Liverpool. But it isn’t just greed. There is a more subtle energy in play here, a coincidence of Infantino’s ambition and the dynamic of football’s new breed of owners.View image in fullscreenGianni Infantino has done a lot of Trump-centred brand building in the last few months.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesTodd Boehly gave a significant speech at the recent Financial Times Football Leaders conference. Despite giving the appearance of having been sedated shortly before taking the stage, Boehly kept turning to two key themes. First, the urge to create out of football’s global cut-through some kind of future streaming platform, a tech behemoth, which is where the real Zuckerberg money is, not mucking about with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s sell-on value.And second, his bafflement with football’s existing culture, its fan-based conservatism. Football wants to grow, to dig its teeth into the wider global market. This is the real key to the Club World Cup, and it speaks again to Trent, to extreme, irrational loyalty, to geographical ties, to all those elements that lasso this thing into its existing shape.The Club World Cup is the first competition where it makes little difference if you boycott it or simply don’t watch. It’s not about getting you to like it. It’s about power and ownership, driven by broadcasting money that exists outside normal market rules, that is basically a bribe to the clubs.It is instead about the dissolution of those old bonds, of the ties to physical place, about players as mobile marketing tools, teams not as mobile brands. It wants you to like it enough to subscribe and click, but not to feel any sense of obstructive ownership.This is also why the booing matters. Booing at least makes sense, speaks to those old sustaining structures, the link to place, colours, family, something that is the opposite of pop-up moves and individualism as a Fifa sales technique.It will be impossible to ignore this thing, to no-platform it, because it’s already here, already eating away at the ground beneath football’s feet. And who knows, in time Trent to Real Madrid in the mini-window might come to look like a first step, an Archduke Franz Ferdinand moment, the day the world shifted just a little on its axis.Explore more on these topicsTrent Alexander-ArnoldReal MadridLiverpoolClub World CupcommentShareReuse this content"

Six years ago Xana died of osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. She was nine. And at the moment when he scaled the peak of his coaching career, Luis Enrique paid tribute to the child who he said was “always in my heart”.At full-time the Paris fans unveiled a tifo depicting Luis and Xana, recreating the moment when he planted a flag in the pitch alongside her after winning theChampions Leaguewith Barcelona in 2015. “It was very emotional with the banner from the fans for my family,” Luis Enrique said. “But I always think about my daughter.”Désiré Doué joins the global A-list to lead PSG’s coronation as kings of Europe | Barney RonayRead moreAs for his history-making side,Luis Enriquecould reflect on a mission spectacularly accomplished, after a 5-0 win over Inter that PSG dominated from start to finish. “Since day one, I said I wanted to win important trophies,” he said. “Paris had never won the Champions League. We did it for the first time. It’s a great feeling to make many people happy.”PSG scored two goals inside 20 minutes and completed the rout in the second half, with the winger Désiré Doué scoring the first and third. “We had a great start to the game, dominating from the beginning,” said Luis Enrique. “But I wanted them to keep pushing, scoring, to ensure we won the game.”Doué, 19, was still processing a game that haselevated him into the very eliteof world football. “I can’t believe what happened tonight,” he said. “We made history for the club, in French football, in European football. We’re a great team, and we showed it.”Inter’s manager, Simone Inzaghi, tried to put a brave face onhis side’s humiliation. “This hurts,” he said. “Of course the game wasn’t good enough on our part.” But he also insisted: “We can come out stronger from this defeat, like we didin 2023[after losing the final to Manchester City] and then won the league the following season.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainLuis EnriqueInternazionalenewsShareReuse this content"

Sophie Downey’s stopwatch, started the moment the clock hit 90 minutes, is running on the desk next to me, but my fingers won’t move. I refuse to write a variation of“Arsenal are European champions”with time still on the clock because the thought of having to press that backspace key and delete it is too much. The editors will have to wait; I’ll start writing the intro paragraph when there’s one minute 30 seconds of the seven minutes of stoppage time to go, but gingerly, agonisingly – even that feels too soon.From Linköping to Lisbon: retracing Blackstenius’ steps to Arsenal hero statusRead moreI believe, I really do, but what if? And then I’m too busy sobbing into my hands to finish or press send. The narratives, there are so many narratives:Renée Slegers, the former academy player head coach with the retro Arsenal ring on her little finger who was made permanent manager only four months ago; Leah Williamson’s journey from being a mascot at a European Cup final to playing in one; Chloe Kelly’s salvaged season; Beth Mead’s emotional turmoil; Mariona Caldentey making it three in a row after winning the past two with the now vanquished Barcelona; Kim Alison Little. Where to start? Where to end?My first report, sent not quite on the whistle, is rushed but I don’t really care. What does this mean? Everything.Williamsonhas said she now felt ashamed for having previously put “trophy for England over trophy for Arsenal”, because the feeling last Saturday was “the happiest I’ve ever been in my whole entire life”. The lifelong supporter of the club said she hoped “that other Arsenal fans are happy too”. Understatement of the century, Leah, understatement of the century.The England captain had said she had been reflecting on her journey and reconnecting with those who helped her get to where she is today after the trophy lift outside the Emirates Stadium on Monday morning, and that chimed. Her journey from fan and academy player to Champions League winner is something few can relate to, but her undying love for Arsenal is more understood and she is not the only one who will have been reflecting on their relationship with the north London club this weekend. Remembering adds to the emotion of the occasion and triggers it.View image in fullscreen‘I stayed the night at the home of a family member who lived a stone’s throw from Islington town hall so I could get as close to the Invincibles trophy parade as possible.’Photograph: PAMy own journey started when a smile was actually wind, my arms and legs manoeuvred into a little flannel babygrow that had the badge on the front and “Arsenal babe” across the back. The earliest memories I have come in flashes across a weekend in Lisbon; then kicking a green translucent plastic ball with white flecks against the wall while I watched Arsenal Ladies play opposite my council estate in Shoreditch Park; finding out the score of the 1998 men’s FA Cup final viaa smuggled radio on a school trip; buzzing as I headed to a two-week Arsenal Foundation course on designing a magazine on QuarkXPress in the school holidays; winning a McDonald’s competition to kick penalties on the pitch at Highbury on the final day of a season; staying the night at the home of a family member who lived a stone’s throw from Islington town hall so I could get as close to the Invincibles trophy parade as possible; going to football sessions at school only to find them being led by Faye White and Rachel Yankey; the “Arsenal win the World Cup” Mirror front page Blu-Tacked to my wall after France’s 1998 men’s team’s triumph. Could I fill this piece with the memories? Yes, probably five times over.View image in fullscreenThe young Gunner at Highbury.Photograph: Courtesy of Suzanne WrackPlenty of journalists choose to keep their personal allegiances private and having decided not to do that I can very much understand why (thanks, social media), but why should I hide or reject my fandom when my love of Arsenal is why I stumbled into this industry, having not ever considered it as something I could do, in the same way aspiring to be a professional footballer was a pipe dream for so many girls my age?Women’s Champions League triumph will redefine how Arsenal see themselves | Jonathan LiewRead moreMy fandom and my journalism are very separate things to me; if anything, I’m most critical of the club I adore because I want to see it do things right. As a journalist, you build bonds and relationships with players and staff across clubs and national teams. I struggle to think of a time I’ve interviewed a player and not come away wanting everything good to happen to them, for them to have their drive, work and passion rewarded. There isn’t a Women’s Super League team I dislike, not even Tottenham, because, while I’ll never fully understand what it takes to be a professional footballer, I’ve been given an insight into that world; the highs, the lows, the injuries, the emotional and mental tolls, the hidden battles, the fight for professional standards and respect and more. But there will always be one team I love, love with a passion fuelled by those memories that flitter in and out.That is why there has been a lot of personal emotion this week. Hell, I’m crying periodically while I write. Arsenal gave me a way to experience collective joy and pain, to share a deep emotional bond with my dad, to feel connected to my community and a career. The feeling of watching a women’s team that played for a short while in the park opposite Clinger Court on Hobbs Place Estate go on to lift the Champions League, in the modern era, in a packed Estádio José Alvalade, and be celebrated by more than 10,000 fans within 48 hours, after pioneering the game for so long, is indescribable – though I’ve tried. So, forgive the slipping of the journalistic cap in the aftermath, the blurring of the lines as the fan in me seeps out a bit, because if I didn’t feel all this, I wouldn’t be doing this job.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Melbourne City are champions of the A-League Men after defeatingMelbourne Victory1-0 at AAMI Park on Saturday.As the final whistle rang out, Joe Marston Medalist Mat Leckie moved to embrace young teammate Alessandro Lopane. On the sideline, coach Aurelio Vidmar – who had never previously beaten Victory as City coach and lost to Victory in the 2009 decider as coach of Adelaide – was embraced in a bearhug by City director of football Michael Petrillo and assistants Paul Pezos and Scott Jamison.Melbourne City defeat Melbourne Victory in A-League Men grand finalRead moreNormal service has resumed in the A-League Men.Melbourne Citystand atop the mountaintop, their fifth trophy in five years secured. In the end, they didn’t do it in the type of grand final that will go down in the annals for the quality of its play – these high-stakes games rarely do, after all. But it was a game played with tension, with fire and, at times, with controversy.The prospect of City and Victory clashing produced one of the most anticipated deciders in recent memory and a sense of electricity permeated the air well before kickoff, with the Victory fans that made up a large proportion of the 29,902 fans in attendance drowning out City’s ‘Happy Together’ anthem.View image in fullscreenCity's Yonatan Cohen celebrates in front of Victory fans after scoring in the tenth minute.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesBut a dampener was placed on their buzz just ten minutes in when Aziz Behich marauded down the left and backheeled the ball to Andreas Kuen, who squared the ball for Max Caputo. The teenager’s resulting effort careened off the crossbar, but this reprieve was short-lived, as the ball sat up for Yonatan Cohen to drive between the legs of Kasey Bos and give his side the lead.Victory had started the contest breathing fire but now found themselves down the first time their foes had got the ball into their penalty area. Making matters worse was that this wasn’t just any opponent but the most miserly defence in theA-League Menand, under Vidmar, the most well-organised of any City side in recent years. Illustrative of this, Santos would muscle his way past the City skipper nine minutes later and cut the ball back for Zinédine Machach, only for the Frenchman’s effort to be blocked by a desperate diving lunge from Leckie.View image in fullscreenCity hero Mathew Leckie played the second half of the final bandaged up for a gash to the nose.Photograph: James Ross/AAPOutside of questions surrounding his fitness, few would have been surprised coming into the game that the Socceroo would be best afield. One of the most accomplished attackers in Australia, the 34-year-old was deployed in an unexpected holding midfield role in the grand final and responded by helping to shut down much of the flow or rhythm to Victory’s play. Collected by an inadvertent boot from Zinedine Machach minutes into the second half, he would spend the second stanza with blood seeping from a bandage hastily wrapped around his face, providing the grand final with yet another bloodied, bruised and triumphant hero.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Socceroo had more touches than anyone in the game, many of them of the fancy variety we’ve come to expect, but his growing sense of desperation couldn’t produce a leveller. His side thought they should have had a penalty in the 80th minute when Germán Ferreyra – taking a break from being a wrecking ball – had a clearing header from Kai Trewin clatter off his arm, only for VAR to clear the incident.At the same time, however, Victory was kept alive by City’s repeated failed efforts to land a killer blow. Just seconds into the second stanza, Jack Duncan flew to his right to deny Cohen’s bending attempt for a second. In the 64th minute, Caputo opted to turn and shoot wide rather than square the ball to a wide-open Steven Ugarkovic. In the 76th, Marco Tilio dropped a cross onto the head of an open Cohen at the back post, only for the winger to send his header across the face of the goal.In the end, though, it didn’t matter.

After reaching the Italian Open final in Rome, losing to the reigning French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz, Sinner has continued to build on his form in Paris.Jack Draper beats João Fonseca in straight sets to reach French Open fourth roundRead moreSinner, the top seed, was in imperious form from the first ball as he rolled to a 6-0, 5-0 lead against Lehecka, a talented 23-year-old and a vicious shotmaker, before losing his first game of the match. Despite bulldozing a quality opponent, Sinner refused to entertain any complacency.“This morning I felt that I was feeling the ball very good but, again, the conditions can change from one moment to the other,” he said. “There was rain a little bit at some point, and then after it was nearly sunny. This changed how the ball bounces and how fast it goes through the air. Things can change so quickly from one day to the other. We saw this in Rome [after defeating Casper Ruud]. Nobody believed me, but in half an hour I lost the first set 6-1 [to Tommy Paul in the following match]. So I have to be very careful.”Sinner was followed into the fourth round by Alexander Zverev, the third seed, who defeated Flavio Cobolli 6-2, 7-6 (4), 6-1. Arthur Fils, the 14th seed and France’s best hope of winning a grand slam title in the near future, was forced to withdraw before his third-round match against Andrey Rublev after his incredible five-set comeback victory over Jaume Munar. On Saturday morning, the 20-year-old announced that he had been competing with a stress fracture in his back.“I had some issues with the back since a long time, and during the match against Munar it got worse,” he said. “Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all: got a stress fracture. We decided with the team it was better to stop now, because if I stop now I could stop for only four to six weeks. If I push myself too much I would probably stop for a couple of months.”Mirra Andreeva maintained her status as one of the top contenders in Paris as she returned to the fourth round of theFrench Openwith a comfortable 6-3, 6-1 win over Yulia Putintseva, the 32nd seed. Despite starting slowly in her first two rounds, Andreeva, who reached her first grand slam semi-final here last year, is yet to drop a set.View image in fullscreenMirra Andreeva has yet to drop a set in this year’s tournament.Photograph: Matthieu Mirville/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockAndreeva will next face her friend Daria Kasatkina after the Australian overcame Paula Badosa, the 10th seed, 6-1, 7-5.

In 2018 Simon Yates was leading the Giro d’Italia by 3min 22sec but became the victim ofChris Froome’s imperious rideon the same slopes. That day, Yates collapsed and ultimately finished 38 minutes behind Froome but on Saturday, seven years later, the rider from Bury would have his redemption by pulling the same trick on Isaac del Toro and Yates will now – barring accidents – win his second Grand Tour on Sunday.This was billed as Del Toro v Richard Carapaz and even pre-stage Yates was playing down his chances, he said those two riders were a “step above”. This was clearly a bluff. Over the last 38.5km of almost entirely uphill racing, Yates overturned his 1min 21sec pre-stage deficit and created an insurmountable time gap of 3min 56sec to Del Toro.What happened in 2018 has clearly stayed with Yates ever since and from the moment the Giro released its route for this year he has been targeting some kind of redemption.Giro d’Italia: battle for overall title in mountains on stage 20 – liveRead more“Once the parcours was released I always had it in the back of my mind that maybe I could come here and close the chapter. Maybe not to take the pink jersey and the race but at least win the stage win or something,” the 32-year-old told TNT Sports after the stage, almost through tears. “To try and show myself, the way I know I can do and to pull it off – I really didn’t believe it. I have to thank the guys, the team. They believed in me and even during the stage they were saying ‘just give it a try’ and I did it in the end.“I’m not really an emotional person but even coming over the finish line I couldn’t hold back the tears. It’s something I’ve worked towards throughout my career, year after year and I’ve had a lot of setbacks. I’ve finally managed to pull it off.”The stage itself was won by Chris Harper of Team Jayco-AlUla, who pulled clear on the Finestre and let all the drama unfold behind him. And it was some drama.What should not be overlooked in this whole piece is the role of Wout van Aert, Yates’s Visma–Lease a Bike teammate, who snuck into a huge breakaway by the virtue of being part of the final 19-man group that chased down the first 12 riders who sped off from Verrès. Yates had a GC lead of 1min 40secs on the road when he found Van Aert on the descent down the Finestre and by the time the Belgian turned off the gas the gap back to Del Toro was almost four minutes.View image in fullscreenA glum Isaac del Toro crosses the line.Photograph: Luca Zennaro/EPAVisma–Lease a Bike have followed a similar tactic of sending a man up the road on almost every stage, but few are as good at this job as Van Aert, who Yates described as crucial in the victory.However, the Briton had done a lot of the hard work himself. Yates was not even part of the original attack on Del Toro at the bottom of the category one climb up the Finestre. EF Education-EasyPost had set up the slingshot for Carapaz to fire off from a crumbling peloton as the gradient reached 14%. Yates responded to successfully bridge the 20-second gap to Carapaz and Del Toro, who looked comfortable on the back of the Ecuadorian’s wheel, to form the group of protagonists who would decide the GC battle.Yates and Carapaz took it in turns to attack Del Toro, but the Mexican seemed less bothered when the Briton would get out of the saddle. Even when Yates made a move that stuck Del Toro seemed more interested in Carapaz than chasing down the man who would go on to steal away the Giro.As Yates increased the time gap on the gravel track up the mountain, Del Toro just followed Carapaz and by the time the man riding in pink realised he might have a problem it was far too late.Questions will have to be answered by UAE Team Emirates XRG as to how they let their rider, who always looked as if he had more in the tank, simply watch Yates ride off with the pink jersey. Apparently Yates was the only man who did not think he could pull off the remarkable turnaround, even as the UAE riders on the road fumed into their radios when it became clear the race was over on the final climb up to Sestriere.“Two hundred metres to go,” said Yates when asked when he believed he could win the Giro. “I was on the radio blabbing, asking for the time gap because I never truly believed until the very last moment.”This is a redemption story for the ages and earns Yates a second Grand Tour win(after his Vuelta a España triumph in 2018)that must elevate him into the upper echelons of British cycling greats. After the processional stage into Rome he will officially become the third Briton to win the Giro in the last decade, after Froome and, two years later, Tao Geoghegan Hart. Few have claimed one of cycling’s big three races in such a remarkable manner and having been the victim of one of those dramas, it is fitting that Yates can now move on from 2018 so definitively.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaSimon YatesCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Indeed, such has been the dominance and the nonchalance with which he claimed this pole and his wins this season, it was put to him that he was taking on Kimi Räikkönen’s mantle as the Ice Man, albeit in the somewhat less flattering form for the 24-year-old of Ice Boy.Piastri’s pole was imperious at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, beating his teammate Lando Norris into second by a huge two-tenths of a second, the biggest margin of the season, with Red Bull’sMax Verstappenin third, three-tenths down.George Russell was fourth for Mercedes andLewis Hamilton, who has struggled in Spain this weekend, found his pace when it mattered, taking fifth place for Ferrari and hoping to challenge for a podium place.Piastri took the top spot with the same almost preternatural calm that has defined his four wins and three previous poles this season, the Australian repeatedly demonstrating immense calm and control under pressure. He was pushed into a shootout by Norris over their final laps and there was nothing between them, but, whereas the British driver went to the limit and in so doing made two minor errors, Piastri was on rails and his car flowed with insouciant ease around the sweeping high-speed turns.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri’s McLaren was two-tenths of a second faster than his teammate Lando Norris.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesAt its close he was asked if he felt it was fair his nonchalant cool in almost any circumstances justified the new nickname. “I’m not sure I want to go under the name Ice Boy,” he said, with a laugh that was joined heartily by Norris and Verstappen. “Certainly there’s been qualifiers and races where it’s not been nonchalant and there’s been a lot of emotion behind them.“I’m just not a particularly emotional person. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still moments that I am emotional but you know I also know that it’s a nice thing to have, starting on pole. But it’s not the end of the weekend, the points are tomorrow.”It was a fair evaluation, given every point might prove vital as he leads the world championship by only three from Norris. The latter was clearly disappointed and he held his hands up for his errors but the gap was an ominous chasm between teammates in identical machinery.That machinery has very much been under the spotlight all weekend. Yet for all that the question of whether the FIA’s clampdown with a new technical directive on the flexing of front wings had dominated the buildup to this meeting and the potential for the pecking order to be reset, it was very much business as usual in Barcelona. It is a circuit that perhaps better than any other demonstrates which team has the best aerodynamic package.McLaren have always insisted they were gaining no advantage and the running in Spain suggests they were spot-on. “It clearly slowedMcLarendown a lot,” was the caustically sarcastic assessment of Mercedes’s George Russell after practice.It was the almost resigned evaluation of a driver who knows that short of some form of miraculous development, itself a vanishingly slight chance given all the resources are already pointed at the 2026 cars and the new regulations, McLaren will not be stopped.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton will start from fifth on the grid.Photograph: Mark Sutton/Formula 1/Getty ImagesPerhaps the only question that remains will be if the change affects the McLaren’s ability to be so easy on its tyres, which will be evident in the race, but nothing indicates there will be any material effect on this either, as the team principal, Andrea Stella, indicated.“The technical directive [TD] was a big talking point, [but] quite immaterial, I would say,” he said. “Formula One is numbers, is technical. When you look at the numbers associated with the TD it was always going to be minor. It entertained to have this kind of debate but in our numbers, in our simulation, everything was very small, we weren’t concerned.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If, as it appears, the championship is between the pair, then Norris must find a way to match his teammate’s icy precision.Several hours after qualifying concluded, the Aston Martin team issued a statement announcing that Lance Stroll, who qualified in 14th, would not take part in the race.

Koepka matched a US Open record.Saigo was asked whether 16 under might be within reach.“It is very difficult to compare,” she said through an intepretor. “All I can say is that I will do my best, and as a result, I would like to make a good result.”Saigo won Chevron Championship in a playoff outside Houston just over a month ago for her first LPGA Tour title.Korda, who has never finished higher than a tie for eighth in the US Women’s Open, had a 67. That’s the best round she’s had in the event.“I feel like I’ve had a very complicated relationship with US Opens,” Korda said, “but I’m happy to be in the position I am heading into the weekend.”She was 5 under with Hinako Shibuno (69), Sarah Schmelzel (68), Maja Stark (69), Yealimi Noh (71) and 2020 U.S. Women’s Open champion A Lim Kim (71).

Her third shot hit the flagstick, bounced backward and rolled all the way to a bunker.But she recovered by getting four birdies in a five-hole stretch from Nos 16-2.“I thought that was not my mistake,” Saigo said. “I just thought to myself that it was just unlucky, and then I just changed my mind.”Play was suspended due to darkness Friday night with 12 players unable to finish.Explore more on these topicsGolfUS sportsShareReuse this content"

I presented a morning show on Radio Kraków twice a week for about two years. It was only one part of my work, but I really enjoyed it. It was about culture and cinema, and featured a range of people, from artists to activists. I remember interviewing Ukrainians about the Russian invasion for the first programme I presented, back in 2022.I was let go in August 2024, alongside a dozen co-workers who were also part-time. We were told the radio station was having financial problems. I was relatively OK with it, as I had other income streams. But a few months later I heard that Radio Kraków was launching programmes hosted by three AI characters.Each had AI-generated photographs, a biography and a specific personality. They called it an “experiment” aimed at younger audiences.One of the first shows they did was a live “interview” with Polish poet Wisława Szymborska, winner of the 1996 Nobel prize for literature, who had died 12 years earlier. What are the ethics of using the likeness of a dead person? Szymborska is a symbol of Polish intellectual culture, so it caused outrage. I couldn’t understand it: radio is created by people for other people. We cannot replace our experiences, emotions or voices with avatars.One of my colleagues who was laid off is queer. One of the new AI avatars was called Alex, a non-binary student and a “specialist” in queer subjects. In Poland, we are still fighting for queer rights, and as journalists it’s incumbent on us to have real representation when reporting on this. For my colleague and the LGBTQ+ community, it was shocking and damaging to hear their lived experience and knowledge being imitated by AI.Some of us who had been laid off started a petition against the station, calling for regulation and to get the AI shows taken off air. We got tens of thousands of people to sign – actors, journalists, artists, but also listeners. Hundreds of young people didn’t want to listen to an AI show.The station has since scrapped the avatars, largely because of the success of our campaign. It’s now student-run. The station claim this is about offering mentorship, but it’s also a cheaper alternative to hiring qualified journalists. I guess it’s better than AI, though.There are still no clear regulations covering its use in Poland. I’m not campaigning for regulation because I lost my job to AI: I’m campaigning because I’m worried about the ethics of all of this; about misinformation and deceiving listeners.I’m a realist – I’m not completely against AI. I think it can be used responsibly to do the boring bits of our job. But we can’t substitute complex thinking with machines. AI can’t replace our curiosity, creativity or emotional intelligence.‘Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced’Lina Meilina, 30, illustrator, Bandung, IndonesiaView image in fullscreenLina Meilina: ‘Since AI took off, my workload has plummeted.’Photograph: Muhammad Fadli/The GuardianI’ve been drawing and painting since I was a kid. Even in kindergarten, I was doodling. By elementary school I was drawing comics and my teachers knew I had potential. I have strict, traditional parents who told me art wouldn’t make me any money, but I wanted to follow my dreams. Now I make anime-style illustrations, and most of my income comes fromcommissions: I draw bespoke characters for clients, and also create my own.Even before AI tools arrived, it wasn’t easy. Indonesia doesn’t take artists seriously and copyright laws are weak. I’ve seen people steal my work and put it on merch to sell on retail websites such as AliExpress. I have to get them taken down myself, screenshotting pages one by one to report them to the site’s admin. Now, AI makes it harder to prove ownership, because it can take your art and make slight changes, so it’s not a direct copy.I first learned about generative AI a few years ago, watching a YouTuber introduce viewers to the software Midjourney, which generates images based on prompts. He asked the program to produce an image in the style of comic book artist Alex Ross. The finished work was good, with Ross’s distinctive hyper-realistic style and colour palette. I remember thinking, “Oh shit, this is going to be a disaster.”Since last year, when AI really took off, my workload has plummeted. I used to get up to 15 commissions a month; now I get around five. People can take your art and feed it into an AI program to create work. A follower of mine recently used AI to portray my characters doing something inappropriate. I tried to report it, but the platform said it didn’t violate its copyright policy.One of the main platforms freelance artists use to get work recently launched a campaign called “Nobody cares if you use AI”, encouraging clients and artists to embrace AI tools. Well, I care, as do a lot of my colleagues.Even the Indonesian government is using AI art: they recently released a video promoting a scheme that provides free lunches for students. It’s a great initiative, but it breaks my heart that they used AI instead of commissioning a talented Indonesian artist.I used to work in a small studio as a storyboard artist for TV commercials. Since AI appeared, I’ve seen colleagues lose jobs because companies are using Midjourney. Even those who’ve kept their jobs have had their wages reduced – and pay in south-east Asia is already low.Maybe my mum was right that I shouldn’t be an artist. I’ve had to look for other sources of income – at the moment, I make cosplay props on commission. I love illustrating, but if I keep losing clients because of AI, I’ll probably go into  prop-making full-time.‘I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs’Annabel Beales, 49, copywriter, Southampton, UKView image in fullscreenAnnabel Beales: ‘Losing my dream job was devastating.’Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianI landed my dream job in 2023, writing content for a garden centre. I mostly did search engine optimisation, and wrote gardening tips for their magazine and blog. My colleagues were friendly and the hours were flexible.I’ve always loved reading and writing. I was brought up on a farm with no television, so I was always at the library, reading Judy Blume books. If I didn’t like the ending, I would rewrite it. But I never thought then that I could pursue writing as a career: where I’m from, it was hard to break into anything creative – people either worked as nurses or at the local car manufacturer. Even though I wanted to be a writer, my mum had always told me to have a back-up plan.Copywriting didn’t come to me straight away, so I did secretarial work for years, and admin roles in the public sector. I’d heard of some friends who needed a copywriter for their businesses, and I was interested in writing professionally, so I enrolled on an online course. It cost a month’s wages and took eight months to complete, but I enjoyed the creativity.I got the gardening centre job a few months later. I’d interview different experts to write blogs on topics such as growing potatoes or planting trees. I threw myself into it and passed my probation.Around eight months in, I noticed I was getting less work. One day, I overheard my boss saying to a colleague, “Just put it in ChatGPT.” The marketing department started to use it more often to write their blogs, and they were just asking me to proofread. I remember walking around the company’s beautiful gardens with my manager and asking him if AI would replace me, and he stressed that my job was safe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They told me they were letting me go immediately. It was just before Christmas. Thankfully, I got a temp role doing admin work in January, but going back to that after having my dream writing job was devastating.The company’s website is sad to see now. It’s all AI-generated and factual – there’s no substance, or sense of actually enjoying gardening. AI scares the hell out of me. I feel devastated for the younger generation – it’s taking all the creative jobs.I’m now a PA in cancer research in the university sector. I feel more settled, but I regret going into copywriting. I got the job at the gardening centre at a time when my mum was terminally ill. I remember asking her whether I should take it, as it would mean I wouldn’t be able to spend as much time with her. She told me to follow my dreams and go for it. I thought I’d be there for years, working as a copywriter until I retired. Looking back, I wish I had spent more time with my mum instead.‘Listening to a series I’d recorded, I heard my character say a line – but it wasn’t my voice’Richie Tavake, 31, voice actor, San Francisco, USView image in fullscreenRichie Tavake: ‘When characters are voiced well, people relate to them.’Photograph: Cayce Clifford/The GuardianI’ve spent 10 years training to be a voice actor. It takes skill–it’s my job to bring honesty to the story I tell. I recently played the main character, Jessie, in a survival video game. Jessie crash-lands on a snowy mountain – as his voice, I have to consider whether he’s injured, how he feels and the shock he’s in.My mum encouraged me to try acting classes while I was at university, as it was something I had always talked about doing. Immediately, I was hooked, and after a few semesters I decided to pursue it professionally. I started training seriously while taking customer service jobs to support myself. My first gig in a professional studio was an Animal Farm audio drama in 2023, in which I played Napoleon. It was a great experience to get mic’d up and perform with a whole cast.The effect of generative AI in my industry is something I’ve felt personally. Recently, I was listening to an audio drama series I’d recorded and heard my character say a line, but it wasn’t my voice. I hadn’t recorded that section. I contacted the producer, who told me he had input my voice into AI software to say the extra line. But he hadn’t asked my permission. I later found out he had uploaded my voice to a platform, allowing other producers to access it. I requested its removal, but it took me a week, and I had to speak to five people to get it done.The Screen Actors Guild, SAG-AFTRA, began a strike last year against certain major video games studios because voice actors were unhappy with the lack of protections against AI. Developers can record actors, then AI can use those initial chunks of audio to generate further recordings. Actors don’t get paid for any of the extra AI-generated stuff, and they lose their jobs. I’ve seen it happen.Better at everything: how AI could make human beings irrelevantRead moreOne client told me straight out that they have started using generative AI for their voices because it’s faster. But when characters are written and voiced well, people relate to them. Take Batman, who was voiced by the late Kevin Conroy in the animated series. People appreciated his work because he brought the character to life. When done right, people will value it and pay money for it.There is also the issue of diversity. I’m American-Samoan and I wouldn’t be happy to hear a Samoan voice generated by AI – it could be inaccurate and even offensive. It’s just a bunch of numbers and words imitating a culture I was brought up in. A great example of this is Ghost of Tsushima, a video game that’s based in Japan. All the cast were of Japanese heritage: they were in tune with the culture and they brought so much honesty to the story. AI can’t replicate that. It’s a machine; it doesn’t have that background and it never will.‘I never anticipated they’d get rid of me’Jadun Sykes, 28, graphic designer, Wakefield, UKView image in fullscreenJadun Sykes: ‘My advice? Learn as many skills as possible.’Photograph: courtesy of Jadun SykesAs a kid I was always arty – sketching, making Play-Doh sculptures. I studied game design and art at college, and went down an Adobe Photoshop rabbit hole. It was fun and I was good at it, so I decided to turn it into a career, starting at the company when I was 21. They sell a platform that creates landing pages and email layouts. I’d design the templates and do bespoke work for clients.When generative AI came along, the company was very vocal about using it as a tool to help clients get creative. As a company that sells digital automation, developments in AI fit them well. I knew they were introducing it to do things like writing emails and generating images, but I never anticipated they’d get rid of me: I’d been there six years and was their only graphic designer. My redundancy came totally out of the blue. One day, HR told me my role was no longer required as much of my work was being replaced by AI.I made a YouTube video about my experience. It went viral and I received hundreds of responses from graphic designers in the same boat, which made me realise I’m not the only victim – it’s happening globally, and it takes a huge mental toll. I went to college, I studied, I did six years of work. Was it all for nothing?After I was let go, I spent months looking for a job. I didn’t find work in graphic design, but did get a job as a content creator at a PC manufacturer. I make videos of the production line, interview staff members and do some social media. I’m not worried here: my employers don’t agree with replacing human roles with AI. I may use it to edit pictures but only to enhance something a human created – say, to remove cables in the back of a product image. We would never post an image entirely generated by AI, which is what my old company is doing. My advice to every graphic designer is to learn as many skills as possible. You have to be prepared.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Graphic designComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With a backdrop of the City of London behind him, from the 34th floor of the Shard, theReform UKchair laid out an economic policy designed to show his party meant business.In a briefing over a full English breakfast for some of the nation’s journalists on Friday morning, Yusuf reiterated an announcement the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, had made overnight from another hotel 5,000 miles away in Las Vegas: the party would now acceptdonations in bitcoin, and if elected to power would make tax and regulatory changes to bolster Britain’s adoption of cryptocurrency.As far as settings go for a press conference, commanding views over St Paul’s Cathedral and the banks and asset managers of the Square Mile, it is straight out of the Westminster playbook, even if the policy idea is pure Donald Trump.However, the trouble with Yusuf’s message to the City was not the questionable credibility of crypto – viewed with unease at the Bank of England as thewild west of finance– but the party’s broader tax and spending policies.Riding high in the opinion polls, scrutiny of Reform and its plans for the economy is growing – led this week byan attack from Keir Starmerwho claimed that Farage’s tax and spending policies were grounded in the same “fantasy economics” used to devastating effect by Liz Truss.The accusation Labour makes is that Yusuf and Farage would spook the City with unfunded tax cuts, sparking a meltdown akin to theill-fated former prime minister’s mini-budget. And despite the posturing from the heights of the Shard, the verdict from many economists is that Starmer could have a point.Reform has made expansive tax pledges worth at least £60bn – with most of the costs relating to a promise to raise the income tax personal allowance to £20,000 a year, a substantial increase on its current £12,570. Reform has also pledged to increase the threshold for the 40% higher rate of income tax in England from £50,271 to £70,000.In the argument about whether Reform’s sums add up, Richard Tice, the party’s finance spokesperson, hassuggested most politicians have no idea about the Laffer curve. Named after the US economist Arthur Laffer, it is an illustration of a theory that there are optimal tax rates at which government revenue is maximised.The idea is that tax cuts could stimulate economic activity, thus bringing in more revenue. While a tax rate of 100% would clearly stop dead economic activity, the idea that tax cuts pay for themselves has also been widely debunked including by Greg Mankiw, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W Bush, who has described Laffer advocates as “charlatans and cranks”.Tice acknowledges that there is an “optimum point”, while Yusuf said that in government Reform would prioritise tax cuts “in the right sequential order and make sure that the numbers add up”. Many economists, too, warn tax rises announced by Labour will undermine economic growth.However, the criticism remains that Reform has mostly promised sweeping tax giveaways without credible corresponding measures to avoid widening the country’s already £100bn-plus budget deficit and £2.7tn debt pile.Add to this Britain’s low economic growth rate, above-target inflation, elevated national debt and rising borrowing costs for governments around the world linked to investor fears over Donald Trump’s trade war, and the argument is that room for additional borrowing is pretty slim.After Farage’s welfare pledges this week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Reform’s announced fiscal policies so far would cost the exchequer between £60bn and £80bn a year in foregone income and additional outlays. The IFS warned this was not yet balanced by corresponding spending cuts or tax rises elsewhere, which it said would be needed for the plan to be implementable.Yusuf said Reform’s plans were a work in progress and were liable to change as the party developed its 2029 manifesto. “You shouldn’t just transfer or copy and paste all of that [policies from the 2024 document] into an assumption about what the manifesto would be for the next general election,” he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour also stands accused of reneging on its early 2024 promises. However, voters may expect better from a putative party of government – especially one trading on public anger at politicians for moving the goalposts.However, Yusuf insisted that savings could credibly be made from “scrapping net zero”, slashing overseas aid to zero, stripping 5% from “quango spending” each year and removing all funding for “asylum hotels”.“The numbers I just gave you there add up to 78 odd billion, right? And that would be £350bn-£400bn over the course of Nigel’s first term,” he said.“Economists at the Institute for Government have questioned whether these savings would ever be deliverable, highlighting that most of the £45bn of net zero savings promised by Reform was money being spent not by the government, but the private sector.When Truss brought forward her mini-budget, she used a Treasury document running to more than 40 pages to justify her tax plans – yet still tested the confidence of City investors.For Reform, there could be a danger of history repeating.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesNigel FarageEconomicsReform UKPensionsBenefitsWelfareanalysisShareReuse this content"

But if you happen to walk by a Smyths toy shop at midnight on 4 June, you may encounter a blast from the past: excitable people, most in their teens or 20s, possibly discussing Mario Kart.They will be waiting to buy the Nintendo Switch 2, the first majorgames console launchsince 2020 and potentially the biggest of all time.What’s particularly notable about this launch isn’t the queues but just how few there will be. About 10 years ago, the midnight launch fad started to fade away. More and more players were buying digital copies of games, which meant they could download and start playing them straight away without leaving their homes.View image in fullscreenThe Nintendo Switch 2 could be the biggest games launch of all time.Photograph: Richard Drew/APIt means that this time around, Smyths is the only UK chain taking part. Even in the States, the home of frenzied launch-day consumerism, only Best Buy and Nintendo’s own stores in San Francisco and New York have confirmed midnight openings.This is a stark contrast to the noughties and early 2010s. Back then, thanks to the vast global success of the PlayStation, Wii and Xbox consoles, video game launch events for titles such as Call of Duty, Halo and Grand Theft Auto were supported by thousands of stores around the world, and the biggest were extravagantly stage-managed.Microsoft’s Halo 3 launch events in the US were accompanied by dozens of actors dressed as space marines; Bill Gates himself showed up at the Seattle branch of Best Buy. In the UK, the Call of Duty Ghosts event at the Westfield in Stratford hired a drill sergeant to yell at customers.I got to play Nintendo Switch 2: hands-on with 2025’s gaming must-haveRead more“My favourite was Skyrim,” says Greg Weller, who was then the UK marketing manager for Bethesda Softworks. “We got the specs of Game’s flagship store on Oxford Street and covered the whole front with Elder Scrolls artwork. We put a snow machine on the roof, so we made it snow in November on Oxford Street. We had press there, we had a cosplay competition, there was a humongous queue, and so many people were dressed up – they wanted to be part of the story, part of the community.”Console launches were a major phenomenon on a par with any movie premiere. For the launch of the Xbox One in 2013, Microsoft took over Leicester Square, building a vast Xbox-branded globe in the centre where the musicians Plan B and Katy B performed. A fortnight earlier, Sony took over the Standard High Line hotel in New York and turned it into a giant video game arcade with developers showing off their wares to thousands of gamers.For the stores and game publishers, these lavish launch events increased footfall and generated word of mouth and press coverage. For the fans, they were a way to feel part of something. “Growing up as a gamer in the 90s, we were quite ostracised for the hobby,” says Rich Thompson, now a developer and founder of Black Rose Studio in Hull. “But then having shops opening at midnight, it was mind-blowing. When Fallout 4 came out, our local Game store hired a DJ; it was a party atmosphere, there were hundreds of us there. I vividly remember people swapping contact details in the queue – you were among your people.”It wasn’t all fun and games, however. Midnight launches sometimes descended into chaos. “The problem was, you’d have one shop open in a city centre that’s full of people coming out of the pub,” says Thompson. “Drunk people would come into these launches, cause a scene and refuse to leave. I remember a huge fight breaking out at one Fifa launch night. Getting thrown out of a midnight game launch became a badge of honour.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(He later told a local newspaper that, though seriously injured, he still staggered into the store to pick up his console.) In London, the Metropolitan police were so concerned about violence that they banned PlayStation 3 midnight launch events at all shops throughout the city apart from the Virgin Megastore on Oxford Street.The transition to digital media, stiff competition from online firms such as Amazon and the disaster of the Covid lockdowns meant specialist high street chains began to close. Game once had more than 600 shops in the UK; now it has about 240. According to data from the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association, UK physical game sales dropped by 35% last year.Will theNintendo Switch2 launch turn things around? As we’ve seen with the vinyl revival and the unexpected incline of Blu-ray sales (due in part to consumer frustration with ad-riddled streaming sites), physical media is gaining popularity once more.There does seem to be a growing revival of interest in physical games. Boutique publishers such as Strictly Limited and Limited Run are producing beautifully packaged editions of modern and classic titles, while game cafes and retro arcades are on the rise.And, after all, the experiential nature of the launch event, the buzz, the social pleasures, is not something that can be replicated by an online purchase.“I got my dad to drive me to a store at midnight for the Xbox launch,” recalls Thompson. “He’d just finished a 12-hour shift. He thought it was just going to be us, but there was a huge queue. The staff were handing out drinks, Limp Bizkit were playing on a stereo system – for 13-year-old me it was just the coolest thing I could imagine. I looked up at my dad and he wasn’t a gamer but he was excited too – there was an energy. All these people just turning up at midnight for a party in a shop.”Explore more on these topicsNintendo SwitchNintendoGames consolesGamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His instincts about Black Americans are clearSat 31 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 16.54 EDTShareThis week,Donald Trumpissued two dozen presidentialpardonsto a motley crew of wrongdoers, including shady politicians, fraudulent CEOs and other wealthy ne’er-do-wells. On that list were the Louisiana rapper NBA YoungBoy (whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden) and the Chicago gangsterLarry Hoover.Regardless of where you stand on American carceral culture and what we know about the ways the criminal justice system squashes Black people who have the misfortune of interacting with it, Trump handing out pardons to Hoover and Gaulden isn’t the magnanimous or justice-focused move he wants us to believe it is. Instead, it’s a clear effort to garner support from the Black community by way of its big names.Gaulden, for his part, was convicted on gun-related charges and sentenced to just under two years in prison. He hadalreadybeen released and this pardon just means he won’t have to follow through with his probation conditions.We demanded justice after George Floyd’s death. Donald Trump made things worse, but we fight on | Al SharptonRead moreFor Hoover, Trump granted a commutation of his federal prison sentence; the former Gangster Disciples leader was serving six life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, drug and other criminal charges. Still, the 74-year-old won’t be coming home (he’s still on the hook for murder in the state of Illinois, a conviction that came with a hefty 200-year jail term).So why is Trump pardoning exactly the kind of people – a gangster and a rapper – whom he despises, and whom he would typically disparage and cast as a danger to American society?The answer is obvious if you’ve been paying attention: he’s done it before – and it seems to have worked.A couple of reasons are often given forTrump’s apparent increase in supportfrom Black voters.Some voters believedTrump’s claims that Black Americans saw an economic boostunder his first presidency, and that he achievedrecord low unemployment– which isn’t thefull story. This is not to mention the fact that Black voters have also become increasingly disillusioned with the Democratic party. Still, one has to wonder just how many of the Black voters who switched sides were won over by disingenuous moves like Trump’s pardons.Probably the most damning indication of the way Trump views Black Americans – and the instincts that drive his political decisions – are his comments about Black people who have experienced the criminal justice system.At a gala in South Carolina in 2024, Trump said he wasgettingmore Black support thanks to his criminal cases, because Black people, like him, have been historically mistreated by the criminal justice system.“And then I got indicted a second time and a third time and a fourth time. And a lot of people said that that’s why the Black people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against,” he said. “They actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against.”Trump’s “aren’t-we-all-just-criminals-at-the-end-of-the-day?” schtick appeals to the kind of famous, moneyed Black people who want to ingratiate themselves with whoever holds power, regardless of who they sell out or what kind of political nightmare they help unleash on the rest of the country. Just look at how many Black male celebritiesshowed upto his 2025 inauguration; from the rappers Snoop Dogg andNelly, to newer faces in the industry such as Fivio Foreign andKodak Black; the latter of whom, mind you, was also granted a presidentialpardonat the end of Trump’s first term. The Trump show is full of these sorts of favors, but is led by a slimy businessman who always comes to collect – with interest.Black folks are disgusted with Trump. This is a fact. But if you thoughtallBlack people would see or acknowledge this for the twisted, insulting, racist grift that it is, think again.Even after the South Carolina gala comments, Trump still managed to secure major cosigns from Black celebrities such as Kodak Black,Kanye West,50 CentandLil Wayne.And he’s doing it again – handing out pardons like Oprah Winfrey giving away cars to her audience.“I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building – as a man, as a father, and as an artist,” Gaulden said in a statement this week after news of his pardon broke. Meanwhile,commentson the news ranged from pleasant surprise, to calls for Trump tofreeother famous people, to wholeheartedsupportof his use of power.We’re minimizing the horror of Trump’s military birthday parade | Judith LevineRead moreSet aside the countless far more worthy cases that Trump could have applied his pardons to. Moves like this are a slap in the face considering everything that Black Americans have specifically said that they need from him, and the ways he and his administration havedirectlymade life harder for them.Black men are the country’s mostunemployeddemographic; Black womencontinueto die with shocking regularity during childbirth, and police continue to harass and abuse innocent Black people simply for existing.The fact that granting a bunch of useless pardons felt like a worthy diversion tells me two things; one, that Trump thinks Black people are stupid or disempowered enough to be distracted by this kind of meaningless breadcrumbing, and two, that the only way he thinks he can relate to Black people is through the lens of criminality and being “wrongfully” persecuted. Either way, these pardons have proven to be a means to an end for Trump – an end where he always comes out on top.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnist.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS justice systemRaceBlack US cultureCelebritycommentShareReuse this content"

This time the issue isautomated license plate readers (ALPRs), which capture (no prizes for guessing!) license plate data and allow law enforcement to build a picture of where a particular vehicle has been. There’s no opting out of being tracked: if you drive, you should simply assume that these cameras, which are sometimes hidden in objects such as traffic cones, are logging your movements. And you should assume that this license plate data can be combined with other surveillance data to paint a very detailed picture of your life. Privacy only exists for ourbillionaire overlordsthese days. The rest of us are just data points.There are obviously plenty of legitimate uses to ALPRs. Their proponents will wax lyrical about how they can help solve carjackings and kidnappings. But, like all technology, they are ripe for abuse. They are particularly ripe for abuse in an increasingly authoritarian US, full of lawmakers who want to control women’s bodies.Back in 2022, a few months after Roe v Wade was overturned, the Guardian published a piece on ALPRs warning that “an expanding web of license plate readers could be ‘weaponized’ against abortion”. It focused on a company called Flock, one of the big players in this space, which promises a “holistic solution to crime”.Flock’s technology could be used to “criminalize people seeking reproductive health and further erode people’s ability to move about their daily lives free from being tracked and traced”, one expert told the Guardian at the time. Another civil rights expert warned that Flock, which has stated that it is happy to provide technology to help enact whatever laws have been passed, “illustrates how surveillance isn’t actually about benefiting society or protecting people – it’s about enforcing the political goals of those in power”.Unfortunately, all these experts have been proved right. This week 404 Media reported that a Texas police officer used Flock toperform a nationwide searchof more than 83,000 ALPR cameras while looking for a woman who had had an abortion. Abortion is almost entirely illegal in Texas but law enforcement reportedly looked at cameras in states such as Washington and Illinois, where abortion is legal.Anti-abortion voices love to argue that they’re not trying to control women, they’re trying toprotectwomen. Funnily enough this same talking point came up in this case. Sheriff Adam King of Johnson county,Texas, told 404 Media that the woman had self-administered the abortion “and her family was worried that she was going to bleed to death, and we were trying to find her to get her to a hospital.” He added: “We weren’t trying to block her from leaving the state or whatever to get an abortion. It was about her safety.”Perhaps this was true in this case. Many of the details are still unclear so it’s hard to tell. But even if this was purely benevolent surveillance, you can certainly see where all this is headed. “This incident is undeniably a harbinger of more AI-enabled reproductive surveillance and investigations to come,” Ashley Emery, a senior policy analyst in reproductive health and rights at the National Partnership forWomen& Families, told 404 Media. “Especially for women of color who are already over-surveilled and over-policed, the stakes couldn’t be higher.”“Texas is the land of freedom,”Governor Greg Abbottrecently proclaimed. If you’re a woman in Texas, however, “freedom” seems to have quite a strange definition. Not only are you not allowed freedom over your reproductive decisions, a number of Texas city councils (some of which are composedentirely of male lawmakers) have been trying topass travel bansthat would stop Texans from driving to abortion appointments in other states. Abortion bans, attemptedtravel bans, and a network of surveillance technology that can be used to enforce these bans: this is what “freedom” for women in Texas looks like.Sexual exploitation and domestic violence soared after Hawaii wildfireIn the weeks and months after the 2023 Lahaina fire, “one in six female fire survivors surveyed felt forced to engage in sexual acts in exchange for basic necessities such as food, clothing and housing”,reports Nina Lakhani.Women and girls in Sudan’s Darfur region are at near-constant risk of sexual violence“Sexual violence has become so widespread in Darfur that many people chillingly speak about it as unavoidable,” Médecins Sans Frontières statesin a horrifying updateon the crisis.Saudi Arabia’s secretive rehabilitation ‘prisons’ for disobedient women“While Saudi Arabia celebrates beingawarded the Fifa men’s World Cupand meticulously promotes itself on the global stage as reformed, women who have dared to publicly call for more rights and freedoms have faced house arrest, jail and exile,”the Guardian reports.

So the horror can be grasped by our celebrity-driven society: are we removing the next Mozart?Sat 31 May 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 13.06 EDTShareTwo children – a nine-year-old boy and his six-year-old sister – are playing at “house”, pretending to be their father and mother. Absorbed in the game, they repeat the words their parents have been whispering to each other when they thought their progeny were not listening.Playing like innocent children all over the world play and have played since the beginning of history. But, here and now, in America, the words some endangered children may be exchanging are far from innocent.What do we do if they come for you, my love, if I never see you again? Who do I call, who do I turn to? What if they also take me? And the children, what if they also come for the children?I can sadly envisage many boys and girls in this country today playing that game, asking each other questions like these while their undocumented family awaits the knock on the door, alert to the sound of a van outside ready to transport them away and rush them off to a distant land.It is not the first time I have had to imagine such a distressing situation. Almost 50 years ago, while in exile in Amsterdam, I wrote a story, My House Is on Fire, featuring a pair of siblings who ask precisely those questions while playing a similar supposedly naive game. I set the story in Chile, a land then under the savage boot of the military, using my fiction as a way of returning to the country forbidden to me as I tried to figure out how those children would cope psychologically with the threat of agents of the state roaming the streets in search of dissidents to arrest and disappear, what sort of permanent scars of dread would be carved into the souls and bodies of those kids forced to become adults before their time.I’ve seen the reality of the new Israel-backed ‘aid’ for Gaza. It’s nothing more than a deadly PR stunt | Eyad AmawiRead moreIt is tragic and disgraceful that the fate of a boy and a girl in yesteryear’s dictatorial Chile can resonate so perversely in today’s America, that their Latin American destiny of apprehension and mistrust echoes what is being perpetrated in so many homes across this land that once beckoned to foreigners to come and build a different sort of future.Though it is, alas, the current United States on to which I am projecting the Chilean experience of those conjectured children, other countries and other youngsters have come to mind over the past half-century as suffering parallel afflictions: Jewish children in the time of the Nazis and Palestinian children in the time of Israeli onslaughts, and Sudan and Brazil, Iran and Belarus, Turkey and Rwanda and Egypt and on and on, a deluge of nations where so many children have asked, at one time or another, what happens if they take away my parents, what happens if they come for me?It is likely that my identification with, and sympathy for, that array of unfortunate young victims may have stemmed from my own life experiences. Even if I had no recollection of what it meant to leave my Argentinian homeland at the age of two and a half when my rebellious father had been forced to flee to New York to escape the wrath of that country’s fascistic military, memories of that trauma must have resurfaced when – by then I was nine years old - the red scare in the United States instilled fear in so many families with leftwing ideas or activities, leading our own family to once again take flight, this time to Chile. And history was going to repeat itself when, after AugustoPinochet’s coup of 1973, my six-year-old son, Rodrigo, followed his father and mother into remote realms, became himself a refugee. And the curse of banishment plagued us yet again in 1986, when I was arrested at the Santiago airport by Pinochet’s secret police, who proceeded to expel me from the country along with our seven-year-old son, Joaquín, already born into expatriation during our Dutch exile.Not strange, then, that I should be haunted by the tragedy of so many forsaken youthful lives being irreversibly twisted, what it does to each boy, each girl, to live in perpetual terror of deportation or death. But I have recently been troubled by a question about another kind of social repercussion: what do we lose, those who watch such persecution and do little or nothing to avert it, what does society lose by hunting down these children and, ultimately, removing them from our midst?We would, needless to say (and yet it must be said), find ourselves depreciated by the vanishing of even one of these defenseless minors, forfeiting the cosmic galaxy of skills and dreams and endowments that each of them promises, how they might enrich us for generations to come. Given that this self-evident truth has been insufficient to stir enough public opinion to get such maltreatment to cease, it might make sense, in our celebrity-driven and success-soaked society, to exemplify that loss in a more dramatic and spectacular fashion.Faced with that ominous question,what do we lose?, I answer with a name that cannot be indifferent or unrecognizable to anyone: Mozart, we risk losing future Mozarts. Can we deny that each deported child has within himself, within herself, the potentiality to become another Mozart?You are not only committing a crime against humanity, Mozart would warn. You are committing a crime against beauty and the compassionate imagination of our speciesInstead of that musical genius I could, of course, suggest any number of other amazingly gifted human beings. There could be an Albert Einstein lurking inside the head of one of the boys being whisked right now to some unknown destination, there could be a Madame Curie inside one of the girls going through that ordeal. A Cervantes, a George Eliot, a Bob Dylan, a Taylor Swift, a Nelson Mandela, an Abraham Lincoln, a Harriet Tubman, a Simón Bolivar, a Garibaldi, a Monet, a Sappho, a Meryl Streep – who knows what miracles are being snuffed out with each stalked child?Let me insist, however, on Mozart as the most luminous paragon in this experiment bent on rattling consciences. True that, during his childhood, he never faced the threat of harassment by cruel authorities. And yet, I am sure he would understand the anxieties and uncertainties that trouble today’s migrant youngsters in the US. One can imagine, as I have done in my novel Allegro, what such a sensitive child must have felt when he was separated from his family and was forced to accept adult tasks and responsibilities, pondering who to trust in a world suddenly full of strangers. Like me at his age, like my own children, like so many imperiled children in the US, Mozart also must have worried about death, must have feared being abandoned at an early age.Who could better represent the latent aspirations and possible talents of many of those contemporary youngsters whose violent passing from among us should fill us with shame and grief? The most famous child prodigy of all time, composing music at the age of five, playing the piano for monarchs once he was seven: I can conjure up no more eloquent and renowned spokesperson for vulnerable children everywhere.Let us, therefore, call on the ghost of Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart to return to Earth and excoriate those victimizers who are ordering and carrying out such acts of merciless repression against his young outcast counterparts in the US and beyond its frontiers.I can hear him telling them to beware of the consequences of terrorizing and deporting a child. You are not only, I can hear him say with that voice which once sang to the world some of the most immortal and consoling melodies ever created, committing a crime against humanity. You are, Mozart would warn them, committing a crime against beauty and the compassionate imagination of our species.Ariel Dorfman, an emeritus distinguished professor of literature at Duke University, is the Chilean American author of the play Death and the Maiden and, more recently, the novels The Suicide Museum and Allegro.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionTrump administrationMigrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But that was the word used by the Northern Territory police to describe the sequence of events to the media. Tragically, painfully, I think it says a lot.I try to imagine a similar scene at my local Coles, where many people who have not been winners in life’s lottery also shop for little items to keep hunger at bay, but no image comes to mind. I think the situation would most likely have been quietly defused, no one would have been “placed” on the floor and died, the shop would not have become a crime scene.On the same day in Western Australia,the state government decidedto provide $85,000 to those remaining stolen people who had spent their lives wondering and suffering because of cruel policies that removed children from their families. A measly lump sum from a state treasury grown fat from mineral resources, many from native title lands.Western Australia announces redress scheme for members of the Stolen GenerationsRead moreFirst Nations people have a life expectancy decades lower than others, so the numbers are much smaller than they were. Delay is the most effective way of maintaining the status quo – people die, responsibility is diminished, the mistake no longer has a human face.The WA announcement came, inexcusably, nearly three decades after the profoundly revealing and movingBringing Them Home report. It landed in the national consciousness and triggered a heartfelt realisation of the long-term consequences of bad policy for those who paid attention; people marched across bridges, signed petitions and wept watchingRabbit-Proof Fence.It also provided a pretext for a cruel and cynical, politically led culture war that has put Australia in aspic for decades.Then prime minister John Howard’s rejection of the recommendations of that report was crystallised as a refusal to say sorry. This was the headline and the source of his global humiliation when Midnight Oil, their jumpsuits stamped with the unmissable word “sorry”, sang and danced in front of him on the stage of the Sydney Olympics closing ceremony.Saying sorrythen gave Howard’s successor Kevin Rudd his greatest political triumph. But saying sorry is not enough – actions must follow to fix the foundational flaw.View image in fullscreenThen prime minister Kevin Rudd acknowledges the Indigenous people in the House of Representatives chamber after delivering his apology to the Stolen Generations on 13 February 2008.Photograph: AAPBehind the moral dilemma about where responsibility ended was a crass calculation. Among that report’s many, and largely still not acted on, recommendations, was thatcompensation be givenfor the thousands of lives that had been deliberately upended with tragic and traumatic consequences for generations.It was this recommendation that galvanised Howard and his minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, John Herron. Compensation for individuals was out of the question and would be impossible to calculate anyway, they declared.That gave way when Ken Wyatt was the minister for Indigenous Australians in the Morrison government, and with little fanfare,compensationof $75,000 was allocated to stolen children survivors in the territories.Pat Turner, a long-term Indigenous public servant, told Dan Bourchier onThe Eldersthat an appropriate amount in 1997 would have been a million dollars each, enough then to buy a house and provide families that had been deliberately destroyed with some ongoing intergenerational security.Queensland has yet to provide redress, and is now, as it has done for more than a century, locking up another generation of children. What bit of this don’t they understand? Crime is not innate, it is mostly caused by circumstances – such as poverty, family dysfunction and trauma – that can be addressed. Locking people up hasn’t worked in the past, and it won’t now.There is unfinished business in this country, and there can be no excuses for not knowing or understanding. We need tochange directionand remove the burden from the most vulnerable.Yuendumu plunged into grief – again – as young Aboriginal man dies in police custody in NTRead moreEndless consultations have been conducted, reports have been written, deep studies of the intergenerational impact of trauma have become part of everyday language. The thing that has not been tried is to listen, and act, on the advice and wisdom of those closest to the problems. To really listen, deeply and seriously to the elders and those who have been working on the ground for years to restore hope. The evidence shows this works – top-down solutions don’t.Almost a million more people voted yes in the referendum than voted for the Labor party in therecent election. The combined Liberal National party vote was about half theno vote. While the majority rejected the voice proposal because they didn’t know, didn’t care or thought it was unfair, this cannot be mapped on to the political snapshot that the election provided. The referendum was not a proxy election. The door to meaningful, symbolic and practical recognition can and must be opened again.I have written here before that this government has an historic opportunity at a time of crisis. It needs to work with the states to grasp it in relation to First Peoples so they can berelieved of trauma, live fulfilled and meaningful lives, so that children are not taken away and locked up, and the whole nation can achieve its potential.In a land of home improvers surely the principle of fixing the foundations first if you want to really close the gaps is obvious.Indigenous Australians can call13YARNon 13 92 76 for information and crisis support; or call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia, the co-editor ofFirst Things First (Griffith Review)and the librettist of the multi-award winning opera Black RiverExplore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansOpinionIndigenous incarcerationStolen GenerationsIndigenous voice to parliamentcommentShareReuse this content"

However, arecent study suggeststhe figure could be hundreds of millions or even billions higher. This news might sound terrifying, but it is important to remember that anxieties about overpopulation are rarely just about the numbers. They reflect power struggles over which lives matter, who is a burden or a threat and ultimately what the future should look like.The world’s population reached 1 billion just after the turn of the 19th century. The number of people on the planet then began to grow exponentially, doubling to 2 billion by about 1925 and again to 4 billion about 50 years later. On 15November 2022, the UN announced thebirth of the eight billionth human.As it is not possible to count every single person in the world, the UN’s population figures are calculated by dividing the Earth’s surface into a grid and using census data to estimate how many people live in each square. This method provides a rough estimate, but until now it was thought to be reasonably reliable.A recent study by Dr Josias Láng-Ritter and his colleagues at Aalto University in Finland discovered that UN estimates undercount the number of people living in rural areas by more than 50%. This is because census data in the global south is often incomplete or unreliable outside big cities. Consequently, UN figures probably underestimate the world population by hundreds of millions or several billion.Many people argue that our planet does not have the resources to support 8 billion people. “Overpopulation” is seen as the root cause of many of the world’s biggest problems. But these concerns are nothing new.In 1988,the US sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov used what he referred to as “my bathroom metaphor” to illustrate his fears about population growth. “If two people live in an apartment, and there are two bathrooms, then both have what I call freedom of the bathroom.” But if 20 people live in the same apartment, they will impinge on each other’s liberty one way or another.According to Asimov, rapid population growth creates a similar problem. It not only places enormous pressure on natural resources, but also erodes autonomy, dignity and civility. “As you put more and more people on to the world, the value of life not only declines, it disappears.”At the turn of the 19th century, when there were fewer than a billion inhabitants on Earth, Thomas Malthus was already convinced that “the period when the number of men surpass their means of subsistence has long since arrived”. Malthus’s inability to predict that technology would revolutionise food production did not dent his popularity. On the contrary, as the world population grew, the prophets of doom grew ever louder.Neo-Malthusian anxieties reached fever pitch with Paul and Anne Ehrlich’s ThePopulationBomb – subtitled Population Control or Race to Oblivion (1968). This hugely influential, bestselling book warned: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death.”These devastating predictions encouraged governments and international agencies to take drastic action. As fertility rates were already falling in most high-income countries, these efforts concentrated on Africa and even more so Asia. USAID funded family planning programmes across what was then referred to as the developing world. Millions of Indian men were sterilised duringthe Emergencyof the mid-1970s. In 1979, the Chinese Communist party introduced the one-child policy and a few years later launched a mass sterilisation campaign, which focused mainly on women.Today, plenty of people remain concerned about overpopulation, but their apocalyptic visions now concentrate on climate change, resource depletion and biodiversity loss. Despite stark disparities in consumption – Americans consume 360 times more carbon per capita than Somalis, for example – population control still focuses on the majority world.Thankfully, the coercive policies that took place in India, China and elsewhere are no longer in vogue.The new approach to population control focuses instead on women’s empowerment. Educating women and giving them control over their lives has proved remarkably effective at reducing fertility rates. In the 1960s, women had on average five children each. Today, the figure is 2.3 per woman – just over what is needed to keep the population stable. By 2100 the global birthrate is projected to fall to 1.8.According to the UN, the world’s populationwill peak at about 10.3 billionin the mid-2080s. After this it will stabilise, then fall. The exponential growth that gave Malthusians so many sleepless nights has been halted. That many people will put considerable stress on the Earth’s resources, but if consumption is managed responsibly and sustainable technologies are developed, the world will avoid an apocalyptic catastrophe.Returning to Asimov’s bathroom metaphor, as anyone who has crammed into one house with their extended family over Christmas knows, many people sharing few bathrooms creates a suboptimal situation. You won’t be able to shower exactly when you want – and you’d better make it a short one. But this hardly amounts to the end of civilisation. In fact, compromise and sharing is probably closer to most people’s idea of a good life than having the freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want.Population growth varies starkly between regions. In most high-income countries, fertility rates are already well below the replacement level. The African continent isprojectedto account for over half the world’s population growth in the next three decades, with Asia and Latin America responsible for the rest.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage launching an EU referendum poster in 2016.Photograph: Philip Toscano/PAAs the historian Alison Bashford points out, concerns about overpopulation are often not really about there being too many people but too many of the wrong kind of people. Ethnonationalists in Europe and North America see the disparities in birthrates as an existential threat to “western civilisation”. They worry about their countries being indelibly changed by mass migration. But the cold hard truth is that in a few decades our shrinking, ageing societies will desperately need these newcomers to pay taxes and work in healthcare and social care. This vision of the future may be unsettling for some, but the alternative is much worse.To extend Asimov’s metaphor, the populist right advocates a sort of bathroom apartheid. They are en suite isolationists, who want to retain exclusive use over one of the bathrooms in the apartment, and force the 19 other flatmates to share. At first, this approach has its advantages. They can soak in the bath all day. They can sit for hours on the can reading the news.But sooner or later they will come a cropper. Perhaps the other toilet becomes blocked and the whole flat is inundated with raw sewage. The other flatmates might forcibly seize control of the personal bathroom. Or as the en suite isolationists grow old and infirm, they’ll find themselves with no one to bathe them or wipe their bottoms.Jonathan Kennedy teaches politics and global health at Queen Mary University of London, and is the author of Pathogenesis: How Germs Made HistoryDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s 2003:the band thatlater becomes MGMTare performing their song Kids to their peers, years before they become a pop sensation, in a dusty quad at Wesleyan University, Connecticut. Social media doesn’t exist yet. There is something about the way people look and behave and inhabit the space that tugs at my heartstrings and fills me with nostalgia. No one is dressed that well; the camera zooms unsteadily to capture the crowd’s awkwardness, slumped shoulders and arrhythmic bopping. Beyond the footage we’re watching, no one seems to be filming.I was only four when the video was filmed, so why does watching it make me feel as if I’ve lost a whole world?A recent surveysuggests I’m not alone –that almost half of young people would prefer a world without the internet. If anything, I expected a higher percentage. This doesn’t mean my generation really would like to reverse everything that’s happened in the last few decades, but there’s clearly something we feel we’re missing out on that older people have had, and we attribute it to the internet – or at least to its current form, dominated as it is by social media.What exactly do we think we’re missing? Personally, I assume that before the social internet people behaved in more authentic and idiosyncratic ways.Social mediahas sped up trend cycles, resulting in an eerieuniformity across styles and personalities: we buy the same products, wear the same clothes, act in the same way, reference the same memes – even quirkiness itself or more “unique” behaviour can be ascribed to trends.I also imagine that if we weren’t on display all the time, our friendships and interactions could be less commodified. Now, spending time with friends is material to be documented and then demonstrated to a faceless audience.Is doom scrolling really rotting our brains? The evidence is getting harder to ignore | Siân BoyleRead moreI’m sure these are rose-tinted assumptions, and I’m conscious too of the things I take for granted about an age of connectivity.Having to trawl through a few measly books and encyclopedias to find anything useful, or growing up in a remote area with little connection to the wider world, surely must have felt both inhibiting and claustrophobic.But it may be that these “negative” aspects are what young people yearning for disconnectivity actually want – we have a sense that there was a value, now largely lost, in the practical effort required for social interaction, for finding good music, or joining a subculture. Life now in comparison seems streamlined, efficient, moreyassified, in a phenomenon that writer Michael Harris calls a “loss of lack”.Recently, my office manager showed me the technology he and his friends used to “watch” the football on:Ceefax. The football score would load on a television screen via the changing of a single digit. They would spend the afternoon just sitting on the sofa, waiting for the digit to change (or not). I felt envious of this. Why? If anything, this is clearly a case where an experience has improved exponentially. And yet I’m captivated by the sense of mystery: if they weren’t watching the game or reading the updates, what were they doing? What were they occupying their thoughts with?The reality might be that they were bored, another scarce experience in a connected age. At least, if bored, they would have entertained themselves with internal rather than external resources. It doesn’t even matter if that was really the case - it is precisely because this experience is unknowable that it is compelling to me. I am haunted by the feeling that spending so much time on our phones has stolen something human and vital from our lives.It is of course true that each era experiences a crisis about the new wave of tech destroying people’s souls – when it wasn’t the internet, it was TV, or the radio, or the printing press, even papyrus scrolls, and nostalgia is common across every generation. But I don’t think any previous generations were ever so down on their own era, in such large numbers, to the point they’d erase its major salient feature. We feel nostalgic for a world that can’t be brought back. As Donald Trump said, now “everything is computer”.Ironically, my nostalgia for a pre-internet age is being fed by the internet itself: the machine constantly feeding me clips of the past, footage of young people operating decades ago where everything seems refreshingly unobserved and carefree.So the very engine of this nostalgia is the thing half of us wish to do away with, despite the fact that it’s an incredible resource, that has allowed unparalleled access to older music, knowledge, ways of living – and is also by nature democratic, questioning traditional media outlets on global affairs and challenging convention.If this survey is a canary in the mine, what should we do? Enjoyable as it is,I don’t think being misty-eyed about the past is the solution; neither is fetishising a perceived authenticity of the past. “Authenticity”, I think, looks like the power to opt in or out, perform or not, when you want to – in other words: freedom. So when it comes to the internet, if switching off entirely isn’t possible any more, then surely the words of MGMT can be useful: control yourself, take only what you need from it.Isabel Brooks is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionInternetDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

But as power migrates to autocracies, our belief in democracy seems complacentSat 31 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 31 May 2025 10.41 EDTShareAfew months ago, I travelled with my six-year-old daughter toHong Kong. As we made our way out of the airport and boarded a train, we shared a brief moment that gave me pause to reflect on how different her conception of the world will be from the one I grew up with. We sat down on immaculate seats, surrounded by LED screens. She looked around and said: “Wow Daddy, we don’t have trains like this back in London.”As the week wore on, and she pointed out other things that she had never seen back home, her comment about the high-speed train took on a broader resonance. Used to Britain’s strained and crumbling public transport, my little girl had identified how economic power has migrated to a different model of capitalism over the past generation.When I was growing up in the heady,Cool Britannia eraof the 1990s, Britain almost seemed like the apex of global civilisation. The only place ahead on its developmental trajectory was the US. And even if MTV or Hollywood presented it as the shining city on the hill, the smart kids knew it was really just Rome to Britain’s Greece.In school, we learned how Britain, the birthplace of industrialised capitalism and parliamentary democracy and long the colonial ruler of placesincluding Hong Kong, had created an ideal form of society that was the model for everywhere else. When we told the story of how capitalism emerged, it was through the enclosure of medieval English villages and the growth of the Industrial Revolution’s “dark satanic mills”. When we spoke of the rise of democracy, it was through the nobles holding King John toMagna Cartaor Oliver Cromwell cementing the power of parliament.Britain, the US and some parts of western Europe were the “developed world”. Everywhere else was “developing”. And development was a one-way road. The various crises we saw on the news engulfing distant lands in Africa, Asia or the Middle East were framed as a painful step in the maturing process that countries passed through in order to become societies like Britain.This is not the world that British children growing up in the 21st century are now experiencing.Our trip to Hong Kong was a stark reminder of this. Back in 2014, the Chinese island city-state was named the overseas destination that most young British professionalswanted to relocate to. In second place was Dubai. Today, entiretelevision programmesare devoted to the subject of young Brits moving to “DXB”, alongside other Arab cities such as Abu Dhabi and Riyadh.In Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman is pushing forward with his sci-fi vision forthe Line– a futuristic, AI-powered linear city, where smart technology will connect inhabitants moving between two parallel mirrored skyscrapers that stretch across 170km of desert. Meanwhile multiple UK governments have been trying and failing for years to advance plans for a high-speed rail line, HS2.View image in fullscreenThe HS2 construction site on Curzon Street in Birmingham, 1 October 2024.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersThe affection young British influencers show for places that are still ultimately autocratic, no matter how much gloss and ring-lighting they use, is hardly surprising. The football clubs British kids support might be owned by Gulf royalty. The films they watch might look as though they take place in LA but areshot in the UAE. The idea that these are the places you now go to if you want to “make it” has become almost as ubiquitous as the idea of following the “American dream” was a generation ago.What does this shift in the axis of our global order mean politically? As the historian Quinn Slobodian detailed in his 2023 bookCrack-Up Capitalism, Hong Kong long functioned as a utopian ideal for free-market radicals who sought to push a vision of capitalism that worked best without the constraining demands of mass democracy. Even Donald Trump, in his nativist justification for a trade war with China, often betrays the envy he feels towards itsability to crush dissentand suppress wages in a way that US constitutional traditions make more difficult.In Britain, it has become more common for our politicians and journalists to cite their admiration for the emergence of technologically advanced, politically repressive states in what was once called the “developing world”. The former British prime minister Boris Johnson travelled to Riyadh in Februaryand stated: “Saudi Arabia is a country where things are happening with incredible speed and decisiveness. Frankly, we need to learn that in the UK.” About the same time, the Telegraph journalist Isabel Oakeshott wrote a gushing piece about moving to Dubai for cheaper private school fees, saying that “unlike angry, divided Britain, Dubai is the ultimatemulticultural success story”.The real story isn’t young men supposedly voting far right. It’s what young women are up to | Cas MuddeRead moreThe idea that capitalism might work best with limited, or even nonexistent, democracy is quietly becoming more acceptable. Just last week, Oakeshott’s partner, Reform UK’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, said Britain should “aspire to” the low crime rate and widespread national pride found in Dubai. That the Emirati city is an absolute monarchy – regularly criticised byhuman rights organisationsfor imprisoning journalists, lawyers and political dissidents with little concern for the public’s right to freedom of expression – appeared to be of little concern to Tice or others on the conservative right who celebrate the city’s “booming metropolis”.With our political and media elites now openly celebrating draconian regimes, it is likely that my daughter’s generation will grow up receiving a different message about the importance of Britain’s democratic “traditions”. According to a Channel 4 study from earlier this year,52% of gen Zersfelt the UK would be a better place “if a strong leader was in charge who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”. Unless our leaders start to promote an alternative vision of how society could function, and Britain’s place in a world where the west is no longer “best”, more and more of our young people will have the feeling that the future lies elsewhere.Kojo Koram teaches at the School of Law at Birkbeck, University of London, and writes on issues of law, race and empireExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionDubaiHong KongYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

In Australia, many major banks and most default super funds continue to invest in fossil fuel companies and their coal, oil and gas projects, driving global warming.That’s where the global divestment movement comes in.Divestment means shifting your money out of harmful industries and into more ethical, climate-positive alternatives. It’s the opposite of investment – you simply pull your capital out of companies or funds that contribute to environmental or social harm.Over the past few years, I’ve delved into divesting my personal finances and learned some key ways this shift can make a real difference.The biggest win: change your super fundIf you only tackle one area of divestment, make it your super – it’s often your largest pool of money beyond property, and too often it’s channelled into fossil fuels.Do your research and get the neighbours onboard: how to get solar panels on your apartment building in AustraliaRead moreThe climate lobby group Market Forcesestimates $150bn of Australians’ retirement savings – roughly $6,200 per member account on average – could be tied up in 190 global companies driving the most climate damage. And such investment is growing, meaning our retirement savings are increasingly being used to create a more polluted world to retire into.One way to find a better option is to use theMarket Forces comparison tool. It profiles more than 70 fund options, pinpointing just seven that fully exclude fossil fuels and the so-called “Climate Wreckers Index” of the world’s worst polluters.Using this type of information, I divested from a large Australian super fund which has known investments in fossil fuels and moved to a fund that excludes major polluters such as Woodside, Whitehaven Coal, Santos, Origin and AGL.Justin Medcalf, co-founder of Ethical Advisers’ Co-op and Unless Financial, says to beware the “devil in the detail”. For example, some funds use a tiered threshold screening, which may allow investment in companies earning limited amounts of their revenue from coal mining.“A lot of investors assume that having a screening process in place means zero exposure to fossil fuels. It can be a rude surprise to discover there is still exposure,” Medcalf says. “Ultimately, there is no perfect portfolio. For now, it’s ‘how do we create the best version of something that isn’t perfect?’”Demand better of your bank – or move your moneyAll four of Australia’s big banks – ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac – pour billions into fossil fuel projects each year, as do many other major players.In 2021, when searching for my first mortgage, I saw the chance to divest from a big four bank and switch to a more ethical option. I told my broker I wanted a home loan that was both competitive and backed by a bank that doesn’t fund fossil fuels. We landed on one of the few with a cleaner track record.To find out where your bank stands, use Market Forces’Compare Banks tool. It includes a “tell them to stop” button, so you can quickly send a message and easily demand change. That’s crucial, says Medcalf. “A lot of people move their money but don’t say anything, so the bank never knows why. A key part of the divestment movement is communicating,” he says.And it works. Just last year, Commonwealth Bankbroke ranks and announcedit would stop financing fossil fuel companies that don’t comply with Paris climate goals. “That was quite a considerable win and a lot of that is attributed to the divestment movement,” Medcalf says.Invest in climate-positive projectsIf you’re investing in shares, ETFs or managed funds, beware of greenwashing. Many mainstream investment products – even those labelled “sustainable” or “balanced” – still include major polluters.Tools like the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia’scertificationand theEthical Advisers’ Co-op’s Leaf ratingcan help you find investment products and services that meet high standards of environmental, social and ethical performance.“We need a mindset shift,” Medcalf says. “Rather than thinking ‘what can I avoid?’, think ‘what can I actively invest in?’ Yes, we want to avoid industries that aren’t creating a positive future, but we can also get behind the industries of the future.”How to avoid ‘fast furniture’ and deck out your home with goods that will lastRead moreAnd divesting doesn’t have to mean missing out financially – it may even boost your returns.RIAA’s 2024 Benchmarking Reportshows responsible investment funds have outperformed mainstream ones by 3% over 10 years, and 1.5% over five years.For long-term investors, especially those in their 30s and 40s, Medcalf says it makes sense to start factoring in environmental risk. Fossil fuel assets are increasingly seen as vulnerable, with tightening regulations and the growing risk of becoming “stranded” and unprofitable.Consider shareholder activismIf you want to go a step further, consider strategically buying into a polluting company along with fellow shareholder activists who then band together to demand change from the inside. You can get started with as little as $500 using theSustainable Investment Exchange (SIX) platform.Whether you divest, reinvest or become an activist shareholder, the point is the same: your money is powerful and you can actively choose whether it props up harmful industries or helps build a better future.Explore more on these topicsPersonal financeChange by degreesEthical and green livingEthical moneyShareReuse this content"

There was, first and foremost, the blockbusterEras tour, which became thebestselling concert tourof all time and acertifiable cultural erain itself. She released thebestselling concert filmof all time, with a distribution model that upended the theatrical market. There was yetanother album of the year Grammy. She turned the Super Bowl intothe ultimate romcom. Even withmediocrecriticalreviews, her most recent album,The Tortured Poets Department, set more streaming records than I can count.All of these were beyond impressive, if at times threatening overexposure and annoyingly at odds with her self-styled narrative as an underdog – the emotionally astute lyricist battling against a sliding scale of villains, from careless boys, bitchy girls and heartbreak to gossip, criticism and misogynistic double standards. Often, the targets are petty: I never want to hear a Kim Kardashian reference again. But on Friday, with the announcement that she purchased the master recordings of her first six albums, Swift notchedarguably the most significant victoryof her career, over the one remaining foe worthy of her stature: the artist-devaluing practices of the music industry.Taylor Swift buys back the rights to the master recordings of her first six albumsRead moreFor those who do not follow what has become canon in Swift’s massive fandom, ownership of her masters has beentheanimating force behind the last six years of Swift’s career, ever since Scooter Braun, most famous as the music manager behind Justin Bieber,purchased themfrom Swift’s former label Big Machine Records for $300m in 2019. Like virtually all young artists, Swift had signed a deal that did not entitle her to ownership of her recordings, just royalties from their sales. The deal “stripped me of my life’s work”, Swift wrote at the time, and left her catalog “in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it”. (Braun used to manage longtime Swift antagonizer Kanye West.) For the following six years, even afterBraun soldthe catalog to private equity group Shamrock Capital for $360m, Swift re-recorded each album under the moniker“Taylor’s Version”, a business masterstroke that at once devalued the originals, ginned up nostalgia and set the stage for the Eras tour.The ownership of her master recordings, as well as her all her music videos, concert films, album art, photography and unreleased songs, is, in Swift’s own words, deeply meaningful on a personal level. “To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,” she said in a handwritten letter posted on her website to announce the acquisition. “All I’ve ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy.” (Swift, the daughter of a Merrill Lynch stockbroker and forever a savvy dealmaker, also thanked Shamrock Capital for being “the first people to ever offer this to me” and praised the private equity firm for being “honest, fair, and respectful”.)View image in fullscreenTaylor Swift celebrating with her albums.Photograph: PR handoutBut it is also a victory that, for once in this era, feels bigger than Swift herself. Swift owning her masters is a small step toward transparency and artistic integrity in the music industry, and one made possible by her immense wealth and power. The fact that we’re even talking about ownership of master recordings, that millions of music listeners now question the business standard of recording industry contracts, is a testament to the power Swift can wield when she chooses a worthy target, even if that target often takes direct form in the figure of Braun (who, for what it’s worth,saidhe’s “happy for her”.) “I’m extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans,” Swift wrote. “Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I’m reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen.”This is Swift in her best crusader mode – grounded in the work, clear-eyed on the stakes, speaking as a songwriter in perhaps the one arena where she remains an underdog with something to fight for. Though often overshadowed by gossip and her personal life, in ways both self-inflected and expected by a culture that loves to see women fail, her flexing of herexceptional cloutover the music industry for artists rights is one of her most enduring fights. It dates back at least to an open letter to Apple Musicwithholdingher album 1989 from the company’s streaming service because it would not pay royalties to artists during the service’s first three months. (Apple quicklycaved.) Or her Billboard’s Woman of the Yearspeechin 2014 in which she called for fairer compensation of writers, musicians and producers – a point she cited five years later whenacceptingWoman of the Decade in 2019, in a speech that is worth revisiting for the contrast between which fights resonate, and which rankle. The part about adjusting her sound and image to appease critics? Flop, mild applause, one of many instances where Swift evinces a sensitivity to criticism and bone-deep desire for popularity that is so incongruous with her stature as arguably the most famous woman on the planet that I find it endearing, the most human element of her incomprehensible celebrity. The part where she bluntly calls out “the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate, as if it’s an app or a shoe line”? It’s the most strident and fair she’s ever sounded, and it holds up.Even if the purchase of her masters feels a bit like settling out of court before the full trial – the re-record project remains unfinished – this is the win that could have the most salient downstream effect for both artists and people who appreciate music. Similar to how her criticism of Ticketmaster, and fan frustration over the experience of buying tickets for the Eras tour, led to efforts toreformticket transparency and break up the Live Nation monopoly, this is power appropriately applied upward. “Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion,” she wrote to her fans. “You’ll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted and ended us up here.” Swiftie or no, this is a Swift victory worth cheering for.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftMusic industryPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The UK’s capital is not Austin, which is a big city but without the myriad cultural offerings of London.On the music front, nearby Brighton’sGreat Escapehas long been billed as the UK’s answer to SXSW, while this summer season is packed with park festivals that started last weekend at Brockwell Park despite a rowover use of public space.Events such asIntelligence Squaredalready offer access to the great minds of our time, and the London film festival brings in talent from all over the world.So what does SXSW London offer?“We really do believe that it’s truly unique in the ability to combine creativity with technology and bring some of the greatest thought leaders together on a platform,” says Arnander, who previously worked at the Barbican and Sadler’s Wells. “And so in that sense, we think it’s something truly remarkable to bring to the UK.”“Austin is very music focused, but we’re sort of broadening it out and introducing other elements to it,” adds Arnander, highlighting the visual arts programme that features Alvaro Barrington.In the 2000s and 2010s, the Austin event became known as a key launchpad for musical talent, particularly British artists, who went to Texas and came back after planting a flag in the notoriously difficult to break American market.Amy Winehouse, Dua Lipa, Skepta and Stormzy all made waves in Austin, but over recent years, that kingmaker status has faltered.Last year, more than 80 artists withdrew from the 2024 edition in support of Palestine afterIsrael’s invasion of Gaza, citing SXSW’s ties to the US army and the defence contractor RTX Corporation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In June 2024, the festival ended its US army partnership after the backlash.When asked if the row had affected bookings, Arnander said: “No, just to be clear, we’re quite independent from Austin, and while Austin had sponsorship from the US army, we don’t have any such sponsorship.”The UK and US events are owned by different companies.London’s musical offering has some big names: Afrobeats star Tems is playing a show at the Troxy, Wyclef Jean is in town, while Erykah Badu was a late addition to the lineup. Mabel is another highlight.But compared with the US event’s usual musical lineup – where Drake, Lana Del Rey, John Legend or Iggy Pop might show up – London’s first edition feels underpowered.SXSW London’s talks programme is where most of the star wattage is found.

The red flags were there from the start, but I ignored them all. When I stayed at his, he didn’t have a towel to offer me, and he never changed his sheets. It became obvious that he didn’t know how to look after himself. Even though, in reality, he could survive without me (similar to how a teenage boy would survive on his own, eating burgers in bed), I felt like, if I wasn’t there to buy groceries, cook and clean, he might die. He would disappear for days, on a drink- or drugs-fuelled bender, and I’d assume he’d overdosed in a basement somewhere. I lived in fear that something terrible would happen to him. I became his boyfriend and his caregiver.This was a familiar role for me: I’d done it in all my previous relationships. I needed to be needed. If the person I was dating didn’t need me, then what value did I have? I found safety in taking care of someone. This started as a family dynamic: as the eldest child, I had to look out for my younger brothers, and learned to overlook my own needs. Then, when I was 14, my girlfriend died in a drug-related car accident. My therapist helped me to see the connection; that because I couldn’t save her, I sought romantic relationships with men or women I thought I could save instead.I hadn’t seen how much I was damaging myself by trying to help him. And that I never would never be able toOne evening, after being recommended it by Netflix, I began watching Beautiful Boy, a film about the breakdown of a father’s relationship with his son, who is an addict. It was about halfway through that I decided to leave my relationship. When Steve Carell’s character (David) hangs up onTimothée Chalamet(Nic), saying, “I wish I could help you, but I can’t do that,” I knew I couldn’t either. I admired the strength it took to end the cycle of trying (and failing) to save his son.Even though he was my boyfriend and three years older, I related to the father-son dynamic in Beautiful Boy. I felt responsible for him, and he would tell me that he would die without me, threatening to take his own life. Until then, I hadn’t seen how much I was damaging myself by trying to help him. And that I would never be able to, not really. He had to learn how to take care of himself. As David says: “I don’t think you can save people.”Despite deciding to end the relationship in September 2023, I didn’t take action until October, when I cheated on him. I felt I had to do something irreparable that would make it impossible for us to stay together. I told him what I’d done over the phone, then I called his mum to tell her about his drug problem. I don’t think she knew: she lived in another country and he hid it from her. Finally, I called a psychiatric facility and did all of the admin to make sure that he would be taken care of, and then never spoke to him again. The guilt I felt was overpowered by the feeling that this was something I had to do.That was my last codependent relationship. I have a new boyfriend, who tells me that my company alone is enough. I’m the most peaceful I’ve ever been, but sometimes the voice that says I’m only lovable if I’m useful comes back. If I try to cook for my boyfriend when I’m tired and he tells me I don’t have to, I can spiral. But slowly, with help, I’m building a sense of self that doesn’t rely on being of service. Beautiful Boy helped me see that I don’t need to take care of someone else to have value.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It invites theatregoers to journey back to 1976 and “plug into the electric atmosphere as one up-and-coming rock band record the album that could propel them to superstardom. Amid a powder keg of drugs, booze and jealousy, songs come together and relationships fall apart.”View image in fullscreenSarah Pidgeon as Diana, Juliana Canfield as Holly and Tom Pecinka as Peter in the Broadway production of Stereophonic.Photograph: Julieta CervantesIf that sounds remarkably similar to the story of how Fleetwood Mac recorded Rumours, then that’s exactly what the album’s producer Ken Caillat thought:he sued the producersfor the play’s similarity to his memoir, settling out of court earlier this year, though Adjmi has always denied his play is purely about Fleetwood Mac, regardless of the many parallels.But Stereophonic is just the tip of the Mac iceberg that has come into view in recent years. Novel readers and TV viewers have enjoyedDaisy Jones and the Six, which also used the Fleetwood Mac template as the basis for its story. Their smooth, adult-oriented rock sound also permeated music throughout the last decade, present in records by artists such as Sharon Van Etten, Julien Baker, the Weather Station and more. If you want a dancier version of the band, you can go to the club night Fleetmac Wood, playing beefed-up remixes.And Mac themselves are as popular as ever: in last week’s album chart, the compilation 50 Years – Don’t Stop sat at No 6 (after 340 weeks on the chart), while Rumours is at No 22 (after 1098 weeks on the chart). Nearly half a century on from Rumours’ release, Fleetwood Mac are still very big business.Partly that’s down to the continued resonance of the story of the album: two couples tearing themselves apart and committing their feelings to tape. (It is perhaps not a coincidence that Abba, another 70s band whose troubled relationships were set to lush pop, are also undimmingly popular.) But it’s also down to the music: Rumours still sounds like a treat when you play it.In a lot of ways it was a band led by women – of course young women are showing up for them“I think Dreams in particular feels very modern sonically,” says Tamara Lindeman, the Canadian musician who records as the Weather Station. “The naked kick/snare/bass line; the way that there almost no instruments inhabiting the mid-range, just a voice; the really tight short reverb; the super short and compressed drums.”“That’s really modern, and sonically resembles a lot of R&B and hip-hop in a way – it’s similar in how that modern music inhabits those frequency ranges. Also I would say Stevie Nicks’ internal sense of rhythm feels so modern – the way she hangs around the beat, often a little behind and kinda swung. It’s not like how other singers of the time sang.”Dreams had a flush of viral fame after being mimed to bycranberry-juice swigging skateboarder Dogg Faceon TikTok in 2020, and those who attended Fleetwood Mac shows during this century have noticed a change in the band’s audience. Twenty years ago, their live crowd had been predominantly ageing couples, but by the time they played what turned out to be their final London shows at Wembley Stadium in 2019, the presence of a great many young women was startling.View image in fullscreenChristine McVie and Stevie Nicks perform at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta Georgia, June 1977.Photograph: Rick Diamond/Getty ImagesFor Lindeman, that development came as no surprise. “Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie both wrote incredible hits. In a lot of ways it was a band led by women – two really powerful voices and writers. For me in particular the songs by Nicks and McVie are the ones that resonate and last – those are the ones you think of when you think of Fleetwood Mac, more than Lindsey Buckingham’s hits. Of course young women are showing up.”Nicks, whose failing relationship with singer/guitarist Buckingham was one of the themes of Rumours, has become a particular hero in recent years. “She does that thing of writing personally and vulnerably about her experiences, but with this strength that comes through anyway – it’s totally vulnerable but she stays tough, like a superhero of the heart,” Lindeman says.Hard rock, ambient weirdness and UFOs: exploring the greatness of early 70s Fleetwood MacRead moreThere are more prosaic reasons for Fleetwood Mac’s continued presence in the culture though, not least the appetite for work they displayed during the first 20 years of this century. While most veteran superstar bands begin to ration their appearances as time passes, Fleetwood Mac stayed on the road for months on end, keeping their name alive. Not for them the handful of stadium shows in major markets: their touring schedules show their willingness to work. Nor did they complicate their message by releasing new music: the focus was always firmly on the past.It has paid off. Now, two and a half years on from the death ofChristine McVieand the final passing of the group (for now: drummer and founder Mick Fleetwood would be open to a new iteration), Fleetwood Mac are the hippest old people in music.Explore more on these topicsFleetwood MacPop and rockBroadwayTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the days after the announcement of my new small press, Conduit Books, the conversation about the balance and representation of women and men in publishing roared back into life. The reason was that, initially at least, Conduit Books will publish literary fiction and memoir by male authors; a modest attempt to address the relatively recent scarcity of young or new male writers in the small world of UK fiction.By and large, the response to the press has been positive and encouraging, with more than 1,000 submissions from around the world (some of which are from men called Reaper Hound or Silent Oath, names their parents might not have given them). We’ve received support from many female novelists (and vocal feminists), as well as women working in publishing. There have been comment pieces across the media.Inevitably, there has been pushback, but also valid criticism asking whether such a press is necessary. There has also been a very small amount of abuse, and attempts to align the press with the toxic axis of Donald Trump and Andrew Tate and the so-called men’s rights movement. This was wearying, though perhaps predictable. My own politics are certainly not anti-woke and do not align in any way with that sorry swamp of hate. I turned down a TV interview withGB Newsas I felt they wanted to talk less about literature and more about the spurious culture wars, with the danger that the debate might have been twisted into an adversarial contest between male and female authors and how much space they have been afforded, now and historically.The fact is, a cursory look at the current literary scene will reveal that new male authors, for complex reasons, are not getting through. In April 2025, the Bookseller’s top 10 fiction picks for the month included no men whatsoever. The all-female literary prize longlist or shortlist has become more common – current examples are the longlist for the inaugural Climate fiction prize, and the shortlist for the 2025 Encore award for a second novel. Having just judged a literary prize (the Republic of Consciousness prize for small presses), I know that all those long- and shortlisted entries were the best books. It’s too important (for both author and publisher) for it to be otherwise.There are liberal and progressive narratives addressing fatherhood and masculinity that are simply not getting publishedThere was never any nefarious plot to exclude male authors, but the judges can only draw books from what’s available. The situation is merely symptomatic of the way publishing has evolved over the last 15 years. Roughly 80% of fiction commissioning editors are women, and it’s understandable they want work that resonates with them. And this often divides along gender lines. After all, to publish literary fiction, which doesn’t usually sell unless it has been prize-nominated or gains word-of-mouth traction, is often to put your job on the line.Fifty-two years ago, the brilliant Virago began publishing books by women with the intention of addressing inequalities in the wider society, many of which are still with us. Conduit Books doesn’t have a political or polemical dimension. After 3,000 years of patriarchy, no one is pretending men are hard done by or not represented in the arts. But there is the pressing problem of what young men read, especially given the current political climate. There are liberal and progressive narratives addressing fatherhood, masculinity, working-class male experience, and negotiating the 21st century as a man, that are simply not getting published. I would like to read them. I would also rather young men read these than the internet. I have an eight-year-old son. I worry about what he will be reading in a few years’ time.I’m still not sure whether Wilde was right. To the trolls I say, there’s no shortage of real misogynists and racists out there. Maybe go after them instead? In the meantime, grown-up debate is welcome. Conduit Books was started in good faith, and I’m excited at the prospect of bringing some outstanding fiction and memoir into the world that might otherwise have been passed by.Jacob’s Advice by Jude Cook is published by Unbound.Submissions to Conduit Books are open until31 May atconduitbooks.co.ukView image in fullscreenAnne Enright, authorI am sure other people will point out that women doing well, or even better, for two good seconds after millennia of oppression should not be declared a crisis in masculinity – why would it be? Also that male writers continue to do very well when it comes to prestige (there were more men called Paul on the 2023 Booker shortlist than there were women, and all that). The majority female readership is generous to male writers, while male readers continue to be reluctant about reading and praising women. My own feminism has always included men, however the conversation about gender has been one-sided for too long, so I am delighted to see them joining in.The majority female readership is generous to male writers, while male readers continue to be reluctant about reading and praising womenYou could argue that one of the purposes of fiction is liberation, and men need that too. As a form, the novel loves going beneath the surface and it loves an underdog – Irish writers have always known it is great at lifting people up. So I would say to a men-only press, “Go for it!”, with one or two thoughts on the side.More books are being published today than ever before, and this includes more books by men. I have seen publishers eat up novels by younger men (especially Irish men, I am glad to say). I have seen them fall on such books with relief that they exist and that they are good. I don’t see any problem with men getting published, when those men are not misogynistic, because it is actually misogyny that has gone out of fashion, not male writers. I worry about men who miss all that, and who miss the inflated, undeserved feeling of importance of the good old days. That said, all writing involves an amount of self-belief, even of self-aggrandisement, and I have also seen sadness and uncertainty in young male talent looking to find a way through.Given the fact that there are a gazillion books by men out there already, the men-only thing may be less a statement about gender in late capitalism than a marketing ploy. I hope it is more than that. I hope this new press brings something to the party. I hope it captures and reinvigorates a male readership. It will be interesting to see which authors are keen to be published by such a press, and what they have to say.The Wren,the Wren by Anne Enright is published byVintage.View image in fullscreenNikesh Shukla, authorIf you want to know how young men are engaging with fiction, with books, with popular culture, ask children’s writers, ask YA writers. We do weekly visits up and down the country, and I honestly don’t know who is better placed than a teacher or school librarian to talk about men’s reading habits.I remember once visiting a boys’ school to talk about my novel The Boxer. My talk, about the racist attack that spurred me on to learn to box, about mental health, about softness and vulnerability, about how anger can be a positive force when channelled by the right people, always goes down well. That one day, I was told to use up the full hour with talking because the boys wouldn’t really be interested and they wouldn’t be asking questions. However, I could feel the energy in the room, them leaning forward as I told my story. And so, halfway through, wanting to bring them into the conversation, I asked if any of them had any questions. A kid put up his hand and asked what product I used in my hair, and before I could answer, someone at the school sent the boy out of the room. Apparently that wasn’t a question to ask an author. I asked that he not be sent out, and noted that he was just making a connection, and I told him I used [redacted] in my hair.It struck me as an interesting moment. The position of author is a revered one. An elite one. I was told afterwards that not many authors visited this school because it couldn’t afford to pay them. And I understood that perhaps the thing that’s acting as a barrier to boys is the institution of literature itself. It’s seen as elitist. As white, middle class, something for other people. Because not enough authors are going into schools and talking to these kids and making connections.I’m interested in what Conduit Books does and how it plans to engage with its audience. Finding and publishing the books isn’t even half the battle; if anything, it’s only a small fraction. It’s finding the audience and engaging with them on their terms that’s most of the battle. Ask any children’s or YA author.Brown Baby by Nikesh Shukla is published by Bluebird.View image in fullscreenLeo Robson, authorAnyone who knows anything about anything, or at least about the English novel, knows that it can never be “too female”. When the literary critic FR Leavis set out his “great tradition” in the late 1940s, he identified four “great English novelists”, only two of whom were English: Jane Austen and George Eliot. He was using his favoured formulation to mean something quite specific: “the tradition to which what is great in English fiction belongs”, something native and distinctive which he called “a vital capacity for experience, a kind of reverent openness before life, and a marked moral intensity”. Leavis named one, more recent, writer: DH Lawrence. Finally, an English-born male! But Angela Carter, writing a little over a decade later, insisted on Lawrence’s “‘feminine’ qualities: sensitivity, vulnerability and perception”. (Lawrence’s tragedy, she wrote, is that “he thought he was a man”.)There are stories addressing fatherhood and masculinity that are simply not getting publishedThere have been periods when male novelists consumed most of the attention: notably in the 1980s and early 1990s, when it was deemed necessary to found a women’s prize for fiction. But everyone knew that the leading English novelists were Penelope Fitzgerald and Iris Murdoch, who wrote often and brilliantly about men (all six of Murdoch’s first-person novels are written from a male perspective). Any such list today would include Deborah Levy, Zadie Smith, Gwendoline Riley, Claire-Louise Bennett, Bernardine Evaristo.Of course I am exaggerating, slightly. There have been some decent male novelists. If this were not the case, it would have been somewhat presumptuous or arrogant to have attempted writing a novel myself. When I judged the Goldsmiths prize, we ended up with an all-male shortlist, and refused to apologise. Perhaps it’s true that fiction has recently been dominated by female writers: publishing is too amorphous to determine these patterns with real authority, and certainly no one could read enough to decide if the dominance is legitimate. But as a male reader and writer, I feel no cause for complaint, or hunger for correction.The Boys by Leo Robson ispublished by Riverrun.View image in fullscreenSarah Moss, authorThe idea of “correcting” women’s domination of literary fiction is troubling. Since Frances Burney and Jane Austen, women have been the novel’s primary readers and writers. As Austen points out in Northanger Abbey, fiction was often disparaged for its femininity. The more serious genres of sermons and self-improvement handbooks of her era fret that young women waste too much time hiding in their bedrooms reading romances that lead to unrealistic expectations of men and marriage, and there’s deep suspicion about what women might get up to between the printed sheets. Novels have always been where women go wild.The idea of ‘correcting’ women’s domination of literary fiction is troublingI suspect that if there is a problem with men’s literary fiction, it’s as much to do with reading as writing. The gender (im)balance of audiences at book events suggests that men much prefer to read nonfiction: mostly rational, quantifiable truths about science, history and politics, though also sometimes travel and life writing, almost always by men. If patriarchy means that some men miss out on the joys of literature, that’s quite low on the list of its harms and also unlikely to be fixed by setting up a men’s publishing house. I wonder also how much this is a British problem, because I can immediately think of dozens of Irish men, established and emerging writers, publishing very well-received novels.I’ve sometimes offered students a false binary (all binaries are false): some novels are mirrors, showing us ourselves in a different light; some are windows, letting us in to unfamiliar worlds. As a teenager I read the big dicks of the 1990s, partly, in retrospect, because I wanted to know how men thought, though also because some of them wrote excellent sentences. I could not see that their perspective was so normalised I had no need to go looking.That reading might have been less harmful to me had my interest been reciprocated. Mostly men don’t read fiction by women and they certainly don’t buy it. (There are exceptions, don’t write in. I live with three of them.) Older men sometimes write to me saying that while they would never normally dream of picking up a novel and especially not one by a woman, their wife insisted that they try mine and actually it’s surprisingly good. They thought I’d like to know. Many men, it seems, experience no curiosity about the female gaze, or women’s experiences. Maybe women, who always used to read men and buy their books, are beginning to return the compliment.All binaries are false. Intersectionality matters, and gender is rarely our most important characteristic. It’s easier to think and write from another gender than another class or national or racial perspective.That said, I’m all in favour of men doing the work on masculinity, toxic and otherwise. Men need space and support to explore emotions beyond anger, to be open and curious about their own and others’ lives, to try out other eyes and other voices, all of which fiction might plausibly do. I’ve no objection to men having a room of their own, as long as they do their own housework.Ripeness by Sarah Moss is published by Picador.Explore more on these topicsBooksFictionPublishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The reality is we would have brought a huge crowd out there: new customers that are Springsteen fans that want to see a band locally.”The culture wars have arrived in New Jersey, the state of Frank Sinatra, Jon Bon Jovi, Whitney Houston,comedian Jon Stewartand TV hit The Sopranos. Springsteen – revered for songs such as Born In The USA, Glory Days, Dancing In The Dark and Born To Run – has long been a balladeer of the state’s blue-collar workers. But last year, many of those same workers voted for the president.Bruce Springsteen says Trump is running ‘rogue government’ and ‘siding with dictators’Read moreNow their split loyalties are being put to the test. Opening a recent tour in Manchester in Britain,Springsteen told his audience: “The America I love, the America I’ve written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.” He repeated the criticisms at later concerts and released them on a surprise EP.Trump responded by calling Springsteen highly overrated. “Never liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,”he wrote on social media. “This dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country.”Trump, 78, also posted a video edited to make it seem as if he had hit 75-year-old Springsteen with a golf drive. Trump called for a “major investigation” into Springsteen, Beyoncé and other celebrities,alleging that they had been paidmillions of dollars to endorse his Democratic opponent in the 2024 election, Kamala Harris.Harris beat Trump by six percentage points in New Jersey, significantly less than Joe Biden’s 16-point winning margin in 2020. In Toms River, a township along the Jersey Shore, Trump receivedtwice as many votesas Harris, helping explain why Riv’s Toms River Hub got cold feet about hosting a Springsteen cover band.The bar and restaurant cancelled the 30 May gig byNo Surrender, a nine-person band that has played Springsteen songs for more than two decades, despite it being scheduled months in advance. Contacted by the Guardian, owner Tony Rivoli declined to comment.Hobicorn, 59, from Livingston,New Jersey, says the band suggested a compromise of playing classic rock other than Springsteen’s but Rivoli rejected the idea. Hobicorn also received some criticism from Springsteen fans for offering the partial climbdown.But he explains: “That’s where I made the point that not everybody in the band is aligned with Bruce Springsteen’s politics. Everybody’s got a different point of view but that’s OK. You can still be in a Springsteen cover band and not 100% agree with everything he says.”He adds: “My band is split. We’re half red, half blue. We have civilised conversations and then we go and play the music and it’s never been about politics. This thing got made into a political situation.”Springsteen is not new to the political arena. When former president Ronald Reaganreferenced the singer’s “message of hope”at a campaign stop, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. Later, he was a regular presence on Barack Obama’s presidential election campaign.He has also challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements.Born in the USAtold of a Vietnam war veteran who lost his brother in the war and came home to no job prospects and a bleak future. My Hometown described the kind of economic decline and discontent that Trump has exploited: “Now Main Street’s whitewashed windows and vacant stores / Seems like there ain’t nobody wants to come down here no more.”Springsteen’s1995 albumThe Ghost of Tom Joad bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants, including those from Mexico and Vietnam. His 2001 song American Skin (41 Shots), criticised the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fanbase.But taking on Trump is a cause of a different magnitude. His “Make America great again” (Maga) movement has proved uniquely polarising in US culture, forcing many people to choose whether they are on the blue team or red team. The clothes people wear, the food they eat and the music they listen to have become signifiers of Maga. Even some in New Jersey, where Springsteen grew up and now lives in the town of Colts Neck, are having doubts.Hobicorn reflects: “As the country has become more and more divided, there’s certainly a real disdain for Springsteen and his politics in New Jersey. Most New Jerseyans are supportive of who he is, what he’s done for the state, what he’s done for our culture, what he’s done for music.“I feel like it’s not a lot of stuff in the middle like, yeah, he’s OK. It’s one way or the other. In New Jersey it’s mostly in a positive way: people love and respect Bruce for everything.But some are going to paint the picture of him: he’s a billionaire and he doesn’t give a crap about anybody but himself. That’s what they do.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at a campaign rally in Wildwood, New Jersey.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesNo Surrender has found an alternative venue. After the cancellation of its Toms River gig, Randy Now’s Man Cave, a record shop in Hightstown, New Jersey, stepped in and will host the bandon 20 June. The shop will producers flyers and T-shirts that say: “Free speech is live at Randy Now’s Man Cave.”Owner Randy Ellis, 68, says:“The state is proud of Bruce Springsteen. He should become the state bird for all I know.”But he admits:“In the last election, Harris won the state but there were many more people for Trump than I ever expected in New Jersey. It’s so polarised now. We may have people in front of my store saying Springsteen sucks and all that. Who knows?”At a time when many of Trump’s critics have kept quiet, Springsteen is arguably his leading cultural foe. In 2020 he said: “a good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotised, brainwashed by a conman from Queens” – knowing the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan.‘This dried out prune of a rocker’: Donald Trump attacks Bruce Springsteen after musician’s fiery speechesRead moreDan DeLuca, who grew up in Ventnor, New Jersey, and is now a popular music critic at the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper, says:“The thing about Bruce that people love is this idea of being a truth teller. You see what you see and you need to speak on it. There’s a lot of people who are muttering things or speaking in private about what’s going on in America who are not speaking out for whatever reason. Maybe they don’t believe that politics and art should mix. Maybe they’re worried about their fanbase or something.“As he said, there’s a lot of crazy shit going on and it’s happened since he was last on the road.It’s good that he’s speaking his mind and he’s speaking what a lot of people want to hear but maybe are afraid to hear and it’s maybe giving some people courage.”But as the case of No Surrender demonstrated, there is a significant minority in New Jersey who see things differently in this hyper-partisan era. DeLuca reflects: “I grew up in south Jersey, which is less densely populated, less urban, and it’s Trump country now.“Springsteen has been true to what he sings about and the people he sings about and the blue collar concerns but then he’s open to target because he’s rich or hangs out with Obama. They probably think that Bruce has turned into a knucklehead socialist or something. I’m sure there are plenty of people who probably do have some divided loyalties.”Explore more on these topicsBruce SpringsteenDonald TrumpNew JerseyUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Through an open window, I hear a harpist plucking notes at a banquet drifting as the sun sets low over the battlements. On the other side of the lane, smoke drifts fromDurty Nelly’s pub, where a singer is halfway through The Parting Glass. A short walk away, the limestone facade ofthe Creameryhints at its past lives – as a stagecoach stop, a dairy, a roadside inn. Tonight, it’s a pub.Inside, Bríd O’Gorman plays the fluttering melody of The Cliffs of Moher on her flute, accompanied by Michael Landers on guitar – a quiet moment before the small crowd erupt into applause as Cian Lally pulls our pints. Just 10 minutes from Shannon airport, Bunratty village sits in the south-eastern corner of Ireland’s most musical county. Along the bar, visitors from the US and France lean in, quietly captivated – likely having their first experience of an Irish music session.View image in fullscreenIt’s no coincidence that County Clare is the centre of Ireland’s famous music scene. Clare is as close as any county comes to being an island. Hemmed in by the Atlantic on one side and the Shannon – the country’s longest and widest river – on the other, it was, for centuries, a place almost adrift from the mainland. Until the 18th century, when bridges finally tethered it fully to the rest of the country, Clare was reached mostly by boat or by traversing the Burren’s stony, unyielding landscape.That isolation also shaped Clare’s culture. Beyond the reach of the capital, this corner of the west became a stronghold for language, music and tradition that flourished in the twilight on its own terms. You can feel that independence in villages along the coast, where the land abruptly falls into the sea at theCliffs of Moher– or farther south, where Loop Head Peninsula stretches defiantly into the Atlantic, a windswept outpost that feels like the end of the world.View image in fullscreenBríd O’Gorman and Michael Landers playing at the Creamery in Bunratty.Photograph: Megan RogersYet even within Clare, there are really two stories, as distinct as the landscapes from which they emerge. Draw a line from Bunratty, through the county town of Ennis, all the way to the northern tip of the county, and you’ll see the divide. Locals speak not just ofClare, but of east Clare and west Clare – each with its own rhythm, character and musical soul.I catch Bríd as she packs away her flute, and the audience turn back to their conversations and pints. She knows this music intimately. A native of east Clare, she is a firm believer that the soul of Irish traditional music doesn’t just echo through the well-trodden pubs ofGus O’Connor’sorMcGann’sin west Clare’s Doolin; it pulses quietly and powerfully through the hills, lakes, and tucked-away venues of the east.You hear east Clare music and you can almost feel the landscape it comes from. The gentleness of the hills, the stillness of the lakes“East Clare music has a character all of its own,” she tells me. “It’s known for being slow, expressive, understated – soulful, even. You hear it, and you can almost feel the landscape it comes from. The gentleness of the hills, the stillness of the lakes of east Clare – it’s a stark contrast to the jagged landscapes of north and west Clare.”The east Clare landscape may have a soft lilt, but its voice carries enormous weight. The monastic ruins onHoly Island(Inis Cealtra) – a round tower and churches – lie just off Mountshannon on Lough Derg, often shrouded in mist. It’s the final resting place of the great writer Edna O’Brien, a place where the sound of the breeze is carried through limestone walls with the same quiet dignity echoed in her prose. There’s something about this part of Clare that holds on to the lyrical, whether it’s in words or music. The land is lush and rolling, threaded with narrow roads and bright streams offering their own soft melody. AtQuin Abbey, swallows call as they dart through the roofless cloisters, while in the pretty marina town of Killaloe, the cathedral bells mingle with the cry of gulls above the great lake. Like the land, the music isn’t loud or dramatic, but quiet, confident, waiting for you to tune in.View image in fullscreenMonastic ruins on Holy Island or Inis Cealtra.Photograph: Fáilte Ireland“People often look north-west when they think of music in Clare – Doolin, Ennistymon, Miltown Malbay,” says Bríd. “But east Clare is just as alive. You just need to know where to look.”One such place is Feakle, a single-street hillside village lost in east Clare’s brilliant green landscape. It was once home to the famous herbalist and wise womanBiddy Early. However, it’s a 19th-century singer, Johnny Patterson, who is commemorated with a plaque in the village square. At a fork in the road on the village approach standsPepper’s Bar, a distinctive yellow-and-green vernacular building that has served the community since 1810. Its compact main room features a homely fireplace, dance-worn flagstone floors and low-hanging beams.On a Wednesday evening, the space fills with the pulse of jigs and reels performed on fiddle, bodhrán, tin whistle or accordion. The music is sometimes frenzied, hypnotic, even mesmerising: complex arrangements often delivered by some of the country’s finest players, including Martin Hayes, Liam O’Flynn, Matt Molloy, Sharon Shannon and Kevin Crawford. It’s in these east Clare villages, such as Feakle, Tulla or Scarriff, that you might realise you’re the only one in the room who doesn’t play, sing or dance.View image in fullscreenDurty Nelly’s pub and Bunratty Castle.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyOn Thursday nights, Ger Shortt of Shortt’s Bar in the heart of Feakle picks up the guitar, joined by a full musical accompaniment. Meanwhile, it seems as if anyone not playing is likely taking part in the Siege of Ennis, a céilí dance performed with spirited energy.Farther afield, Irish-language sessions are held at Gallagher’s in Kilkishen, while occasional music nights at Gleeson’s in Sixmilebridge also contribute to the rich musical tapestry of east Clare. Even the Honk Bar – hidden away on a bramble-filled lane near Shannon airport, not far from where Johnny Fean, one of the founding members of Celtic rock band Horslips, grew up – is known to host the occasional session. But eventually, all musical roads lead to Ennis.The roll call of regulars reads like a Who’s Who of traditional music. Ennis is home to globally in-demand players“It’s the heartbeat of Clare’s music scene,” Bríd says. “There’s a session most nights at Ciarán’s, Knox’s, Cruises, the Diamond, the Poet’s Corner in the Old Ground, Nora Culligans. And don’t forget PJ Kelly’s – it’s a great spot too.”Not every tune is played in a pub. “One of my favourite places to play isGlórin Ennis,” Bríd adds. “We run an open session there once a month – myself and Eoin O’Neill on bouzouki. It’s in the foyer, free to all, and open to musicians of every age and level. It’s spacious, welcoming and it’s been running for years. People love it.”Ennis’s music scene is among the richest in Ireland, thanks to its deep pool of local talent, lively pub culture and a spirit that blurs the line between performer and audience. Mike Dennehy, owner of the red-and-black-frontedKnox’s Pubon winding Abbey Street, says: “Knox’s has a wealth of musicians of various styles from all over Clare playing daily. We’re known not just for the quality, but for our open sessions, with up to 20 musicians at once.”View image in fullscreenA session outside Knox’s Pub in Ennis.Photograph: Brian Morrison/Fergus Mac SweeneyThe roll call of regulars reads like a Who’s Who of traditional music. Ennis is home to globally in-demand players such as uilleann piper Blackie O’Connell, accordionist Murty Ryan and banjoist Kieran Hehir. One of the scene’s crown jewels isPiping Heaven, Piping Hell, a weekly uilleann piping session hosted by Blackie O’Connell. “It started as an afternoon session,” says Mike, “and has become a weekly gathering of pipers from all over the world.” Held in Ciarán’s and Lucas’s pubs, it features a guest piper joining the regulars for an afternoon of music, laughter and storytelling.Ennis also plays a key role on the festival circuit, hostingFleadh Nuain May and theEnnis Trad Festin November – events that have drawn legends such as Moving Hearts, Sharon Shannon, Andy Irvine and Lankum, and cemented the town’s status as a musical capital.The west Clare scene is more relaxed, more immediate, the music blending with the conversation, and one tune flows easily into the next. Events such as theRussell festivalin Doolin kick off the year in February, and by July, theWillie Clancy summer schooltransforms peaceful Miltown Malbay into a bustling, welcoming village of sound. It’s where my own daughter, Síofradh, honed her harp skills in a chaotic makeshift class.That’s the thing about Clare. Whether it’s a gentle melody in Bunratty, a fireside session in east Clare or the lively pull of Doolin, the music – and the welcome – are always there.Bunratty Manorhas doubles from €119 and singles from €109,room-only.Clare Eco Lodgein Feaklehasdoubles from €90and singlesfrom €50, room-onlyExplore more on these topicsIreland holidaysCultural tripsLearning holidaysEurope holidaysFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Blends are a mix of those singular flours in varying ratios, and for familiarity’s sake are usually labelled as either gluten-free plain, self-raising or bread flour. These blends are more versatile, and it’s the plain flours that we’ve got under the microscope today.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To test their mettle, I made a batch of gluten-free cookies with each product. And, seeing as gluten-free food can be extortionately expensive, cost is factored into my ratings, too. A slight caveat: different gluten-free flour blends work better (or worse) depending on the recipe involved. Most will do just fine as a thickener for sauces or as a coating, but when it comes to baking, some are better suited to cakes, others to pastry and others still to bread. That means it’s very hard to say which flour is the “best”, but I’ve done my best to figure it out.The best gluten-free plain flourBestall-rounder:Freee gluten-free plain white flourView image in fullscreen£1.95 for 1kg at Sainsbury’s (20p/100g)£1.95 for 1kg at Ocado (20p/100g)★★★★★Gluten-free flour blends were originally created to emulate wheat flour (so you can use them to adapt recipes to be gluten-free), and this one produces a similar performance to wheat for everything outside of bread baking. Of course, it’s not magic; you still need good recipes and, in some cases, the addition ofxanthan gum.Best bargain:Asda Free From Gluten plain flourView image in fullscreen£1.10 for 1kg at Asda (11p/100g)★★★★☆A solid performance for the price, and certainly a blend that will produce satisfying results for baking. It’s a bit less absorbent than I’d expect, which might mean your dough ends up a little stickier, but if you know what consistency you’re looking for, that shouldn’t be hard to remedy by adding a little more to compensate.The best stand mixers to make baking easier – and even more funRead moreBest splurge:Caputo gluten-free flourView image in fullscreen£8 for 1kg at Ocado (80p/100g)£8.29 for 1kg at Amazon (83p/100g)★★★☆☆This blend contains gluten-free wheat starch so, while it’s gluten-free, it’s not suitable for people with a wheat allergy. As such, its strengths lie in bread-making, rather than your average cake or bake. For bread, it would be five stars, but for pure versatility (and considering the sky-high price), it’s not a panacea.And the rest …Eurostar gluten-free premium plain white flourView image in fullscreen£3.90 for 1.5kg at Ocado (26p/100g)★★★☆☆While this boasts an unconventional range of ingredients, such as vegetable flour and fibres, it produced results comparable to my best buy. However, the higher price means there’s little reason to go hunting for this one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

However, considering it’s nearly twice the price (and while the Asda flour exists), there’s not much justification for buying this.Shipton Mill gluten-free all-purpose flourView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 750g at Shipton Mill (33p/100g)★★☆☆☆This was less able to bind and absorb common baking ingredients, making it feel as if you hadn’t added enough – of course, adding too much can result in heavy, dense or dry bakes. The biscuits weren’t all that far from expectations, but they were a little greasy.Middleton Food gluten-free plain flourView image in fullscreen£13.71 for 3kg at Food Angles (46p/100g)£20.82 for 3kg at Amazon (69p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Even if this was considerably cheaper, the dry and grainy results wouldn’t persuade me to use it in the average recipe. Its absorption and binding are far off expectations – although still not the worst of the bunch – and the finished result gave me the feeling that the balance of the blend must be completely off.Holland & Barrett gluten-free plain white flourView image in fullscreen£2.50 for 1kg at Holland & Barrett (25p/100g)★☆☆☆☆Despite having almost identical ingredients to my best buy, the results this produced were extremely disappointing. It lacked binding power and absorption to the point where it made the dough greasy, sticky and difficult to handle. Sadly, the end results were also excessively greasy and too far away from that of the average flour blend.Becky Excell is a gluten-free cook and author of Quick + Easy Gluten-Free (Quadrille, £20).

Until summer starts knocking, that is. The sun makes me want to slow down, and I find myself wanting a variation of vegetablesagrodolceon repeat. Agrodolce is Italian for sour (agro) and sweet (dolce), which in my kitchen translates to a pile of meltingly soft vegetables, all slick with olive oil, sweet with onions, and cut with vinegar and capers. Often, this takes the form of my husband Hugh’soven-baked caponata, but I also love the comfort of squash and the liquorice sweetness of the cooked fennel here.Squash and fennel agrodolcePrep15 minCook40 minServes41 squash(1.1kg), halved, deseeded and cut into 1½cm dice8 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to finishFine sea salt2 tbsp capers in brine, drained2 tbsp pine nuts2 tbsp raisins1 fennel bulb(300g), trimmed, halved and cut into ½cm-thick slices1 red onion, peeled and finely diced2 large tomatoes(300g), finely diced2 tbsp balsamic vinegar30g mint, leaves picked, to get 15gGreek flatbreads, to serveHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9, and line two medium baking trays (or one large tray) with greaseproof paper.Put the diced squash in a bowl, pour over three tablespoons of the oil, add a half-teaspoon of salt and toss to coat. Tip out evenly on the lined trays and roast for 25-30 minutes, until cooked through and nicely browned.Meanwhile, put two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat and, once hot, add the drained capers and cook for five minutes, until they start to crisp up. Add the pine nuts and raisins, cook for a further two minutes, until the raisins puff up and the pine nuts brown, then tip into a bowl.Put the remaining three tablespoons of oil in the same pan, set it over a medium heat, then add the fennel, onion and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, until soft. Add the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, and cook for another eight minutes, until the mixture turns jammy. Fold in the roast squash and reheat, if need be, then stir through the mint.Top with the pine nut mixture and serve with grilled flatbreads.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodMain courseVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkBreadItalian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
