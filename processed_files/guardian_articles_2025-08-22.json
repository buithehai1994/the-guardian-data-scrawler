We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My vision is fuzzy, my heart is racing and my lungs are emptying of oxygen. I’ve just been asked to speak in a meeting at my first graduate job on a fashion magazine. My task is simple – read out the week’s social media stats – but I can’t make it through. I cut the presentation short. I sit down, murmuring an apology, my eyes stinging with tears.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This isn’t the first time this has happened. I had my first panic attack during a university class presentation. As the room started to spin and my breath grew short, I ditched most of what I’d prepared just to reach the end of my speech as fast as possible. When I returned to my seat, the lecturer carried on as though nothing had happened, but I was mortified. It had blindsided me. I’d enjoyed public speaking at school. Since when had I become such an anxious wreck?Over the past decade, I’ve done everything I can to avoid public speaking – and it’s come at a cost. I’ve turned down the chance to give speeches at friends’ birthdays, declined to speak on the radio about articles I’ve poured myself into, and said no to panels discussing topics I care deeply about. I just can’t risk another public meltdown.Half of Britons have a phobia or fear of public speaking, second only to heights – and above spiders and snakesI’m not the only one who feels this way. According to a 2023YouGov survey, half of Britons experience a phobia (known as glossophobia), fear or anxiety of public speaking, second only to a fear or phobia of heights – and above spiders and snakes. This fear seems prevalent among younger people, with another survey finding that63% of gen Z said they would avoid public speakingif they didn’t have to.After a string of panic attacks during job interviews, I decided it was time to do something to cure my dread of public speaking using some of the most effective methods out there.A specific form of psychotherapyI tell Dr Robert (who prefers to remain anonymous), a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, my history of performance anxiety. Robert is an EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) Europe accredited consultant, and he tells me that this form of psychotherapy could help by changing how my brain stores past negative experiences.“When stressful things happen, sometimes it gets stored in the nervous system,” Robert says. “Part of you feels the trauma is still happening. EMDR is a way of unsticking it, speeding up a process that would hopefully happen anyway.”By guiding me through lateral eye movements while I recall a negative public speaking memory – or another past experience fuelling my anxiety – Robert says I’m “taxing” my working memory: “Each time you retrieve a memory, reflect on it, then store it, you’re rewriting it with less emotional intensity.”There’s a principle that the further away you stay from something, the more likely you are to be anxious of it“You might start with a negative belief: I’m hopeless,” he says. “And once you process it, you’re able to think about it as an adult from a new perspective.” The more sessions I do, the less I see my public speaking anxiety as something that’s wrong with me, and more a product of bad memories.Early on, we try the “flash” technique. It involves recalling distressing public speaking experiences and rating the level of disturbance from one to 10. Then I shift my focus to something enjoyable – watching Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter music videos. We repeat this cycle until the distress fades or I reach a “0”. It feels strange at first, but the memories gradually become less upsetting.When I ask Robert whether it’s possible to cure glossophobia through EMDR, he emphasises that exposure therapy is important too. “If somebody has a phobia of, say, going in the lift, we can do the EMDR – but if they never get in the lift, the anxiety is just going to go up again,” he says. “There’s a principle that the further away you stay from something, the more likely you are to be anxious of it.”Bootcamp for public speakingTaking Robert’s advice, a week after starting EMDR, I head to my first Toastmasters – a club for improving public speaking skills held in a side room at a pub.The host stands and delivers a confident speech about his own story of public speaking. He asks the audience to repeat the mantra “experiment, fail, learn, and repeat” several times. It feels a bit like I’ve joined a cult, but the chanting is reassuring. If there’s anywhere it’s OK to have a panic attack in front of a crowd, this is it.Founded in 1905 by Dr Ralph Smedley, Toastmasters was started to train boys and men in speech-giving but soon became popular among business types looking to excel at work. Nowadays it draws in a diverse crowd, welcoming people of all ages and backgrounds. I meet an NHS doctor who wants to get better at explaining to his clients what depression is, and chat to a first-time author who wants to prepare for press interviews.Toastmasters is free for guests, but paid-up members host the event and get to practise longer speeches. Guests can volunteer for a speaking challenge, which may involve being given a random topic and speaking on it for two minutes.I’m the first guest called to speak, and am given the topic, “How do you get someone to tell you a secret?” When I start, I feel as if I’m in a daydream. I pull together hurried thoughts about how I’d share a secret of my own, but trip over my words and struggle to fill the time (I spoke for 48 seconds). No panic attack – but it was definitely no TEDx Talk.Virtualreality trainingI head to Cambridge to meet behaviour scientist Dr Chris Macdonald, who has developed a VR platform to help people overcome public speaking nerves. He used to struggle with public speaking – and seeing a teenage relative develop a fear of presenting in front of classmates motivated him to find a solution.Macdonald read every research paper he could find on public speaking anxiety and considered possible tools. Nothing was too trivial: “If imagining the audience in their underwear was helpful, I would have considered it,” he says. He found that exposure therapy stands out as the most well-evidenced technique, along with other tools such as breathing exercises that slow your heart rate and certain eye movements that calm the brain’s fear centre.He developed a hybrid platform featuring various photorealistic audiences. It can be accessed via laptop, VR headset or smartphone. “I want this to be freely and easily accessible,” Macdonald says.But how could VR capture the real terror of standing in front of a crowd? Macdonald’s research is highly promising. A study found that students who used the headset for a 30-minute session of overexposure therapy reported experiencing reducedpublic speaking anxiety.And in trial results to be published later this year, it was found that one week of training with VR overexposure was beneficial to100% of participating students.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I have to practise in VR daily, increasing the audience size each time. By building up to an audience of thousands in VR and delivering a four-minute speech I’ll be intentionally “overexposing” myself.“It starts to feel like a step-down,” says Macdonald. “And that’s what people are reporting: that the practice in VR was harder than their actual presentation.”I’m surprised by how realistic VR feels. Rehearsing with friends can be awkward, and doing it alone is dull. But VR feels more immersive and rewardingAt home, I’m surprised by how realistic the experience feels. It’s much more engaging to practise in VR. Rehearsing in front of friends or family can feel awkward, and doing it alone is dull. Whereas VR presenting feels more immersive and rewarding. With each practice run, my confidence grows. I’m even starting to enjoy speaking on random topics I’m given.Ten days after meeting Macdonald, I’m at Toastmasters again, more nervous than the first time. The room is packed. My anxiety builds as I wait, raising my hand every time the host asks for a guest to take on a random topic. I try to shove fears of a panic attack aside as I watch other peoples’ speeches, and focus on doing a relaxation technique that Macdonald showed me: breathing in for four seconds, holding for seven and exhaling for eight.When I’m chosen, I make my way to the front, where I’m given the topic: “Why is it good to go out of your comfort zone?”“As someone terrified of public speaking, I’m totally out of my comfort zone,” I start by saying. Being honest immediately makes me less nervous. I feel fairly calm. I talk about why I think exposure therapy is so important, then talk about my music tastes, which I’m trying to expand out of my comfort zone – or at least beyond my TikTok algorithm. I speak for a full two minutes without any real difficulty.“It’s a miracle,” I text my partner after I step off stage. One member, who saw my first speech, squeezes my arm and whispers: “You overcame the nerves.”It wasn’t a perfect speech: I wrung my hands throughout and could have structured my response better. But the distance I’ve come in a month feels miraculous. For the first time in more than a decade, public speaking doesn’t feel impossible. And I haven’t had to imagine anyone in their underwear to get here.View image in fullscreenDaisy wears dress, £36,River Island.

Keep it simpleBefore you even think about a calm delivery, simplify your message. Strip away unnecessary jargon, complex sentence structures, and tangential anecdotes. Focus on the core idea you want to convey. A concise script will be easier to remember and far more engaging for your audience.2. Get the air out of your lungsBreathing that involves prolonged exhalations trigger an automatic response that slows your heart rate and calms you down. Try breathing in through the nose for a count of 4, holding one’s breath for a count of 7, and exhaling from the mouth for a count of 8. You could do this in the moments before your presentation. When presenting, be sure to slow things down and allow for pauses.3. Get the words out of your mouthSpeaking too quietly not only makes it harder for the audience to understand you, but it also speeds up your heart rate and can make you feel more anxious. Speakers report their volume levels as being much higher than the audience members report. Therefore, try to speak much more loudly than you think you need to.4. Get your focus out into the roomSelf-focus and the associated self-criticism are a common route to increased anxiety. Instead, guide your focus outwards. Focus on the message. When speaking to larger audiences, often looking at faces can raise levels of anxiety, and so you can look slightly above their heads and towards the back of the room, thus increasing your field of view, which can further help to calm the brain. You can add to this calming effect by introducing lateral eye movements, looking side to side, as this quietens brain activity in the amygdala and therefore suppresses our fear response, resulting in a profound calming effect.5. Get out of your comfort zoneMost people practise a presentation at home on their own in a comfortable environment to an audience of zero. Accordingly, even a small audience can feel like a significant step up. However, with the latest advancements in VR, it is possible to practise in front of a wide range of increasingly challenging photorealistic audiences. This overexposure therapy will accelerate desensitisation and build extra resilience, adaptability, and confidence.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingWork & careersPsychologyVirtual realityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I first came across it as the epigraph to The Government Inspector, Gogol’s 1836 masterpiece satirising corruption and hypocrisy in the provinces of the tsar’s empire.The phrase sprang to mind last week when I learned that a 21st-century government inspector is displeased with things I have written about Vladimir Putin and his imperial war against Ukraine – the land of Gogol’s birth. This I know because my name has been added to the“stop list”, a growing roster of undesirable elements – politicians, journalists, charity workers, consultants – banned from entering the Russian federation.The Russian foreign ministry said this was a retaliation for “London’s continued confrontational course” in supplying weapons to “the neo-Nazi Kiev regime”. Since I’m not an arms dealer, my inclusion on the list must be for the subsidiary offence of spreading “anti-Russia narratives”.Presumably, that relates tomy characterisation of Putinas a venal despot and ideological crackpot, whose unprovoked attack on Ukraine was as strategically ill-conceived as it was murderous. I can see why the Kremlin’s inspectorate of media narratives might recoil from the sight of such blood-soaked crookedness, but like the proverb says, that’s not the mirror’s fault.The statement of sanctions is sinister and absurd. It is written with the combination of bombast and menace that Russians recognise as the idiom of capricious, vindictive bureaucracy with deep roots. It is familiar to generations that grew up in the Soviet Union, steeped in the self-satirising pomp of a thin-skinned power that you can’t take seriously in private but are careful not to ridicule in public.It is older even than that. Gogol was a master at capturing social deformations that arise from a duty of deference to dysfunctional autocracy, holding a mirror up to all the grotesque and preposterous contortions. At the end of The Government Inspector, the disgraced town mayor turns to the audience. “Who are you laughing at?” he asks. “You’re laughing at yourselves.”The bleak absurdity of Putin’s rule is not lost on Russians, not all of them. But any jokes have to be coded, discreet, transmitted in glances and arch references. The country has a knack for dark humour that tracks its long habituation to repression. It’s one of the traits, first encountered in translation, that made me want to study the language, and then led me to fall in love with the place when I lived there as a student more than 30 years ago. It’s one of the reasons I stay invested in the relationship, albeit now in a condition of forced estrangement.I have spent a lot of time engrossed in the works of novelists and poets, giants of world literature to whom monuments are erected and after whom streets are named, who would be denounced for disseminating “anti-Russia narratives” if they were writing today. I have enough Russian friends to know that there are stories other than the onestold by Putin’s propagandistsabout a president who is the incarnation of heroic national destiny.I know liberals who have fled their homeland, and more who have retreated to that place of interior exile, where the clear-eyed dissident spirit takes refuge from public delirium. I know there is more than one Russia and that describing atrocities perpetrated by the state is not synonymous with hostility to the people.Dictators always conflate those things. Nationalists always seek a harmonious alignment of governing institutions, ruling party and cultural identity. The regime decides which traits, symbols and opinions qualify as correct expressions of nationhood. Divergence is anathematised as degenerate or treasonous. This might start as a process of narrowing, pinching and whittling to fit the subtle, complex contours of a variegated nation into a rigid doctrinal frame. It soon turns to pressing and beating, hacking away at awkward protrusions of independent thought.As nationalism turns more radical it tends inevitably to violence, first rhetorical but soon physical. Disloyal thought must be excised. The seditious imagination must be suffocated. Political opposition must be cast as the pawn of nefarious foreign nations, against whom war must be waged to galvanise patriotic spirit.Putin has marched Russia a long way down that road, deep into the bloody quagmire inUkraine. Less documented, also violent but more successful, is the Kremlin’s campaign against Russian pluralism. It is a war on the very idea of Russia as a people whose history transcends the martial cliches trotted out by their banal brute of a president; whose cultural greatness is expressed in the tradition of resistance, not the demand for submission.Maybe I am a partisan of that cause, but it isn’t an anti-Russia narrative. It isn’t the people holding the mirror who make Putin’s regime crooked. Who are you blaming, guys? Blame yourselves.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRussiaOpinionEuropeVladimir PutinUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

She’s so devoted to this mission she even did it straight after the death, five years ago, of her beloved mother Maria. “My mum died in hospital at 5.30am,” she recalls. “At 6am, I went out to my car and this woman stopped me for a selfie. I said sure, no problem. I knew it would make her happy, so I hid behind my own smile. Little did she know my mum had just died but looking back, oh my God – I’ll always remember it.”The 50-year-old Brummie whirlwind loves to make someone’s day. At her local supermarket recently, she met a fan called Kate who’d just lost her own mother. “I’ll never forget how hard it was when my mum passed, so I invited Kate to the Bake Off final. She met Paul Hollywood and he gave her a handshake. She said it was the best day of her life. It doesn’t take a lot, does it? Kindness truly does make a difference.”From a ‘Yeastie Boy’ to the ultimate fairytale contestant: meet the stars of the 2025 Great British Bake OffRead moreHammond’s high-wattage enthusiasm and infectious humour have won her a devoted following but she’s fully aware that hers can be a divisive screen presence. “Not everyone likes me. Look, I’ll show you a video that tickled me.” She plays a TikTok of a woman grumbling about her joining the cast of Celebrity Gogglebox. “Give somebody else a chance, love,” she rants. “We’re sick of the bloody sight of you.”“I like these, because they humble me,” says Hammond. “They remind me I’m not all that. She hates my guts but that’s all right. People say Pete Wicks would be better than me at presentingFor the Love of Dogs. He might be but I’m doing it. Deal with it! I know my worth. Besides, my mum would have been so proud. That’s the reason I do this. She’s my guiding light.”TikTok trolls haven’t dimmed Hammond’s glow. Perched on a chaise longue after a long day ofGreat British Bake Offpromotional duties, she exudes energy and warmth. When people wander past – including her partner-in-cake Noel Fielding, sporting a skull jumper – she involves them in our conversation. She shows me gossipy messages on her phone. That trademark laugh peals out regularly. “I don’t think I laugh that loudly, then I hear myself on telly and think: what do I sound like? It’s like a horn. A literal foghorn.” At which point it peals out again.View image in fullscreen‘It’s still not the norm to see a Black woman doing this’ … photographed for Alison Hammond’s Big Weekend.Photograph: BBC StudiosWe’re meeting to discuss Bake Off’s imminent 16th series and Hammond’s third as co-host. “I still see myself as the new girl,” she says. “Paul has been there from the start, obviously. Noel and Prue [Leith] have been there for nine years. So I’m still the newbie and they’re still bullying me. Only joking. I bully them too, to be fair, especially Paul. I take him to task for being mean to the bakers. He’s dead stingy with the handshakes this year. Even I haven’t had a Hollywood handshake in real life. He’s funny about them. That handshake is worth a lot. His hands are probably insured for millions!”This year’s batch of 12 amateur bakers are a typically diverse bunch: “We’ve got the whole spectrum, from age 23 to 59. There’s an engineer, a hairdresser, a medical student, a wedding dress designer. But the one common denominator is that baking is everything to them.” Hammond has genuine empathy for them because she’s seen both sides of the reality TV experience. “I was a contestant on Big Brother, in the jungle, even on Celebrity Bake Off,” she nods. “I know what they’re going through. There’s one baker who can’t even make caramel but they learn on the job and do brilliantly. I love watching them progress. They go into the tent as one person and come out as another. You can’t help ​being emotionally involved. What often moves me is hearing about who they’ve left behind to take part. Some have kids. They’re not seeing their babies because they’re working so hard at this. You’re willing them to do well. When they leave, you find a lump in your throat.”Last year, Hammond took a hilarious tumble off a workbench. Any pratfalls to look forward to this time? “Loads. It’s me you’re talking to. I’m always awkward and clumsy. Hopefully they’ll edit out the mishaps, but knowing our team, they’ll leave them in.” Things go awry for the bakers too. “A technical challenge goes disastrously wrong and it’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. Even the bakers see the funny side. Well, eventually.”View image in fullscreenOven ready … Hammond with co-hosts Prue Leith, Noel Fielding and Paul Hollywood in the new series of The Great British Bake Off.Photograph: Laura Palmer/Channel 4Asked for behind-the-scenes titbits, she grins: “We’ve all got our own deckchairs now. We’ve put them outside our little shepherd’s hut trailers, so we can sit there and chat. Hopefully next year, we’ll get a jacuzzi.” There was plenty of whizzing around the Welford Park grounds in golf buggies. “Noel doesn’t have a driving licence so he’s obsessed. That’s his time to be a driver. He was extra lucky this year: for his birthday, Paul bought him the car that Noel’s dad had when he was a kid. This beautiful three-wheeler. Now he has to pass his test or it’ll be embarrassing. Someone’s bought you a car and you can’t drive it? Bit rude. I made a point of telling Paul that my dad drove a Mercedes, so next birthday, you never know. Fingers crossed!”Hammond’s weight loss has become a tabloid obsession. She shed an impressive 11st, thanks to healthy eating and weight training, and looks fabulous in a shimmery olive jumpsuit. How much scoffing of bakes does she do? “I tried to hold back but I still put on 2kg this series. When I see a handshake, I’ve got to try it. I always taste the winning technical and best showstopper.” Is she still weightlifting? “I am but I’ve not had time lately. I hadn’t been to the gym for ages but I went back yesterday and, babes, I think I pulled a muscle. I was like, I’m getting too old for this.” Surely she gets free massages from boyfriend David Putman – a masseur who (cue another tabloid fixation) is 23 years her junior? “It was better when I used to pay for them,” she chuckles. “I don’t get jack shit no more. He does everyone else but me!”This spring, Hammond finally landed her own interview series,Alison Hammond’s Big Weekendon BBC One, in which she spent a weekend at the homes of her famous guests. “I adored it,” she says. “Just holding that space for people to talk. It caught me offguard, some stuff they told me. It was lovely that they felt comfortable enough to open up. Perrie Edwards discussing her struggles with anxiety was really powerful. So was Mel B talking about being a survivor of domestic abuse.”View image in fullscreenBarking brilliant … Hammond in For the Love Love of Dogs.Photograph: ITV/REX/ShutterstockComedian Jimmy Carr – when he wasn’t teasing Hammond about her pronunciation of “skeleton” (“I still don’t know what I’m saying wrong,” she laughs. “It’s skellington, isn’t it?”) – spoke movingly about seeing his late mother in his own son. I wonder if Hammond feels the same about her 20-year-old son, Aidan. “Without a doubt. Aidan’s exactly like her, right down to the way he eats and how he’s strict about home security. He tells me off if I haven’t locked the porch, which was exactly what my mum did. It’s like she came back in my son.” A second series of Big Weekend hasn’t yet been announced (come on, BBC) but who’d be her dream guests? “Kylie, definitely. Madonna? Oprah? Let’s aim high and see what happens.”Hammond has plenty to keep her busy in the meantime. Every Friday, she co-presents This Morning with Dermot O’Leary. It’s invariably the best episode of the week. Would she fancy doing the other four days? “Nope,” she says firmly. “I live in Birmingham and spending all my time in London would be too much. Cat [Deeley] and Ben [Shephard, the main hosts] are incredible. Anyway, I like being the Friday guy. The weekend’s coming, let’s have some fun.”Last year, she had the unenviable task of taking over ITV’sFor the Love Of Dogsafter the death of longtime host Paul O’Grady. “I never tried to fill Paul’s shoes. Those shoes are well and truly filled. Mine are a totally different pair. I can see why he did the job for so long. It’s bloody lovely. Being with dogs is like therapy.”She inherited her ferocious work ethic from Maria. “Mum was a proper grafter and I am too. I’m a single parent like she was. She understood what that’s like and helped me so much. With every success comes sacrifice. I wasn’t always around for Aidan but she was. We called her his second mum. When Aidan was little, I made a rule that I’d only work three days a week, no more, so I could be there for him. Now he’s older, it’s more flexible.”View image in fullscreenHow it started … Hammond in Big Brother series three, 2002.Photograph: Channel 4/ShutterstockDoes she worry about becoming overexposed? “No. If I need to rest up or a job doesn’t appeal, I won’t do it. I’m good at saying no. I turn down 10 things per day, no exaggeration. It looks like I’m on TV a lot, sure, but I stand out partly because it’s still not the norm to see a Black woman doing this. I don’t want to bring race into it but no one says that about Davina or Ant and Dec. I’ve worked hard for 22 years to get here. That woman on TikTok is allowed her opinion. It keeps me grounded. I’m not a national treasure. I’m just me, doing a job that I adore to the best of my ability, trying to be better than I was yesterday.”That 22-year journey began onBig Brother. In the reality trailblazer’s third series, housemate Hammond memorably jumped on a garden table and broke it. Behold, a TV career was launched. “Wow, what a time. The maddest thing is, I was only in there for 14 days but it was life-changing. I’m eternally grateful to Big Brother. If it wasn’t for that show and breaking that table, I wouldn’t be doing what I love now. And I never did pay for the damage.”Next in the pipeline is new Channel 4 format Your Song, which has been dubbed “The Piano for singing”. “I’d forgotten about that show!” she cackles. “God, I really am everywhere, aren’t I? It’s people singing who probably never planned to. Everyday people with a connection to a particular song.”She scoffs at any notion of a career plan. “I just do what makes me happy, and I do it with grace and love. I’m 50 now. I only want joy in my life. What links all the shows I do is people and joy. I enjoy talking to the public because Iamthe public. I’m normal too. I just happen to laugh like a horn.”The Great British Bake Off returns on2September at 8pm on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsAlison HammondThe Great British Bake OffTelevisionFood TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It echoes insolvency steps at 15 of his companiesGovernment takes over Liberty Steel’s South Yorkshire plants to protect 1,450 jobsJasper JollyandJonathan BarrettFri 22 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 17.40 EDTShareAdisparate collection of steelworks in Australia, the UK, Romania and the Czech Republic at the start of the year had two things in common: they were part of the metals empire ofSanjeev Gupta, and they had fallen silent.The idling plants were emblematic of the tycoon’s struggles. Born in India before starting a commodities trading business at university, Gupta was once nicknamed the “saviour of steel” for his plans to turn around struggling plants. Yet things looked very different this week, as hefinally lost control of one of his key UK businesses.London’s high court ruled on Thursday that Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), a key operating subsidiary, should enter compulsory liquidation as it was “hopelessly insolvent”, with debts of several hundred million pounds but only £650,000 in its account. As soon as the hearing ended, government-appointed special managers present at the court met executives to discuss taking control of steel plants in South Yorkshire andensuring 1,450 people are paid salaries.Gupta did not witness the SSUK liquidation in person; instead he remained in Sydney, according to his company. However, Jeffrey Kabel, the Liberty Steel executive at court, insisted that Gupta was “sad”, but also that he was not done yet. Gupta will try to buy back SSUK – which has operations in Rotherham and Stocksbridge inSouth Yorkshire– from insolvency, Kabel said, claiming that Liberty had the backing of the investment manager BlackRock.Meanwhile, the rest of Gupta’s operations – steel and aluminium works in Scotland, Wales, England, and Australia – under the informal Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance banner, will be “exactly the same”, Kabel said. “We will continue to operate those and invest in them.”View image in fullscreenSanjeev Gupta.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesYet the court proceedings and workers around the world present a picture of an industrialist running out of time and money, with creditors and worried governments closing in, and production slumping or stopping completely. An investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office is ongoing.Saviour of steel?Gupta started trading commodities from his student room at the University of Cambridge in the early 1990s, earning him expulsion from the halls because of a ban on running a business there. He then began snapping up struggling steel and aluminium plants on the cheap across Europe and Australia – controlled via Singapore – and making them part of Liberty Steel.Liberty Steel has been catastrophic for European steelworkers in their management of key industrial assetsJudith Kirton-Darling, general secretary at IndustriAllHe also enjoyed the trappings of wealth that came with it: hebought a £42m house in London’s Belgravia, a Welsh country estate called Wyelands, a Scottish estate that includes the foothills of Ben Nevis, a waterfront property in Sydney, a 31-metre yacht, and a private jet adorned with the GFG logo and the tail sign M-ETAL. He lists his country of residence as the United Arab Emirates, where he owns another villa.Yetsince the collapse in 2021 of Greensill Capital, his key lender, Gupta’s businesses have been scrambling to find new financing and to renegotiate debts in a desperate effort to retain control. Promised investments in new green technologies have not materialised, and much-vaunted turnaround plans have stuttered.The global steel industry has suffered from a glut of Chinese production, and slumping demand, while Donald Trump’s tariff war has created uncertainty.Gupta had already lost control of several companies. One of the first things government-appointed administrators noticed in February after taking control of his steelplant in the Australian port city of Whyallawas that the traffic lights for vehicles entering the site were not working, potentially compromising safety.There was also just three days’ worth of the crucial steelmaking material, coking coal, and a long list of required repairs and maintenance.View image in fullscreenSanjeev Gupta (front left) and South Australia’s Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, in Whyalla in 2017 mark GFG’s purchase of the mining and steel group Arrium.Photograph: David Mariuz/AAPThe lead administrator, Sebastian Hams, at KordaMentha, described the dire levels of working capital at the steelmaker, formerly owned by the GFG Alliance entity OneSteel Manufacturing, as “quite scary”.The steelworks was put into administration after the South Australian government, which was also a creditor, lost confidence in Gupta’s ability to deliver on promises to reinvigorate what is one of only two big integrated steel projects in Australia, and the only local manufacturer of rail.When administrators moved in, the steelworks was found to have racked up more than $A1.3bn (£630m) in debts, including unpaid employee entitlements.GFG says there was no mismanagement involved, and that it invested heavily. Rather, it argues that steel making globally is suffering amid a difficult trading environment.The state and federal governments are providing a $A2.4bn support package to ensure the steelworks keep operating during administration and that workers are paid. There is also financial support for the next owner to upgrade the facility.Similar stories are playing out elsewhere. In the Czech Republic, GFG Alliance reportedlysold Liberty Ostrava for about £100mto a fund controlled by a former interior minister. In Romania, Liberty Galați staved off bankruptcy after a majority of creditors this month agreed torestructure debtsreported to be worth 4.7bn lei (£806m). Steelworks in Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg and Poland have also been declared bankrupt within the last year, with governments scrambling to find new buyers.Judith Kirton-Darling, the general secretary at IndustriAll, a federation of unions including several representing Liberty workers, said: “Liberty Steel has been catastrophic for European steelworkers across the continent in their management of key industrial assets. The current steel market is volatile because of geopolitical tensions and massive structural overcapacity especially in Asia, but this doesn’t explain what has gone wrong in this company.“Workers have long called for government to step in and ensure new owners of these industrial sites but their mismanagement and underinvestment by Liberty Steel over years has made this difficult. Thousands of jobs have already been lost.”Fraud investigationA shadow hanging over GFG’s efforts to refinance all of its companies has been aninvestigation into it by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office. The SFO made its investigation public in 2021, and attended Liberty Steel offices in April 2022 to take away documents; it has not issued any update since.However, there have been other indications of fraud concerns. A 2018 private investigator’s report prepared for bankers at Credit Suisse, the main lender to Greensill, said that Liberty and Gupta were a “clear participant” in a multibillion-dollar fraud because many purported trades were “simply fake”, according to a copy quoted byBloomberg. The Financial Times has separately reported on documents that purported to show GFG sold products to companies who denied having done business with the steel group.A lawyer for GFG Alliance said that the group “categorically” denied any wrongdoing to Bloomberg. Gupta wrote in a 2021letterto the Financial Times: “I’d like to make clear that I refute any suggestion of wrongdoing.”Other bankers within Credit Suisse ignored the concerns, and continued to lend to Greensill; Greensill’s collapse contributed to Credit Suisse’s own fall and purchase by its rival, UBS. UBS, which declined to comment, is now the lead creditor hoping that administrators for Greensill Capital will recover their money from Liberty Steel companies through courts across the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, that strategy may have run out of road. Across the tangled web of companies that form part of the GFG Alliance, at least 15 companies in nine countries are in insolvency proceedings, the high court heard.Take Liberty’s relatively small 140-person operation in Hartlepool, northern England, making pipes for oil and gas – and potentially hydrogen. HM Revenue and Customs this monthfiled a separate winding-up petition over allegedly unpaid tax(although Liberty Steel said that the tax has now been paid). Accounts for the Hartlepool business are three and a half years late, and Gupta faces prosecution in a November hearingover the failure to file accounts for itand for other companies.The last published accounts suggested that the company is dependent on its Singapore parent, Liberty House Group (LHG), to continue as a going concern. Yet LHG was placed into administration in Singapore in April over unpaid debts to ArcelorMittal, a giant steel-producing rival.Ajudgmentfrom that case revealed how Gupta tried to retain control of Liberty House: he said he would “monetise” another asset, the Tahmoor coalmine in Australia. That would free up $42.5m that could be returned to creditors, including ArcelorMittal and the Greensill creditors – despite Gupta owing 100 times that, about $4.2bn.The Singaporean judge appeared unimpressed with the suggestion, writing: “Mr Gupta was proposing to raise funds from entities he ultimately owned and controlled to enable the company to discharge its debts entirely by paying one cent to the dollar, while retaining (beneficial) ownership and control of the company and the group”.Instead, the judge said it was unclear whether Gupta could even come up with the 1% return offered. He put the company into administration, noting a “lack of candour” about how it expected to find the money.GFG hadclaimedin February that it had reached agreement on commercial terms to settle its Greensill debts; that claim appears to have been wildly optimistic, at best. For SSUK, Gupta had in December proposed to give Greensill creditors £500,000, compared with £289m owed. Counsel for the creditors told the high court in London that they “have had enough” of waiting.Life after Gupta?Eddie Hughes, the South Australian Labor MP whose seat covers Whyalla, said the town is better off without Gupta. (In Australia, Gupta still owns an alloy plant in Tasmania plus InfraBuild, a company making beams with electric arc furnaces in Sydney and Melbourne. Bondholders have insisted on a “ringfence around InfraBuild from the rest of GFG” to prevent money flowing out from a business still making significant revenues.)“No one believed that the situation was going to improve while he was that strong presence in Whyalla, and in fact, there was a belief that the place would just be run into the ground,” Hughes said.“There is a real material difference now. There’s still a way to go, but at least that [government] money is being spent on the things that need to be addressed.”Whyalla is a once-thriving port city that formerly boasted a profitable steelworks and in-demand shipyard. Its population has ebbed and flowed with its changing fortunes, and the city is now home to a modest 21,000 people. A quarter of the workforce is directly employed by the steelworks, plus another 35% working for it indirectly, according to agovernment report.In June, Gupta also lost control of the adjoining port, which had accumulated $A194m of debts, according to administrator, William Buck. Michael Brereton, of William Buck, said the future of the city is intricately linked to a successful sale of the steelworks. Australia’s largest steelmaker, BlueScope, is part of aninternational consortium considering a takeover.“Seven years ago, Gupta was hailed as a hero for having stepped in to save the whole business; he’s no longer the hero,” said Brereton. “If they’re not able to find a purchaser, the [steelmaking] business would get shut down and Whyalla would no longer have a reason to be.”A GFG Alliance spokesperson said Gupta’s investments had ensured that “many GFG businesses survived despite operating losses, and safeguard[ed] thousands of UK jobs which would otherwise be lost.View image in fullscreenLiberty Steel’s site in Rotherham this week.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty“Liberty’s strategy has been to identify underperforming or distressed assets that had latent value and that could be transformed over time to produce or process green steel. Its approach has been to rebuild and reinvigorate these businesses while protecting and generating well-paid local employment in less-advantaged communities across the UK.“Liberty has remained committed to this task even while implementing a complex financial restructuring following the collapse of Greensill Capital in 2021, which has affected access to capital at some Liberty operations.“Like all steel producers globally, Liberty has been impacted by major challenges from wider market conditions and the costs of decarbonising legacy industrial assets.”The workers in the UK, Australia and in other plants across the world that are still part of Gupta’s empire are left with huge questions over their futures, and over whether Gupta can follow through on his many promises, secure the backing of the investors he insists he has lined up, and turn things around.For those at SSUK, there was a sense of relief, and some hope that their business will have a future beyond Liberty Steel.“I do think in the long run it will be a dawn for a new future,” said one worker. “We’ve been wanting rid of Gupta for a while.”Explore more on these topicsSteel industrySanjeev GuptaManufacturing sectorSouth YorkshireYorkshireNorth of EnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But nearly a year later, Clarke brought a libel action against the newspaper, claiming millions of pounds of damages. As Lewis tellsHelen Pidd, the trial began in spring this year, with 26 witnesses coming to the Guardian’s defence.The final judgment – that the Guardian’s investigation was both true and in the public interest – is an emphatic victory for the paper, and for the future of investigations into sexual misconduct.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: Andy Rain/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockExplore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeToday in Focus#MeToo movementSexual harassmentThe GuardianNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersNational newspapers"

But in 2019 he was exposed as a serial swindler who had created one of the largest art frauds in history, a Ponzi-style web of lies that conned collectors and investors.In 2022, aged 34, he was sentenced to seven years in a US prison, with two years of supervised release and an order “to pay forfeiture of $86,672,790”.Released from prison partway through his sentence last year, he claims not to know where the $86m is and expresses regret rather than remorse in a forthcomingBBCdocumentary.Asked whether he has the money, he replies with a grin: “No.”He says: “I’m obviously in no position to do anything other than say how sorry I am. But there is a small part of me that thinks: what about all the good deals?”He was interviewed for more than 14 hours for a two-part, two-hour BBC documentary, The GreatArtFraud, to be released next week.The production also features Victoria Baker-Harber, aMade in Chelseasocialite with whom he fled Britain, hiding out on the Pacific island of Vanuatu, where he was eventually arrested by the FBI. She too downplays any wrongdoing: “You could say he’s a criminal, but who hasn’t done something illegal?”View image in fullscreenVictoria Baker-Harber sitting outside the airfield from where Philbrick was removed from Vanuatu.Photograph: BBC/Bamus (WAA) Productions Ltd/Blue Ant MediaThere is no suggestion that Baker-Harber was involved in Philbrick’s criminal activities and she did not face any legal action.Philbrick grew up in Connecticut, the son of a former museum director and a Harvard-educated writer and artist. Collectors and colleagues recall a “disarmingly charming” American, who established himself after rising quickly from an internship with the White Cube gallery in London.But he went on to run a business that engaged in fraudulent practices, selling more than 100% of an artwork to different investors without telling them and falsifying documents to inflate values.Judd Grossman, a New York lawyer representing several of Philbrick’s victims, including the collector Aleksandar Pesko, recalls that Jean-Michel Basquiat’s 1982 painting Humidity was among multimillion-dollar works involved in the fraud: “Philbrick told Mr Pesko that he could acquire the [Basquiat] for $18.4m … Philbrick wasn’t buying it for $18.4m. He was actually getting it in a private sale … for $12.5m. To sell that lie, Philbrick forged documents to create the appearance of legitimacy.“He made up a contract. He even put into that contract the bank account information of a well-known New York law firm … They’ll tell you they had nothing to do with that deal.”Philbrick’s world came crashing down after he lied to German investors about Rudolf Stingel’s 2012 photorealist-style portrait of Pablo Picasso, telling them that the auction house Christie’s was offering a $9m guarantee on its sale.There was no guarantee and the hammer fell at $5.5m. Philbrick said: “I, from that very moment, was dead.”The Germans chased him for the missing millions. When they requested a copy of the guarantee, he had one faked. But they contacted Christie’s, who confirmed it was fraudulent.In the documentary, a tale of greed and of arrogance, Philbrick recalls the lure of money that was “literally shooting out of the ground around me”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a way, because it wasn’t really out of the norm for me, because I’ve had wealthy boyfriends before in the past … shopping, boats, planes.”She describes a debauched life: “We did a lot of parties, after-parties, after-after-after parties. Were there drugs? Yeah. Was it excessive? Yeah.”Philbrick says: “Have I drunk to excess? Yes, absolutely … there were moments of weakness, where I did phenomenally stupid things, decisions that I can’t explain.”The film-makers trace his flight from justice, using footage that Baker-Harber shot on her phone when they were on the run. She also takes them to an “odds-and-ends” shop on Vanuatu, where he was arrested in 2020: “His face just went white. They said: ‘Are you Inigo Philbrick?’ And he said: ‘Yes.’ And then suddenly more men came in with bulletproof vests on.”Both he and Baker-Harber, who have since married, blame his lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, for not securing a shorter sentence. Philbrick says: “I had walked into that room thinking that I was probably six months, nine months, 10 months to the door.”Baker-Harber says: “I got shafted, I feel. Inigo got shafted.”However, Lichtman says the few years he spent in prison for such a crime was in fact “a pretty tremendous result”, considering the strong case against him.When asked what the future holds for him, Philbrick says: “The ambition is to get back to doing what I was doing. I was a great art dealer.”The Great Art Fraud is on BBC Two on 27 and 28 August and on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsArtCrimeUS crimeDocumentaryTelevisionThe art marketBBCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His “general pattern” was “of only being prepared to admit that which was established by documentary evidence (which he had carefully studied), and even then only to the minimum extent shown”.She said there had been no conspiracy to lie, and the conspiracy claim did not have a “proper foundation”.Noel Clarke claimed he was a victim. Twenty-six witnesses painted a very different pictureRead moreKatharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, said of the outcome: “The judge ruled, in extremely clear language, that the Guardian’s reporting was substantially true, and our belief that the reporting was in the public interest was undoubtedly reasonable.“This judgment is a deserved victory for those women who suffered because of the behaviour ofNoel Clarke. Going to court is difficult and stressful, yet more than 20 women agreed to testify in the high court, refusing to be bullied or intimidated.“This is also a landmark judgment for Guardian journalism, and for investigative journalism in Britain. It was important to fight this case. This was a deeply researched investigation by some of the Guardian’s best reporters, who worked diligently and responsibly. The judgment is clear that our investigation was thorough and fair, a template for public interest journalism.“I hope today will give encouragement to other women in similar situations who have been too fearful to raise their voices for fear of the consequences.”3:35Noel Clarke loses libel case against Guardian over sexual misconduct investigation – videoIn her judgment, Steyn said: “There has been much reference to an ‘anonymous email campaign’ making false allegations against Mr Clarke. If there was such a ‘campaign’ – and it seems Bafta may have received some vitriolic anonymous emails – it was not something to which any of the witnesses were party.” While one or two of them wrote anonymously to Bafta, “the matters they raised were true”.She said Clarke’s case that there was an unlawful conspiracy “was born of necessity, in the face of the large body of witnesses giving evidence against him”.“There has been no conspiracy to lie. In the absence of a conspiracy, Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses – none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come to court to lie is inherently implausible.”Clarke, 49, had said he would seek £70m in damages if successful.The Guardian relied on testimony from almost 30 people, 26 of whom spoke in court in London about their experiences of working with the former star of Doctor Who. Many said they had been directly affected by Clarke, while others said they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour.The writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy sued Guardian News & Media (GNM) over seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in whichmore than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.The judge found that Viner, along with other Guardian editors and reporters, believed publication was in the public interest, which was a reasonable belief.The allegations against Clarke were made up of the following elements:There were strong grounds to believe that,over 15 years, he had used his power to prey on and harass female colleagues.He sometimes bullied female colleagues.He engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping.He engaged in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments.He was involved in professional misconduct.He took and shared explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.The judge found that “instances of each of those elements have been established”.In closing submissions, Gavin Millar KC, for the Guardian, said Clarke had been forced to come up with an “elaborate conspiracy theory” to try to rebut the “overwhelming evidence” against him.Clarke denied all the allegations and variously claimed that his accusers were lying, embellishing incidents, motivated by grudges and that there was a conspiracy against him.Steyn said: “While Mr Clarke was willing to desist from making sexual allusions and advances and engaging in sexual talk with those who unequivocally spurned him, he clearly felt the onus was on such a person to object to his behaviour and he regarded anyone who was unwilling to acquiesce in his ‘sexual banter’ as haughty and hostile.”She said she accepted one aspect of Clarke’s evidence, namely “his belief that he is not what the Guardian ‘branded’ him”. “Although I find that he has been untruthful about most of the allegations in his efforts to salvage his career, his initial response that ‘some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise’ was true.“Even when his actions have been calculated and deliberate, Mr Clarke has tended to be oblivious to their impact, regarding his own behaviour as merely being ‘naughty’, ‘cheeky’, ‘teasing’ or within his rights as a director or producer.“In addition, he does not see himself as reflected in the articles because there is a kinder, more generous side to him. But that does not detract from the conclusions I have reached.”She found that in one sex scene involving Clarke, an actor known as “Penelope” was naked from the waist down, and this was “not necessary” for the purposes of the footage taken. She said: “I have not found that the requirement for ‘Penelope’ to be naked below the waist for the filming of the sex scene was introduced for Mr Clarke’s sexual gratification, but he did then take advantage of it for that purpose.”Discussing another witness, she said: “The strong impression that I gained is that Mr Clarke felt that he could sexually proposition any woman he wanted, as reflected in his evidence that he has ‘been turned down a million times’, even allowing for the obvious hyperbole – regardless of the circumstances.“He had no understanding of how pressuring such conduct could be, or how uncomfortable it could make young women, in subordinate roles to him, feel while performing their jobs.”Of the Guardian’s reporting, the judge said the claim that journalists covering the investigation became a party to a conspiracy and knowingly deceived Viner and others to secure publication of known falsehoods was “wholly unfounded and meritless”.“It is readily apparent that none of the reporters and editors involved had any interest in publishing any allegation that they did not believe to be true, or sufficiently verified and corroborated to be fit and ready for publication.”Of individual witnesses’ accounts, Steyn said the Guardian had established that Clarke “revealed naked photographs” of a woman known as “Ivy” without her consent and shared them.Gina Powell, who worked at Clarke’s Unstoppable Film and TV production company between 2014 and 2017, alleges the actor groped her in a lift, exposed himself to her in a car, and brushed off concerns about his sexual behaviour towards other women. She also told the court that he kept a hard drive of naked pictures of others. The judge described Powell as “an impressive and compelling witness” who “demonstrated admirable bravery and integrity”. Steyn said she had “no hesitation in finding that she was an honest, reliable witness, who did not overstate or exaggerate any of the matters which she addressed”.Joanne Hayes, who in 2004 worked with Clarke on Doctor Who as a costume assistant, claims that, while alone with her in his trailer on set, Clarke told her he liked girls with long hair, adding words to the effect that it was “nice to have something to hold on to when I do them from behind”. Steyn said Hayes “gave truthful, careful and reliable evidence” and had “no reason to come forward and lie”.In a statement, Clarke said: “Today’s result is disappointing. For almost five years, I have fought against a powerful media outlet and its extensive legal teams over inaccurate and damaging reporting.“These stories started via anonymous emails portraying me as a monster to attract attention and outrage. The goal was to damage my career, and they succeeded.“I have never claimed to be perfect. But I am not the person described in these articles. Overnight I lost everything. The media outlet didn’t just ruin my life; they ripped through my family’s also.”Clarke thanked the “team who stood beside me throughout”, including his family, “who never stopped believing there was something worth fighting for”.At the conclusion of the trial, Philip Williams, representing Clarke, argued that his client was the victim of an industry attempting a “purge” after the #MeToo movement. He highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series and Carry On films as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate”, and said the treatment of Clarke “represents illiterate historical revisionism and completely ignores any nuance or context”.Millar, for the Guardian, said Clarke had “made unpersuasive but revealing efforts to normalise and/or excuse conduct that most people would find – and would have found, whether 10 or 20 years ago – offensive and unacceptable”.Steyn’s judgment means Clarke, who said his career had collapsed as a result of the articles, faces a hefty legal bill and may also be required to pay the bulk of the Guardian’s legal costs.The trial was a rare case of #MeToo-type allegations published by a UK newspaper going to trial. A victory for Clarke would have been likely to make the press rethink future reporting on such issues.After the publication of the Guardian’s first report on Clarke, Bafta suspended a lifetime achievement award it had given him the previous week and ITV declined to broadcast the final episode of the thriller Viewpoint, in which he was starring.Additionally, Sky cancelled the award-winning police show Bulletproof, which was created by and starred Clarke. He alsoleft Unstoppable Film and TV, the company he co-founded and which produced Bulletproof.Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianNoel ClarkeNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesSexual harassmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Their accusations covered all manner of misconduct: sexual harassment, unwanted touching and groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour, taking and sharing sexually explicit pictures and videos without consent, and bullying.The allegations spanned a long period, from 2004 to 2019 and were the basis ofa powerful series of Guardian articlesanda podcast, which led to Clarke suing the Guardian.The six-week trial took place in the high court in March and April,and the judgment came in today. Mrs Justice Steyn ruled that what the Guardian published was true, and that publishing it was in the public interest.The judge praised our reporters’ and editors’ exhaustive approach to covering the story and noted the “extensive efforts they made to investigate, test and corroborate the information they received, and not to publish allegations which they could not substantiate”.It is an overwhelming victory for the women who spoke to us, for the Guardian, and for investigative journalism in Britain.Almost every day over my decade as editor-in-chief of the Guardian I have had to take difficult decisions. In many ways, deciding to fight Noel Clarke’s defamation claim was not one of them. I believed from the start this was a case we needed to see through to the end – primarily, of course, for the women who had spoken to us for our original investigation, and those who then came to the court to give testimony.I remember when I was first told about the investigation: what struck me was the sheer scale of it all.In cases where there are claims of sexual misconduct, even post the #MeToo movement, it is rare to find women who are prepared to speak to journalists. When you’re talking about someone who is much more powerful than you are, and is a big name in the film and TV industry, it’s a huge risk. Yet every time I received an update from the investigations team, the numbers of women had risen. Within days, we had more than a dozen sources.By the time we had published our first investigation we had heard credible first-hand allegations from 22 women, and our superb reporters had done extensive work on corroboration. By the time we published our last article, we had spoken to more than 100 sources.At trial we were able to rely on testimony from 26 different people, some of whom had travelled to the high court from abroad.The many women who came to give testimony in court did not flinch, despite the often intimidating tactics used to try to deter them both before and during the trial. I attended court most days and found it very moving that so many of the women came forward and spoke so powerfully and with such commitment about some of the worst times of their lives. As the great British writer, actor and director Michaela Coelwroteabout our sources: “Speaking about these incidents takes a lot of strength because some call them ‘grey areas’. They are, however, far from grey. These behaviours are unprofessional, violent, and can destroy a person’s perception of themselves, their places in the world, and their career irreparably.”One of those witnesses, Gina Powell, a former employee of Clarke’s, was an important source in our reporting and a witness at the trial in March. Powell accused Clarke of sexually assaulting her and told the court that she was speaking up because she did not think he should be “around young women in the film industry”. Her decision to speak out, like that of all of our witnesses, was incredibly brave. In addition to calling her an impressive, honest, compelling witness who did not overstate or exaggerate any of the matters she addressed, Mrs Justice Steyn said of her: “Courage is not evinced by the absence of fear but by mastering it, and Ms Powell demonstrated admirable bravery and integrity.”The Guardian stood by Gina and all these women, and the media as a whole will benefit from the bravery the women showed, thanks to a judgment that has fully vindicated their decision to come forward.So this judgment is a victory for them.It is also an important exoneration of the Guardian – our reporters, editors and lawyers. Investigative journalism is risky and expensive, and reporting that involves allegations of sexual misconduct is famously extremely challenging to publish.There is the constant threat of litigation, which is unpleasant and time-consuming. There is the toll that it takes on the witnesses, who may have already suffered abuse, and who can often, understandably, feel they cannot put themselves through the trauma of a gruelling court case.That’s also something faced by our journalists. Six of us were cross-examined in the high court. One reporter was on the stand for three days. Another was the subject of extremely personalised questioning. Baseless allegations of a “conspiracy” were levelled. All performed superbly, standing up for journalism in the public interest, standing up for the Guardian.And then there is the threat of ruinous costs. At one point, and doubtless in an attempt to force us to settle the case on his terms before the trial, Noel Clarke tried to increase his damages claim to the eye-watering sum of £70m.The Guardian is lucky to have the support of the Scott Trust behind us – our owners, who are committed to journalism in the public interest rather than pursuing commercial or political interests. They backed the journalism every step of the way.Few defamation cases make it to trial precisely because of the financial and reputational jeopardy. But this was a case where I felt the Guardian needed to take a stand and trust in the women, our journalism and the court process.It’s a good day for the Guardian, for media in the public interest, and for women.Katharine Viner is editor-in-chief of the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Twenty-six witnesses painted a very different pictureInside the trial in which the actor claimed the Guardian’s sexual misconduct investigation was a conspiracy among people with grudges against himClarke loses case against Guardian over sexual misconduct investigationHaroon SiddiqueLegal affairs correspondentFri 22 Aug 2025 09.13 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.52 EDTShare“Ithink the world has just changed,”Noel Clarketold the judge while giving evidence in his libel case against the Guardian. “I think we can all agree that things that were acceptable 10, 20 years ago are just no longer acceptable.”While the actor also vehemently denied many of the claims against him, that, in essence, was one of the arguments he presented to the court.He was the victim.Twenty-six witnesses who gave testimony against him over the course of a five-week trial, including women who described all manner of bullying, and professional and sexual misconduct, painted a very different picture.In Friday’s high court ruling, the judge who presided over the case, Mrs Justice Steyn,came down clearly in favour of Clarke’s accusers. The Guardian ran two defences: that the articles about Clarke’s sexual misconduct were true, and that their publication was in the public interest. Steyn found overwhelmingly in favour of the Guardian on both counts.In contrast, she found Clarke was “not a credible or reliable witness”, concluding that he was “untruthful about most of the allegations, in his efforts to salvage his career”.Clarke’s claims of conspiracyIn his legal action over theGuardian’s articlesaccusing him of sexual misconduct, the former Doctor Who actor decried a “blanket [modern] lens” being cast on past actions. Dance moves at the Notting Hill carnival would be considered “assault” in other cultures, he said, and anyone his age who went to university would know that “uni lads and things, people get crazy and the things that happened back in those days would not be acceptable now”.It was a theme echoed by Philip Williams inclosing submissions, in which Clarke’s barrister highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate” as he said Clarke had been a victim of “historical revisionism”.But inappropriate sexual comments – or “banter” as Clarke sometimes referred to them – was just one of the accusations he faced in the Guardian’s reporting and defence of the case. Others included bullying, taking and sharing explicit videos and photographs without consent and unwanted sexual contact.Attempting to rebut the accusations, Clarke, the first witness on the stand, ran a variety of arguments, which included flat denial that most events ever took place and that his female accusers hadconsensually participated in and/or initiated behaviourhe was being blamed for.Clarke also alleged a conspiracy between people who had grudges against him, who had either collaborated with the Guardian’s journalists or duped them, saying his nine-year-old son had made “a little chart” showing the connections between his accusers.In her judgment, Steyn unequivocally dismissed such claims. She found the evidence of sexual misconduct made by the women who gave evidence in court – and even one who was unable to – to be true. Clarke’s conspiracy claim, the judge concluded, was “born of necessity, in the face of the large body of witnesses giving evidence against him”. The notion that Guardian journalists had engaged in a conspiracy, she ruled, was “unfounded and meritless”.View image in fullscreenClarke on the set of Adulthood, part of the Kidulthood trilogy, in 2008.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyDuring his testimony, he at times laughed off accusations but also wept and showed flashes of anger towards the Guardian for having “smashed my life”. He appeared ruffled when he noticed that one of his accusers, the Gangs of London actor Jing Lusi, was watching him give evidence, and questioned whether it was allowed (it was).Clarke spent more than three-and-a-half days in the witness box, longer than all of the other witnesses his legal team called on his behalf combined. This was partly because they were mostly character witnesses who could not directly contradict the accusations against him.The most notable exception was the testimony of the actor Louise Dylan, who said that an allegation that Clarke had groped her at a wrap partywas untrue. The allegation, by Clarke’s former creative partner Davie Fairbanks, had never been reported by the Guardian in any of the published articles. It was brought into the libel claim by the Guardian’s inclusion of it in its amended defence as an example of behaviour by Clarke that supported the meaning of the articles.The judge accepted that Clarke did not grope Dylan, but found Fairbanks to be a credible witness who honestly believed the incident that he recounted, but initially misdescribed the location of the incident.Other witnesses called by Clarke’s legal team were limited to attesting that they had never personally seen him engage in inappropriate behaviour or, following in the footsteps of his evidence, casting aspersions on the character of his accusers.His wife, Iris,claimed that Gina Powell, a film producer and documentary maker who worked for her husband from 2014 to 2017, was a liar who was “infatuated by him”. She said of Fairbanks: “Not that I have anything against it, but he smokes a lot of weed. He is self-destructive.” She was unrestrained in her anger at his accusers and the Guardian, sarcastically referring to its staff in court as “our lovely people in the back there”.Philip Dore, a childhood friend of Clarke who worked for his production company Unstoppable from 2014 to 2015,told the court he saw Powell “grope”Clarke, who wrote and produced the Kidulthood trilogy, at a film premiere. Gavin Millar KC, representing the Guardian, challenged the use of the word “grope” in light of Dore describing it variously as “friendly” and Powell “having playfully touched his arse” but the witness insisted it was accurate.Clarke’s eight witnesses (excluding himself) were done and dusted within two-and-a-half days. Another six who were anticipated to give oral evidence did not do so. One of them was Arnold Oceng, who appeared in Clarke’s films Brotherhood and Adulthood. When he could not be traced, a witness summons was issued and Steyn warned that he could face contempt of court proceedings if he did not show, but to no avail.3:35Noel Clarke loses libel case against Guardian over sexual misconduct investigation – video‘Shock and shame’: the testimony of the womenThe trial then moved on to the Guardian’s two defences: that the allegations in the articles were true and that they were in the public interest.The 29 “truth” witnesses included 21 key witnesses who said they had experienced misconduct by Clarke themselves or directly witnessed it. They were mostly women, some of whom were granted anonymity and two of whom – Powell and Naome Morris – gave evidence from behind a screen.Much of the evidence spoke to the specific allegations contained in the Guardian’s reporting but there were also accusations never previously published.One of the witnesses, Imogen*,said she was a “wide-eyed” 20-year-old actorand huge Doctor Who fan when she met a “sexually threatening” Clarke for dinner at Soho House in central London in July 2014. She said she told Clarke she was 17 in the hope it would deter him from talking about sex. It did not work; he suggested they go to his flat to have sex and that he could take photos of it.Also not previously published was the allegation by Penelope* thatClarke got an erection when filming a sex scenewith her and touched her with his penis at the entry to her vagina. In her witness statement, she said: “When he first took down his trousers and pants, I felt his penis land on my pubic area. I tried to move myself up in the bed slightly so there would be distance between our genitals, but then his penis was touching me in between my legs right at the entry of my vagina.“He was so close that I recall being worried in case he moved in further or ejaculated.”View image in fullscreenClarke at the Baftas in 2017.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PASome witnesses were asked by Philip Williams, representing Clarke, why they had not told anyone about their allegations when they happened. Penelope said it was becauseshe felt “shock and shame”.Williams also questioned several women about why they would not just leave situations they were uncomfortable with, whether filming sex scenes or being propositioned in a restaurant, and why in some cases they kept working with Clarke or stayed in contact with him afterwards.In response, they pointed to the sexual politics of the industry and the importance, as women, of not making enemies.Powell, who faced questioning from Williams about her sexual history and experience, and J​ohannah Whyte, an actor and digital content creator, whose stage name is Jahannah James​, bothclaimed Clarke kept naked photos of women he had sex with as “collateral”in case they ever wanted to speak out about him or tell his wife.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Williams asked her why she did not email Clarke afterwards to say that he had gone too far, Powell said she was in shock. “It felt like I was trying to leave an abusive relationship,” she said.Powell, Whyte and Lusi all told the court that Clarke used the example ofAdam Deacon, his former mentee, who was convicted in 2015 of harassing Clarke, as a cautionary tale of what happened to those who crossed him.Imogen said: “It was pre-#MeToo. It was pre women standing up for themselves. I have never seen a woman stand up for themselves and it go successfully. At the end of the day, the industry is so fickle, it can turn in an instant. There is an element where everybody is scared of stuff like this and [that’s] why I had never spoke up about it. I was not in the Guardian article, I chickened out, I was too frightened.”It emerged that Imogen had been sent a legal letter by solicitors for Clarke last year, only two months before the pre-trial hearings were due to begin, which Millar saidthreatened her with prosecutionfor circulating allegations about him.Millar argued it was “witness intimidation” but this was denied by Clarke, who said he was just trying to get her to switch sides. “It is not uncommon for people to play for one football team and then play for another football team,” he said. “It happens. You get transferred and that was the intention.”Fairbanks provided the most dramatic moment of the trial. Hesaid he had found a cache of 15 pictures of Ivy* on his hard drivethat, he claimed, Clarke had sent him. Ivy told the court she had never seen the images previously and believed they were taken without consent. The judge found that Ivy’s answer was an honest one but that she probably knew and consented to Clarke taking those photographs.Williams described it as an “ambush” and accused Fairbanks of seeking to pervert the course of justice.When Clarke was recalled to address this specific issue he denied sending the photos to Fairbanks, whom he accused of stealing them. Clarke said the photos were consensual, he took them for “aesthetic” reasons and eventually would have deleted them if they had not been stolen by Fairbanks.During testy exchanges with Millar, Clarke initially said Fairbanks had “all levels of access [to his devices]”, sometimes posting on Twitter, now X, for him, but when Millar asked if this was appropriate given that he stored naked pictures on his laptop in a folder that was not password-protected, Clarke said Fairbanks only had access for “emergencies”.While cross-examining Fairbanks, Williams initially suggested he had stolen the photos with the idea of weaponising them. But given they had still been friends when they were allegedly stolen, Clarke said Fairbanks had initially taken them “for his own sexual and perverse gratification” and only after they fell out decided to retain them for use against him.The Guardian in the spotlightAfter Clarke’s second time on the stand, it was the turn of the Guardian’s journalists, including Lucy Osborne and Sirin Kale, who wrote the story together, the Guardian’s head of investigations, Paul Lewis, who oversaw it, and the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, who ultimately signed off on it. The deputy editor, Owen Gibson, and the head of audio, Nicole Jackson, also gave evidence.View image in fullscreenSirin Kale (left) and Lucy Osborne.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThey faced questions about the deletion of Signal messages journalists had exchanged relating to the investigation, which had already formed the basis of anunsuccessful attempt to strike outthe Guardian’s defence before trial.Dismissing that application, Steyn had found that the claim made by Williams that, in deleting the messages, the Guardian had fabricated evidence and perverted the course of justice was “a grave allegation [that] should not have been made and publicly aired without foundation”.She found the deletions were in accordance with the Guardian’s data minimisation policy, but that did not stop Williams revisiting the issue during the trial, accusing Lewis of trying to “hide the evidence”.Lewis responded that the messages in question were “micro-level chats, informal chats” between journalists which were never customarily retained, unlike other documents that were material to the investigation.Williams also questioned the credibility of the sources for the Guardian’s reporting, including through the lens of race.Clarke’s barrister suggested to Kale that she was assigned to the story because she was a woman of colour and said that none of the defence witnesses who gave evidence in court were black.Kale replied that some of the journalistic sources were black women and women of colour but some “felt it was more difficult to speak publicly about such matters, given that Mr Clarke was also a very successful black man”.Williams asked Osborne if she was aware that Ieva Sabliauskaite, who alleged that Clarke took a picture of her underwear while she was dancing and attempted to show it to their colleagues, was wearing a mini-dress at the time.Osborne replied: “Sorry, but I do not think it makes any difference whether she was wearing a short skirt or not.”Similarly, he said Osborne should have taken account of the fact that Sabliauskaite was “heavily intoxicated”, to which the journalist replied: “I do not think it matters either way if she was drunk or not drunk. He took a photograph, according to the allegation, and then showed it to people the next day.”In his closing submissions, for the fifth time in the trial, Williams reached for his favourite analogy: that the Guardian’s story had “more holes than a colander” and went so far as to describe its journalists as “rogue”.Millar said the idea that the truth witnesses “were all doing a thing as serious as lying to the high court … is frankly inconceivable”.Steyn agreed with that assessment. “Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses – none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come to court to lie is inherently implausible,” she said.*Not their real namesExplore more on these topicsThe GuardianNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Here are the key issues:1.Were the allegations true?The courtfound in the Guardian’s favouron both its defences: that the articles it published on sexual misconduct allegations against Noel Clarke were true or substantially true; and that publication of the articles was in the public interest.It said that Clarke was, overall, “not a credible or reliable witness”.Regardingthe first articlepublished by the Guardian, Steyn said: “There are strong grounds to believe that the claimant is a serial abuser of women, that he has, over 15 years, used his power to prey on and harass and sometimes bully female colleagues, that he has engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments, and professional misconduct, taking and sharing explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.”She said: “The meanings of all eight articles were found to be substantially true. The Guardian established that the truth defence applied and so the libel claim fell to be dismissed.2.Was there a public interest in publishing the allegations?The court focused on the first article on the basis that if the public interest defence succeeded in respect of that, it should succeed on the subsequent articles.The Guardian mounted a public interest defence principally on the grounds that a successful man in the film and television industry had used his power and status to subject women to sexual harassment and abuse, unwanted sexual contact, mistreatment and bullying over many years. It also said the industry had failed to protect female workers.The court found that Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, “honestly believed publication was in the public interest. If it were necessary to look beyond her belief, the other editors and the reporters all believed publication was in the public interest, too”.Viner told the court that “sexual harassment is an important subject for the Guardian to report on”. The first article “told a story of the specific ways in which imbalances of power and influence were serially abused”, she said, and there was “a very clear public interest in exposing allegations of misconduct” in the context of Clarke having recently been given a prestigious award by Bafta.The court concluded that Viner had “given compelling and unchallenged evidence that she believed, and continues to believe, that it was in the public interest to publish”.Steyn said the Guardian “succeeded in establishing that the first article was published on a matter of public interest. Ms Viner made the decision to publish and she honestly believed (along with all of the Guardian’s editorial witnesses, as well as the reporters) that publication was in the public interest … That belief was undoubtedly reasonable.”3:35Noel Clarke loses libel case against Guardian over sexual misconduct investigation – video3.The allegationsSteyn said the question was whether there were strong grounds to believe that, over 15 years, Clarke had used his power to prey on and harass female colleagues, had sometimes bullied female colleagues, had engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping, engaged in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments, had engaged in professional misconduct, and had taken and shared explicit pictures and videos without consent.She said that “instances of each of those elements have been established” and this is “more than sufficient to find that the meaning of the first article is substantially true”.The judge said: “The strong impression that I gained is that Mr Clarke felt that he could sexually proposition any woman he wanted, as reflected in his evidence that he has ‘been turned down a million times’, even allowing for the obvious hyperbole – regardless of the circumstances.“He had no understanding of how pressuring such conduct could be, or how uncomfortable it could make young women, in subordinate roles to him, feel while performing their jobs.”Steyn also found that Clarke “covertly filmed the naked auditions” of two women and showed the footage to a colleague. “It is probable that Mr Clarke also recorded, or sought to record, footage of at least one of the other actors who attended the final audition.“Mr Clarke did so knowing that the actors had been firmly assured that their naked auditions would not be recorded.”She continued that the “inevitable inference” was that Clarke “acted in this way for his own sexual gratification”.4.The witnessesThe court heard oral evidence from Clarke plus eight witnesses called on his behalf. Written statements were submitted from six further witnesses.For the Guardian, the court heard oral evidence relating to the truth defence from 26 witnesses and considered witness statements from three others, plus six Guardian journalists who gave evidence relating to the public interest defence.A striking feature of Clarke’s case was that he alleged that “almost all of the Guardian’s 29 witnesses to the truth defence are lying, at least in part, in the evidence they have given to the court”.His claim that there was a conspiracy against him “lacked any proper foundation”.The court found that although there were connections among the Guardian’s witnesses to the defence of truth, many came forward independently after the first article was published or had no involvement until they were asked to give evidence.“There has been no conspiracy to lie. In the absence of a conspiracy, Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses – none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come to court to lie is inherently implausible.”5.Noel ClarkeThe court considered that “overall, Mr Clarke was not a credible or reliable witness”.Steyn said his case had been “almost entirely one of robust denial and counter-allegations”. The judgment said Clarke had a “very clear motive to lie. He says the Guardian’s publications have been career-ending and he values success in the claim in excess of £70m …“It is obvious that the first article had a hugely damaging impact on his reputation, his career and his finances. He has sued the Guardian for libel, involving both parties in a long, complex and expensive trial, to try to repair that damage.”However, Steyn added: “One aspect of Mr Clarke’s evidence that I accept is his belief that he is not what the Guardian ‘branded’ him. Although I find that he has been untruthful about most of the allegations, in his efforts to salvage his career, his initial response that ‘some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise’ was true.“Even when his actions have been calculated and deliberate, Mr Clarke has tended to be oblivious to their impact, regarding his own behaviour as merely being ‘naughty’, ‘cheeky’, ‘teasing’ or within his rights as a director or producer. In addition, he does not see himself as reflected in the articles because there is a kinder, more generous side to him. But that does not detract from the conclusions I have reached.”6.The Guardian’s journalistsThe court heard oral evidence in support of the public interest defence from six witnesses called by the Guardian: Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief; Owen Gibson, the deputy editor; Paul Lewis, the head of investigations; Nicole Jackson, the head of audio, and Lucy Osborne and Sirin Kale, the main reporters.Steyn said she agreed with Viner’s evidence that “the factual accounts of the Guardian’s sources are presented in ‘a measured and accurate way’, without being ‘exaggerated or sensationalised’”.Gibson “gave unchallenged and obviously honest and reliable evidence regarding the investigation, the decision-making process, and his belief that publication of the first article was in the public interest”.Regarding Lewis, Osborne and Kale, Steyn said each gave “honest and reliable evidence”.Osborne and Kale were each accused in cross-examination of having “an agenda”, seemingly to “get Noel Clarke”. Steyn said: “That allegation has no foundation, and is demonstrably disproved by the materials before me which show the extensive efforts they made to investigate, test and corroborate the information they received, and not to publish allegations which they could not substantiate.”Osborne and Kale exercised “critical reasoning”, and tested and investigated the information they received, the judgment says.The claimant made the “wild and wholly unfounded allegation” that Lewis was a “rogue journalist with his own agenda”. He was accused of lying and being evasive.Steyn said of Lewis: “I found him to be an honest and reliable witness. Across the two days that he gave evidence, his conscientiousness, professionalism, integrity and desire to assist the court shone through. I have no hesitation in finding that he, too, honestly believed that publication of the first article was in the public interest.”7.The court’s conclusion“The Guardian has succeeded in establishing both truth and public interest defences to the libel claim. In addition, in respect of the second to eighth articles, the serious harmrequirement was not met. The data protection claim was withdrawn. Accordingly, Mr Clarke’s libel and data protection claims against the Guardian are dismissed.”Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianNoel ClarkeNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNational newspaperskey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Slogans. Culture reviews. Even a new standards body. The pipeline of toxic behaviour haunting Britain’s television industry in recent years has led to numerous attempts to end the grim assumption among its workers that little can be done to challenge the inappropriate actions of powerful figures.Recent initiatives have shown signs of reducing bad behaviour. However, in an industry that still talks about “above the line” talent – referring to the leading creative figures and cast in a show – many working in the production world fear it still suffers from a power imbalance that fosters unacceptable treatment and deters whistleblowing.“We’re an industry that’s supposed to be progressive and groundbreaking, but has embedded itself in some of the worst habits of Hollywood,” said one experienced, female executive producer. “For the amount of money and profile it generates for the country, it is a very badly safeguarded industry.”The high-profile cases, including allegations againstNoel ClarkeandGregg Wallace, have spurred action, most notably with theBBC’s culture reviewpublished earlier this year and the industry’s creation of an independent standards body.The Guardian hassuccessfully defended a libel action brought by Clarkeover its investigation revealing claims of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women. A report on Wallace’s behaviour substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact.3:35Noel Clarke loses libel case against Guardian over sexual misconduct investigation – videoBig independent production companies and broadcasters have embraced support hotlines and some now have independent whistleblowing services available during shoots.Yet it is a mark of the problem the industry faces that while such initiatives appear to have helped cut the proportion of industry workers who say they have been subjected to bullying, harassment or discrimination over the past 12 months, the figurestill stood at 41% last year, according to the Film and TV Charity.New data from the broadcasting union Bectu has found 74% of those it surveyed said behaviour that would be unacceptable elsewhere is tolerated in TV.What really worries senior industry figures is that among those who had experienced toxic behaviour, more than half did not report it.“What you invariably find with high-profile cases is that there’ll be one or two people that journalists pick up on, which opens the floodgates,” said Marcus Ryder, the chief executive of the Film and TV Charity. “What that tells me is that there is a pent-up level of abuse, which is just not being heard or addressed.“We’re not finding it’s about one rogue bad apple, or power going to the head of one celebrity or one presenter. This is an industry that has got a systemic problem, which it needs to address. The good news is that it does look like it’s addressing it, because the numbers are going down. But the bar was so high to start off with.”Many blame the structure of the industry, which is populated by powerful executives and on-screen personalities alongside freelance workers with precarious job security,exacerbated by the retraction in production.“Freelancers really still do find it difficult to report inappropriate behaviour,” said one female producer. “You may be able to report it more easily. Unfortunately, because the industry is in crisis with award-winning people not getting jobs, to be associated with anything that might rock the boat makes it difficult. Sticking out of the pack is not seen as a good thing.”At the Edinburgh TV festival this week, Kate Phillips, the BBC’s chief content officer and perhaps the most important commissioner in British television, was among those to make clear that no one’s inappropriate behaviour should be tolerated, whatever their position.The BBC has also launched its Call It Out campaign, designed to highlight attempts to improve its culture. Branded mugs, lanyards and pin badges bearing the slogan are already circulating around its offices across the UK.View image in fullscreenKate Phillips, the BBC’s head of content, says she has a zero-tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe sector has also backed thenew Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority(CIISA), developed as the sector’s main antidote to the problem after the allegations against Clarke.The sentiment is sincere, but industry workers remain doubtful. “The problem now is that people are so petrified about the lack of job security, they’re just so unlikely ever to call somebody out – particularly with an artist, because the artist might say ‘it’s them or me’,” said Jonathan Glazier, a television consultant and experienced executive producer.“The large, global [production companies] might take a view that nobody’s bigger than the show. But I think when you get to the sort of indies who are producing mid-range entertainment and have two or three commissions a year, to jeopardise that by ejecting an artist through inappropriate behaviour is pretty difficult.”UK financial watchdog expands bullying rules to 37,000 City firmsRead moreSome freelance workers said when they had reported inappropriate incidents, nothing had happened. Several emphasised the importance of an independent reporting system.That could come in the form of CIISA. However, some worry about the level of financial commitment to the body from some broadcasters. It relies on funding from the industry and its biggest players. It also has to cover a vast swathe of the creative industry, from television to music – and will have to carry out its work without any legal powers.A freelance champion promised by the government could also help keep up pressure on the issue, while ministers have pledged to support CIISA in its work.Despite some pessimism among a weary workforce, Ryder chooses to be optimistic that a cultural shift across the production world is possible. “This is a market failure,” he said. “Every sector has market failures that need to be addressed. We should be optimistic that this can be addressed.”Explore more on these topicsBBCTelevisionNoel ClarkeGregg WallaceBullyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay – even by days – will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.“If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”Charts showing food insecurity in the Gaza Strip by governorateThe IPCwarned in Julythat a “famine scenario” was unfolding in parts of Gaza but until now it had stopped short of making a formal declaration, citing a lack of hard data.In addition to a famine in and around Gaza City, the biggest built-up area of the territory and home to between 500,000 and 800,000 people, the report declares that the towns of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis in the centre and south of Gaza are likely to experience famine “in coming weeks”.The experts say the data is insufficient to declare a famine in the north of the territory, though aid officials say the conditions there are thought to be the most severe and have called for urgent steps to allow for a full humanitarian assessment.1:03UN agency says Gaza famine is direct result of Israel’s actions – videoIbtisam Saleh, 50, who lives in Gaza City, said she and her 29-year-old son had been eating one meal a day for weeks, and many times they had nothing at all. “I cook only lentils, nothing else is available to us,” she told the Guardian. “Yesterday a donor gave us a small bag of rice. As for food kitchens, I cannot eat their food, it makes my stomach hurt if I taste it. And I do not have the strength to stand in line waiting to get my share.”In order to declare a famine, strict criteria must be met: at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and two people for every 10,000 die each day due to “outright starvation”.The declaration of famine in Gaza will increase pressure onIsraelto ease the tight restrictions it has maintained on supplies since the beginning of the 22-month-old conflict.David Lammy, Britain’s foreign secretary, condemned the famine as a “moral outrage”. “The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable,” he said in a statement. “The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe.”Amjad Shawa, the director of the Gaza NGOs Network, who is based in Gaza City, said: “This is the worst, the most critical stage in the entire history of Gaza, not just in this war. We are in a very complicated situation. We feel very sick and very tired. We must get food otherwise we cannot imagine what will happen.”Israel rejected the findings the report, claiming there was no famine in Gaza and that the findings were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israeli forces will launch a massive new assault on Gaza City within weeks. Aid officials said any further offensives in Gaza would have catastrophic consequences for the population.View image in fullscreenAid packages descend with parachutes on Deir al-Balah on Friday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israel-backed organisation that was supposed to replace aid groups that previously distributed food to much of the population in Gaza, is failing to distribute sufficient food.The UN and other organisations face massive logistical obstacles including widespread looting due to an almost total breakdown of the rule of law, ongoing Israeli combat operations, Israel’s administrative restrictions and bureaucracy and damaged infrastructure within Gaza.Riham Kraiem, 35, who is living in a tent in Gaza City, said her eldest son, 13, had travelled to the aid distribution areas in the north of Gaza, risking his life in largely fruitless efforts to bring food for the family of 10. “My children’s health … is now very poor,” she said. “There’s nothing nutritious for them to eat. I can’t provide proper food to support their bodies. My four-year-old daughter’s condition is deteriorating, she is suffering from malnutrition and is sick because of it.“I have no food supplies left. We left some behind in our home when we fled and the house was destroyed. Yesterday my son went again to look for aid and got one kilogram of pasta and a can of tomato sauce. He didn’t get it from the aid distribution, a young man there gave it to him. He came back feeling like he was flying from happiness.”Chart showing numbers of arrived and intercepted aid truck deliveries to Gaza by the UN and partners since 19 May 2025The IPC report expresses grave concern at the continued and large-scale killing of civilians while trying to access food deliveries and the inadequate planning, implementation and monitoring of the privatised food distributions conducted by the GHF.It calls for “urgent, comprehensive and sustained action to end the swiftly deteriorating and ever-expanding humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip”.According to figures from Gaza’s health ministry, verified by the World Health Organization, deaths from malnutrition and starvation in Gaza have risen sharply. In the 22 months after the 7 October attacks by Hamas, 89 deaths were attributed to malnutrition or starvation, mostly children under 18. In the first 20 days of August there were 133 deaths, including 25 under-18s, the ministry said on Wednesday.Israel disputes the hunger fatality figures given by the health ministry of Gaza’s Hamas-run government, arguing that the deaths were due to other medical causes.Israeli officials said more than220 aid trucksentered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaFaminenewsShareReuse this content"

The materials comprise redacted transcripts for both days, along with multiple audio recordings – seven separate parts plus test recordings for day one, and four parts plus test recordings for day two.Justice department releases transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell interview with deputy attorney general – liveRead moreThe Department of Justice gave Maxwell limited immunity to allow her to talk about her criminal case, butdid not promise anythingin exchange for her testimony, according to the transcript that was released.“The most important part of this agreement is that this isn’t a cooperation agreement, meaning that by you meeting with us today, we’re really just meeting,” Blanche told Maxwell. He added: “I’m not promising to do anything.”Maxwell, 63, was Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime associate and was convicted on five counts, including sex trafficking of minors, and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.Epstein died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Maxwell, in the released transcript, said she never saw Trump do anything inappropriate and she repeatedly showered Trump with praise. That sort of comment would have been welcomed by Trump and his circle who have been keen to dismiss concerns about this relationship with Epstein which have roiled his support base.“I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell said.But she did detail the social relationship between Trump and Epstein, who cultivated a wide and powerful social circle for many years.“I don’t know how they met, and I don’t know how they became friends. I certainly saw them together and I remember the few times I observed them together, but they were friendly. I mean, they seemed friendly,” she said.She added: “I think they were friendly like people are in social settings. I don’t … I don’t think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the president in any of … I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance,” she said.The justice department lawyers also questioned Maxwell extensively about Epstein’s relationship with former president Bill Clinton, who travelled multiple times on Epstein’s plane and – like Trump – has denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of wrongdoing.“President Clinton liked me, and we got along terribly well. But I never saw that warmth or that … that warmth, or however you want to characterize it, with Mr Epstein,” she said of Clinton’s contacts with Epstein.Maxwell also said she did not remember Trump having been in Epstein’s 50th birthday book, which she assembled.The Wall Street Journal reported in July that the book’s collection of letters included one with Trump’s name on it. The president has repeatedly denied writing the note and filed a lawsuit accusing the Journal of libel.Maxwell said she saw some parts of the birthday book before her trial, during its discovery phase.“There was nothing from President Trump,” Maxwell said.She also denied remembering any picture of a naked woman, a detail the Journal previously reported.Maxwell said Epstein did not know what to do to celebrate his 50th, and she suggested a birthday book like “my mom did … for my dad”.She added: “He said, I love that idea.”After her interview with justice department lawyers, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida, where she had been serving a 20-year sentence, to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas.Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons has explained the reason for the move which caused a storm of criticism and raised eyebrows as to whether Maxwell get some sort of deal for her cooperation.One legal expertsaid that the releaseof the transcript was Trump “getting what he wants” from the interview in the latest effort to calm the political storms around his links to Epstein that have dogged him for weeks.“From what we see from this transcript, Trump is getting what he wants. She is saying that Trump didn’t do anything untoward, nothing criminal. That’s what Trump wants. Ideally, he’d also like names of Democrats who did do something wrong, because that’s what the Maga base has been promised,” Dave Aronberg, former Democratic state attorney for Palm Beach county,told CNN.The House oversight committee has received the first round of Epstein documents from the justice department, which includes 33,000 pages of documents, according to panel staff.“The committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for the committee chair, James Comer, said. “The committee will also consult with the [justice department] to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations.”The committee subpoenaed files related to Epstein following a public outcry over the administration’s handling of its promises to release more information related to Epstein’s conduct and death.House Democrats seized on the issue and helped push Comer to subpoena the justice department for documents.“The Trump DoJ is providing records at a far quicker pace than anything” than it did during Joe Biden’s presidency, the committee spokesperson continued.Explore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellTrump administrationJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bolton’s wife Gretchen was seen leaving their home while agents were present.Bolton, also formerly a US ambassador to the United Nations, fell out with Donald Trump during his first administration and was ousted from the post of national security adviser in 2019. He wrote a political memoir that prompted an investigation anda government lawsuitover whether he had misused classified information, but those actions ultimately went nowhere.Bolton and Trump have maintained a political feud ever since.On Friday morning, Trump talked to reporters and said: “I’m not a fan ofJohn Bolton. He’s a real sort of a lowlife. He’s not a smart guy. But he could be very unpatriotic. I’m going to find out.”The president added that he did not know the raid was planned and that he expected to be briefed by the justice department later. “I tell the group I don’t want to know, but just you have to do what you have to do. I don’t want to know about it,” Trump said.JD Vance, the US vice-president, reposted Patel’s message, as did Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI. Bonginoadded: “Public corruption will not be tolerated.”Chiming with the cryptic style of such comments, the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, later posted: “America’s safety isn’t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”No details have been released of any specific allegations underlying the federal court warrant that would have been needed to conduct such a search.The raid began at about 7am ET and wasfirst reportedby the New York Post. At that time Bolton, when reached by CNN, said he was not aware of the law enforcement activity, but he did not issue further comment or a statement.View image in fullscreenThe then national security adviser, John Bolton, listens as Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting in April 2018.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APBolton served as national security adviser – Trump’s third – for 17 months and clashed with him over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. The administration thenunsuccessfully sought to blockthe publication of his memoir.After a judge ruled, in June 2020, that the book could be published, Trump said Bolton “must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him”.Bolton was not detained or charged with any crimes during the raid.On his first day back in office this year, Trump revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was alsoamong a trioof former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier this year.Bolton’s bookThe Room Where It Happeneddetailed his time as national security adviser. He detailed what he described as impeachable conduct and accused Trump of asking China to help secure his re-election. Bolton depicted a president ignorant of basic geopolitical realities, including not understanding that Finland was an independent country. The book became a bestseller despite Trump’s attempts to ban its publication.In recent days, Bolton has been critical of Trump’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war. After a Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska failed to yield progress on ending the war, Boltonwrote on social media: “It’s clear that Putin got to Trump, most likely convincing him away from Zelensky non-negotiables like security guarantees.”On Thursday he criticized Trump again,writing: “Putin’s KGB training and flattery campaign is working Trump over.”Meghan Hays, a former White House special adviser to Joe Biden, told CNN in an interview that the raid “seems extremely political, extremely petty”, and that it smacked of “pure revenge” on the part of Trump and was a “poor use of FBI resources”.Roger Stone, a longtime political operative who was prosecuted during the Russia investigation and later pardoned by Trump,postedon social media: “Good morning. John Bolton. How does it feel to have your home raided at 6 o’clock in the morning?”Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat representing Illinois, said in an interview on CNN that he thought the Bolton raid was designed as a distraction from the simmering saga of files from the federal investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who moved in high-level, bipartisan political circles.Krishnamoorthi sits on the House oversight committee, which was due on Friday to receive hundreds of documents about Epstein from the justice departmentas a resultof a subpoena.Early on Friday afternoon, the FBI were still at Bolton’s house on a residential Bethesda street.

They went to another leisure facility inFrancewith no incident, the statement said. The manager denied any wrongdoing, it added.“A line was crossed. We are appalled,” said Perla Danan, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions in the Languedoc-Roussillon region.“It started with graffiti, insults and physical attacks and now it’s literally a ban on children aged eight to 16,” Danan said, adding that it reminded her of the “no Jews or dogs allowed” sign during the Holocaust. “France’s values have been violated,” she said.Jean-Philippe Augé, the mayor of Porté-Puymorens, which has about 100 residents, said “the DNA of our community is based on a sense of sharing and fraternity”. He added that the incident had caused “utter astonishment” in the village.The Jewish Observatory of France also expressed “deep outrage” in a statement on Friday. “Such an act of discrimination, targeting minors exclusively on the basis of their nationality and origin, is extremely serious and undermines the fundamental principles of the republic.”Discrimination based on religion is an offence punishable by up to three years in prison in France.There was a sharp increase in antisemitic incidents reported in 2023 after the 7 October Hamas attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. These included physical assaults, threats, vandalism and harassment, prompting alarm among Jewish communities and leaders.This monthEmmanuel Macron promised to punish an act of “antisemitic hatred”after the felling of an olive tree planted in memory of a young French Jewish man who was tortured to death in 2006.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeIsraelAntisemitismJudaismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

The host nation more than lived up to their hype as they kicked off their campaign in front of a record crowd for an opening game at a women’s World Cup with a hugely dominant display against the USA which has underlined their ambitions for the World Cup crown.The prop Hannah Botterman and the centre Megan Jones were standouts in a good team display and the scary thought for their future opponents is that the performance was far from England’s best.England get the party started on a night that shows just how big this World Cup could be | Andy BullRead moreHandling errors were at the heart of the sloppy areas for the Red Roses but the hosts were commanding at scrum time which got them out of jail on a few occasions. When their attack did click nothing could stop them, the best try of the 11 coming with Botterman’s clever line run in the first half.But before a ball was thrown, the city of Sunderland had been buzzing all day in the buildup.Heading to the stadium there were USA fans in hot dog outfits, while England supporters donned scarves and cowboy hats. The hats are becoming synonymous with the Red Roses thanks to Ellie Kildunne and Jones’s try celebration which the 42,723 fans had to wait until the 35th minute to see, as Kildunne scored her first try.There was a showbiz start with the opening ceremony including pop star Anne-Marie but it was clear who the rugby superstar was with a huge cheer for Ilona Maher, the USA outside centre and the most followed rugby player on social media, when the teams were announced but England’s Kildunne also registered deafening applause.View image in fullscreenIlona Maher (centre) and her teammates cheer after the United States national anthem.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was a cagey opening few minutes with both teams’ first attacks thwarted. England found their opportunity through a scrum penalty with the first set-piece punch thrown by the hosts and a simple catch and drive was executed to make the openside flanker Sadia Kabeya the first try-scorer of this World Cup.The next try was a piece of rugby brilliance. Jones picked a cross-field kick which Abby Dow managed to recover and recycle, Botterman ran an expert line to splice the defence open and the huge roar from the prop which followed showed what it meant. With England in the driving seat every small win the USA gained, if it was disrupting a lineout or winning a breakdown penalty, they celebrated wildly.Maher had said in a pre-match conference that the USA can be their “own worst enemies” at times and that was definitely the case in this Pool A match. Miscommunication between USA captain Kate Zackary and the wing Bulou Mataitoga led to a sure try being fumbled but a piece of individual skill by Erica Jarrell shortly after put the USA on the board. The fly-half McKenzie Hawkins’ conversion counted but she cut it close, with the hooter from the countdown sounding just after her kick attempt. The USA then took another hit with Alev Kelter sent to the sin-bin for cynical play.View image in fullscreenEllie Kildunne celebrates with Abby Dow after scoring England’s fourth try in their 69-7 mauling of USA.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/World Rugby/Getty ImagesEngland took advantage of being a player up after Maud Muir powered over the line despite resolute defence from the USA.The stadium came to life next with supporters on their feet as Dow broke down the right before feeding back inside to Kildunne.

Very aptly the song to play in celebration was I Just Can’t Get Enough by Depeche Mode and the Red Roses couldn’t with the wing Jess Breach next over.England to ring changes and ‘get everyone started,’ says coachRead moreEngland continued to be relentless with replacement hooker Lark Atkin-Davies over and then Emily Scarratt entered the pitch for her fifth Rugby World Cup, becoming the first England player to reach that many.Scarratt, who won the World Cup in 2014 and made her first appearance at the tournament in the home 2010 competition, took over kicking duties after replacing Zoe Harrison but missed her kick when Breach crashed over for her second try. The scoring was rounded off by Atkin-Davies to complete the Red Roses’ 28th consecutive win.The Red Roses machine is moving and it looks deadly in their pursuit of the trophy they haven’t won since 2014.

Of them, 8,900 were marked as killed, or probably killed, a joint investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand the Hebrew-language outletLocal Callhas found.That is less than one in five of the total, and far below figures given publicly by politicians and military commanders, who have given tolls more than double that number, varying between 17,000 and 20,000 for the same period.An intelligence team reviewing militant casualties concluded that the database probably undercounted the total “by a little” but the significantly higher figures given publicly were “inaccurate”, several intelligence sources said.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of an Israeli strike on Deir al-Balah. The overwhelming majority of deaths and injuries in the Gaza war have been civilians.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAKilling a significant proportion of enemy soldiers is not always a military objective in war or a precondition for victory. But in the absence of a long-term strategy, Israel’s military chose to make the militant toll a metric of their success.Soon after the start of the war, Yossi Sariel, then the head of the elite 8200 intelligence unit, began sending a daily update on the toll in the form of a data graph, which was dubbed the “war dashboard”, several intelligence sources told the Guardian.The display was treated like “a football game, officers sitting around watching the numbers go up on the dashboard,” one source said.Sariel and other senior commanders presented the deaths ofHamasfighters as an objective in itself, sources said. There was no discussion of how Gaza would be controlled or governed if Hamas collapsed, or what concessions Israel might try to force through the mass killing of individual fighters.“We had a beautiful, interactive dashboard, but we didn’t understand the goals of the war,” one of Sariel’s subordinates said. “It was very frustrating, the flattening of things into numbers.” Asked about his focus on the number of militant casualties, Sariel declined to comment.Several sources said that inflating militant death tolls, figures frequently reported and amplified by the Israeli media, was seen by some in the military as a way to restore their standing in the eyes of the Israeli public after the failures of 7 October 2023.But from a strategic perspective that attempt to measure military progress through a militant body count, amid an extremely high rate of civilian killing, was tactically unsound and self-defeating, a senior western military source said.“They are just measuring the wrong statistic. They will never be able to kill everybody who is associated with Hamas, so what is the definition of victory?”For nearly two years, Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israeli forces are inGazato “destroy Hamas”, an objective so vague it could be pursued almost indefinitely.The military capacities that allowed the group to massacre 1,200 people in Israel in 2023 have been destroyed. All bar one of the leadership group who planned the 7 October attacks have been killed, as have many of their replacements.Israel hasreduced much of Gaza to a flattened wasteland, killed or injured one in 10 of the prewar population and forced the starving survivors into just 20% of Gaza’s area.Graph showing deaths and injuries in Gaza since October 2023In that apocalyptic landscape, after intensive bombings and ground operations that have killed tens of thousands of civilians, most of the people listed in Israel’s database as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters are still alive.Israel defines and targets as militants many people who do not participate in combat, and are protected civilians under international law.A specific piece of intelligence is attached to every operative on the list whom the army is sure it killed, justifying that designation, intelligence sources said. The Guardian, +972 and Local Call obtained figures without names or additional reports.“Anybody that we have knowledge of their death, in any way whatsoever, will be documented there,” one source said. The document notes the confirmed deaths of 7,330 militants and records 1,570 as “probably dead”. There were 750 senior Hamas operatives in the database; 300 were labelled as certainly or probably killed.Comparing the military database with the casualty list compiled by the Gaza health ministry indicates Israel killed five civilians for each militant inside Gaza. Mass killing is one factor cited by scholars, lawyers and rights groups, who say Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.True death toll is higherBoth the military database and the health ministry casualty list are underestimates.Israel’s military intelligence teams are aware they had not identified all militants and do not know of every death, sources with knowledge of the database said. But their estimates still indicated that “for each militant, four civilians were killed”.The casualty list published by the health ministry includes only those whose bodies have been recovered, not the thousands buried under the rubble. Peer-reviewed international research alsoindicates a significantly higher toll.Map showing majority IDF military zones and evacuated areas of Gaza.Yet Netanyahu, who iswanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes, is promising that another ground operation in Gaza City – which would inevitably bring further mass killings of Palestinian civilians – will allow the military to “seize control of the last terrorist strongholds” and defeat Hamas.The western military source said: “What we are seeing now is another throw of a losing dice. Because this is not going to work. It’s going to be more of the same.“There is no way that any of this is going to lead to any situation where you could possibly apply the word victory. It’s gratuitous violence for no military point at all.”Hamas now has just a handful of rockets that it would struggle to deploy and its fighters would not easily get near the border fence, much less through it. It does not pose an existential threat to Israel,according to Israeliand Palestinian experts.“They have lost the ability to threaten Israel itself for the next one to two decades minimum,” said Muhammad Shehada, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.But if fighting continues in Gaza, Hamas could have time and manpower on its side. Israel’s military is structured to fight conventional armies in short wars, mobilising from reserves. Growing numbers of reservists are now refusing to report for duty, and the military isconsidering an appeal to the diaspora.“Hamas can maintain a long-term insurgency in Gaza, because it doesn’t take much: all they need is rifles and anti-tank weapons,” Shehada said. “If they recycle the Israeli bombs that didn’t explode there is an endless supply of explosives, and the genocide provides an infinite recruiting pool for new members.”View image in fullscreenDestroyed buildings in Gaza City. Israel has reduced much of the strip to a flattened wasteland.Photograph: Omar al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesAmerican intelligence estimates suggestHamas has recruited 15,000 operatives during the war, about twice as many as Israel has killed.Public claims of a death toll approaching 20,000 have also been criticised by rightwing figures inside Israel. The retired general Itzhak Brik, a confidant of Netanyahu at the start of the war but now a fierce critic, believes even the 8,900 figure is an exaggeration.The focus on the death toll offered a dangerous incentive to lie, he said, describing the much higher toll as “one of the most serious bluffs” in the country’s history.In April 2024, several members of the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee questioned militant casualty figures presented to them by the army, the rightwing dailyIsrael Hayom reported.After examining the military’s data, the committee members found public estimates had inflated the number of militant casualties “in order to create a 2:1 ratio” between civilian and militant deaths.Their findings echo numbers in the militant database seen by the Guardian. The list is based on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad documents from before and after 7 October and extensive research. It includes thousands of militants the army believes were recruited after the start of the war.The Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the database or the casualty data when approached for comment by Local Call and +972. When the Guardian asked for comment on the same data, a spokesperson said they had decided to “rephrase” their response.In a statement to the Guardian the military did not directly address questions about the intelligence database. It said “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without specifying the data it disputed. A spokesperson did not respond when asked why the military had given different responses to questions about a single set of data.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

International staff employed on the project in Australia are hired on diplomatic visas.View image in fullscreenA bird’s eye view of two completed stations in June 2024. The SKAO is not subject to national laws or regulatory oversight in Australia.Photograph: SKAOWhile the UK and Australia are majority shareholders in the project, the total financial contributions of each member nation are not disclosed.The Australian government announced in 2021 that it would contribute $387m to the SKAO over a decade for the construction and operation of the telescope, with $141m committed over the four-year forward estimates.At the time, the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the project would “help our scientists make more discoveries than we can imagine today, whether it’s better understanding the origin and future of our stars and galaxies, to how gravity works across the universe”.Portfolio budget statements for the Department of Industry, Science and Resources published since show the total amount spent is substantially more than this, with a total spend of $475m from 2021 to 2025.A department spokesperson said the additional spending included Australia’s member state contributions to the SKAO Observatory and “Australia’s other commitments to the SKA project, including investment in the Australian SKA Regional Centre and site readiness and local communities”.“Part of the investment is also leveraging the Australian SKA site’s fibre optic connection to provide connectivity for two communities nearby to the site – the Pia Wadjarri Remote Aboriginal Community and the Murchison Settlement,” the spokesperson said.The amount spent between 2020 and 2024 was $164m more than initially budgeted in 2020.The spokesperson said there had been changes to the administered budgeted expenses for the SKA project “due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, adjustments to economic parameters, and the reprofiling of funds as part of regular updates to budget estimates”.In the 2025-26 budget, the government announced an additional $47.9m in the budget’s contingency reserve “to address funding shortfalls for the SKA project” alongside other member nations.In response to the disclosure, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, Zerbi has initiated an investigation into claims that public funds from member states have been lost through trading accounts – and then covered up by the organisation through the shuffling of funds internally.At the centre of the misconduct allegations is a claim that at least £12m (A$25.1m) was lost through investment in three money market funds, with one fund allegedly losing 45% of its value. The Guardian has seen balance sheet extracts and statements that appear to confirm the investments by the SKAO, which is headquartered at the Jodrell Bank Observatory near Manchester.The report also calls for an investigation into claims funds are being shifted within the organisation, and currency fluctuations being fabricated to conceal these losses from the governing council overseeing the project.A spokesperson for the SKAO denied the allegations, but confirmed it was “assisting an independent, external investigation” into them.“No capital loss has been incurred in these investment holdings. Money market funds are inherently low-risk, highly liquid investments and were selected for SKAO’s investment portfolio for this reason,” the spokesperson said.“Any reduction seen in the investment balances relates to amounts being redeemed (withdrawn) from the investments to support SKAO’s normal cash requirements, for example to pay suppliers and staff salaries.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No adverse findings of note have been reported.”View image in fullscreenPortfolio budget statements reveal the Australian government  contributed $475m between 2021 and 2025 towards the SKAO.Photograph: SKAO/Max AlexanderOther complaints detailed in the whistleblower’s report include allegations that procurement budgets have been mismanaged, leading to delays and change in scope.One example is the project’s failure to build a permanent power supply to the telescope at the Australian site, which is now being run on temporary diesel generators.The SKAO website claims power for the project’s central processing plant “is provided by a photovoltaic plant [solar] and energy storage system backed up by diesel generators, generating renewable energy a majority of the time to power the antennas and all site infrastructure”.However, no solar plant has yet been built. The project is yet to award a tender for the power plant and is allegedly spending more than $1m a year on diesel to power the plant.A tender document published by the SKAO in March reveals that a “phase one” diesel-operated system for the site is “expected to be operational in early 2026”, with the tender seeking interest to build a “phase two” power plant to integrate renewable energy.The scope and schedule of the SKA project, a massive undertaking to deliver the world’s two largest and most complex radio telescopes, are under constant reviewSKAO spokespersonThe SKAO spokesperson confirmed that the project would be running on diesel generators until the long-term solar-based plant was operational – expected in late 2028.“An expert team is implementing a complex multi-stage power procurement process that will result in a long-term power purchase agreement with an independent power provider to build and operate a radio quiet power station with a very high fraction of power generated from solar photovoltaic cells and using a substantial battery energy storage system.”The Guardian can also reveal thata €5m European Commission grant claimed by the SKAO consortium for infrastructure development was partially clawed back.A letter sent from the European Research Executive Agency to the UK-based deputy director general of the SKAO, Simon Berry, indicates that the commission was seeking repayment of €3.4m that had already been paid.It is understood that the amount ultimately recognised by the European Commission was €2.5m of the original €5m grant after many of the claimed costs were deemed ineligible.The grant, allocated under the Horizon 2020 program, had been intended to support “the detailed design of the infrastructure required” for the telescope sites in Australia and South Africa.View image in fullscreenThe Australian SKAO site is being run on temporary diesel generators.Photograph: CSIRO/Alex CherneyThe SKAO spokesperson said the grant had been overseen by the SKA organisation – the predecessor company to the SKAO that is in the process of being wound up.“As is often the case, with a complex major project of this sort, there were some costs deemed ineligible, but by the closeout of the project these were modest in nature and the arrangements resolved amicably between all the project partners and the EC, with the full knowledge and approval from the Organisation’s governance structures,” the spokesperson said.An “internal update” circulated within the organisation in early July suggests there have also been changes to the project’s scope and schedule.According to the update, a “programme and schedule risk review” had established “extensions to our Mid and Low schedules”. (“Low” refers to the Australian telescope, while “Mid” refers to the project in South Africa.)The document also refers to a “budget gap” that will be assessed over the coming months. “Then we’ll look at how we can manage this, through reducing or deferring some of our scope.”The circular states that the organisation is aware that “our current contingency budget is insufficient to cover the expected ECPs [engineering change proposals] and remaining risk” of the project.In response to questions from the Guardian about the project’s changed scope, the SKAO spokesperson said: “The scope and schedule of the SKA project, a massive undertaking to deliver the world’s two largest and most complex radio telescopes, are under constant review.“SKAO Council, comprising representatives of the governments of the member states that make up SKAO and supported by its Finance Committee, has oversight of all such issues. A recent schedule update has been notified to Council and the wider scientific community, and is driven by programmatic not financial reasons,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSquare Kilometre ArrayAstronomyWestern AustraliaSpaceShareReuse this content"

MPs call hypocrisy as former minister rails against system he expandedFri 22 Aug 2025 14.12 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 14.32 EDTShareRobert Jenrick had been migration minister for just a few days in 2022 when he gave a broadcast interview that could easily have been given by a minister in the current government.“Suella Braverman [the former home secretary] and her predecessor, Priti Patel, were procuring more hotels,”he told Sky News. “What I have done in my short tenure is ramp that up and procure even more. Because November, historically, has been one of the highest months of the year for migrants illegally crossing the Channel.”He went on to add: “I would never demonise people coming to this country in pursuit of a better life. And I understand and appreciate our obligation to refugees.”It was a very different Jenrick who showed up in Epping last weekend at the site of prolonged protests outside the Bell hotel, which houses asylum seekers.“Great to be with peaceful, patriotic protesters in Epping today,” heposted on X. “People are right to be fed up of illegal migration. And the crime and billions being wasted because of it.”Labour condemns Robert Jenrick’s visit to rally attended by far-right activistRead moreJenrick’s inflammatory visit to Epping, where he waspictured close to a well-known far-right activist, showed why he is – in some ways – one of the most effective members of the shadow cabinet, but also the political risks of his sometimes controversial public appearances.Supporters argue that no one else in the shadow cabinet is so adept at seizing the political initiative.They point to his much-discussed recent social media videos, including one of himaccosting fare dodgerson the London underground, as evidence of his success. And they add his appearance in Epping, where not even the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has sought to go, shows he is one of a small number of Conservatives able to outmanoeuvre his populist rightwing opponents.“It’s incredibly difficult for us to get attention right now,” said one Conservative MP. “If all of the shadow cabinet were doing what Jenrick is doing, that would be great.”Another said: “There’s much noise around Reform right now. Any noise from a Tory perspective is good.”Others, however, are accusing him of rank hypocrisy.In an unusual personal attack on a Conservative politician, Reform publisheda series of X postsaccusing him of having “boasted” about opening more asylum hotels while in government.Meanwhile, severalConservativessay they are uneasy about Jenrick’s tactics and accuse him of being more interested in lining up a leadership bid than helping his party.“It is hard to take him seriously,” said one Tory MP. “The reservation is that he’s notNigel Farage, and he will never be Nigel Farage.”Another said: “The challenge for leadership hopefuls like Jenrick is that he presided over an immigration policy that increased the use of hotels, which is why Reform are now focusing their attacks on him.“We also have the likes of [fellow Conservative MPs] Danny Kruger, Nick Timothy and Katie Lam who advised successive prime ministers and home secretaries now behaving as though they are clean of the past and have the answers. It doesn’t fool anyone.”View image in fullscreenJenrick’s visit to a Bell hotel protest showed why he is one of the most effective members of the shadow cabinet, but also the political risks of his controversial public appearances.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAJenrick’s difficulty in being taken seriously as a rightwing agitator, after years in government as a supporter of Rishi Sunak, mirrors the wider challenge facing the party in shaking off the legacy of 14 years in power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A recent Conservative social media post criticising the “freebies and perks” given to asylum seekers arriving in the UKwas met with scornby many of its own MPs.On a leaked Tory WhatsApp chat, MP Lewis Cocking said: “This makes us look silly as we gave them all this too, which is why we are in the mess we are in today.”The Guardian view on Conservative asylum policy: the moderate Tory tradition faces extinction | EditorialRead moreRob Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said: “Going big on the issue makes sense on the surface in that salience of it is high and Labour’s poll figures are bad too.“But it is and always has been Farage’s core issue. So their recent behaviour is very much ‘Nigel is right, don’t vote for him.’“Jenrick showing up at that hotel may work as a campaign image for the coming Tory leadership contest but it also makes it more likely that whoever wins that contest takes over a ship headed rapidly to the seabed.”Some say that by attacking asylum seekers so aggressively, the party risks emboldening the far right and undermining the entire idea of granting asylum.A recent studypublished in the British Journal of Political Science found attacks by mainstream politicians on migration were far more powerful in changing public attitudes towards migrants than ones from the hard-right.The researchers found that “statements by mainstream politicians lead to more norm-erosion than similar statements by radical-right politicians”.Those concerns are shared by some anti-racism campaigners. Lewis Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, recently said: “Jenrick is fanning the flames of the far right by chasingReform UKvotes. He’s giving confidence to known fascists.”None of this troubles those close to Jenrick, however, who believe that even being pictured at the same rally as a former British National Party strategist can be turned to their advantage.“At this stage in the game, controversy is good,” said one Jenrick ally. “Making controversy on a point where we are saying what the public want us to say is more than a net benefit – much more.”Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickConservativesReform UKNigel FarageMigrationImmigration and asylumanalysisShareReuse this content"

As she walked through the forest to get to the pool, Carmen Chan could feel the mud between her toes getting warmer.“It was such a visceral way to be in the forest,” Chan says. The pool had a hot waterfall, the steam from which created a fogginess “like an Indiana Jones adventure” – even though the real world, golf courses and highways, was only 6km away. A decade after that first trip, the now 32-year-old Chan is still hooked.

Numerous resorts and geothermal areas have been developed as tourist sites, with paid entry, spa treatments and information about the natural and human history of the area. Many, likeWhakarewarewa,are owned and operated by Māori. The area also has geothermal electricity stations, providing power into the grid.View image in fullscreenLocals warm up in the thermal waters of Spa Park’s Otumuheke Stream.

It’s further now, but he still makes his way to a thermal pool whenever he can.His favourite pools, near Waiotapu between Rotorua and Taupō, have a warm spring right next to a hot one, and nearby parking with no thrashing through the forest required.

One of the trade-offs is the persistent smell of hydrogen sulphide, “like farts or a toilet”, from the springs, but “you get used to it”, Mani says.View image in fullscreenLocals enjoy a thermal pool at the head of a tributary to the Waikato River.

But that is millions of years away, and in the meantime humans can enjoy them. “People want to sit in hot water and enjoy these unusual places on our planet’s surface,” Pittari says.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificShareReuse this content"

The then 16-year-old, at the ground with her school team, remembers the moment of relief when a last-minute French penalty goal attempt drifted wide, allowing the Black Ferns to scrape through to the final of the Women’s World Cup. In another gripping contest against arch-rivals England, New Zealand went on towin the tournament.Now, Sorensen-McGee hopes to play a decisive role inretaining the title. After a breakout 2025, the 18-year-old is the youngest member of the Black Ferns squad, who take on Spain on Monday morning (NZT) in their opening act of the 2025 Women’s Rugby World Cup, hosted by England.Instead of just watching, as she did that spring evening in 2022, the three-Test full-back hopes to help the Black Ferns secure a record seventh World Cup title – and their third in succession.Firefighter, mother, tattooist: three rugby part-timers on their sacrifices to live a World Cup dreamRead more“Everyone believes that we got it, and we back each other.

Others include the fleet-footed loose-forward Jorja Miller, 21, who has dominated the international sevens game since making her debut three years ago; powerful ball-running prop Veisinia Mahutariki-Fakalelu, 20; and Logo-I-Pulotu Lemapu-Atai’i Sylvia Brunt, the bruising centre who, despite being just 21, has already won 25 Test caps for the Black Ferns, including several appearances at the previous World Cup.At the other end of the spectrum, older heads such as co-captain and first five-eighth Ruahei Demant, winger Portia Woodman-Wickliffe, and mainstays of the forward pack like hooker Georgia Ponsonby and co-captain Kennedy Tukuafu have their hands on the tiller. Another veteran, 30-year-old Theresa Setefano, the second five-eighth who scored a crucial late try in that French semi-final, described the importance of having youthful exuberance to draw on during long, gruelling campaigns like a World Cup.Flashing mouthgards for concussion to be introduced at Women’s Rugby World CupRead more“That’s probably where the young girls’ energy will help us older ones as well.

Players like herself, she says, can help the less experienced “focus on the right things, try and shut out the noise, because there will be a lot of external noise, and it’s a long, long campaign as well”.View image in fullscreenTheresa Setefano. ‘If you’re under 21, your energy levels are just out of the gate.’Photograph: Jack Thomas/World Rugby/Getty ImagesSorensen-McGee says she is looking to her elders to help cope with the intensity of World Cup rugby.“They know what pressure is like,” she says. “They know how to be in difficult moments and hard times … [We] look up to them, play off them, and seeing them do it gives us confidence.”In her case, knowing that a back-three colleague of Woodman-Wickliffe’s experience and calibre “has got my back” is a huge boost; Sorensen-McGee hopes the combination they formed during this year’s Super Rugby Aupiki campaign for the Blues will help power the Black Ferns to the title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Setefano remembers the tournament as something “like a movie or a fairytale, you could say, everything just fell into place for us”.Sorensen-McGee spoke of the Black Ferns’ history as a legacy she was desperate to help uphold. But both players are trying not to let thoughts of that tournament cloud their thinking about this one.Setefano: “It is a clean slate this time around. Nothing you did in the past will really matter coming into this World Cup here. So we will take it one game at a time. Just focus on ourselves.”But nor is the squad unrealistic about the pressure they will face – and about how different – and how belligerent – that pressure could be when compared with the army ofpoi-wielding supporterswho urged them on to overcome England during that epic final at a sold-out Eden Park three years ago. Both teams could meet again at the sharp end of this tournament,at a sold-out Twickenham for the final with a record 82,000 fans in the grandstands, almost all of them in the English corner, baying for revenge. Setefano says the “tighter and more connected” the team can be, the better they will deal with that pressure.View image in fullscreenSouth Africa’s Springbok women’s rugby team in action against New Zealand’s Black Ferns at Athlone stadium, ahead of the 2025 Rugby World Cup.Photograph: Esa Alexander/Reuters“We are aware that it will be a different sort of atmosphere in the UK, and so we are prepared for that. We know we’ll have each other’s backs, and we know that our whole country will be supporting us back at home.”Sorensen-McGee, whose maturity Setefano speaks highly of, welcomes that pressure.“I think pressure is a privilege. Like, it’s a privilege to have this job, to be able to put on the Black Ferns jersey, to be able to train every day. Yeah, it’s pretty much a privilege for me. I don’t look too much on it as pressure.“Even though it’s my first World Cup, I back my ability to go out there and show the world what I’m like.

You may have spotted him posing with an oat milk matcha pretending to read a copy of The Bell Jar. Or maybe you saw him seeming to listen to Lana Del Rey deep cuts but his earphones weren’t plugged in.Maybe he makes a point of carrying tampons around with him for women in need. He’s called a “performative male” and is a relatively new archetype gaining traction – and inspiring mockery and critique – online.Labubusare a key component, he will probably have one dangling off a bag or belt loop. Point-and-shoot cameras are optional. He’d like you to think he has read Sally Rooney’s entire back catalogue and that Joni Mitchell is his favourite musician, but he doesn’t know a single lyric.There is a menswear element, too. He’s likely to wear baggy trousers, perhaps made from Japanese selvedge denim, Vivienne Westwood chrome hearts necklaces and a tote bag, ideally emblazoned with feminist slogans. All of this posturing has one end goal: to look good in the eyes of (progressive) women.According to J’Nae Phillips, a trend forecaster and the creator of theFashion Tingznewsletter: “A performative male is less about who someone is than about how they curate and project masculinity in public – usually online. He is someone acutely aware that manhood is being watched, assessed, and consumed, and so he stages it.”View image in fullscreenHe’d like you to think that he’s read Sally Rooney’s entire back catalogue.Photograph: AlamyOnTikTok, women are sharing sightings of people they deem to be performative males in public – reading highbrow literature, maybe even filming themselves as they do it, between sets at the gym.Content creators are seeking to skewer the archetype, with men performing like “performative males” for knowing audiences.In one videoshowing what it could be like to go on a date with a performative male, the man in question plays Beyoncé’s Run the World (Girls) on a ukulele having just shushed his date in order to finish reading a chapter of anAngela Davisbook.From Seattle to Chicago, Sydney to Jakarta, contests in the vein of last year’scelebrity lookalikeshave been held for performative males. Men have held copies of Joan Didion upside down andimplored schools to start teaching “herstory” instead of history. At a contest in Ottawa, a contestant named his mum as his cultural and aesthetic inspiration.As the organiser of the Seattle contest, Lanna Rain, told a local news station: “My best description of a performative male is a man who wears feminism and softness and certain music as a guy to allure women without actually knowing anything about what they’re putting on or talking about.”Marcus Jernigan, who won the contest in Seattle, said: “To me a performative male is a man who partakes in certain activities or listens to a certain genre of music with the intention of attracting women.” He thinks it “stems from men who genuinely participate in these aesthetics but unfortunately have them stolen by those men who have ulterior motives”.The performative male has been likened to the poser of the 90s. But there are key differences. Dr Ashley Morgan, a masculinities expert at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said that where performative masculinities perhaps used to mean men showing off with things such as fast cars in order to impress other men, the 2025 version looked more inclusive. She saw a positive in that the performative male was offering a different take on masculinity, helping to expand what it can mean.It can also be seen as the offspring of the“softboi”, an archetype from the late 2010s. A softboi was in touch with their emotions – not like the other guys. For Philips, they share DNA. But while the softboi “flaunted niche music taste, claimed emotional depth, and differentiated himself from the ‘basic’ masculine mainstream”, and “performed sensitivity”, by contrast “the performative male is broader: he can perform toughness, tenderness, politics, spirituality, or even incompetence, as long as it’s theatrically framed”.The performative male lands against a backdrop of discussion over whether masculinity is in crisis. In the US in 2023, nearly half of men believe traditional masculinity is under threat. But what even is “masculinity” today – starkly different ideals of masculinity are jostling for dominance. “As traditional gender roles dissolve, men look for new scripts to inhabit, and performance offers a way to experiment with them publicly,” said Phillips.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the flip side is that the perceived end goal of many of these “performative males” is to woo women they hope will be attracted by their feminist theatrics.Phillips thinks it can be seen as the other side of the trad wife movement, which, she said, “is about restaging femininity in a hyper-stylised way – curating domesticity, submission, and nostalgia for imagined stability”. The performative male, she said, was “its mirror: a hyper-awareness of masculinity as something to craft and showcase”.Both, she said, “are symptoms of the same cultural moment: people seeking clarity, identity and validation in a chaotic world, turning to heightened gender performance as a stabilising, aestheticised refuge.”Eugene Healey, a brand strategy consultant, looks at the irony of the performance in performative man content.In a video he points to a quote from the philosopher Slavoj Žižek: “Even if we do not take things seriously, even if we keep an ironical distance, we are still doing them.” As Healey said: “The men making this content do have these haircuts, do listen toClairo, they do rock a small top, big pant, tote bag combo and in an effort to get ahead of their own reputational issues they have to prove that they’re above it.”But, he added, being conscious of the performance was not the same as transcending it: “Self-awareness doesn’t free us from performance, it just adds another layer to it.” The truly radical act, in his view, would be to drop “the performance of being above the performance”.For others who truly like the things these performative males pretend to like, they find themselves in a tricky spot. As one social media user said: “Let me enjoy my matcha and tote bag. I’ve been doing this since 2020.”Explore more on these topicsFashionMenTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The debut feature from Alex Russell, The Bear and Beef writer-producer, is an elegantly creepy thriller about one super-fan’s scheme to become close to his musical idol, transposing author Patricia Highsmith’s “two-man theme” into a murkier grey territory, with parasitic attachment giving way to co-dependence that blooms into something that looks like a twisted kind of love.Lurker review – deviously entertaining Hollywood hanger-on thrillerRead moreThe lurker of the title is Matthew (Théodore Pellerin), an isolated twentysomething who lives with his grandma and works shifts at a local vintage boutique to make ends meet. After a chance run-in with his idol Oliver (Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe) at the vintage store where he works, Matthew worms his way into Oliver’s entourage and makes himself indispensable – first as a videographer, then confidante and then as someone who has the power to make Oliver’s enviable life come crashing down. “The thing I found relatable is that no one tells you how lonely being any version of an artist is,” says Madekwe. “Oliver needs someone outside the paid [members of his team] to say ‘Yeah, I fuck with it. I get it. You’re so real.’ He needs it because he knows that he’s a bit of a fraud anyway.”I’m chatting with the director and leads of Lurker at a swishy New York hotel as part of a busy day of interviews and photo calls. They’re getting through the week of promotion with a playful sense of humour, as well as a little fraternal rough and tumble. Earlier in the day, they filmed a social media skit which involves Pellerin perched on Madekwe’s lap, and Madekwe teases his co-star that he would be “so much better” in Pellerin’s role of Matthew.Madekwe did, in fact, initially audition for the role of Matthew. But it’s hard to imagine who could play him quite like Pellerin, a deserved arthouse darling after quietly compelling performances in Never Rarely Sometimes Always and Solo. In the Québécois actor’s hands, he’s both a grifter with a cruel coercive streak and a whimsical kid whose face lights up while dancing around the kitchen with his nan. After an oddly homoerotic hazing ritual – and advice from an entourage member (Zack Fox) to stop acting “like some kind of tour thot” – Matthew assumes a superfluous role of videographer with the crew.“There was something endearing about his awkwardness and his desperate need to be a part of something,” says Pellerin, sipping a matcha latte. “After being subjected to Oliver and his friends’ games and humiliations, there’s a decision of ‘I’m not going to let this happen any more, I’m going to up my game.’” He adds that the mindset reminded him of his experiences at school in Montreal. “I felt like that and tried that as a kid, when I was like, ‘I don’t want to be the one who gets rejected any more.’ It would work for two weeks, and then it wouldn’t. And it was like, ‘What can I do to have friends?’”Before shooting the film, Russell took Pellerin to some celebrity parties in LA, which bizarrely included Paris Hilton’s birthday party. Pellerin filmed what was unfolding on a handheld camcorder, and no one batted an eye. “Everyone’s already recording stuff on their phone,” says Russell. “In a way, someone with a camcorder is more wholesome.”The Lurker set sounds something like a party in itself, where Russell’s friends in the LA music scene would drop by to hang out with the crew. “Every day he was having the best day of his life,” says Madekwe. “But it was really useful because that’s not my world at all.” Plus it allowed Pellerin, who grew up speaking French and only learned English at 18, to master the scene’s vernacular. “It’s not my world at all, so on set I’d be trying it out” – he flips into the slurred voice of a SoCal stoner – “That’s crazy, bruh.”Set in pre-Covid LA, Lurker is holistically imbued with the first-hand experiences of Russell, who has written for music magazines such as the Fader and Complex and also co-wrote the Brockhampton short film Billy Star with band member Kevin Abstract. Russell’s career history likely has something to do with the film’s arch view of celebrity. Oliver’s music sounds like the kind of frictionless fare of a “beats to study to” playlist, and he seems to view Matthew as a kind of musical sensei based on his knowledge of Nile Rodgers … the most famous funk musician in history. I’m curious if Russell has heard of any real-life instances of the blackmail that his movie depicts. There’s a long pause before the director nods yes. He won’t name names, but he says that he’s “heard of this kind of thing happening”.View image in fullscreenArchie Madekwe in Lurker.Photograph: APPlenty of mediocre art has been made about social media obsession, a fact I am reminded of today as I wait for the trio opposite a large painting of a woman taking a selfie. Russell strikes a delicate tonal balance between the pulpy fun of 90s erotic thrillers, a genre which the director says he binged after writing Lurker, as well as the complexity of European arthouse. Even so, they’re game to lean into the movie’s popcorn pleasures, and tomorrow the trio will fly to LA for a live reading of Single White Female, which Madekwe cheerfully admits he hasn’t seen in full: “I started watching it in my hotel, I’m 40 minutes in!” While Russell’s movie hits similar pleasure centres to its 90s forebears – including the sexual tension between its leads – it respects its viewers enough to do away with straight-forward tropes of white knights and boogeymen. There is a version of this movie, I tell Russell, that is hopelessly corny. “The worst!” he agrees. “At every step, I was trying to run as far away from that as I could.”That fear didn’t quite dissipate until Russell stepped on set and saw his two leads nail the complex magnetism that draws them together. After shooting the scene in which they meet in the vintage store, Madekwe walked to the back of the set to chat to Russell, and found the director getting emotional while watching back footage of the actors. “I was like, ‘How you doing?’” recalls Madekwe. “And you were crying.”“I wasn’tcrying,” laughs Russell, “but tears were welling up – tears of relief. Once I saw the two of them on the monitor I knew the tapestry of the whole thing would work.”Lurker is out in US cinemas now and in the UK and Australia soonExplore more on these topicsThrillersMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There three, four, five thousand or more were bouncing up and down while a stout lad with Spandex trousers, a sequined jacket and serious pipes was belting out the opening notes of We Will Rock You on the big stage while his band thrashed away behind him. If everywhere else around town was empty, it was because everyone was here. It was a hell of a way to start a World Cup.England off to a flyer in 11-try Women’s Rugby World Cup mauling of USARead more“Let’s show them how we do it in the north-east!” shouted out the Mackem Mercury as he set a carnival parade off marching over the bridge towards the Stadium of Light for the kick-off.Sunderland was a great place for the opening game. The tournament has been organised so that 95% of the population is within two hours’ travel of a match. Usually you have to go a long way further than that to find a good game in the north-east.There isn’t an elite women’s rugby club in this corner of the country. The North East Women’s XV was launched in 2024, but have struggled to attract enough sponsorship to cover kit costs, let alone pay for coaches. There’s no shortage of talent, there are more than 100 girls on the RFU pathway just in Durham, never mind the surrounding counties, but they have nowhere to go except down south if they want to carry on in it.View image in fullscreenThe players line up at a packed Stadium of Light.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe World Cup is part of an effort to put that right. The RFU has pledged to invest plenty of the Impact 25 money it has had from the government in this region over the next decade, and the North East Combined Authority had pumped £500,000 into the fan zone alone. It showed, too. Newcastle Rugby Foundation was running a series of busy skills workshops for all the kids there, with radar guns measuring whether they could sprint as quick as Ellie Kildunne, or pass as fast as Mo Hunt.Life moves fast, but hell, the Women’s World Cup has grown up quicker than the teenage nephew you haven’t seen for three years. The last time this tournament was held in this country, in 2010, the opening game was played at Surrey Sports Park in Guildford, in front of a crowd of just under 3,000 people who were packed into temporary grandstands.Fifteen years later, more people than that had turned out just to watch the Queen tribute band playing in the fan zone over the road from the ground a couple of hours before the match.View image in fullscreenThe atmosphere before the game and in the stadium was electric.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe crowd for this opening game was bigger than the combined attendance for the entire tournament in 2010, and, from watching it, you would bet World Rugby spent more on the fireworks that were let loose from the stadium roof in the minutes before kick-off than it did staging that entire edition of the competition.No wonder Marlie Packer and Emily Scarratt and a couple of England’s other older players made a point of taking a moment for a slow walk around the ground before the team warm-up, just to soak in the moment.

Well, nothing in rugby serves to settle the nerves like a good maul, and the Red Roses rolled out a couple at the first good chance they had.

England put 14 points on them in that period, one try from another maul, the other after a neat bit of interplay from Abby Dow and Kildunne down the right wing after the USA made a dreadful mess of a restart. That put England 21 points up, and from there it was downhill running all the way to the whistle.It was late by the time they scored their ninth and 10th tries, and some of the thousands of little kids in the crowd were beginning to drift away to sleep, their nodding heads snapped back off their parents’ shoulders by the screams and shouts and intermittent blasts of the White Stripes or Depeche Mode coming over the stadium PA as England scored another. They had hours to sleep ahead of them in the car ride home, and then in their beds, and sweet dreams of Kabeya, Kildunne, Dow and all their other new heroes.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamUSA women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the London Stadium emptying out long before full time, patience worn thin by the latest in a long line of humiliations. It is one young fan mounting a solo pitch invasion after being driven to despair by his side’s inability to defend set pieces. It is a new £15m goalkeeper who cannot catch crosses and, as much as Potter will plead for calm, it is that the only positive for West Ham wasChelseapretty much declaring after going 5-1 up with over half an hour to play.Chelsea had run through at will, cutting West Ham’s execrable back five to shreds, João Pedro and Estêvão Willian playing a different sport from every individual in claret and blue. Whatever the gulf in class, though, there can be no excuse for a performance so lacking in heart and a team so incapable of doing the basics.‘I have to do better’: Potter admits he’s under pressure after Chelsea defeatRead moreThere is no hiding place for Potter, who has taken fewer points from his first 10 home games in thePremier Leaguethan any manager in West Ham’s history. He is already under pressure, already facing suggestions that he is in trouble after eight months in the job, although there is the awkward question of whether he is more symptom than cause. After all, the sense that Potter is the wrong fit at a club who tend to feed off ­emotion should not overlook the fact that this collapse owes much to years of West Ham’s owners making one bad decision after another on and off the pitch.Put it all together and Potter could be forgiven if he was pining for the days when he was struggling to make sense of life at Chelsea. He was bruised by his experience in west London, although the longer time has gone on the more it has become apparent that Chelsea were simply going through a period of transition. Their owners have built a seriously talented squad since ­firing ­Potter.Cole Palmer pulling out of this game with a groin injury just before ­kick off? It hardly mattered when manager Enzo Maresca was simply able to bring in Estêvão and watch the 18-year-old Brazilian ­prodigy rip West Ham apart with his speed and skill on just his first competitive start for Chelsea.View image in fullscreenEstêvão inspired Chelsea on his first start.Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesIt bordered on the absurd that Chelsea had fallen behind to a stunning early goal from Lucas Paquetá. The theory that fatigue will be one of the biggest challenges for Maresca’s side after their Club World Cup exertions had been given strength by Palmer exiting the warm-up early. It meant a rejig in an attack led by Liam Delap – Estêvão came in on the right, João Pedro played as the No 10 and Pedro Neto moved to the left – and the late alterations initially had West Ham thinking that their luck was about to turn after losing to Sunderland on the opening weekend.Yet the optimism faded soon after Estêvão lost possession in the sixth minute and watched Paquetá send a swerving shot past Robert Sánchez from 25 yards. Chelsea needed less than 10 minutes to respond in the manner of world champions, Neto’s corner headed on by Marc Cucurella for João Pedro to shake off Aaron Wan-Bissaka and equalise. They were soon ahead, Paquetá squandering possession before João Pedro crossed for Neto to convert, and the game had run away from Potter’s side by the time Estêvão sliced through West Ham’s left side before crossing for Enzo Fernández to make it 3-1 in the 34th minute.It became painful for Potter, who has won two home games since replacing Julen Lopetegui in January. West Ham, who have conceded eight in their first two games, are relegation candidates. Midfield reinforcements cannot come quickly enough. Moisés Caicedo and Fernández ran over James Ward-Prowse and Tomas Soucek. Max Kilman, Jean-Clair Todibo and Nayef Aguerd all looked like expensive mistakes in central defence.West Ham crumbled. They have no leadership. Estêvão’s assist for Fernández was followed by the camera cutting to David Sullivan, West Ham’s largest shareholder. The mood in the stands was a curious mix of anger and apathy. Many have lost patience with Sullivan after an ­uninspired transfer window, blaming him for the club’s shoddy recruitment. There were more boos when the 33-year-old Callum ­Wilson replaced the 32-year-old Niclas ­Füllkrug up front.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It got worse.

The next corner brought more confusion, Hermansen bullied before Trevoh Chalobah scored the fifth. It turned ugly.

But our relations have changed.“It is not so close [now]. I’m being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know. My job is always to try to anticipate what’s coming ahead of us, and that’s what I said with respect.“It’s not good. I think everybody at the club should be together but it’s not the reality. The reality is that [it] is not what it used to be. It was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good.”Asked about a report in Italy that referenced rising tensions between Nuno and Marinakis and suggested the Portuguese could be sacked, the 51-year-old fuelled doubts over his position. “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things work, but I’m here to do my job. I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the first one to be worried. I’m the first one to be concerned. There’s no smoke without fire.”It is thought Nuno’s comments have inflamed tensions behind the scenes, particularly given their personal nature and the fact they came 48 hours before an already supercharged match against Crystal Palace. Forest profited from Palace’s demotion to the Conference League and will take the place of Oliver Glasner’s side in the Europa League.Postecoglou, the former Tottenham manager, is understood to be a leading candidate for the role should Forest decide to sack Nuno. Postecoglou, who is out of work after leaving Spurs in June, is thought to be interested in the role.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet hours later,Arsenal swept in to gazump themand are primed to confirm his arrival in a £67.5m deal. If it is a coup for Arsenal and a dream move for Eze, who supported the club as a boy, it has been an episodeSpurs would rather forget. They failed in a bid for Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White in July and are without their two main central attacking midfielders,Dejan Kulusevskiand James Maddison. Both have long-term injuries.Battle with Arsenal for Eberechi Eze was a fight Spurs feared they wouldn’t win | David HytnerRead moreFrank did not want to talk specifically about Eze at his press conference on Friday, which was ostensibly to preview Saturday’s Premier League visit to Manchester City. But he had a message for the club’s supporters and it was hard to think he did not have Eze in mind as he delivered it.“There has been a lot of links,” Frank said. “There’ll be a lot of links in the future. And just to generalise that … to make it very, very clear … I don’t want any players that don’t want to come to the club. Who don’t want to wear this fantastic badge. We don’t want them here.“That’s very clear and I’m also pretty sure that the fans will feel the same. If they [the signings] don’t want to put the fantastic shirt over their head, play for the badge, play for the club, really enjoy it, no problem. We don’t want them. I think that’s a key message.”Mikel Arteta refused to comment on the Eze deal as he prepared for the visit of Leeds on Saturday evening because the player was not yet a part of his squad. But the Arsenal manager did echo Frank in talking up the importance of signing players who identify with the club. “The number one thing is that they want to be with us, that they feel something special to come to us,” Arteta said. “We’ve done very well in the last few years to create a group of players and to build this spirit in the team and if they are supporting Arsenal, so much the better. The stronger the feeling, the better because it brings a different edge, a different will and an emotion to what you do. That always brings something extra.”View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta hinted at Eberechi Eze’s ties with Arsenal as he said it is even better if a player who signs supports the club.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesFrank said he was confident of adding to his squad before the closure of the window and it sounded as though he knew it was essential to do so. He name-checked six options for his front line – the new signing Mohammed Kudus, Brennan Johnson, Dominic Solanke, Richarlison, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel. He did not include Manor Solomon, Kulusevski or Maddison. Frank was asked whether the group would suffice without reinforcements for a season that will include a Champions League return.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It’s a good question,” he said. “Of course we need to do everything we can to make sure we are as competitive as possible. I think we’ve got six good front players and then Kulusevski – he will come back in this season. That’s a big thing. It’s probably longer term with Maddison, unfortunately. But I am also pretty confident that we will sign a player before the end of the window.”Spurs have added João Palinha along with Kudus for the starting XI but they have lost Son Heung-min to Los Angeles Galaxy plus Maddison, who has ruptured his ACL, for the majority of the season. Is the squad stronger at present than it was last season? “You can say that’s two players in, two players out, so it’s probably pretty similar,” Frank said. “It’s up to me, together with the players and the staff, to make sure we can compete and then do what we can to strengthen.”Frank said Richarlison wanted to stay and that he wanted to keep him, in the face of rumours about the striker’s future. “There’s been no talks about anything else,” he said.Arteta, meanwhile, believesArsenalwill be better equipped across the attacking third this season. “More creativity, more weapons, having the ability to bring different profiles on the pitch at different stages in the game,” he said. “This is something that for sure we’re going to have more of this season.”The Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, praised the impact that Eze had for him after he took over from Roy Hodgson in February 2024, culminating in the famous winning goal against Manchester City in May’s FA Cup final.“I’m a big NBA fan and the crunch time is when the superstars are on the court,” Glasner said. “Ebs, in crunch time, when we needed him, he was here. This is what I will always remember. This is what great players are doing. We could count on Ebs in the crunch time, in the final, in the very important games. This is what he gave toCrystal Palace.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankArsenalMikel ArtetaCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

Why lend it to Ozempic culture?Bryan Armen GrahamFrom Compton outsider to American nonpareil, she came to embody resistance to toxic norms. But her embrace of GLP-1 drugs feels like capitulation to ideals she once rejectedFri 22 Aug 2025 12.38 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.09 EDTShareWhen Serena Williams was featuredin a People magazine storyon Thursday morning discussing her 31lb weight loss, the rollout had all the hallmarks of an advertisement draped in the thin veil of an all-caps EXCLUSIVE.Vogue’s social channels amplifiedtheir own access, NBC’s Today showgave her a one-on-one segmentand Elle publisheda carefully packaged interviewin which Williams declared she wanted to break the stigma around weight-loss drugs, each of them in lockstep with what appeared to be a hard 9am press embargo. This vintageJill Smollerquadrafecta was not a spontaneous confessional; it was a coordinated media blitz pegged to theUS Open, the tentpole event of American tennis, which kicks off on Sunday in earnest.Yet for all the precision and polish, it was unmistakably a commercial. The product wasn’t just Williams’s refined physique, already the subject of months-long speculation among her 32 million followers across social media. It was a telehealth service called Ro – a company on whose board her husband, Alexis Ohanian, conveniently sits, a disclosure the press release at leastdid the courtesy of includingin a footnote – promoting access to GLP-1 weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound.US Open draw: Emma Raducanu faces tough route if she can beat qualifier in first roundRead moreWilliams isn’t merely dabbling in one-off spon con. Her partnership with Ro is a promised multiyear campaign across billboards, digital platforms and television spots. In the first of them shelooks into the cameraand says: “After kids, it’s the medicine my body needed.” Ro’s CEO, Zach Reitano, was explicit about why she was chosen: precisely because some will say she doesn’t need GLP-1s. “That’s why she’s perfect for it,” he explained. In other words, the point of putting Williams in the ad is to normalize weight-loss drugs as lifestyle products for people who aren’t typical patients.On Today, Williams presented herself as anything but a corner-cutter. “As an athlete and as someone that has done everything, I just couldn’t get my weight to where I needed to be at a healthy place, and believe me, I don’t take shortcuts,” she said. She recalled running and walking for hours after giving birth to her daughters, only to plateau at the same number on the scale. The Elle interview sharpened that story further: Williams spoke of 30,000-step days, four-hour summer training sessions and her coach raising concerns about her weight in the HBO documentary series Being Serena. “I needed to try something different,” she said. “Sometimes people do absolutely everything, and it doesn’t work.” Her message was clear: she had done the work, and the drug was merely the missing piece.The public response across tennis Twitter and entertainment blogs has generally been divided. Some fans expressed resignation:if even the greatest athlete of her generation needed medication to shed weight, what chance does anyone else have?Others were angry that a global sporting icon, oncecelebrated for defying toxic beauty standards, would lend her name to a pharmaceutical fad already criticized for being over-prescribed. And then there were those who shrugged that Williams had always represented the family business. Much like Taylor Swiftappearing on Travis Kelce’s podcastfeels less like happenstance than deft cross-promotion, Williams’s tie-up with Ro isn’t solely about personal health – it’s #couplegoals on a macro scale.Many saw Thursday’s collective messaging not as candor but as advertorial: personal struggle framed as stealth marketing. In an era when audiences are used to celebrities weaving mental-health confessions or fitness “journeys” into commercial deals, Williams’s campaign was interpreted less as openness than strategy. The insistence that GLP-1s aren’t an “easy way out” didn’t so much silence critics as underscore the broader worry: that even someone as disciplined as Williams needed pharmaceutical help to be deemed “healthy”, leaning in tothe very thinness culture she once resisted. To many of her admirers, this was more than a sponsorship deal – it felt like a diminishment of her athletic legacy, asuggestion that all the titles and training were still not enough in a society where appearance trumps achievement.That contrast is striking because Williams’s career was built on defiance and being the ultimate outsider. A Black Jehovah’s Witness from Compton, she kicked in the doors of a country club sport with beaded braids and an unyielding game, only to endure years of skepticism, mockery and outright racism. Yet she leveraged those pressures into dominance, winning 23 grand slam singles titles and redefining power, athleticism and relentlessness in women’s tennis. For millions of fans, she was proof that success did not require conforming to narrow ideals of beauty or femininity. She bent a sport and an industry to her will, embodying strength and resilience for generations of Black women who saw in her an avatar of possibility.View image in fullscreenSerena Williams spent almost the entirely of her 27-year career in professional tennis weathering the worst kind of body-shaming from misguided critics ... on her way to 23 major singles titles.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesBy aligning with Ro, Williams has gone from embodying resistance to helping mainstream an industry built on shrinking bodies. The woman who once crafted a superpower from her double burdens – ofbeing born a woman and being born Blackin America – has chosen to reinforce the very culture that sought to erase her. Critics argue it’s especially dissonant given her own history of nearly dying twice – oncefrom a pulmonary embolismafter stepping on broken glass, oncefrom a traumatic C-section recovery– experiences that exposed the structural failures of American healthcare,particularly for Black women. If anyone could have credibly used her platform to call for systemic reform, it was her. Instead, she’s lent her name to a for-profit enterprise that markets weight-loss drugs to those who can already afford concierge medicine.And make no mistake: this is part of a bigger push. Between 8% and 10% of Americans are now taking GLP-1s, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ro has already run a controversial subway campaign showing injected bellies and signed former NBA star Charles Barkley to inject himself on camera. Competitor Hims & Hers splashed out for a Super Bowl commercial. All have drawn fire: from politicians who complained about skipped side-effect disclosures, from activists who saw body-shaming propaganda and from doctors worried about malnourishment. Unlike traditional pharma, telehealth companies in the US don’t have to run long read-outs of risks. They can present drugs like lifestyle accessories. And now they havea real American heroas their most bankable face in the gold rush for market share.Williams is not alone in this. She joins a growing roster of celebrities who have gone public about GLP-1 use, among them Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Meghan Trainor and Amy Schumer. But if others generated curiosity, Serena brings legitimacy. Few endorsements could signal more clearly that weight-loss drugs have moved from Hollywood whispers into the glossy mainstream.The money question lingers uncomfortably. Williams is not a retired athlete scrambling for relevance. She is married to an uber-wealthy tech founder and has amassed generational wealth of her own, yet her endorsements in recent years have increasingly tracked with the aesthetics of Silicon Valley affluence and a curated tradwife domesticity, a jarring turn for someone once defined by rebellion.As a Black woman in the public eye, Williams has always faced a disproportionate level of scrutiny over her body – her musculature, her curves, her clothing choices – scrutiny that her white peers rarely endured in both volume and scale. Chris Evert wrote her apatronizing open letterdoubting her commitment. Pat Cashdeclared her washed up(in 2007!).That grim history helps explain why many of her fans in friendly spaces likethe Shade Room commentsresponded with empathy, acknowledging both the hormonal struggles she described and the impossible double bind she has lived under: at once a legend who redefined beauty and power, and a woman relentlessly policed for the body that made her great. But still others lamented the disappearance of the muscular body she once defended, and suspected that she was reshaping herself, and her brand, to fit into that conventional mold.GLP-1 drugs can be life-changing for people with obesity or diabetes. But they also underscore grotesque inequality. Wealthy Americans spend thousands a month to stop snacking. But pharmacies ration supply and insurers refuse coverage. For critics, the glamorization of the practice by Williams, once the living rebuttal to those hierarchies, only deepens the inequity. Williams’s greatness on the court is beyond any credible dispute. But her embrace of GLP-1 culture is a reminder that even the most untouchable of legendscan be co-opted, and that in a society obsessed with shrinking, even our icons are made to disappear.Explore more on these topicsSerena WilliamsTennisUS sportsUS Open tennisUS Open Tennis 2025commentShareReuse this content"

If anything, it has only worsened it. Staff have routinely been paid late and Salford have had to let the majority of their first-team squad leave to stay afloat.They will rely predominantly on a squad of youngsters and loan players borrowed from other Super League clubs to get through to the end of the season. Their owners have not done a single public interview since arriving despite countless requests. That is only the tip of the iceberg. The takeover involved acquiring Salford Community Stadium and surrounding land. Clearing the club’s debts and stabilising it was part of the deal. So, when Salford city council walked away from a deal to sell the stadium to the club this summer, it left them in greater limbo than ever.Salford’s away support, among the best in Super League in recent years, has also been decimated – perhaps unsurprisingly given what they have been put through this season. But the couple of hundred who were at Leigh on Friday night certainly made themselves heard, with songs against the ownership group pre-match.On the field, their patched-up squad, which included nine loanees and some signed on the day of the game, did not disgrace themselves. They actually led Leigh at one stage here but you always felt that Leigh would eventually pull clear given their experience. That proved to be the case, with the Leopards winning 38-6 but Salford’s owners should look at how their players performed and be inspired to take action and save this famous club.Salford’s owners have promised for months that a multi-million pound bridging loan will arrive, which may tempt the council back into stadium talks, but it is nowhere to be seen. The Guardian has been told that Saia Kailahi and Curtis Brown, the two members of the consortium running the Red Devils day to day, are seriously considering stepping away in the near future.View image in fullscreenA Salford fans’ banner with a message to the owners during the Super League match at Wigan Warriors in May.Photograph: Alun Roberts/ProSports/ShutterstockThis is a club who finished fourth in Super League last year but, on the pitch, they are unrecognisable. All their best players have left for other clubs and insiders have insisted there are non-playing staff now considering doing the same, their wellbeing undone by continued uncertainty over whether they will be paid on time, or even at all.The situation will reach a head in the next fortnight. Salford have been using payday loan companies to meet the payroll. Debts are now understood to be in excess of £3m. The crucial bridging loan has been promised by the owners for months but now it simply has to arrive. If it does, then the projected plan is for Kailahi and Brown to move aside and bring in someone new to run the club.Salford staved off the threat of a winding-up order from HMRC earlier this year but they are in court again on 3 September when that petition will be heard. They also have another payroll to meet next week for August. Without that promised loan arriving and giving the Red Devils breathing space, things will take a turn for the worse.Political pressure is brewing too. A supporters’ group has been formed, with a protest taking place last Sunday despite the Wakefield game being off. Another will take place at their next home game. That group met the owners this week, and the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, is also determined to do the same to understand what happens next. A push to remove the owners is not inconceivable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

IMG’s gradings system – in which Salford were ranked 12th last year – will determine 12 of the 14 clubs that play in Super League in 2026, with the other two chosen by an independent panel.View image in fullscreenSalford fans still turned up to support their team last night, while also protesting against the owners.Photograph: Nigel French/PAPrivately, Salford expect to be outside the top 12 this year. They will be deducted points in their IMG ranking thanks to at least one breach of the Rugby Football League’s operational rules, and with Championship sides including York and Toulouse set to dramatically increase their score, it will leave Salford at the mercy of that aforementioned panel.The problem? The criteria for election to Super League will revolve heavily around long-term financial stability and detailed forecasts. The Red Devils will apply to be part of the process, the Guardian has been told, but there is an acceptance they have next to no chance of being considered. So it is likely life next season will be in the Championship, and that is the best-case scenario. The alternative is almost unthinkable, 150 years of history disappearing.Salford will continue to fulfil their games, as the sport scrambles them through to the end of this campaign to avoid a logistical and reputational disaster. But the real story, the future facing the club, is now only days away from becoming clear.Explore more on these topicsSalford Red DevilsSuper LeagueRugby leaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But while it was very much Plan A from the rider’s point of view, the dedication required to get Asfoora spot-on for this high-speed dash down the Knavesmire should not be underestimated.Her attempt to win the King Charles III Stakes at Royal Ascot in June for the second year running had ended in valiant defeat, while Asfoora was still not quite at her peak for the King George Stakes at Goodwood in August. Yet Dwyer and Chenelle Ellis, Asfoora’s groom, work rider and near-constant companion since their arrival in Britain in May, retained full faith in her ability.“Last year we had it easy in the sense that we had so much time over here before going to Ascot,” Ellis said. “This year has been a little bit harder given that we were only here two weeks before Ascot. She’s just taken a bit longer to come to hand, but I knew after Goodwood that she was going very well.“I’ve been looking after her since she arrived, I’m here until she goes home and I’m just happy to be here. I said after galloping on Tuesday morning that I don’t think they’re going to beat her, and she deserves it more than anything.”Asfoora could now extend her time in the northern hemisphere with a trip to Ireland for the Flying Five on Irish Champions Weekend next month, while Declan Carroll, who took the Gimcrack Stakes with Lifeplan, also has Group One ambitions for his winner on the Friday card. Carroll’s 40-horse Yorkshire stable had the ante-post favourite for the Gimcrack back in 2017 in Santry, only to lose the promising colt in a gallops accident a few days before the race.Eight years on, Lifeplan gave the trainer a first-ever win at Group Two level, and the son of Kodi Bear is now around the 8-1 mark for the Group One Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket next month.“I thought it was a stiff task after just winning a novice to come into a Group Two, but he’s very streetwise,” Carroll said.“He could be a Guineas horse, I guess, he’s in the Middle Park and that may be his next step, but I’d want a bit of ease in the ground.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowNewmarket1.25 Words Of Truth 2.00 Liv My Life 2.35 Harswell Ruby 3.10 Perfect Location 3.45 Arqoob 4.20 Hk FourteenGoodwood1.30 Wetsand 2.05 Rhoscolyn 2.40 Crystal Flyer 3.15 Dreamasar 3.50 Pink Lily 4.25 Autumn’s Breeze 5.00 Dream ComposerYork1.50 Gladius 2.25 Tarriance 3.00 Never So Brave 3.35 Majestic Warrior (nap) 4.10 Pocklington (nb) 4.45 Revival Power 5.20 Marhaba GhaiyyathCartmel2.10 Ambassador 2.45 Restandbethankful 3.20 Dusky Days 3.55 At Vimeiro 4.30 Lightening Company 5.05 Beny Nahar Road 5.35 La QuariteWindsor5.15 Amazonian Dream 5.45 Division 6.15 Caviar Heights 6.45 Military Order 7.15 Mafnood 7.45 Clipsham NobleRedcar5.30 Princess Niyla 6.00 Wonderful Friend 6.30 Eternal Force 7.00 Hale End 7.30 Dandy Dinmont 8.00 Golden ProsperityWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Majestic Warrior primed for EborWillie Mullins, the champion trainer over jumps from his base in County Carlow, has become a major player too in the big staying handicaps on the Flat and holds a strong hand in Saturday’s Ebor Handicap at York with the first two names in the betting.Hipop De Loire, the 7-2 favourite, has unfinished business on the Knavesmire after getting no luck in running on the way to a fifth-place finish when fancied for this race last year.He is 4lb higher in the weights this time around, however, after what was ultimately a four-and-a-half-length defeat, while Mullins’s Ethical Diamond, the 6-1 second pick, landed a 12-furlong handicap at Royal Ascot last time out, but is up 8lb in the weights as a result.Two lightly raced five-year-olds, Majestic Warrior and Shadow Dance, make more appeal, and at the likely prices,Majestic Warrior(3.35) could be a big each-way runner at around 16-1.James Tate’s runner has just four races in the book having missed last season, but he looked a long way ahead of his mark when successful on his only outing this term back in April.

I am ready to figure out what we are doing and get a team together.”Bradley is due huge credit for his candour. A second round of 64 at the Tour Championship boosted his case to become the first Ryder Cup playing captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963. Bradley, who was 11th in the US rankings heading into the Atlanta event, will name his six wildcards on Wednesday.McIlroy provides thrills but Henley leads Tour Championship after 61Read more“I am very well aware that no matter what decision I make, I am going to be defined by it,” Bradley said. “If we win, it doesn’t matter what I do. I am fine with that, normally if you win you are the best captain and when you lose you are the worst. I have been a part of teams.“Every captain has to make tough decisions, this is just a unique one. It is going to be controversial either way but I am ready for it. This is the biggest decision of my life.”Bradley has also emphasised the big picture is uppermost in his thoughts. The US are seeking to regain the trophythey lost in Rometwo years ago. “I really don’t care if I play and lose all five matches or if I don’t play,” said the 39-year-old. “As long as we win on Sunday. Any decision we make is with that in mind. This is about what we think will win us the Ryder Cup.”Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa are almost certain to take two of Bradley’s selections for the tournament from 26-28 September. Both were in attendance as the US held a Ryder Cup team dinner in Atlanta on Tuesday. Patrick Cantlay’s involvement at Bethpage is also highly likely. Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Sam Burns and Maverick McNealy are the others who are part of the discussion alongside Bradley himself. Griffin’s chances are the strongest among that set.View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood has led a PGA Tour event at halfway seven times but is still to win one.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APBradley’s six-under-par second round came despite huge distraction. “It is very difficult,” he added. “I am having a really hard time right now separating my captaincy and my play. For the past month it has been like this. This week I am trying so hard [to focus] but it [the Ryder Cup] is all I am thinking about. Pairings, certain things I want to say to the guys during the week … it is just difficult.“I have been in the position before of trying to make the team, it is just really strange being the captain. I don’t think anyone has ever gone through this.”It therefore seems to naturally follow that playing at the same time as leading the team would add a fresh level of stress. “ It would be difficult,” said Bradley. “It is doable though. I have got incredible vice-captains and people to lean on. I will cross that bridge if it comes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The man himself insisted that need not be altogether relevant. “It means a lot but I don’t think it counts,” Bradley said. “We have to get together with vice-captains and look at what has gone on, look at the data and make a decision based on what is best for the team. That stuff certainly feels nice for me but when we look at me as a player, we talk as if I am not in the room. We look at the stats, the data and I am player X. That is strange but if there are negatives about me playing, I want to hear those.“I feel like I am still one of the best players in the world so I figured the likelihood of me being completely out of the picture was slim. I had an inkling so we have been preparing for this. It certainly would be a lot easier if I was top six or completely out of it.”Tommy Fleetwood’s latest bid for an overdue victory on American soil has him tied for the lead with Russell Henley at the halfway point at East Lake. Fleetwood’s 63 and Henley’s 66 left the pair at 13 under. Young is two strokes back, with Cantlay alongside Robert MacIntyre at minus 10. “I actually feel like I’ve played very, very well when I have led tournaments and been in contention,” Fleetwood said.“It’s just I might have not got things right at the end. It’s not like I’ve crashed and burned. It’s just that I’ve not quite finished things off.“The people that win the most are the guys that are in contention the most. That’s just what I want to do. That’s where I want to be. I love the buzz when I am in contention.”Explore more on these topicsGolfRyder CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But I will probably ride a few more Tours. It’s the biggest race and I doubt the team will leave me out.”With the intense transfer speculation surrounding Remco Evenepoel having ended – the Olympic road and time trial champion will join Red Bull Bora-Hansgrohe next season – the Belgian is skipping the Vuelta in favour of next month’s Tour of Britain.For Vingegaard, who needs to revive a career that is in danger of withering on the vine through a growing sense of inconsistency and underachievement, the Vuelta presents an ideal opportunity.But even without Pogacar starting, the greatest threat to him is likely to come from the Slovenian’s UAE Emirates team, who have Juan Ayuso and João Almeida in their lineup.The 22-year-old Ayuso has all the qualities to win a Grand Tour but has yet to deliver, while Almeida, who crashed out of the Tour, is another rider who excels in shorter stage races, but seems less sure of himself over three weeks.Others, including the Briton Tom Pidcock, are seeing the Vuelta’s mix of steep, sharp climbs and technical sprints as a chance to further enhance their season. Pidcock began the year duelling with Pogacar at Strade Bianche and is among the pack of opportunists seeking both stage wins and a strong overall finish.View image in fullscreenTom Pidcock will be eager to put in a strong race after missing the Tour de France.Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty ImagesThe 26-year-old, whose Q36.5 team did not qualify for the Tour de France but who finished 16th in this year’s Giro d’Italia, said that he is “curious to see what I can do in the general classification”. That marks a shift in mentality for the double Olympic gold medallist, who in the past admitted that he didn’t see himself as having the necessary mindset for such a goal.Pidcock’s former team Ineos Grenadiers come to the Vuelta led by the 2019 yellow jersey winner Egan Bernal, and hoping to build on their two stage wins in July’s Tour, while also avoiding any more revelations centred on theunder-investigation carer David Rozman.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf Bernal is to reach the podium in Madrid, he will need to race with a more strategic mindset than he did in May’s Giro, when an erratic performance took him to seventh overall, the team’s best result in a Grand Tour since Geraint Thomas finished third in the 2024 edition of the Italian race.But, having missed out on snagging Evenepoel, the British team continue to lag behind the big three, Vingegaard’s Visma–Lease a Bike, Pogacar’s UAE Emirates and Evenepoel’s new sponsor, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe.Dave Brailsford has reportedly frozen all transfer activity and, even if the soon-to-be-retired Thomas imminently assumes a managerial role within the Grenadiers, the often-cited “period of transition” continues.This being the Tour of Spain, the race begins, of course, in Italy, with an opening quartet of stages zigzagging from Turin to Novara and then across to France, before a long transfer to Figueres, where the convoy finally reaches Spain.A team time trial, an individual time trial and six summit finishes, including the dreaded climbs of Angliru and the teetering Bola del Mundo, are allied to the usual smattering of tricky hilly stages and fast sprints.As usual, the decisive moments will come in the steepest mountains, ostensibly Vingegaard’s forte. In the absence of the rider regularly touted as the “GOAT”, it will be down to the Dane to seize the day.Explore more on these topicsVuelta a EspañaCyclingJonas VingegaardTadej PogacarTeam IneosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A wealth tax really is her only viable optionFaiza ShaheenThe alternatives for the UK chancellor are either unworkable or risk losing Labour votes, so here’s what she should tryFri 22 Aug 2025 11.33 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.18 EDTShareDepending on whose forecasts you believe, in the autumn budget the UK chancellor needs to find£25-£50bnto cover day-to-day spending, let alone to raise the extra funds needed to turnaround crumbling public services or end the two-child benefit cap. Rachel Reeves is bound by a manifesto commitment not to raise the big three – income tax, national insurance or VAT – and having already slapped businesseswith a national insurance risein her inaugural budget last year, she faces having to think about creative ways to raise revenue.The past few weeks, we have seen a bewildering parade of policies emerging from Treasury sources. These includereforms to inheritance tax,replacing stamp dutywith a national proportional property tax for homes worth more than £500,000, replacing council tax with a local proportional property tax levied on house values up to £500,000 with a minimum annual bill of £800 paid by the property owner, and apotential capital gains tax (CGT)on primary residences valued at more than £1.5m.The government is right that Britain’s property tax system is in desperate need of reform. The current council tax system is regressive and outdated, based on property values from 1991, and stamp duty is a punitive brake on mobility. However, the solutions being floated risk creating new problems while failing to solve the old ones.Take the proposed mansion tax by another name: a CGT on primary homes worth more than £1.5m. In principle, it targets unearned wealth gains on the most valuable properties. But once you do the maths, its flaws become glaringly apparent. Unlike second homes or buy-to-lets, a primary residence has always been exempt from CGT. Introducing it would create a huge disincentive for people to sell. It would trap older homeowners in houses too large for them, stifling the property market for families below.Otherproposalsthe government is looking at, including a new tax on homes sold for more than £500,000, are thin on detail. (Although they are reportedly underpinned by a wider set of reforms in apaper from the thinktank Onward.) The tax would only kick in once you sell; it is not yet clear how this would differ substantially from stamp duty.In this same set of proposals, a £500,000 threshold is also applied for those paying more towards a new property tax that would replace council tax. Such a threshold risks many ordinary people who own their properties in London and the south-east struggling to pay. For renters, this new property tax is paid by the owner. However, there is no modelling on probable ripple effects on rental prices. Making London even more unaffordable to live in will not help Reeves’s economic growth prospects in the short term.Adding council tax bands for the most expensive homes is a potential short-term solution to help ease the inherent unfairness at the top, but it would not address regional price disparities. There are more progressive approaches to council tax, such as those set out byFairer Share, which advocates for an annual flat-rate tax that would see the wealthiest pay more and any increase in local taxes capped to protect the “asset-rich cash-poor”.Here is the crucial issue with the focus on property taxes: while most people hold their wealth primarily in their property, the richest do not. A 2020 study by the Resolution Foundation, using data from 2016 to 2018, found that on average in households with assets of £5m or more, property accountedfor less than 20% of their total wealth. Instead, the wealth of the top 1% is dominated by stocks, shares, bonds and other financial investments. Financial wealth is significantly more prevalent in the wealthiest households and is a major driver of their rising net worth and inequality.Inheritance tax does take forms of wealth beyond property into account, but here we come up against a significant political barrier. Understandably, people have an emotional connection with wanting to leave their homes to their kids, particularly amid a housing affordability crisis that has for many made it close to impossible to get on the property ladder without family support. Both the design and the communications of any reforms to this tax must focus on truly large dynastic wealth – by reforming the sorts of trusts that allowed the previousDuke of Westminster to pass on £9bnto his son without paying inheritance tax – rather than the modest wealth of ordinary families, otherwise it risks a huge political fallout.Why radical tax reform may be only way for Reeves to balance the booksRead moreThis brings us back to a straightforward annual wealth tax. A modest levy of 2% on individual net wealth exceeding £10m. It is focused on inequality. It would raise substantial revenue; estimates suggestmore than £24bn annually.And crucially, it applies to total net wealth (including assets such as stocks, bonds and property, minus debts). And no – well-designed wealth taxes in Europe have not caused the capital flight critics often prophesied, and dodgy data flouted in recent months has been found to bewildly exaggerated. The political argument is just as powerful. Polling consistently shows it is very popular, with75% of the public backing a wealth tax, including Reform UK voters.Of course, given that we don’t know the full value of what the richest have, there are administrative hurdles, but these are not insurmountable. The chancellor should announce more resources for HMRC to do the much-needed scoping work, and we can learn lessons from wealth taxes in comparable European countries.People in the UK need to feel a real improvement to their quality of life. If they don’t, this government simply won’t last long enough to bring in any of the changesit is proposing. Instead of tinkering around the edges, with a wealth tax the government could win the argument on fairness – and finally start to reverse toxic wealth inequality in this country.Faiza Shaheen is executive director ofTaxJustice UKDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ensuring safety is now part of the jobFri 22 Aug 2025 05.23 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 06.13 EDTShareIn today’s social media age, one version of events spreads like wildfire. So it is fast becoming accepted in the national conversation that all men risking life and limb to cross the Channel in flimsy vessels are dangerous people who are likely to abuse women and girls. The leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch,went so far as to saythat, because of rising numbers coming in small boats, women had “stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes”.As the political rhetoric has become more toxic, andespecially this week, the real-world consequences for those inside the hotels and for organisations like my own and many others in the charity and statutory sector become more dire.The plight of the asylum seekers themselves must stay front and centre. On the street they have faced verbal abuse and hostility. Shouts of “Go home, scumbag” and more hate-filled language are not uncommon. I met an African man in his 60s living in the north-east recently who in May, not long after theprime minister told the country“we risk becoming an island of strangers”, was set upon by a group of men and suffered a broken arm. He was so terrified he didn’t want to leave his accommodation for weeks on end.But the threats are not just aimed at them; also being targeted are those who seek to help them. Thinking about personal safety at work has become part and parcel of the job. I am now even being advised to consider my own home security. This was unimaginable nearly five years ago, when I started my role.At the Refugee Council we work in communities with refugees including on some allotments, where they love to grow food. In one northern town, well before the riots last summer that saw asylum seekersburned outof a Rotherham hotel, ours was the only allotment patch that was firebombed one night. We now tell staff not to wear their lanyards, so they’re not visible when out and about as they’ve had abusive comments.View image in fullscreenFire at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, 26 November 2024.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAWe aren’t alone. Far-right influencers are targeting the refugee sector, posting pictures of chief executives and naming them. Leaders in recent weeks have had to come to terms with a new normal whereby they have to think about their and their staff’s safety both on and offline.Some of the organisations targeted are small and community-rooted without the capability and infrastructure of larger organisations to put in place sophisticated risk assessments and security procedures.And then there are the lone individuals who want to threaten and scare us. I know of leaders not just in the charity sector but also in the statutory sector who have received threatening handwritten messages saying they and their families aren’t safe.Those who have worked with refugees for decades tell me they have never known a time when the hostility has been so strong and the environment so toxic. And it ripples out so that support which would be in place is withdrawn. I’ve been told about food banks that did provide assistance to any person who needed it turning away people they believe to be “foreigners” with no right to be in the UK.Hidden from public view, the poisoned political environment on asylum is having consequences not seen before. The narrative that refugees and migrants are the root of all our problems means that they and those who work with them are firmly in the line of fire, seen as legitimate daily targets of hate.It is not too late, however, to pull back from the brink. There is a role for government: to try to neutralise the toxicity by not only focusing on fixing the dysfunctional and costly asylum system, but also by articulating a pride in Britain that celebrates our diversity and integration story. One that saw Mo Farah,himself a victim of traffickingwho was given safety in our country, proudly wrap himself in the union jack every time he won one of his Olympic gold medals.We have a choice. As a nation, we can drift further into a world of division and hate. Or we can celebrate British values of fairness, tolerance and compassion, and focus on the importance of a shared community that so many Britons believe in.The direction of travel our prime minister and his government choose to take feels more important than it has ever been in the seven decades of the Refugee Council’s history. We look to our political leaders to do far more to bring an end to the division and hate and say clearly: this is not who we are.Enver Solomon is chief executive of the Refugee CouncilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It seems to come round quicker every year. Possibly that should be “more quickly”. Their grammarian splinter group will let me know.Far more so than birthdays or adventures in HRT, this event is a great measure of how functionally old you are. How much of the world do you, quite literally, still understand? I have heard of, and indeed enjoy though have never personally deployed, “delulu” – a play on “delusional”. “Tradwife”, too – which is the practice of monetising all the most boring bits of motherhood and domesticity on Instagram, under the guise of upholding conservative tradition. I like to think that among tradwives themselves it also carries the meaning of “socking all the proceeds away in a secret bank account and taking off for Costa Rica the minute the last child turns 18”, but I have yet to confirm.Then things get harder. “Mouse jiggler” is more innocuous than I first feared and just about inferable (software that makes it look like you are still working if you are not in the office but likely to be remotely observed) but “skibidi” defeated me. It’s a YouTuber’s coinage, and seems to mean everything and nothing. Only those born to the skibidi can use it properly. And that is as it should be. The words “bath chair”, “tartan rug” and “Werther’s Originals” remain for the rest of us.TuesdaySpare a thought for the poor Prince and Princess of Wales, soon to be up to their eyes in packing tape and cardboard boxes as theyprepare to movefrom Adelaide Cottage on the Windsor Great Park estate to Forest Lodge on … the Windsor Great Park estate.Nothing says “I live a life unimaginably distant from yours” than a) the ability to move house at whim and b) to one that’s essentially in the same garden. Yes, there’s an extra four bedrooms in it for them (otherwise it’d just be another cottage, not a lodge, duh!), but imagine a normal doing the equivalent and going to all the expense and stress to move a few doors up the road. Although take away the stamp duty, the unreliable movers, the crippling solicitor’s fees, the dealing with utility companies and estate agents – oh, and the sale price, which I didn’t so much forget as find myself unable to conceive of living a life without – and the whole thing becomes instantly feasible.

Get rid of that sofa, that abomination, and then – then I will come in and we can talk.’Photograph: ABACA/ShutterstockWednesdayAre you an otrovert? Why this personality type could be your greatest giftRead moreAnother new word is upon us! What a week we’re having!This time it is “otrovert”. I thought at first it might be something to do with non-innocuous mouse-jiggling, but no. It is a term coined by the American psychiatrist Rami Kaminski for people “whose fundamental orientation is defined by the fact that it is rarely the same direction that anyone else is facing”. (He’s written a book about them.) Oh, for heaven’s sake. That’s mostly just your common-or-garden introvert in a world that’s largely extrovert and they’re just facing into a book – leave them alone. The remainder are simple contrarians, the most wearisome people in the world. They see a received opinion and immediately set themselves mindlessly up against it.ThursdaySpeaking of Jungian archetypes as we tangentially were,researchers are claimingthat almost every activity is more enjoyable in company – even reading. Which is just more blatant propaganda from Big Extrovert bent on destroying the last havens of peace for those who don’t follow their busy, cacophonous lead.We have to start pushing back at this point. We can attack the new contention on any number of grounds. On the practical: is farting better in company? It’s funnier, sure, at least for the farter – but beyond that? And even for the detonator, the law of diminishing returns sets in pretty quickly. On the philosophical: can masturbation, for example, truly be said to be taking place in company? Does it not become subsumed within exhibitionism? And on the methodological: this study was carried out using only American subjects, citizens of the most extrovert, camera-ready nation on earth. To take them as representative samples of humanity is a very great mistake.View image in fullscreenStormtrooper: ‘This is CLEARLY not Tatooine, you planks. Try again.’Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersFridayCommon sense and a small understanding of probability theory tells us it is technically possible – but still. No one really thinks they will live to experience it but on the way backfrom Edinburgh, where I’d been talking aboutmy new book(Bookish – available in all good bookshops and maybe some bad ones too, if there is such a thing), I did. I had a perfect train journey.No, honestly. I’ve no reason to lie. I thought all my travel luck had been used up when the 11.05 arrived on time. But then I got on and reservation screens were working and my seat had not been taken. The lady next to me was a reader and knitter. We smiled at each other as I sat down, and that was the full extent of our interaction over the next three and a half hours. During which: nobody yelled into a phone; the few children there played quietly together at their tables; the air conditioning worked and kept us at a comfortable instead of sub-arctic temperature. And the buffet was open.This really happened. I feel I am going to pay for it somehow in the next few days – I am constantly checking the cats for signs of illness and my bank account for fraud – but until then, I shall revere the memory.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekMonarchyEdinburgh festival 2025Rail travelSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Ellie – as councillor, MEP and MP – has encouraged young people’s involvement, pushing for youth inclusion on local boards, taking groups to the EU and Westminster parliaments, and setting up the West Midlands Youth Climate Assembly.Zack Polanski: Inspire them. Listen to them. Involve them.Young people face stagnant wages, high costs and the climate crisis. Why would they engage unless they can feel it makes a real difference? We need every young person to experience their power early on – through local campaigns, climate action or activism. As deputy leader, I’ve consistently amplified youth voices. As leader, I’ll turn the volume up.Danny Braverman:I’m disappointed with both responses. Representative democracy will not motivate the very many disengaged young people. Radicalism lies in participatory democracy, such asregional youth citizens assemblies.I’d like to see Zach as the new leader. He’s the nearest to my own politics. I’d describe myself as a watermelon: green on the outside, red on the inside, with some black anarchist pips for good measure.What role does class have in your understanding of the world?Simon Legg, 71, FelixstoweEC & AR:The widening inequality and deepening poverty that blight so many lives are so clearly linked to the concentration of more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands. Those with the least are the first to be hit hard by climate breakdown, and a just transition to a zero-carbon world can’t happen without much greater redistribution of wealth. At the heart of Green politics – and our personal values – is a commitment to the fundamental equality of all people, to breaking down barriers and sharing resources fairly. Politics is how we can reverse the market’s tendency to concentrate wealth and power.ZP:Class is central. Without fair wages, resources and skills, other inequalities persist. We must be rooted in working-class communities. People know that the super rich and corporations are destroying our environment, communities and democracies. This isn’t “us v them” – it’s all of us, building change from the grassroots up.Simon Legg:These are decent answers to a questionthat could legitimately be answered in innumerable ways.If the Greens were in a position to join a coalition government, what policies would you insist were adopted?Hana Prosser, 56, OxfordEC & AR:With the political landscape shifting at incredible speed, we see this as an entirely possible scenario. We’d focus on three things: electoral reform, fair taxation of extreme wealth to invest in public services, and strong climate and nature action. The introduction of a proportional voting system would be a complete game changer, and we’d want this to be a red line in negotiations. First past the post leaves millions of people feeling unrepresented, driving cynicism and disillusionment with politics – which are deeply corrosive to democracy. It also raises the risk of an extremist government elected on a minority of votes.ZP:A wealth tax to tackle inequality.Proportional representation (PR) so every vote counts.Serious climate action, starting with a nationwide home-insulation rollout.These are red lines about fairness, democracy and a liveable planet.Hana Prosser: 10/10 for ambition! I appreciateZack identifying specific policy actions. But are three red lines realistic? I fear the Greens either presenting an indigestible package deal to coalition partners or, once in government, becoming Lib Dem-style hostages to fortune.Ellie and Adrian’s single red line – PR – seems more credible.Polls suggest the new party being formed by Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana could secure 10% of the vote. Should the Greens explore a pact with it?David Lowry, 68, EwellEC & AR:We’re always ready to work constructively with other parties where we agree, and often do so in parliament – including with Jeremy and Zarah. We’re open in principle to electoral alliances to stop Reform UK, but this would need to be a wider collaboration to be effective. And unless there are clear commitments to a fair voting system, and to tackling the climate and nature crises, there will be major differences between us. It’s crucial for the Green party to keep its distinctive identity, offering a genuinely fresh vision of a fairer, greener country with much broader appeal than an old left party.ZP:I have huge respect for both Zarah and Jeremy and have shared many platforms with them for a whole variety of campaigns – most recently against the genocide in Gaza. But the party doesn’t exist yet, so it’s far too soon for electoral pacts. Right now we need coalitions of ideas, working with anyone who shares our values of environmental, social, racial and economic justice. I do already consider them allies – the actual fight must be against Reform UK and this failing Labour government.David Lowry: I think the concerns of Ellie and Adrian that the new progressive party might not support a fair voting system are misplaced. It is in their own electoral interest to do so.Climate change and biodiversity loss are likely to result in medical crises against which the UK has little defence. How do you plan to mitigate them?Rajarshi Raychaudhuri, 58, DudleyEC & AR:We need to treat the climate and nature emergencies as the public health threats they are – and that means action across all areas of society and theeconomy. We’re already pressing hard for these: affordable, warm, net-zero housing for all, resilient to overheating and to flooding; good public transport, and safe walking and cycling; sustainable, healthy food systems. Tackling the climate crisis means fixing our food, housing and transport systems and more – doing this will hugely increase our resilience and health, as well as directly reducing emissions. Building resilience to climate impacts is vital to our national security.ZP:I’ve chaired the environment committee in the London Assembly for the past few years and produced a report with University College London which includes recommendations for mitigation of emissions and climate adaptation.We need to make sure active travel and public transport are properly resourced, the cheapest option and accessible to all.We need to make sure that we’re also building the infrastructure we need to tackle climate disasters such as wildfires and floods, including nature-friendly solutions.And we needto co-design (including usingcitizens assemblies) so people are involved with the decision-making process rather than have things done to them.Rajarshi Raychaudhuri: My question dealt specifically with climate change, biodiversity loss and a medical catastrophe,like the Covid-19 pandemic, which was more likelya result of biodiversity loss than US scaremongering. I note that the answer, while apparently audacious and impressive, doesnotdeal with the question. However, having been an enthusiastic environmental activist in my youth, I continue to hope. I shall certainly follow the progress of the candidates with great interest.If 50% of the electorate believes a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote, how would you convince people that a vote for Green wouldn’t be a vote for Reform UK?Adam Butlin, 26, LondonEC & AR:Such arguments have been used to prop up the failed two-party system for decades. Now it’s blown wide open, and there are huge opportunities for the Greens. Under Carla Denyer and Adrian’s leadership, we’ve shown we can win parliamentary seats everywhere, from big cities to rural constituencies. In local elections we’ve gained every year for the past eight years, and Green councillors have earned strong trust. Voters can now see clearly that if you vote Green, we can win Green. That appeals not just to those disillusioned with the old politics but to all those hopeful for a greener, fairer future.ZP:We now have four MPs, three London Assembly members and more than 800 councillors. We got nearly 2 million votes and 39 second-place finishes – we’re planning to turn them into MPs at the next general election. My central mission is to make Keir Starmer more worried about losing votes and ultimately losing more seats to the Green party than to Reform UK. Until he feels that electoral pressure from his left, this country will continue to veer to the right. It seems that no marginalised group is off the table for cruelty. We stop that happening right now by growing the Green party.Adam Butlin: I personally preferred Zack’s response, butall the candidates have clearly addressed the central point of my question, emphasising both recent electoral successes and the potential for political leverage over the mainstream parties. I can only hope that voters also see the strategic impact of voting Green.Should the UK have a fairer immigration system? Under present rules I would not have been able to come with my husband because then he did not earn £38,000Patricia Jephson, 41, WorcesterEC & AR:Generations of immigrants have made a huge contribution – culturally and economically – to our national life. We’re proud to celebrate this and condemn the demonisation of migrants by the media and politicians, which is driving racist hate. We want to see a humane system of managed immigration and are opposed to rules that discriminate on the grounds of income or impose unreasonable costs on people who move here. This is not only unfair but it also ignores the fact that many currently low-paid jobs – in social care, for instance – are actually far more socially valuable than many higher-paid jobs – say in banking.ZP:We need to tell the truth. With an ageing population, we badly need migration. Of course we should also train up British workers, but it doesn’t have to be an either/or.If you use the NHS, theperson who cares for youis more likely to be a migrant than anyone in front of you in the queue.And the unfair rules around visas just cause unnecessary stress on families kept apart for absolutely no reason but to appease the right. The real problem in our country is not migrants but years of austerity under both Conservative and Labour governments.Patricia Jephson: I have heard no end of nonsense from the Conservative and now Labour representatives in my area regarding immigration, which is one of the reasons why I joined the Green party.I am glad thatEllie, Adrian and Zack all value immigrants and our contributions to our adopted home, the UK.Should the UK rejoin the European single market and customs union?Richard Norton, 55, RochesterEC & AR:Rejoining the customs union is one of many win-win steps we should be taking immediately towards undoing the economic damage done by Brexit and rebuilding our relationship with our nearest neighbours. The single market is trickier – there would clearly be major economic benefits, but as non-EU members we wouldn’t have a say in making its rules. In the long term, we believe Britain’s best future is in the EU family of sovereign nations, and Brexit is now seen as a bad mistake by most people in the UK. It’s not a mistake that’s irreversible when political conditions are right.ZP:There’s no area of our life that Brexit has improved – it’s been an absolute disaster. We also know that, in poll after poll, even people who voted forBrexit now regret it. I don’t think Europe is perfect, and there are huge changes I want to see, but ultimately I think we’d be a lot better in rather than out. And a natural first step to that is to rejoin the customs union. The single market would only make sense if we were re-entering anyway.Richard Norton: I’d likethe candidates’ positions to feel more proactive – to shape politics, not wait for “conditions”. Our economy, society, young people and environment deserve a future without the contamination of Brexit.Explore more on these topicsGreen partyThe panelElectoral reformcommentShareReuse this content"

Think of it as the Mirror Universe version of when Tony Abbott appointed himself Minister for Women, except this time a feminist champions men’s social health and, you know, actually likes you.This week, the male friendship recession is our subject of shared concern. The Guardian reported a month ago concerning data from (where else?) America, which spoke to an observabledecline in the prevalence of male friendship, with some notable demographic implications.Datafrom the Survey Center on American Life revealed 15% of men said they didn’t have “close friends” in 2021, compared with only 3% in 1990 while those reporting 10 or more close friends had decreased from 33% to 13% during the same period.Acknowledging that these figures were skewed by more male loneliness among heterosexual men than their gay brothers, the Guardian interviewed men working to facilitate male friendship outside the “third spaces” of congregation, activity and entertainment outside the home and work that queer male communities built for themselves.Creating better infrastructure for heterosexual male socialisation is a public health necessity, given that the isolation and loneliness reported in the wake of shrinking friendship networks has dire health implications. You can truststudiesthat repeatedly demonstrate that “those who experience social deficits, including isolation, loneliness, and poor-quality relationships, are more likely to die earlier, regardless of the cause of death”, or you can remember how mad we all went during Covid lockdowns and just imagine that being the rest of your life.Labor MP Dan Repacholi on masculinity, men’s health and why he was ‘embarrassed’ to visit his doctorRead moreSadly, the figures in Australia seem to be following the US pattern, withstudies from 2020showing similar implications: “men who reported lacking close friends or relatives were around twice as likely to have thought about suicide in the past 12 months”. Otherlocal studiesexposedthe loneliest age group of Australian men was middle aged (35-49 years), who were “three times more likely to feel high-level loneliness than men aged over 65”.It’s this demographic distinction amid rates of friendship decline that underscore how the phenomenon isn’t rooted in biological destiny, but rather in the way western culture’s changing paradigms of masculinity straitjacket modern straight men into rituals and behaviours that denude them of connections and expose them to harm.Patriarchy – spoiler – is bad for men, too.Claims that men struggle to form friendships because of traditions of stoic masculinity’s model of consistently performed toughness and invulnerability do not really square with older generations of men having more friends and being more socially integrated, when performances of toughness in previous eras included resolving conflicts through violence and conscription in actual war. My grandad saw active service in the second world war and was, by all reports, great fun at a party.Claims that work obligations make it hard to find time to socialise also do not hold up to scrutiny because women of the same generational experience maintain powerful social connections despite their double modern burden of meeting work and care commitments.Clearly, what we are doing to the loneliest cohort is cultural but also new. And it’s becoming more of a problem: a shocking 25% of US boys and men aged 15 to 35 reported “feeling lonely for a lot of the previous day” as per a recentGallup poll.Are young women finally being spared the unique cruelty of male literary opinions? | Van BadhamRead moreIt’s tempting to blame technology – but how do we explain the fact that women, girls and gay men have the same technology available to them but don’t seem to suffer the same misery? This also goes for the shrinking “third space” thesis, in which the fading social associations built around church attendance, union membership, and community and sporting clubs have impeded social connections, again, disproportionately.Rather, we might consider that an intersecting number of cultural changes are meeting new variations of old gender roles in a particularly destructive way, and with fewer social points of connection to bulwark men against them.If there is an explanation for the “skibidi toilet” theory of young male social detachment, in which “hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online” we can reasonably assume its generation “fluent in irony but starved for meaning” has been created from specific gender targeting that niche marketing delivers through the internet and other media, affirming and amplifying the kind of gender role modelling through which parents – often unwittingly – channel their children into by, for example, reading to their girls but not their boys.For young men, whether it’s selling gaming consoles, supplements or Andrew Tate hate material, the convenient marketing message is instrumentalisation is more valuable to men than friendship.This is to apportion zero blame to parents, given that parenting is hard and as subject to the forces of history as any other institution. It’s not only the bloody internet and ruthless marketeers and capitalist labour exploitation that have encouraged the desocialisation of men. It’s not only the prevalence of technology. It’s that the pre-internet “Satanic Panic” disinformation event of the 1980s fostered a “stranger danger” anxiety that relocated children from open world roaming to controlled environments, in which messaging – loaded with old gendered instructions and new microtargeting – can assume more heft than lived experience.The children of the Satanic Panic generation are the lonely middle age men of today. Their isolation suggests the real “stranger danger” was who we let into the house.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

But the US transformation calls for a Finland-style approachFri 22 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.29 EDTShareThe secondTrump administrationhas been worse thanCanada’s worst nightmare. The largest military force in the history of the world, across a largely undefended border, is suddenly under the command of a president who has called for our annexation. Canada could not be less prepared. The possibility of American aggression has been so remote, for so long, that the idea has not been seriously considered in living memory. Donald Trump has focused oneconomic rather than military pressure, but the new tone in Washington is finally forcing Canada to ask itself the most basic question: how do we defend ourselves?For most other countries in the world, self-defence is the key to national identity. Canada’s immense good fortune has been that we haven’t really needed a strong military to build our country. In the war of 1812, we were British, and the British kept us alive because we were British. There hasn’t been an attack on our homeland since. Confederation, the founding of the country, was the result of a political negotiation rather than a conquest or a violent independence movement. Our military was based on a fundamental assumption about our place in the world, and the nature of the world itself. Our place in the world was to contribute to the global order. The global order shared our fundamental values. Peacekeeping was more our style than defense.Recently, I’ve been working onGloves Off, a podcast about how Canada can protect itself from any threat emanating from the US, and from every other country in the world now that the US is no longer our protector and guardian. The consensus from military and security experts is that we would be “a snack”.It is far from unusual for countries sliding toward authoritarianism, such as the the United States, to use foreign engagements to justify the suspension of their own laws.Trumphas already started trumping up crazy excuses for anti-Canadian sentiment – a supposed flow offentanylover theborderand othernonsense. His ambassador says Trump thinks our boycotts make us“nasty” to deal with.So what does Canada need to do to develop the capacity to defend itself?The good news is that Canada’s new reality is far from unique. In fact, it’s the historical norm.Finlandis a potential model for us. It has lived its entire existence next to a belligerent country that is either expanding imperially or collapsing dangerously. The Finns do not have nuclear weapons. They are only 5.5 million people, next to Russia’s 143 million.The period we are entering is a period of deep chaos. Any reliance on international institutions and their restoration is a false hopeFinland’s strategy is whole society defence. Matti Pesu, a senior research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, and a reserve commander of an armoured personnel carrier, explained that whole society defence does not pretend to be able to overcome a potential Russian onslaught. “Power asymmetry is an absolutely essential factor in the Finnish security thinking,” he told me. “Given how much bigger Russia is, in order to thwart that potential threat, we need to mobilize broadly the resources available in society.”Because Finland is geared, throughout its national institutions, towards self-defence, its resistance toRussiais credible. The idea is not to match Russian military capacity, but to make the conquest of Finland not worth the trouble. “Full societal resources of a smaller nation can actually be enough to thwart the potential threat from a larger power because the costs for the larger power to invade could actually be much higher than the potential benefits it would gain from such an invasion,” Pesu explains. The more capable a country is of causing pain to occupiers, the less likely the occupation happens in the first place.Conscription is essential. The Finns can put a million soldiers in the field within 72 hours. But every facet of Finnish government, from the healthcare system to the national broadcaster, has a role in the security system, and knows its role in a possible military conflict. “A preparedness mindset permeates the whole society,” Pesu says. “From the state level all the way to an individual living somewhere in the country.”To rise to Finland’s level, Canada would need to reorchestrate its entire frame of reference. The prime minister, Mark Carney, has recently announced seriousbooststo national military spending: 2% by the end of this year, rising to 5% at some point in the future. But the government has pushed its readiness targets back to 2032. And those are targets that align with our typical military practices: meeting our commitments to our alliances. That money sounds good on a theoretical level. But the Canadian military situation has not fundamentally altered. We have not reset our position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, it’s taking cues from him | Shiri Pasternak and Dayna Nadine ScottRead moreThe period we are entering is a period of deep chaos, of the weakening of international institutions, of multiple, interlocked collapses. Any reliance on international institutions and their restoration is a false hope. If Canada is to remain a stable democracy, we will have to find the stability in ourselves. A whole society defence would bolster us against the chaos that threatens us from every side and from within. In an era of splintering society, conscription is a force of unification, what Pesu calls “a strong democratic linkage”. Canada is a big country, with huge geographical and demographic diversity. We are as vulnerable as any other society to the informational chaos that is overtaking the world, to the incipient breakdown. A whole society defence would be a massive force for unification. It would establish, to Canadians at least, that there are crises we are going to face and we need to face them collectively. The thing about a whole society defence is that it determines that you are living in a whole society, a society thatneedsdefending.Canada has no history of needing to defend itself. In fact, not needing a military is baked into our national identity – and that creates a psychological bind. To preserve who we are, we have to overcome one of our oldest tendencies, one of our best tendencies: our peace-loving nature, our idea of our country as an escape from history rather than its perpetrator or victim.And that leads to a very scary question: what will be the crisis that makes us realize that we need whole society defence? Let us hope it won’t be Canada’s last.Stephen Marche lives in Toronto and is the author of The Next Civil War and On Writing and FailureExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationFinlandRussiaUS politicsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Mrs Justice Steyn’s judgment is about power and complicity as well as the failure to protect vulnerable people. In her verdict, she agreed with the Guardian that there were “strong grounds to believe that [Clarke] is a serial abuser of women”.The court heard testimony from26 witnessesbefore concluding that Clarke had engaged in harassment, bullying and abuse of power over many years. The judge accepted some of his evidence, but found him to be neither credible or reliable. The Guardian’s journalists, by contrast, were meticulous and gave Clarke reasonable opportunity to respond as well as fairly presenting his denials. Without women speaking up, Clarke would never have been exposed.The judge rightly agreed that these were plainly matters of public interest. But in law it is not enough for an editor to say that a story is important. It must also demonstrate responsible journalism: it must have careful corroboration and fair presentation, and not be given to sensationalism. The editors and reporters produced a final article, the judge agreed, that wasmeasured, accurate and balanced. Crucially, their belief that this work was in the public interest was “reasonable”.Beyond the law is a wider, all too familiar story. Clarke was not just another actor; he was beinghonoured by the British film academy, Bafta, for his “outstanding British contribution to cinema” even as serious allegations began to circulate. But the deeper indictment is of an industry that turned a blind eye. Clarke was rewarded and celebrated while women who spoke out risked their careers. The structures of power that enabled him – and the colleagues willing to look away – are the same factors that have ended up sheltering abusers across society.This is the culture that allowed him to flourish. It is the culture that required #MeToo before voices were heard, and that now faces abacklashin which powerful men are recast as victims. In Britain, a star celebrated by his peers has been exposed as a serial abuser only after years of whispers were ignored. In her summing up, Mrs Justice Steyn punctured Clarke’s line of defence in a passage that was both subtle and resonant. These were, she reasoned, deliberate acts of abuse, later rationalised through minimisation and self-deception.The lesson of this case is twofold. First, it is a victory for investigative journalism. When reporters act responsibly, the courts will uphold their right to publish. The Clarke case and allegations on shows such asMasterChefhave sparked reforms, prompting a BBC culture review and the creation of an independent industry standards body. The second part of the lesson is that awards, plaudits and silence sustain harassers and abusers more effectively than any legal defence.Clarke’s reputation lies in ruins, not because of gossip, but because of findings tested in court. For years,Britain’s TV industrytolerated a toxic culture where the misconduct of powerful men was seen as unmentionable and staff were resigned to silence. The industry’s power imbalance – dominant executives and stars versus insecure freelancers, a situation worsened by shrinking production budgets – is widely blamed. The story here is not just about one man’s downfall. It is about a culture that looked away – until it could no longer deny the truth.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Europe and North America loom vast, while Africa andSouth Americashrink.Greenlandoften appears roughly the same size as Africa, when in reality the continent is 14 times larger. The impression is that the north is large and central, the south peripheral and marginal.Cartographic distortion would be forgivable if it were confined to sailing charts. But for generations of policymakers – and of children – the world has been presented through a lens that flatters the powerful and diminishes the rest. The academicMark Monmonier, in his book Rhumb Lines and Map Wars, counters that empires were driven by politics and economics more than classroom atlases – a point echoed bycriticswho say Mercator has become overrated as a tool of western imperialism. It is true that colonialism didn’t need maps to justify itself, but maps helped to naturalise its worldview.There are also better alternatives to Mercator. TheEqual Earth projection, introduced in 2018, gives a truer sense of area while retaining a visually intuitive layout. Earlier attempts, such as theGoode homolosineor thePeters projection, made similar efforts to redress the balance. None is perfect. Representing a sphere on a flat plane requires compromise. But the point is not perfection; it is honesty. And honesty requires acknowledging distortion where it matters most.It’s a long-running debate, but for many it was popularised by Aaron Sorkin’s West Wing TV drama. In a famousscenefrom 2001, a group of earnest cartographers explain to a White House press secretary how Mercator has misled generations into believing Greenland is the spatial equal of Africa. The exchange plays for laughs. But it also delivers a serious truth. Start from the wrong map, and you risk ending with the wrong conclusions. That observation has a broader resonance. Leadership depends on an accurate starting point. Whether in business or politics, vision without truth is fantasy. The West Wing moment wasseenas being about leadership. Great leaders, the thinking runs, succeeded not only by imagining the future but by demanding clarity about the present. And clarity begins with the facts, not the distortions of old prejudice – whatever the real-life occupant of the West Wingthinks.The Mercator projection was born, undoubtedly, of European priorities in an age of empire. To continue using it as the default projection is surely to perpetuate those priorities. By contrast, adopting, say, Equal Earth is not only more geographically sound butemblematicallyimportant. It makes clear that Africa won’t be diminished in print when, in fact, it is vast in scale and promise. Critics may scoff that changing maps is only symbolic. But symbols mould perception, and perception drives decisions. Draw Africa small and it is treated as small; draw it true and its scale and potential become harder to ignore. The African Union seems more right than wrong. It offers not pedantry, but leadership.Explore more on these topicsMapsOpinionAfrican UnionAfricaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

I think the UK is about to find out, 21 August)? They would downsize but can’t, because the local authority hasn’t asked them to (they all live in council houses).They would give up the several luxury holidays a year but don’t have any to give up (unless a week in a caravan at the seaside counts?). They would give up their expensive pensions, but they only have the state pension and, even with the triple lock, it isn’t generous enough for any of it to be given up. That’s the price you pay for being part of the vast majority born into the wrong class in the 1950s and 60s and having to leave school at 15 or 16.So this mea culpa comes in the form of an apology for not being part of the minority of baby boomers born into that comfortable, and often southern England, middle class that Inman seems to assume is the heritage of all of, rather than a small minority of, the baby-boomer generation.A better understanding of history and the avoidance of generalising from one class’s narrow experiences might help to avoid the perpetuation of yet another form of hate speech. We already have more than enough of that to go around.(I’m the lucky sibling – the one who managed to make it to university as a mature student.)Nancy HardingCardiffI was irritated by the tone of Phillip Inman’s article. At 66, I am at the younger end of the “boomer” generation. My husband and I would love to sell our family home and buy a smaller bungalow (if anybody actually builds bungalows), and have been trying to sell our house since January, with no luck. Viewers admire the generous space of house and garden, but then say it would be “too much work” to look after, or “too far out in the countryside” (seven miles from the nearest town). We have a lovely village school, shop and pub and other local amenities, but this adds up to nothing.Also, has Phillip tried moving recently? It is a tortuous affair. The costs involved are astronomical: stamp duty, fees for this and that, surveys and removals. You have to identify yourself over and over again on apps, taking selfies, divulging personal information, sending off copies of birth and marriage certificates, your passport. Is it any wonder that people decide to stay put?Nicola MoignardAylesbury, BuckinghamshireWhat Phillip Inman is overlooking is the intricate web of social connections and sense of community built up over many years, which cannot be easily replicated by moving. If you are a boomer living in a larger family house that has seen your children grow up, welcomed their friends and families, hosted grandchildren, moved on to retirement but remained active in the community, you have created a sustaining network of mutual support.These are the people who will notice a change in your routine and offer help or alert relatives. This is the community that rallied round in the pandemic and offered an essential lifeline in shopping, getting prescriptions and all the other little assistances. These are the people who will change a lightbulb, put a new battery in the smoke alarm, help with new technologies.On the other hand, we are the people who will feed the cat, rabbit or guinea pig when neighbours are away, share resources and create a balanced generational neighbourhood. This mutual help is invisible, and cannot be quantified, but is the glue that holds a community together and is the reason I am not downsizing.Christine HillOxfordIf you Google “Beatles: Ailsa Avenue” you will see the moptops pretending to live next door to each other in our street, in the opening scene of their film Help! The “joke” is that their vast wealth hasn’t changed them, and they still live in humble terrace houses. This was 1965. We bought a house here in 1982, for £42,000 – a real stretch for us at the time, three and a half times our joint annual salaries, which was all we could borrow. Today these same small houses sell for about £1m. Which means that our children would have to earn about £300,000 to live in the same little house they were born in. They can’t afford to buy a dog kennel round here. The idea that this is somehow a great benefit to our family, and we should be taxed on our unconscious “profiteering”, seems downright harsh.Mike MacCormackTwickenham, LondonThank you, Phillip Inman, for pointing out the error of my baby-boomer ways. I think I will “cash out” and jet off on a couple of holidays. I just need to cancel my commitments to a local charity (exclusively staffed by retirees), stop looking after my grandchildren so my children can pursue their careers, forget voting Labour in the selfish interest of having my taxes raised, and forgo my Guardian – which seems, with articles like these, to be intent on creating even more divisiveness in an already fractured society.Denise WhiteSale, Greater ManchesterI trust that when Phillip Inman is finally able to retire (aged 75?) from the gruelling coal face of economic journalism, and gives up his comfy chair, nice desk and expensive laptop, he too will give back to the community. Failing that, any chance of him retiring now? Or at least changing the record.John HartleyRawtenstall, LancashireNot to worry, Phillip – we’ll all be dead soon.Dorothy MitchellSunderlandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The remarkably low reoffending rate (5%) seems to me to be due largely to participants being treated with respect, together with the wraparound care they receive while working at LandWorks. This ranges, as the article explains, from help with accommodation to finding work.I am sure that, with the same dedication and kindness, a similar project could be set up in the middle of a city, also with remarkably low costs.Gillian HamiltonBudleigh Salterton, DevonI read the article about LandWorks with joy. I know the project and the effect it has on people. Margaret Thatcher brought in the “community care” initiative in 1983, closing psychiatric hospitals and selling off farmland.I was a psychiatric nurse. My patients loved working and being on the hospital’s farm – it gave them a reason to get up in the morning. Cut to Bristol city later that year: lots of the long-stay patients were placed in the local “community”, with nowhere to go all day, and only the promise of a fry-up in a local cafe. After that they were left on their own. So we made a place, Windmill Hill city farm, where they could come – it was just a secondhand caravan on some farmland with a former psychiatric nurse (me) on hand.It worked, and still does more than 40 years later. Give people an opportunity to belong, and to matter. Sow the seeds and watch them grow. People need to belong to feel hope. That’s why “land works”.Juliana DartPoundsgate, DevonThe obvious question is that if this works, why not have gardening clubs in schools, and set up schemes for youngsters to work with allotment groups or to tend a patch themselves? Imagine how much money would be saved. Add in fishing, which has also reduced recidivism. If people have a purpose and a connection to a community, it stops antisocial behaviour. In 10 years someone will do a research project and get paid to tell us these actions work. Do it now. A small investment will have a big impact.Heather Penny-LarterSwindon, WiltshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It’s true: we now walk more quickly and socialise less, 18 August) chimes well with Thomas Heatherwick’s latest series of Building Soul on Radio 4, where his prime concern is to encourage joy in our built environment.May I make the case for a too often overlooked space in the heart of Preston? Winckley Square is composed of largely Georgian townhouses that define an undulating park.In the mid-20th century, a public space was created with paths laid out in “desire lines” across the square. By the 21st century, repeated flooding under an overarching tree canopy made for a distinctively less inviting place. But trees felled in the wake of the ash dieback disease, together with landscaping and rebuilt culverts, have had an enlightening effect.The gardens, looked after by the Friends of Winckley Square, host a programme of social and heritage events. Now, associations with the likes of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the suffragette Edith Rigby, the graphic novelist Bryan Talbot and the Beano artist Leo Baxendale are being looked at, with a view to setting up links to explore their work and inspire contemporary writers.Austen LynchGarstang, LancashireCarlo Ratti presents fascinating AI-generated data on how people use public open space, arguing that this can be used to design spaces better, and suggesting architects should use these AI tools. There are some truly outstanding public spaces designed by architects. But the professionals best placed to use these tools, to evaluate the conditions and to design creatively in response, are landscape architects (or multidisciplinary teams that include landscape architects).Annie CoombsFellow of the Landscape InstituteExplore more on these topicsCommunitiesPublic landslettersShareReuse this content"

Here’s how it changes children’s lives, 16 August). In the early 1950s my parents actively sought a socialist children’s organisation. We lived in Clapham and the nearest Woodcraft group met in a co-op hall in Balham. The group was called Sunrise Elfins and the leader was Ada, the wife of national organiser Henry Fair.In 1952, aged six, I went on my first of many summer camps. The camp was at Westward Ho! and was hit by a hurricane that was reported on the Daily Mirror’s front page. In 1959 I went to Czechoslovakia in a 10-strong delegation. One of my lasting memories was visitingLidice, a village razed to the ground in reprisal for the assassination of an SS official, Reinhard Heydrich.As a leader, I ran groups and took them to camps abroad. On one occasion, there was no female leader available to help me take my Venturer group to a camp in Aarhus, Denmark. Esmé Goldberg, the campaigner against apartheid, was suggested to me. So I met the South African political prisoner Denis Goldberg’s wife and then Denis himself, after he was released. In 1984 I met my wife, Jenny Brooks, in the international camp in Loughborough. I also participated in CND’s Aldermaston marches with the folk.One hundred years of first-class work with young people deserves national recognition. Come on, Royal Mail, how about a set of stamps? Come on, Royal Mint, how about a coin?Andrew MoncrieffDronfield, DerbyshireI was delighted to read Phineas Harper’s article. As he says, the Woodcraft Folk was founded in south London – Woolwich, to be precise – with the earliest activities taking place in Peckham.Most of the work on developing the organisation was the work of Joe Reeves, who was the education secretary for the Royal Arsenal Cooperative Society – one of the largest retail co-ops; RACS covered most of south London and quite a bit of Kent and Surrey. It was also highly political, with a background of the earliest known co-ops in what was a heavily industrialised area.Reeves’s job with the RACS was what we would describe today as a community worker. He went on to be elected as Labour MP for Greenwich in the 1945 intake. We have a lot to thank Joe for, both in his work with the RACS and then for his later work in parliament. I could go on about all of it for hours.Mary MillsLondonMy wife and I loved reading the article on the Woodcraft Folk by Phineas Harper. Woodcraft Folk met at the local Methodist church in Birmingham, where I was the minister. Our three sons loved Woodcraft. Its leaders, Ted and Olive Palser and their daughter Kate, were the salt of the earth. We loved the anti-militaristic stance and it was way ahead of its time in terms of its commitment to caring for the environment.Best of all were the annual camps. We all took our turn in preparing meals. Facilities were basic and the wide games challenging. A favourite memory of mine is bivouacking on a deserted beach on Anglesey with inner-city children fighting off creepy-crawlies. Although Woodcraft is not a religious organisation, the group meeting at the church was one of the most caring and supportive of our activities.We have wonderful memories and commend it wholeheartedly to youngsters today.Rev Clive R FowleNuneaton, WarwickshirePhineas Harper’s very interesting article on the Woodcraft Folk celebrates the organisation’s socialist ideals, while taking a couple of subtle swipes at the Scouts. But he fails to acknowledge an important point: Harold Wilson was a devoted scout.Perhaps he saw a nice little definition of socialism in the scout motto: “A scout is a brother to his fellow scouts and a friend to all.” While he is not the most celebrated of prime ministers, it is worth remembering that his government created the Open University – a powerful tool for addressing inequality and lack of opportunity.Anthony ClaffHamburg, GermanyYes there is a militaristic tinge to the Scouts, as Phineas Harper hints in his grateful appreciation of the impact his membership of the Woodcraft Folk has had on him. However, in spite of certain cringe-making activities (saluting the flag, marching to bugles etc, when I joined in the late 1940s) my membership of the Scouts has had a similarly profound effect on me. The rhyme we learned to help us remember the (then) scout law (Trusty, loyal, helpful; brotherly courteous, kind; obedient, smiling, thrifty; clean in body and mind) is as useful a guide to good living as any I know (though now with reservations about unquestioning obedience). Along with the example of my first scoutmaster (as they were then called), Leo Moreland, this has been more useful to me than a lifetime’s church sermons.Peter WrigleyBirstall, West YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Thanks to Intel CEO @LipBuTan1 for striking a deal that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.”Trump met with Lip-Bu Tan on Friday and posed for a photo with Lutnick. The development follows a meeting between Tan and Trump earlier this month that was sparked by the US president’s demand for the Intel chief’s resignation over his ties to Chinese firms.“He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10bn for the United States. So we picked up $10bn,” Trump said on Friday.While Trump did not provide detail on the $10bn, the equity stake is about equal to the amount Intel is set to receive in grants from the government under the Chips and Science Act to help fund the building of chip plants in the US.The Intel investment would be the latest of several unusual deals struck by theTrump administrationwith US companies, including agreeing to allow the AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for the US government receiving 15% of those sales. Chipmaker AMD struck a similar deal.The Pentagon is also slated to become the largest shareholder in a small mining company to boost output of rare-earth magnets and the US government negotiated for itself a “golden share” with certain veto rights as part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy US Steel.The US government’s broad intervention in corporate matters has worried critics who say Trump’s actions create new categories of corporate risk.Trump’s move follows a $2bn capital injection from SoftBank Group in what was a major vote of confidence for the troubled US chipmaker in the middle of a turnaround. Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said Intel’s problems were beyond a cash infusion from SoftBank or equity interest from the government.“Without government support or another financially stronger partner, it will be difficult for Intel foundry unit to raise enough capital to continue to build out more Fabs at a reasonable rate,” he said, adding Intel “needs to catch up with TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] from a technological perspective to attract business”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lutnick said this week any stake would be non-voting, meaning it would not enable the US government to tell the company how to run its business.Federal backing could give Intel more breathing room to revive its loss-making foundry business, analysts said, but it still suffers from a weak product roadmap and challenges in attracting customers to its new factories.Tan, who took the top job at Intel in March, has been tasked to turn around the American chipmaking icon, which recorded an annual loss of $18.8bn in 2024 – its first such loss since 1986.Explore more on these topicsIntelDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Levies on steel, aluminum and autos will remain in place.The announcement comes one day after Carney andDonald Trumpspoke on the phone.In recent months, the US has upended global trade as it seeks to bring manufacturing jobs back and sign more favourable deals with trading partners.Carney said despite the global turmoil and American tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, lumber and energy, 85% of Canada’s trade with its southern neighbour was tariff-free.“Let’s be absolutely clear: Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States, and while it’s different from what we had before, it is still better than that of any other country,” he said. “As we work to address outstanding trade issues with the US, it is important we do everything we can to preserve this unique advantage for Canadian workers and their families.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Washington and Ottawa had long been positioned as close allies on trade and defense.Canada has imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods three times. Those counter-tariffs covered $60bn worth of consumer goods. Canada’s federal government also imposed tariffs on American-made cars. The governing Liberal party has also pledged government support for sectors disproportionately affected by American economic protectionism, and in an effort to reduce Canada’s reliance on the US as a trading partner.Despite hints of a detente in recent weeks, including talks between Carney and Trump this week, Canada and the US failed to reach a set of terms by Trump’s 1 August deadline that would reshape a longer-standing relationship. In late July, Carney said Canada was unlikely to convince Trump, who sees tariffs as a useful and powerful cudgel, to drop all levies on Canadian goods.In a statement, the White House called the move “long overdue” and said Carney’s overture paved the way for “continuing our discussions with Canada on the administration’s trade and national security concerns”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsTariffsMark CarneyDonald TrumpAmericasAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It found that Iran’s nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the US strikes, contradicting assertions fromTrumpand the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.The Republican US president, who had pronounced the Iranian program “completely and fully obliterated”, rejected the report.In a news conference following the June strikes, Hegseth lambasted the press for focusing on the preliminary assessment but did not offer any direct evidence of the destruction of Iranian nuclear production facilities.“You want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated – choose your word. This was an historically successful attack,” Hegseth said then.Kruse’s exit was reported earlier by the Washington Post.Trump has a history of removing government officials whose data and analysis he disagrees with. Earlier in August, after a disappointing jobs report, hefiredthe official in charge of the data. His administration has also stopped posting reports on climate change, canceled studies on vaccine access and removed data on gender identity from government sites.The firing of the DIA chief culminates a week of broadTrump administrationchanges to the intelligence community and shakeups to the military leadership. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence – which is responsible for coordinating the work of 18 intelligence agencies, including the DIA – announced that it would slash its staff and budget.The Pentagon announced this week that the air force’s top uniformed officer, Gen David Allvin, planned to retire two years early.Hegseth and Trump have been aggressive in dismissing top military officials, often without formal explanation.The administration has fired Air Force Gen CQ Brown Jr as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, as well as the navy’s top officer, the air force’s second highest-ranking officer, and the top lawyers for three military service branches.In April, Hegseth fired Gen Tim Haugh as head of the National Security Agency and Vice Adm Shoshana Chatfield, who was a senior official at Nato.No public explanations have been offered by the Pentagon for any of these firings, though some of the officers were believed by the administration to endorse diversity, equity and inclusion programs.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryPete HegsethTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He is presently en route to his family in Maryland, after being unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government’s vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back against the administration’s continuing assault on the rule of law. He is grateful that his access to American courts has provided meaningful due process.”Ábrego entered the US without permission in about 2011 as a teenager after fleeing gang violence. He was subsequentlyaffordeda federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador.The 30-year-old was initially deported by federal immigration officials in March. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation was an“administrative error,”officials have repeatedly accused Ábrego of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family vehemently deny.Denied, detained, deported: the faces of Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreDuring his detention at El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and psychologically tortured,according tocourt documents filed by his lawyers in July.Following Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, theTrump administrationfaced widespread pressure to return him to the US, including from a supreme court order that directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return.In June, the Trump administrationreturnedÁbrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with crimes related to human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January.Before his deportation, Ábregohad livedin Maryland for more than a decade, working in construction while being married to an American wife.In acourt filingthis week, his lawyers stated that they had hired a “private security firm that has experience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases” to transport Ábrego from Tennessee to Maryland.Explore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaTrump administrationUS immigrationUS justice systemUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He says the whole conversation around carnival, which costs more than £11m a year to police but is worth about£400m to the local economy, needs to change.View image in fullscreenIan Comfort wants the carnival, which is worth about £400m to the local economy, to receive guaranteed funding for five years.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“Should the government recognise carnival as much as it recognises New Year’s Eve? For many, and that sounds very odd, but for many in the Caribbean community, carnival is just like Christmas,” said Comfort, who wants guaranteed funding for five years.In June, it emerged that the annual celebration could be in jeopardy without “urgent funding” from the government, according to a leaked letter from its organisers.City Hall, Kensington and Chelsea council and Westminster city council together provided £958,000 for the event after pleas from organisers for support. Council leaders, who are struggling with shrinking budgets, were clear that the money was for this year only.Comfort said he was surprised by the stance of the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, that “carnival wasn’t a cultural matter for her” after he appealed to her for assistance.He wants core funding, either from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport or the Arts Council, which only gives money to groups performing at the event, and supplementary sponsorship.View image in fullscreenPartying in the street in 2023: the carnival costs more than £11m a year to police.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverBut negative press coverage around the event is offputting to sponsors, and the last 12 months has seen a lot of bad headlines.Last September, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Matt Twist told a committee at City Hall that his biggest fear was a “mass casualty event” caused by a crush after the number of police officers was reduced by 1200.Earlier this month, the Conservative leader at the London assembly, Susan Hall, said City Hall should become the official organiser of Notting Hill carnival, while warning of the “prospect of a Hillsborough-type” incident.Comfort dismissed Hall’s worries, saying: “Publishing a report two weeks before a carnival is just political posturing”. However, he admitted the event was in a “difficult situation” when it came to attracting sponsorship.He said: “Last year, the Met published the crime stats for carnival, they put it out almost like a leaderboard coming out during the day. It was incredibly unhelpful, if I put it politely. Any sponsor who only ever sees the crime figures for carnival doesn’t want their name attached to carnival.”View image in fullscreen‘For many in the Caribbean community, carnival is just like Christmas,’ said Ian Comfort.Photograph: Anselm Ebulue/The GuardianLast year, there were 889 reported crimes across the event, with 353 arrests. The most shocking incident was themurder of Cher Maximen, who was stabbed and killed after being caught up in a fight during Notting Hill carnival’s family day.Comfort said he considered whether or not he could continue in his role after Maximen’s death but was not sure if it could have been prevented.“The question, is what could we do about that?” he said. “I’ve seen the body-worn footage from the police officers in that area when that happened: there were police officers all around when that happened. It didn’t happen in a dark corner, somewhere in carnival.“So can we stop that sort of thing? The answer is probably no.”Comfort insists this year the event will be safe, with a new stewarding system to help with the flow of festivalgoers and large screens to direct revellers if it becomes too crowded in certain spots.He and the millions of attenders will be hoping for a smooth event to help secure the future of the biggest festival of its kind in Europe – one that serves as an annual celebration of Black British culture and attracts people from around the world.Explore more on these topicsNotting Hill carnivalLondonArts fundingMetropolitan policeFestivalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

They plugged that data into a computer model to track pollution from each source, and used epidemiological and health data to track the adverse impacts of those emissions.These disproportionate impacts are not inexplicable; rather, they are attributable to historic policies such as redlining – a discriminatory mortgage appraisal practice used after the Great Depression by the US government – and high rates of permitting for oil and gas processing plants in close proximity to Black communities.Oil and gas are responsible for a major share of all air pollution-attributable health impacts in the US, the authors also found: one in five pre-term births and adult deaths linked to fine particulate pollution are from the sector, the authors found, while a stunning 90% of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution are from oil and gas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Between that year and 2023, US oil and gas production has increased by 40% and consumption by 8%, meaning the estimates are probably highly conservative.The research comes as the Trump administration works to boost fossil fuel production and suppress renewable energy production.“Given the reckless deregulation being pushed by Trump’s EPA and the president’s call to ‘drill, baby, drill’, this new study should be a flashing red warning light for the nation,” said Donaghy.Eloise Marais, a University College London professor of geography and study co-author, said she hoped the study was “picked up by the kinds of community leaders and advocacy groups that are pushing for exposure to cleaner air”.“If there was a move away from reliance on oil and gas, we would experience the climate change benefits 50, 100, 200 years from today because the greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere so long,” she said. “But communities would experience the health benefits immediately.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsAir pollutionHealthRaceGasOilFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Evacuation orders and warnings have been issued on Thursday for hundreds of residents around Calistoga, a small city in the region known for its wine, as firefighters faced challenging conditions, working through dangerously high temperatures and rugged terrain. The fire’s perimeter is just 5% contained.“Firefighter safety will be an emphasis once again Friday, with temperatures expected to reach into the upper 90s,” analysts with the state fire agency known as CalFire wrote in an update issued on Friday.Bob Todeschini, the battalion chief on the Pickett fire,saidthere had been no injuries or structures damaged, in a video shared on social media on Thursday night. “We’d like to remind everyone to be vigilant and have a plan as we continue with suppression efforts,” he said.The fresh wildfires come as California is experiencing its worstmulti-day heatwave of the year, with some citiesalready breakingdaily temperature records.View image in fullscreenA vineyard in Calistoga, California, as the Pickett fire burned on Thursday.Photograph: Stephen Lam/APFire risksremain exceptionally highacross the American west with high temperatures expected to linger for days. “Hot, dry, and unstable conditions are likely along much of the West Coast near and west of the Cascades and Sierra as near record-setting temperatures 10-25F above normal are expected,” according to an analysis from the National Interagency Fire Center issued on Friday.Paired with low humidity and a chance of dry thunderstorms that could produce lightning strikes, more fires could ignite and rapidly grow.It has already been a busy year for fire, with more than 44,800 ignitions across the US – more than any other year in the last decade, according to NIFC statistics. More than 16,500 wildland firefighters and support staff are currently battling blazes covering a combined total of roughly 912,400 acres.Even after this heatwave subsides, the risks will remain. With minimal moisture in areas of California and the Pacific north-west, fire dangers are expected to climb through the next month and into October. Vegetation isdangerously dry and overgrownin parts of Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming, according to NIFC advisories that “point to areas where hot, dry conditions can quickly turn a spark into a fast-moving fire”.The heat – which will bake moisture out of already parched landscapes and increase the potential for ignitions, rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior – also create significant threats to public health.The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts across the region,extending from Arizona to Washington, warning that the high temperatures could break numerous local daily records and will “pose a threat to anyone without effective cooling and adequate hydration”.View image in fullscreenNapa Valley firefighters look on as the Pickett fire burns. The fast-moving wildfire scorched thousands of acres within hours.Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty ImagesThe heat will also linger after the sun sets, offering little reprieve overnight. High night-time temperatures will add challenges to containing fires that erupt and increase the dangers for people unable to access cooling. “Numerous night-time temperature records are likely,” the NWS said in a Thursday warning. “Without A/C or cooling, the body can’t recover, increasing the risk of heat illness.”Extreme heat, often called a “silent killer”, alreadyranksas the most lethal weather-related disaster in the US, and deaths are increasing. Fueled by theclimate crisis, and often exacerbated by concrete cityscapes that cook when temperatures rise, heatwaves are getting longer, larger and more intense.The heatwave is expected to begin calming down after Sunday inCaliforniaand south-western states, but could continue through the middle of next week in the Pacific north-west.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaWildfiresWest CoastExtreme heatUS wildfiresClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis), which goes back to 2003, shows 1,015,024 hectares have burned this year – breaking the previous record of 988,544 hectares that was set in 2017, with weeks of dangerous fire weather still to come.Chart showing cumulative area burned by wildfires in EU countries between 2006 and 2025The destructive blazes have pumped out 37m tonnes of carbon dioxide – about as much as the yearly CO2emissions of Portugal or Sweden, each home to 10 million people. The fires have also broken records for this time of year for nine other air pollutants, including fine particulates known as PM2.5 that experts say make wildfiresfar more deadlythan previously thought.Cristina Santín Nuño, a fire scientist at the Spanish National Research Council, said the “perfect conditions” for big and dangerous wildfires were happening more and more because of changes in the climate and how people used the land. “It is sad and scary – my home region is burning right now – but not surprising, really,” she said.Wildfires ripped through swathes of southern Europe this month as a heatwave made longer and stronger by fossil fuel pollution pushed temperatures above 40C across much of the Mediterranean and the Balkans. The drawn-out spells of blistering heat dried out vegetation, which in countries such asSpain and Portugalhad grown rapidly after a wet spring, allowing fires to burn hotter and spread farther.1:41Drone footage shows Spanish village destroyed by wildfires – video“A concentration of heatwaves increased the atmosphere’s thirst and cured these [grass and herbs] and other fuels,” said Victor Resco de Dios, a forestry engineer at the University of Lleida. “This has been accompanied by very unstable atmospheric conditions, leading to the occurrence of fire storms.”The flames are known to have killed more than a dozen people but scientists say the hidden death toll is likely to be far greater. Thick clouds of smoke will have fouled people’s lungs with harmful gases and toxic particles small enough to seep into the bloodstream. Astudypublished in the Lancet in December blamed wildfire smoke for 111,000 deaths a year in Europe, including Russia, between 2000 and 2019.On Tuesday, the EU’s Copernicus atmosphere monitoring service found that “unprecedented” fire activity this year had driven Spain’s wildfire emissions up to the highest annual total in the 23 years since records began. Fumes from fires across the Iberian peninsula were made worse by smoke drifting across the Atlantic from Canada, which has also burned badly in recent weeks.Wildfire emissions from Spain and Portugal in August have been “exceptional”, said Mark Parrington, a scientist with Copernicus. “The large quantities of smoke – and especially PM2.5 – released into the atmosphere have resulted in severely degraded air quality locally, and further afield across the Iberian peninsula and parts of France.”Effis said on Tuesday that fire weather conditions were expected to ease across most of southern Europe this week, but added that “very high to very extreme” anomalies were expected in north-west Europe.Santín Nuño said a “catastrophic” wildfire season was unlikely every year, but that each year the probability of breaking records was increasing.It is “highly probable” the record in 2025 will be broken again in a few years, she added. “This is a new reality. And the sooner we realise it, and take action to be more resilient to these types of wildfires, the better.”Explore more on these topicsWildfiresExtreme weatherAir pollutionPollutionSpainEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Most transformations take place over a weekend. Volunteers and mural artists pile in, and it is funded by small grants that Beverley – who does not get paid – applies for in her own time, street collections and donations from local businesses.“The things that are good for nature tend to be very good for people too,” she says. “We’re lucky to have so many green spaces in Bristol, but there is a lack of connection between them. Habitat fragmentation is a big issue.”UK wasp numbers soar after unusually warm and dry springRead moreScientists are reporting catastrophic declinesin insect numbers around the world. International reviews estimate annual losses globally of between 1% and 2.5% of total insect biomass every year. The drivers of the plummeting numbers vary, but include habitat loss, exposure to pesticides and the climate crisis. In the UK,​a citizen science surveyrun by the conservation charity Buglife monitors bug splats on cars. It found a 63% decline in flying insects between 2021 and 2024.There are manyways to help protect insects, some simple, others harder to achieve. Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex says that creating more pollinator-friendly habitat in our cities is “a fairly easy win”.map“We already know that urban areas can be surprisingly good for pollinators compared to modern, intensive farmland,” he says. “If there were initiatives greening up gardens, parks, road verges, roundabouts, cemeteries, little alleys in Bristol, then it all adds up.“And there’s no downside to having lots of wildflowers in our cities. As well as helping to conserve biodiversity, it connects people with nature. Kids can grow up surrounded by bumblebees, butterflies and birdsong.”The Bristol alleyways project is the most local of actions, but it taps into a rich global movement. The US artist Sarah Bergmanncoined the term “pollinator pathway”in 2007 for her project connecting Seattle University’s campus to Nora’s Woods via a corridor of native plants.Ahuge network of community pollinator pathwayshas since sprung up across 300 towns in 24 states in the US and in Ontario, Canada. It began in 2017 when the conservationist Donna Merrill offered people near her home town of Wilton free native trees to form a passage of pollinator habitat that spanned the Connecticut-New York state line. Merrill was particularly inspired byOslo’s “bee highway”created a few years before – a network of green rooftops, beehives and patches of insect-friendly plants that stretches across the city.In the UK, Buglife is tackling the loss of pollinator habitat on a national scale through its B-Lines network, which is mapping a series of 3km-wide insect superhighways that crisscross the country, connecting the best remaining wildflower-rich areas. The charity has been working with farmers, landowners, wildlife organisations, businesses, local authorities and the public for more than 10 years to help fill at least 10% of each line with insect-friendly plants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Buglife invites pollinator projects to mark their initiatives across the insect superhighways on anonline map, with more than 3,800 plotted so far.The charity’s B-Lines officer, Rachel Richards, says the lines running north-south are particularly important for migrating species and those moving northwards as a result of the climate crisis.“Reconnecting fragmented landscapes builds resilience,” she says. “As we see more fires and floods, it’s quite easy for an amazing site to be destroyed or partly destroyed. But if we have the stepping stones of wildflower-rich habitat, it can be colonised by insects from neighbouring sites.”Back in Bristol, Beverley is hoping to expand her pollinator pathways project and make it as sustainable as possible. With hotter and drier summers expected, she has made sure to include a variety of hardy and drought-resistant plants in the alleyways. Weeds that might block accessibility are manually removed to prevent the council spraying herbicide.After her videos of the alleyway transformations shared on social media attracted hundreds of thousands of views, she also plans to create a template for people outside Bristol to emulate.In the meantime, the people living around the existing alleyways are eager to look after them. “The small amounts of litter that are dumped there get cleaned up really quickly because people know that it’s a wonderful space, and we want to keep it that way,” Beverley says. “It’s a bee buffet, and now the pollinators are coming in their masses.”Explore more on these topicsInsectsThe alternativesAnimalsWildlifeConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

We continued to have national mobilisation plans in place to respond should the position change.”Meanwhile, councils across the country controlled by Labour, the Conservatives and Reform UK areinvestigatingwhether theycould pursue legal challengesagainst asylum hotels.This follows a judgegranting Epping Forest councila temporary injunction on Tuesday that blocked asylum seekers frombeing housed at the Bell hotel in Essex.On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers were working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoided creating problems for other areas.The home secretary said: “That is the reason for theHome Officeappeal in this case, to ensure that, going forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way right across the country – without creating problems for other areas and local councils.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that people had “every right” to protest over asylum hotels in their areas. While the number of asylum seekers rose in Labour’s first year, the new data shows they are still far below the 2023 peak, when the Conservatives were in government.In a letter dated 18 August seen by the Guardian to the home secretary, the Broxbourne Conservative MP Lewis Cocking said residents were “understandably concerned at the prospect of an influx of unvetted men from barbaric cultures and particularly how this will impact the safety of women and children locally”.He asked Cooper to guarantee that if the Bell hotel in Epping were to close, asylum seekers from there would not be sent to the Delta Marriott hotel in his constituency, which currently accommodates asylum seeker families. Broxbourne council is considering a similar legal challenge to the one launched by Epping Forest council to try to get the hotel shut down.Labour has pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of this parliament in 2029.Cooper said Labour had taken “crucial steps” in the past year towards this by cutting the asylum backlog and money spent on the asylum system, increasing returns of asylum seekers whose applications had failed, and overhauling appeals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour has identified life sciences as akey growth sector for the economy.Richard Torbett, the chief executive of the ABPI, said: “We need to reach a solution that improves patient access to future innovation, allows the sector to fulfil its growth potential, and does not require industry to pay back nearly three times as much of its revenues as is required in other European countries.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johan Kahlström, the managing director of the drugmaker Novartis in UK and Ireland, said the lack of agreement between the sector and government was “a serious setback for UK patients, the NHS, and the life sciences sector”.The NHS row comes as Donald Trump’s White House puts pressure on the industry internationally,threatening a crackdown on pharma firmsunless they lower drug prices for Americans. In addition, the US president hasvowed repeatedly to ramp up tariffson imported drugs to sky-high levels, in an attempt to get companies to relocate production to the US.Earlier in the week, Eli Lilly, the US manufacturer of the weight-loss jab Mounjaro, said it wasincreasing the UK price by up to 170%, taking a month’s supply of the highest dose from £122 to £330.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryWes StreetingNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Economists have also warned that the problems risk the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, making tax and spending “missteps”.The OBR forecasts are key to the budget process, as they are used to judge the headroom the chancellor has against herself-imposed fiscal rules, and form the basis for her tax and spending decisions. Its work is also closely watched by financial markets. This can affect the cost of borrowing the government needs to help fund public services.The ONS, which produces figures on a range of indicators including economic growth, inflation and unemployment that are used by financial markets and government agencies, is struggling withmounting problemsas it has delayed or cancelled several of its releases.Its labour force survey (LFS) – the official measure of employment in the UK – has been beset with problems amid a collapse in response rates. Only this week, it postponed the release of retail sales data due on Friday for two weeks “to allow for further quality assurance”. Household wealth data has also been downgraded and is no longer treated as “official” because of quality concerns.The longer the data quality problems persist at the ONS, the more acute the challenge becomes, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian. One said: “We are, to a significant extent, flying blind on major areas such as the jobs market.”They added that while other datasets might offer indications of the health of employment in the UK, nothing could replace the fundamental role of the LFS.This echoes public criticism of the ONS by leading economists and officials, including the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, who said earlier this year: “It is critical from our point of view that these issues are addressed.”An economist with close knowledge of the OBR’s processes said there were difficulties in forecasting the path of the debt-to-GDP ratio because the official figures had been frequently subject to revision.They added: “Knowing what is happening in labour market, producer prices, etc, is critical. Chaos at the ONS will have a material impact on the government policy path via ONS projections.”In April, the head of the OBR, Richard Hughes,told the Commons Treasury committeethe forecaster was relying on a “panoply” of alternative data because of quality issues and frequent revisions in key ONS figures.“Ideally, what we want to do is have a snapshot of where the economy just was before we try to figure out where it is going over the next five years. Instead, at the moment, we get an incomplete picture from different points in time from what we get from the ONS,” he said.The ONS has facedharsh public criticism in recent monthsover “deep-seated problems”, adding to the pressure on the Newport-based number-crunching office to improve its data gathering. Earlier this month, Darren Tierney, a former top Cabinet Office official, wasbrought in as its new chief executive.No date has yet been set by Reeves for the autumn budget. The chancellor must give 10 weeks’ notice before a fiscal event for the OBR to produce its forecasts. However, in reality it maintains near-constant monitoring of the economic picture.Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the consultancy CapitalEconomics, said inadequate data could lead Reeves to cut spending or raise taxes unnecessarily at the autumn budget.“If the OBR is unable to get an accurate read on supply, that could lead to fiscal policy missteps.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ONS has said itslatest jobs market figuresinclude the full effects of improvements in data collection and sampling methods introduced from January 2024. However, efforts are continuing to further improve response rates. It has previously warned theprocess could take until 2027.Jagjit Chadha, a Cambridge university economist and former director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said there was “considerable dysfunction in Newport”, partly as the agency had been pushed to make cost savings.“The ONS is a bit of shower at the moment,” he added.While warning the problems could result in “the wrong policies. With fiscal policy overly tightened”, he said heightened uncertainty meant Reeves should proceed with caution. “While it’s useful for policymakers to blame the ONS if they get things wrong, should you be driving a car with mechanical problems as fast as you’re trying to drive it? The answer is no.”A spokesperson for the OBR referred the Guardian to its previous comments in March.A spokesperson for the ONS said: “We have been open and transparent about the issues with some ONS statistics. A strategic plan is already in action, and with new senior leaders now in place, we are working closely with key users and urgently refocusing resources on our core economic outputs.“Revisions to population statistics are unrelated and are due to unprecedented levels of international migration seen over recent years and short-term volatility which results from change.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “This government is building a stronger economy for a renewed Britain, kickstarting economic growth based on rigorous and robust analysis of the economic and fiscal challenges we face.“HMT uses a vast range of data sources to support policymaking. We fully support the ONS’s plan to improve their core economic statistics and are working closely with their new leadership team.”Explore more on these topicsOffice for National StatisticsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityRachel ReevesBudgetEconomicsTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

And then they’re able to say to the AI: ‘How would you improve the answer?’ It’s like having a tireless tutor.”Others suggest AI is developing so rapidly a totally new exam will be needed to test how effectively students are using it. Dr Thomas Lancaster, a computer scientist at Imperial College London specialising in the educational use of generative AI, academic integrity and student cheating, said: “This is becoming such a core digital skill now. I think an exam of this type is inevitable.”Lancaster warned AI would lead to new ways of cheating. “I do think we’ll need to see increased security checks for exams and more training for invigilators to help them to spot disallowed devices,” he said.“Communication devices now can be as small as concealed earpieces, and there are more dangers with AI-enabled smart glasses.”Sir Ian Bauckham, the chief regulator of England’s qualifications watchdog, Ofqual, warned of the risks AI posed to the use of extended writing coursework to assess a student’s knowledge.In an interview with the Guardian, heraised concerns about the extended project qualification, an independent research project students can undertake alongside their A-levels that is the equivalent of half an A-level.“I think it’s got a really important place that is valued and universities sometimes tell us that they value it too,” he said. “So I wouldn’t want to take precipitous action on it, but I am worried about the extent to which AI may be being used to support students in that qualification.“I think anybody that wants to say we should move the exam system wholesale away from exams, where you can control the use of AI, to a space where it’s much harder to do that, which is extended writing coursework, should probably do a reality check.”Rogoyski echoed his concerns. He said: “Our assumption that you can tell a student’s mastery of a subject by asking them to write an essay is being fundamentally challenged, especially if they’re doing that work unsupervised.“We are likely to have to change exams to focus on testing their understanding of what has been written, whether by AI or human. This means vivas, or discussions, about examined topics.”He also warned there are early signs of AI-dependency emerging as students start to use the technology routinely: “The risk is that they become dependent on the AI and lose their own abilities to analyse, write, and critique subjects,” he said.On the possible benefits of AI to the exam system, Jill Duffy, the chair of the Joint Council for Qualifications board of directors and the chief executive of the OCR awards body, said exam boards were looking at how AI could speed up and improve the quality of marking.One theory is GCSE and A-level results could be delivered within a month instead of two, thanks to AI speeding up marking. OCR is using AI in trials to turn handwritten answers into digital text to cut delays caused by poor handwriting. If successful, it could mean students are offered university places based on their qualifications rather than predicted grades.Duffy agreed more vivas and other forms of oral assessment were already being used in higher education. “If we’re seeing it there, is that going to start to cross over into schools? We could see something like that,” she said.Lancaster added: “Overall, exams are here to stay in some form, but that exam form may be rather different to what it looks like now.”Explore more on these topicsEducationArtificial intelligence (AI)ExamsA-levelsGCSEsComputingSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

Former staff had sought $500m in a proposed class action suit against the billionaire.A court filing released on Wednesday stated that both parties had reached a settlement agreement in principle and requested that a scheduled 17 September hearing in the case be postponed while they worked to finalize a deal. The filing did not disclose any details of the tentative agreement and it is unclear what level of compensation that former employees may receive.Former Twitter employees, led by Courtney McMillian and Ronald Cooper, alleged that the company failed to appropriately pay thousands of workers severance after conducting mass layoffs. When Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he cut more than 6,000 employees in an overhaul of the company’s workforce, slashing almost the entirety of departments such as content moderation and communications. The layoffs led to several lawsuits, some ongoing, from staff and executives, and foreshadowed how Musk’s “department of government efficiency” would approach its gutting of government agencies earlier this year.The lawsuit alleged that laid-off workers were owed at least two months of pay plus additional compensation depending on their time worked at the company, in accordance with a 2019 severance plan. Instead, Musk failed to honor the contract and in some cases paid workers no compensation at all, according to the suit.The tentative settlement is a turnaround from last year, when a US district judgedismissed McMillian’s suitin a legal victory for Musk.

No one will go with you. People aren’t like that now. No one will come out to the square.’”Prigozhina said her son replied:“No, they will support me.”Prigozhin’s short-lived rebellion, launched with several hundred of his most loyal fighters, was preceded by weeks of escalating tension with Russia’s defence ministry and top commanders, whom he accused of corruption.At the time, Wagner played a keyrolein Russia’s offensive against Ukraine, with Prigozhin’s fighters often deployed as shock troops in frontal assaults during battles in eastern Ukraine.While no major political figures backed Prigozhin’s rebellion, polls suggested that at its height, his blunt, anti-establishment rhetoric resonated widely and won him significant support among Russians.When Wagner troops seized control of key military sites in Rostov-on-Don, Prigozhin wasgreetedwarmly by locals.But he called off the march about 120 miles (193km) outside Moscow after a series of phone calls with senior Russian officials and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who acted as an intermediary.During the advance, Wagner fighters shot down a Ka-52 attack helicopter, killing its crew, and destroyed an Il-18 military aircraft.“In the end he just turned around – that was it,” said Prigozhina.“He had no intention of overthrowing Putin, absolutely not. He only wanted to get through to the military leadership,” she added, claiming her son halted the march to avoid further bloodshed among regular Russian troops.“He told me he couldn’t shoot young guys during his march,” Prigozhina said.After Prigozhin’s death, Russian authorities swiftly moved to seize his sprawling business empire, which extended far beyond mercenary operations to encompass online “bot farms”, mining ventures in Africa and a vast catering business – the source of his nickname “Putin’s chef”.View image in fullscreenYevgeny Prigozhin serves the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, at his restaurant in 2011.Photograph: APHis Wagner forces, which operated primarily across Africa and have been accused of mass atrocities, have since been absorbed into Russian state structures and continue to operate under the name Africa Corps.Prigozhin’s 27-year-old son, Pavel, who fought with Wagner in Syria, has been largely sidelined in the power struggle that followed his father’s death.In September 2024, Prigozhina won an unexpected victory in an EU court, which ordered her removal from the European sanctions list and instructed the Council of the European Union to pay her legal costs.She and her grandson had been placed under sanctions as part of a wider move against the Prigozhin family, which for years played an active role in Yevgeny Prigozhin’s network of businesses.In the interview with Fontanka, Prigozhina complained that despite being taken off the sanctions list, she was recently denied a visa to travel to Hamburg, Germany, to visit a clinic.“Instead, I am preparing many exhibitions now,” she said, adding that one of the main works currently on display in her St Petersburg gallery shows a portrait of her son inUkraine.Explore more on these topicsYevgeny PrigozhinRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

But as the president ramps up his extraordinary attack on the Fed’s independence, Powell suggested on Friday that central bank officials are considering a rate cut.“With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said in a closely scrutinized speech at a Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming on Friday, highlighting a “challenging” dichotomy of risks: that Trump’s tariffs might increase inflation, while his immigration policies knock the US labor market.Wall Street rose sharply after the address, with the benchmark S&P 500 gaining 1.5% as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.9% to close at a record high. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite reversed several days of declines to advance 1.9%.Good, mad and ugly: the US economy’s performance under Trump – in chartsRead moreTrump, meanwhile, continues to encroach on the Fed’s independence and demand that it rapidly cuts rates. The presidentcalled ona Fed governor, Lisa Cook, to resign after one of his allies, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency head, Bill Pulte, alleged that she had committed mortgage fraud.After Cook said she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down, Trump told reporters in Washington on Friday: “I’ll fire her if she doesn’t resign.”Since Trump started his second term and overhauled the US trade system, Powell – who is usually reserved about making direct comments on executive branch policies – has been more outspoken about the impact of Trump’s tariffs.“This year, the economy has faced new challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the global system,” Powell said in his speech on Friday. “Tighter immigration policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth.”Changes to tax, spending and regulation may also affect the economy, Powell added, tacitly underlining the erratic nature of government by Trump. “There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be,” he said.Recent government data shows that US labor growth stalled this summer. While new jobs are still being added to the economy each month, Powell noted that it was “a curious kind of balance” where both the supply and demand for workers have been slowing.“This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” he said.Cutting rates could help boost the labor market, but it can also make inflation worse. Powell pointed out that Trump’s tariffs have “begun to push prices up in some categories of goods”.“The effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts,” Powell said.It is unclear whether tariffs will cause lasting inflation, meaning prices will continue to go up at higher paces, or if it will mean a one-time shift in the price level.a interactive graph of interest rate cuts from August 2019 to July 2025At five consecutive meetings, the Fed has left rates unchanged, despite the president’s calls for rapid cuts. Before moving, most policymakers wanted more clarity on the economic impact of his policies, including sweeping tariffs on imports, and deportations.At the Fed’s last meeting, in July, when it againopted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, two governors opposed the decision – the first time multiple governors have voted against the majority since 1993.After the meeting, official employment data showed that jobs growthstalled this summer– prompting Trump tofire the federal officialin charge of labor statistics – as inflationcontinued to rise.A parade of those aspiring to replace Powell next year– believed to include the two governors who called for rate cuts at the last Fed meeting, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Kevin Hassett, thedirector of Trump’s national economic council – will be interviewed in the coming weeks.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS interest ratesDonald TrumpJerome PowellUS unemployment and employment statisticsUS economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a struggle. “He has arms,” is about as good as it gets. The actors who play them are less reticent. Highlights are itemised before I’ve even asked. “I love your hair,” Olivia Colman tellsBenedict Cumberbatch. “Short at the sides! Brilliant!” It’s their first time together in ages. They compare half-terms and weeding. She coos over his dislocated shoulder. He admires her suit.OK, enough mush. What do they hate about one another?“Tricky,” says Cumberbatch, ruminatively. “I hate how …”Colman moans. “Oh God, he’s gonna do ‘I hate, but aniceway.’”“Fuuuck,” he says. “I hate how she thinks five steps ahead of me. I hate how predictable I am around Olivia, and I hate what a grumpy arsehole I feel in the face of her unmitigated joy.”The Favourite review – Olivia Colman is priceless in punk Restoration rompRead moreHe’s been her “proud friend” for ages, he continues; leapt out of bed in his pyjamas to party with her when Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite swept the Baftas. Her intuition is “extraordinary. It’s all just there, not overcooked, a very raw talent.”“That’s one of the things I love about Ben,” Colman chips in.“I do the heavy talking?”“It means I can have a cup of tea. Probably do some emails. But also I want to hold your hand and go: ‘Don’t be hard on yourself.’” She pats him. “Because you do that.”“Yeah,” he nods, sheepish. “I do do that.”“But you areamazing. Very good and wonderful. I wish you could simply go: ‘I’m great!’ I’m going to enrol you in a workshop. No! Let’s go on a walking holiday together! I’ll hold your hand all the time and you’ll end upso happy.” A manic cackle.He joins in. “I’ll walk off a cliff because I won’t be scared of death any more.”“We won’t go anywhere with hills or cliffs,” says Colman. “Just back to my house every evening for loads of pasta. We’ll go on big round walks. You can’t get lost if you always go left.”He laughs, she beams. “When Ben’s face lights up, it’s a whole-body shake. It’s properly joyful working with him. Oh, this issickly, isn’t it.” The door opens and something green and livid in a glass is ushered in. “Oh fuck, here comes my wanky matcha,” says Cumberbatch bashfully. “What colour is your wee after that?” asks Colman. He grins. “I’ll show you.”View image in fullscreenIvy (Colman) and Theo (Cumberbatch) get digging in The Roses.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkThe Roses is less of an acid brew than its source material: Warren Adler’s 1981 novel, The War of the Roses, and the 1989 adaptation by Danny DeVito, starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Gone is the quasi-rape, the almost-murder and the moment Douglas’s lawyer urinates on the fish that Turner’s aspiring caterer has prepped for a tasting.In the 2025 film, she has been upgraded to a chef while he becomes an architect. The pair escape London for California with their young twins, where her career rockets as his nosedives. She’s on magazine covers. He handles nits.Yet relations only crumble so far: Ivy and Theo do sort of want to stay together. But if they can’t, they each definitely want to stay sole owners of the swanky beach villa he’s designed and she’s bankrolled.Capitalism is the problem, reckons screenwriter Tony McNamara, an Australian best known for his work with Yorgos Lanthimos (including The Favourite). “It’s become an element of marriage,” he says, earlier that morning. “Both partners have to work. In the 1960s and 70s we might have been less emotionally articulate but it’s tougher today because of the idea you have to get fulfilment from your career and be special.” Balancing that with a partner, children and a mortgage is “ridiculous”, he says.Theo pours his thwarted ambition into his children, drilling them into athletic prodigies. “It’s really hard for men,” says McNamara, “because they’re brought up for a sort of ego success; that’s the way to define himself. When that’s taken away, he makes his kids the success.”Ivy enjoys her acclaim but comes to covet Theo’s bond with the twins. “When she got the chance,” says McNamara, “her ego was as big as his. And she couldn’t balance it, either.”It would be possible to do a bracingly traditionalist reading of The Roses. To see the film as a cautionary tale about the perils of swapping gender roles – or even of progress full stop.“Steady on, Tony,” says Colman, when I recount his theories. “I mean, in the 60s and 70s, women weren’t really encouraged to …” She pauses, then assumes a fond Aussie accent. “Oh yeah! I didn’t mean that … I’m gonna get in so much trouble.”Cumberbatch attempts a defence. “Look, there was an idealism in the 60s, the fledgling of equality ….”“Womenalwaysthought about equality,” counters Colman.“But then there were open relationships and changing gender roles,” continues Cumberbatch. “I think we are in an era where we are trying to have it all.”View image in fullscreenThe cast of The Roses (from left), Sunita Mani, Jamie Demetriou, Ncuti Gatwa, Benedict Cumberbatch,  Zoë Chao, Kate McKinnon and Olivia Colman.Photograph: Bryan AdamsYes, says Colman, firmly. “What I like about this is it’snotabout genders, it’s about roles at home. It could be a same-sex couple.” She pauses. “I mean, it could have all been solved with a nanny.”Cumberbatch perks up. “I did think that at one point. Because though they hate each other, there’s no trust issue. They’re not unfaithful. The nanny thing could have played with that.”“You could have had a fling with a nanny!” says Colman, excited. “Or I could. Dammit!”“Missed opportunity,” says Cumberbatch, with the hint of a grimace.Jay Roach, the director of The Roses, has the calm smile and open gaze of a couples therapist – which is what he wanted to be, if his movies (including Meet the Parents and Austin Powers) hadn’t taken off. “I take on projects to work my own shit out,” he says. “I really am fascinated by what makes a relationship work or what dooms it.”The Roses also betrays his interest in the special relationship between the US and UK. “I’ve always had an inferiority complex,” he says. “But especially around British people. They are so much wittier and more articulate. Olivia and Benedict are hilariously dark and insulting, even off camera.”In the film, Ivy and Theo’s brittle banter contrasts with the sometimes spectacular frankness of their American friends, two couples played by Andy Samberg and Kate McKinnon,Jamie Demetriouand Zoë Chao. “When Ivy and Theo are really harsh with each other, they’re sort of speaking in their love language,” says Roach. “When Americans try, they suck at it.”Olivia Colman wins best actress Oscar for The FavouriteRead moreBoth Cumberbatch and Colman are popular across the Atlantic. Both are also perceived as quintessentially British – a sense cemented by Colman’s best actress Oscar acceptance speech. (“Brilliant!” says Cumberbatch, who raises it unprompted. “Like Olivia mach 11.”)He’s perhaps more of a fan of the US than she. “You don’t have to stay in your lane over there,” he says. “You can keep evolving.” He talks about how “history speaks to a more nefarious version” of the idea that Britons are refined and Yanks brutes.He also questions the charge levelled by the film: that Americans don’t get irony. “It taps into that cliche: that Brits say to each other things that are really quite cruel, cold and barbed – and Americans just think it’s funny. But maybe that’s changed. Look at the roasting thing … ”“They’ve taken itsofar,” says Colman.“Barbaricallycruel. Not at all epigrammatic.”View image in fullscreenA cautionary tale? Cumberbatch and Kate McKinnon.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkDo they soften their own swearing outside England? “Oh I go much worse,” says Colman. “My first time in America, my lovely team went: [nervous American accent] ‘Um, I know you like the c-word. We can’t do the c-word here.’ And then the LA Times asked me about David Tennant and I said: ‘Oh, total cunt!’ and you could see everyone’s colour just draining. It’s because I was told not to.”“It’s that school thing, isn’t it,” says Cumberbatch.“Yeah,” she says, “everybody wants to say ‘cunt’. It’s a great word.”There are limits though, even for Colman. Some years back, she was bathing her train-mad young son and spelling out words for him in foam letters on the tiles. He requested “Fat Controller”, per Thomas the Tank Engine. She’d got as far as “fat c” when her husband appeared, alarmed. “Idiot! I’m not gonna write ‘fat cunt’ on the bath!”The pair potter off on a tangent, rhapsodising over Brio (Colman: “The bridges!”; Cumberbatch: “Sosatisfying”) and comparing notes on classics of children’s literature that seem less palatable when you’re a parent.“I had a little squiz at the Mr Men books,” says Cumberbatch. “And oh my God! Mr Chatterbox is basically gagged and laughed at by the postman. Can you imagine teaching a child that’s acceptable? Just shut someone up with a mask.”“And Mr Nosey!” says Colman. “You shouldn’t be nosy, but they sort of hurt him.”“Alotof consent issues with Mr Tickle.”The series should be repurposed as teaching aids, thinks Colman. “Everyone gets a red flag and waves it when they spot inappropriate behaviour.”Both Colman and Cumberbatch are in notoriously happy marriages. She’s been with the writer Ed Sinclair since university. They have three children, as do Cumberbatch and his wife, theatre director Sophie Hunter. Do they think we romanticise love?“By its very nature, yes,” says Cumberbatch. “And I think that’s fine.”“I love love,” says Colman, cheerily. “I like to romanticise love. I think it’s ace.”View image in fullscreenJay Roach in 2017.Photograph: Matt Baron/REX/ShutterstockCumberbatch leans back. It’s a bit of a format, this: she says something chirpy and succinct, he expands on it thoughtfully, prodding the other side of the coin.“Classicism has given us this sort of romantic ideal of love,” he says, “which is impossible to live up to. Those two things wrestle: it’s great to fall in love, but eventually one of you will be dog-tired and doing the bins.”“And then you take turns,” says Colman briskly, “and step up to the plate.”“But that’s the thing. There has to be this cool thing beyond the idealism of vows.” He talks mistily about his wedding. “It’s such a powerful thing to express love and then have it reflected back with your friends and family. But to find something beyond that heightened moment, you have to think a bit more deeply than just the party of love.”“Three more matchas!” says Colman, impressed.In the film, Theo says he feels “great waves of dizzying hatred” for his wife. Is that incompatible with love? Cumberbatch gulps. “God, this is like a Trojan horse to our [private] lives. When you’re living closely with someone, you go through all the extremes of life. That’s really what love is: getting through them.”A pause. “I’m not sure I’ve felt massive hatred,” says Colman.“I didn’t mean that,” he says, quickly. “But moments when you’re not massively in love.”“I’m quite in love.”“I am too! It’s all great. It’s, y’know, life. And I know Ed annoys you sometimes.”“Only a bit, and it’s been 30 years. It’s not bad to be a bit annoyed with each other.”“Hate is a very strong word.”“Not a good word,” says Colman. “Unless it’s thrown at certain political leaders. Then ‘cunt’ is fine.”View image in fullscreenDifferent approaches … Sunita Mani, Colman and Ncuti Gatwa in The Roses.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkIn The Roses, just as the American friends offer a counterpoint to Theo and Ivy’s robust irony (and blasphemy), so two servers in Ivy’s restaurant represent a different approach to courtship. Jane (Sunita Mani) shags a co-worker in the big fridge. Jeffrey (Ncuti Gatwa, who played the last iteration of Doctor Who) blows truckers in the car park. A younger generation, says McNamara, are less wedded to the idea that love lasts for ever.The actors who play them share this take, as well as the screenwriter’s theory that being told you’re special is fatal for relationships. “In America, individuality is such a currency,” says Mani. “It’s bait: ‘Be you!’ It becomes commodified so quickly.”Gatwa hums in agreement. “There’s this narrative on socials, a line I see all the time: ‘I’m the prize!’” He shakes his head sadly. “Dating apps have done something to our brains.”“[The] feeling that you need to be ‘special’ is really exploited,” says Mani. Gatwa nods. “The void has been capitalised.”View image in fullscreenTony McNamara and his wife, Belinda Bromilow, at the 2024 Oscars.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesAsk these two if we romanticise love and you get a rather different response to Colman and Cumberbatch. “Yes!” yells Gatwa. “Oh. My. God. Nineties films have done a number on us! Disney, too. We’ve all been trained to think that someone’s coming to save us.”Mani concurs. Fairytales are catnip, she says, “in this age of technology and loneliness”.At 32 and 38, Gatwa and Mani are a good decade younger than the film’s leads (Cumberbatch is 49, Colman 51). So too, in fact, are the actors who play their friends. Down the hall of the hotel sit Demetriou, 37, McKinnon, 41, and Chao, 39, in a room set up for TV interviews. The three of them (sans Samberg) duly engage in the kind of comedy business (ear nuzzling, etc) perfect for social media reels. Unfortunately, this is print – and they soon get pretty glum, anyway.“I think our expectations of what a marriage is supposed to deliver are disproportionate and silly,” says McKinnon. “What it’s really for is comfort and solace as we move through time.”If you want to procreate, she says, other methods are available. Take bees: “Twenty-five female embryos are selected at random and overfed, and then they fight to the death. The queen emerges, then flies to a predetermined location to which all of the men in the colony fly, ejaculate upon her and then die.”“So that’s another way,” McKinnon concludes, caveating that I should check the science.View image in fullscreenZoë Chao and Jamie Demetriou.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkDemetriou says he’s better for being in a relationship, but still doesn’t seem entirely sold on the concept. “Were they intended or just a sort of habit we all got into?” he asks. “There’s no official organic document that says: this is the way.” Movies are indeed to blame: “Commitment porn. Even for those of us who can be like, ‘It’s just a film!’, those messages will have seeped in way before we were able to conjure that distinction.”“I feel as if I’ve been spending my whole adult life unraveling the stories that were fed to me at a very young age,” adds Chao, sadly. “I’ve been trying to do that math for a long time.”Such cynicism cannot be chalked up only to youth. For all their California sunniness and Aussie bonhomie, Roach, 68, and McNamara, 58, also sing from the same bleak hymn sheet.“We’re all lonely and dysfunctional and scared,” says the director. “When you find that other person that feels the same way you do, it’s an amazing, magical thing. It feels like we’re tapping into our higher angels. When you lose that, it’s so painful.”An actor recently told McNamara that, though he wanted to stay with his wife, the way she ate made him want to kill her. “Most of the people I know are in the creative world,” he says. At root, he concedes, The Roses is a Hollywood fable: “It’s hard for two creative people to carry a life together.”View image in fullscreenAll at sea .. Colman and Cumberbatch.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkYet Colman and Cumberbatch, snuggled in their suite, seem to manage it. Presumably they’re plagued by people seeking relationship advice? Both look nonplussed: neither has ever been asked for any. “I feel a bit disappointed now,” says Colman. “Maybe people look at [me and Ed] and go: ‘God no! Notthatway.’ I might text all my friends after [this]. “What’s wrong with us? It’s been 30 years and we’ve worked together. We’ve done really well!”So how do they sustain marriages in which one party is publicly adored? They don’t entirely answer. Every profession needs public approbation, says Colman, “not just the obvious showoff actors”. Totally essential, agrees Cumberbatch. “It’s part of how you see the reflection of who you are. It can’t just be about the grounding your children and your partner give you.”Though yes, he says, gesturing round the room, all this is “certainly something that can warp your sense of self and give you entitlement”.“It’s slightly off the scale, isn’t it?” says Colman. “You need to try to remember that it’s silly.”“Have fun with it and then just go home.”“And clear up some dog vomit or something, just to remind you.”And if there is none?“Find some,” says Cumberbatch. “Just go to Olivia’s house.”The Roses is released on 29 AugustExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsOlivia ColmanBenedict CumberbatchJamie DemetrioufeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go awayWhether it’s Robbie Williams’ new album, a Blur v Oasis play or Britpop romance novels, Alex James and others explain why we’re all still in thrall to the ​m​ad-fer-it 90sAlexis PetridisFri 22 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.15 EDTShareIt is a Tuesday evening, and in the suitably 1990s environs of Soho’s Groucho Club,Robbie Williams,resplendent in pair of dungarees, is in the process of launching his new album. It’s called Britpop, features some songs co-written withGaz Coombesof Supergrass, and is, he attests, “the album that I wanted to write and release after I left Take That in 1995”. This was the brief period where he attempted to establish himself as an adjunct to the mid-90s wave of hugely successful UK alt-rock, releasing a string of audiblyOasis-influencedsolo singles, palling around Glastonbury with the Gallaghers and temporarily employing one of the band’s inner circle, Creation Records’ former managing director Tim Abbot, as his manager. “I’ve been musically aimless for a little while,” Williams said to the assembled press. “I’ve just spent the last 15 years looking backwards. I think with this album, if I am gonna look backwards, I might as well just clear the decks and go back to the start and head off from there.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve just spent the last 15 years looking backwards’ … Robbie Williams at the launch of his new album at The Groucho Club.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/ShutterstockHis determination to revisit the Britpop era feels slightly odd. His Oasis-influenced singles met with declining public interest, nearly scuppering his solo career before Angels and Let Me Entertain You came to the rescue. His relationship with Abbot ended with each suing the other in a dispute over Abbot’s contract (they settled out of court), he later said Oasis were “gigantic bullies” (Liam Gallagherreplied that he’d “never bullied anyone in my life”) and when he talked about the period when I interviewed him in 2016, it was in terms of trauma: “There was an indie fundamentalist mentality … I was looked down on when I was in conversation with a lot of people … [it] starts to make you feel agoraphobic and second-guess everything you do”. But his appearance at the Groucho is the latest in a series of 90s-themed publicity stunts by Williams – he’s also unveiled fake blue plaques in Camden, proclaiming it “the home of Britpop”, and Soho’s Berwick Street, where the photograph on the cover of Oasis’s (What’s the Story?) Morning Glory was taken.All of this is timely at the very least, coming amid a huge wave of nostalgia for Britpop. In part, it’s obviously fuelled by the fact that Blur, Pulp andOasishave all reformed to considerable acclaim over the past two years, but it also feels more general than just fondness for any one band. It’s as if people have retrospectively fallen in love with “Britpop” as an idea, a signifier of something beyond music, something more nebulous.The first signs of a notion of Britpop detached from the actual music might have comelast year, when a succession of artists who sounded nothing like Blur or Oasis – drum’n’bass starNia Archives, music producerAG Cookand singer-songwriterRachel Chinouriri– began adopting the era’s visual signifiers, union jacks and all, andDua Lipaclaimed its “honesty and attitude” had influenced her album Radical Optimism. There have been a succession of Britpop books – a quick search reveals titles called Faster Than a Cannonball, Don’t Look Back in Anger, Feeling Supersonic, A Field Guide to Britpop, The Britpop Bible, The Birth and Impact of Britpop and at least three Britpop-themed romance novels. There are Britpop walking tours, Britpop festivals and a plethora of non-specific Britpop tribute acts.There is Britpop Classical, a reimagining of the era’s hits with a 20-piece orchestra, fronted byBlur’s Alex James. Inspired, he says, by seeing “everyone arms aloft crying their eyes out, singing along to 90 minutes of hits” when the dance-themed Ministry of Sound Classical headlined the Big Feastival, the festival he hosts on his farm in the Cotswolds, last year.Britpop battle between Blur and Oasis revisited in ‘punchy’ new comedyRead moreThere are Britpop clothing collections – “classic British countryside meets 90s indie cool … countryside heritage with that Camden edge”, as the press release from designers Maude and Fox puts it – and there is aBritpop play,The Battle, about the feud between Oasis and Blur. It’s been written by novelist John Niven, will star Mathew Horne and is scheduled to open in February.It’s the idea of theatrical producer Simon Friend, who says he thought the show would initially appeal to a niche audience – “to sell a play that is new, by someone who’s completely unknown in the theatre industry is hard, in fact nigh-on impossible” – but instead found himself booking it on a six-month tour around the provinces: a West End run is to be announced and it’s been optioned for television by Universal.“About ten years ago, nostalgia for the 80s was really prevalent – the theatrical version of Dirty Dancing could not have been hotter, for instance,” Friend says. “I think there’s a 30 year cycle of nostalgia: ten years ago, the 90s were still in the rear view mirror. Now, if you look at video footage or photos in the 90s, it does feel like a historical period compared to where we’re living now. It looks more fun. There is a certain anarchy about that time that, from a distance, people have a fondness for”.And there is Britpop wine, lager and cider, also Alex James’s handiwork: he has actually trademarked the word “Britpop”, at least for food and drink. “Trademarking is incredibly tedious, it turns out,” he says. “You have to do it by territory and category. The word ‘Britpop’ used to totally give me the ick, as I think it maybe did for a lot of bands in that era. You know, ‘Britpop rocker Alex James’ – oh, God. I had to take control. So I thought, ‘that actually sounds like a really nice drink’.”This is Britpop as a branding exercise, which begs the question: what does the word signify? “I guess now it just sort of means good times,” he shrugs. “Maybe when outlooks were more positive, and there was less doom and gloom and scrutiny. Maybe it’s like ‘the swinging 60s’, only not quite as naff. You hear the phrase ‘swinging 60s’ and you’re like ‘yay!’, aren’t you?”View image in fullscreenAlex James at the launch of his Britpop ClassicalPhotograph: Alan West/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockThewriter and broadcaster Miranda Sawyeragrees. Her contribution to the pantheon of Britpop literature, Uncommon People, was published last year, and she’s just launched a podcast called Talk 90s to Me. “What is it about Britpop that appeals? There was a sense of ‘fuck you, we’re going to have a good time’, which Liam Gallagher definitely epitomised. And there’s an optimism – the gatekeepers had changed, different people were running Radio 1 and Top of the Pops, and a load of bands became absolutely huge without really changing what they did, or compromising. Blur didn’t change, Pulp didn’t change, Oasis obviously never changed – they just got worse. Someone like Tricky, who record companies would previously have told to fuck off, got really big.“It felt like youth culture was winning. You couldn’t believe it was happening, and there’s a sense of optimism attached to that. That’s an amazing feeling that can be sensed by others.”You can see why people old enough to remember the mid-90s first-hand might be drawn to reliving their youth 30 years on – generally your teens and 20s look appealingly carefree from the perspective of middle age – but the striking thing about the current wave of Britpop nostalgia is that its market isn’t exclusively drawn from the ranks of forty- and fiftysomethings. Alex James says he was “really, really surprised” at “how many kids, people my kids’ age” were at Blur’s 2023 reunion gigs. Promoting Uncommon People at literary festivals, Sawyer was struck by the audiences she attracted. “I thought it would just be people my age, right? What I didn’t expect was people in their late 30s and early 40s. Everybody, I think, is always slightly obsessed with the era when they were just born: things that were going on that were adult, that seemed exciting and just beyond you on the telly. And then, every time, there were always at least a couple of 17-year-olds, mostly girls, interested in music, want to be in bands, and they want to talk about Elastica.”View image in fullscreenYouth culture without compromise … Elasticain 1995)Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesIf you buy the idea that what the Britpop brand represents is optimism, positivity and youth culture winning without compromise then you can see its appeal to a 17-year-old in 2025. Who wouldn’t hanker after the notion of a prelapsarian world before the scrutiny of social media, 9/11, the rise of the “alt-right” et al? And the era’s “fuck you, we’re gonna have a good time” excesses look alluring in an age of wellness influencers and constant cameraphone surveillance.Of course, they’re being sold a very rose-tinted and reductive notion of the past. The Britpop era played out alongside the Conservative government’s back-to-basics campaign, which felt a little like a culture war, replete withtalk from John Majorabout “traditional values falling away” and having “allowed things to happen that we should never have tolerated”. Unemployment rates were around twice as high as they are now and there was genocide in eastern Europe, while even Sawyer notes that when she interviewed Garbage’s Shirley Manson and Sleeper’s Louise Wener for her book, “it was like we already knew each other, because we’d been through the 90s as women, like you’d been through some kind of trench warfare”. But that’s nostalgia for you: the past with the crap bits tactfully excised.Given his own experience of the mid-90s you might expect Robbie Williams’ take on Britpop to be less idealistic. Certainly the cover of his album hints at that – it’s a photo of him at Glastonbury in 1995 on a gallery wall, being defaced by protesters. But when the subject comes up at The Groucho Club, he bats it away, restricting himself to talking jokily about the tracksuit he’s wearing in the photo. “So that’s the album cover,” he concludes. “We’re Britpopping.”Uncommon People by Miranda Sawyer is out now, published by John Murray. The Big Feastival is at Alex James’s Farm, Oxfordshire, 22-24 August. Britpop by Robbie Williams is released 10 October by Columbia Records.

It’s icky, irresponsible televisionHannah J DaviesFri 22 Aug 2025 09.34 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 09.40 EDTShareIn January 2019, news outlets across the world reported that the actor Jussie Smollett had been the victim of a particularly vile and disturbing hate crime. Smollett – who was, at the time, best known for his leading role in Fox’s music dramaEmpire– had been set upon in the early hours of the morning in his Chicago neighbourhood by two white men who had racially and homophobically abused him (Smollett is gay and mixed race). During a bitter cold snap in the city, the men had poured bleach on him and even tied a noose around his neck, while declaring they were in “Maga country”. The resulting deluge of support for Smollett is recounted in the opening of this documentary, with even Donald Trump describing the attack as “horrible … it doesn’t get any worse”.Can a Netflix documentary explain what really happened to Jussie Smollett?Read moreThese days, Smollett is no longer best known for his role on Empire but for his participation in what is widely understood to have been a hoax, organised by the actor and carried out for a fee by two acquaintances, brothers Akimbola (Bola) and Olabinjo Osundairo (Ola). The idea the Osundairos – who are of Nigerian heritage – had perpetrated a fake white supremacist attack made the case into instant meme fodder, while subsequent legal proceedings saw Smollett charged with having staged the whole thing.But is that what really happened? The Truth About Jussie Smollett? – a 90-minute documentary from the makers of such Netflix hits as The Tinder Swindler – teases the possibility of something more sinister. It asks whether the actor was the victim of a conspiracy at the heart of the city’s criminal justice system, that turned him from victim to perpetrator. It’s bold, it’s shocking – and it’s utter nonsense.View image in fullscreenFormer superintendent Eddie Johnson in The Truth About Jussie Smollett?Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThings start out convincingly enough, with testimonies from senior figures from the Chicago police department. They outline the facts of the case, as well as the inconsistencies that troubled them. Or, as the then-superintendent Eddie Johnson puts it, why would anyone have left their home “when it’s cold as shit?” Smollett had bought a sandwich, a meal that survived the attack (we see CCTV footage of him walking back into his apartment building with a Subway bag in his hand). It wasn’t conclusive, but it seemed – at the very least – odd.Rider data from Uber led the police to the Osundairos, aspiring actors who – conveniently – had flown to Nigeria the day after the attack. Footage of Smollett crying during a TV interview is juxtaposed with that of the police apprehending the brothers on their return to the US. We meet them in the present day – Ola is spaced out, while Bola modestly describes himself as “an all-round great human being”. Being hired to beat someone up was, they say, the sort of thing they assumed happened all the time in Hollywood. Plus, they allege, the idea was to give Smollett a leg-up in becoming an activist. For his part, Smollett is interviewed throughout, looking morose as he relays his version of events to camera. He insists a cheque he made out to the brothers was actually payment for fat-busting herbal steroids they would procure for him back in Nigeria, and says his life descended into a game of “whack-a-mole” in the face of rumours and lies.The Osundairos ultimately avoided any criminal charges. Smollett, meanwhile,drafted in a lawyer whose client list reads like a roll call of the most problematic public figures of our time, including Andrew Tate and Chris Brown. He was written out of Empire, then reached a plea deal with the city of Chicago that involved him sacrificing his bail money and doing community service. But then he was tried again and sent to jail, only for a court to find it unlawful that he was tried twice on the same charges and decide tooverturn his conviction.This, arguably, is where The Truth About Jussie Smollett? should end – but it just keeps going, becoming increasingly icky and irresponsible. The final act is given over almost entirely to talking heads Abigail Carr and Chelli Stanley, who weave conspiracy theory and conjecture together as they claim the Chicago police framed Smollett. After all, two eyewitnesses were given short shrift by the police, and there’s some grainy footage where the suspects look as though they could, maybe, be white. We are told, too, about the police’s worrying record on race (quelle surprise), and the fact that Johnson (who is black) wasfired for misconduct. It feels more than a little problematic to link Johnson – fired for drinking on the job – with a plot to purposely incriminate Smollett and the Osundairos while letting two hypothetical white criminals off the hook, and there is no evidence here to say that was what happened.Stanley is a freelance journalist who has written a handful of articles on Smollett, while Carr is a British TV documentary producer. How they came to be authorities on the case is never explained, and their contributions feel far too lightweight to justify the screen time given to them. (The credits reveal that both are consultant producers.) The final revelation is that Bola and Ola have written a tell-all book: cue some blooper-style scenes of them trying to remember what it’s actually called. The implication seems to be that the brothers have exploited their brush with infamy for financial gain, and thrown Smollett under the bus. But, really, a programme like thishas no business taking the moral high ground at all.The Truth About Jussie Smolllett? is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewEmpirereviewsShareReuse this content"

There is nothing new about these nostalgist leanings: Agatha Christie has after all been a solid film and TV export for more than half a century. ScreenwritersKaty Brandand Suzanne Heathcote adapt the novel and director Chris Columbus robustly delivers the C-major chords of mainstream entertainment. The result is some undemanding enjoyment, even if the film does appear finally to be saying something rather bold, even controversial, on the subject of assisted dying.The scene is Coopers Chase, a retirement facility that looks like a gigantic stately home grand enough to rival Downton Abbey; some of the exteriors were filmed at Englefield Estate in Berkshire. Inhabitants are assigned huge sets of panelled rooms – what must the fees at such an extraordinary place be? The clientele have all sorts of hobbies, but the most remarkable is that of the Thursday Murder Club. This comprises former MI6 chief Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), ex-trade unionist Ron (Pierce Brosnan), retired psychiatrist Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley) and former nurse Joyce (Celia Imrie), whose own obsession with baking absurdly lavish cakes brings some Bake-Off energy to the picturesque tale. They meet in the jigsaw room every week to discuss unsolved crimes, supplied to them by Elizabeth’s friend, a retired police officer now in the palliative care wing.Elizabeth’s husband Stephen (Jonathan Pryce) has dementia and is another resident of Coopers Chase; Elizabeth has apparently moved there as well to be with him and she is as vigorous and hale and hearty as her TMC pals. When their evil landlord Ian Ventham (David Tennant) unveils unspeakable plans to redevelop the place as luxury flats, this sets in train violent and mysterious events involving his business partners Tony Curran (Geoff Bell) and Bobby Tanner (Richard E Grant). These need to be investigated by local coppers DCI Chris Hudson (Daniel Mays), an officer with a serious chocolate habit, and WPC Donna de Freitas (Naomi Ackie). But the police won’t get anywhere without the help of the Thursday Murder Club, whose leader Elizabeth has icily forbidden use of the word “feisty” to describe them.There’s a fair bit to enjoy here, with the club sometimes resembling a kind of senior-citizen X-Men group whose collective superpower is invisibility; old people can do things without people noticing them. We also get some self-aware gags: Helen Mirren’s character at one stage walks in and her husband says that she looks “just like the queen” – that is, Queen Elizabeth, who Mirren portrayed in The Queen. Yet when the plot has to accelerate to the point of pure daftness in its final act, the movie resembles not so much a Sunday night crime serial, but a weekday afternoon kids’ TV show. Nothing necessarily wrong with that of course. The keynote is fun.The Thursday Murder Club is in cinemas from 22 August, and is on Netflix from 28 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekCrime filmsFilm adaptationsRichard OsmanOlder peopleComedy filmsKaty BrandreviewsShareReuse this content"

The first part of this tragedy may have been unavoidable, given the force of the storm; the second element certainly wasn’t. Via some beautiful footage of pre-Katrina New Orleans at Mardi Gras time, this documentary series remembers the city as it once was. It also doesn’t hesitate to call out the trail of mendacity, negligence and incompetence that made the disaster – and its aftermath – so much worse than it needed to be.Netflix, from Wednesday 27 AugustKPoppedView image in fullscreenA new Korea … Psy, known for the viral Gangnam Style, co-hosts the pop show.Photograph: AppleAs the performer who, as he modestly puts it “brought K-pop to the world”, it’s fitting thatPsyshould present this cross-cultural light entertainment spectacular.

There are car chases and shootouts with absurdly attractive people in the middle of them and recognisable “that guy from” faces surrounding. But even back then it would have been a gamble without an A-lister attached, the film probably going the way of the many non-Fast & Furious car flops like Driven, Speed Racer, Drive Angry and Need for Speed.Honey Don’t! review – Ethan Coen returns with another amusing, throwaway queer comedyRead moreNow, it’s a much more obvious, and far safer, fit for streaming, with Disney wisely nudging this one to a Hulu/Disney+ premiere. Eenie Meanie still has the feel of something that was once on a bigger screen, though, with a reported $50m budget edging it above many of the season’s multiplex offerings (more than say Weapons, Nobody 2, Materialists or Freakier Friday). Exactly how and why this particular package was deemed worthy of such an unusual spend (in this climate!) is a bit of a head-scratcher, as the film is a mildly diverting yet strangely dated caper, a watered-down Tarantino rip-off without a soul of its own.It’s the feature debut of writer-director Shawn Simmons, who created the one-and-done action series Wayne and co-created John Wick spin-off The Continental, both shows not really leaving that much of an impression. But the former was exec-produced by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, the duo who co-wrote the Deadpool series, and they have also shepherded this one, with the franchise’s almost $3bn gross granting them a certain amount of special treatment at Disney. The smug irreverence of those films is mercifully kept in check here (the humour is more misfiring than actively annoying) but there’s a similar balance of action and comedy that’s also come to typify their work elsewhere. The pair have also written the execrable streaming duds 6 Underground andGhosted(their finest work, by a considerable amount, is their smart, terrifying Alien riffLife).Simmons’s script is marginally better than their worst and he does have an uncanny ability to construct genuine surprises, especially in the first act, but his sharp left turns soon fade and the journey ahead becomes a little too obvious. The star in the vehicle is Samara Weaving, the Australian Home and Away actor turned model turned genre mainstay best known for films like Ready or Not, The Babysitter and Scream VI. She plays Edie, an unlikely getaway driver, trained from a young age, nicknamed Eenie Meanie, who has turned her back on a life of crime, choosing the straight and narrow. But she’s dragged back in by her troublesome ex-boyfriend (Karl Glusman) whose latest mistake reunites her with former boss (Andy Garcia) and a far-fetched heist with life-or-death consequences.It’s the old “one last job” tale, filled with an inevitable array of overly quirky characters (brief appearances from Randall Park, Marshawn Lynch, Steve Zahn and Jermaine Fowler) and dialogue that confuses swearing with actual jokes (the limp banter is almost entirely zinger-free). Formative shared history with Glusman’s handsome yet consistently awful ex (referred to as “the 9/11 of fucking human beings”) never quite explains why someone as smart and savvy as Edie/Eenie would continue to risk everything for him. Glusman plays dumb well, although Weaving, struggling with an awkward midwestern accent, is a little indistinctive as a lead despite the flashy chaos that engulfs her. Their low-investment back-and-forth relationship can’t propel us through the more serious stretches, the film more effective when nothing or no one really matters.When that is the case, when we’re fixed behind the wheel with $50m to spend, the film zips into action and Simmons is a dab hand at choreographing an involving and kinetic car chase. He also throws in another left-turn in the finale, one that’s initially daring yet ultimately unsatisfying as he doesn’t quite know where to take us next, leaving us with an endnote of unearned sentimentality. It’s a bumpy road for Eenie and an even bumpier one for us.Eenie Meanie is now available on Hulu in the US and on Disney+ elsewhereExplore more on these topicsThrillersAndy GarcíaAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Some attenders came away convinced that Live Laugh Love contained guest appearances not merely by Vince Staples, but actor/rapper Donald Glover and comedian Dave Chappelle (it doesn’t, although all three contributed to a fanzine produced for the event). At one juncture, the DJ announced the arrival of “my brother, Earl Sweatshirt” before the appearance of someone who was visibly not Earl Sweatshirt – he was Asian, and apparently goes under the winning stage name Gary Underpants – performing a succession of Earl Sweatshirt songs. In the aftermath, at least one online music title didn’t seem sure whether it actually was a launch party for a new album or “an elaborate prank”: would a man whose grim worldview seemed summed up by the title of 2015’sI Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outsidereallyrelease something called Live Laugh Love?View image in fullscreenEarl Sweatshirt: Live Laugh LoveOf course, Earl Sweatshirt has form when it comes to confounding album launches: Sweatshirt’s last album,2023’s Voir Dire, was secretly available on YouTube under a fake name for at least three years before it was officially released, according to its producer the Alchemist. And more broadly, this kind of thing fits with Earl Sweatshirt’s idiosyncratic approach to his career.On arrival, he was widely held to be the most gifted rapper in the Odd Future collective: not even the furore about the stomach-churning lyrical content of his debut mixtape Earl (variously compared to a body horror film and Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho) could quite drown out the technical skill and clarity on display. But while his bandmateTyler, the Creatorparlayed Odd Future’s early notoriety into a deserved seat at hip-hop’s high table, Sweatshirt seemed intent on taking a more inscrutable musical path. His lyrical focus shifted into self-examination of a particularly bleak tenor, the precision of his early flow loosened, the music behind him became increasingly challenging and avant garde: 2018’sSome Rap Songsended Sweatshirt’s career at major label Columbia in a lo-fi squall of jagged samples, glitching beats, tape hiss and buried vocals.Earl Sweatshirt: Some Rap Songs review – powerful, emotional poetryRead moreLike Voir Dire, which paired him with a producer squarely from the old-fashioned, crate-digging school, Live Laugh Love isn’t as out there as some of Sweatshirt’s oeuvre. There are hooks, or at least samples that dig into your brain as they repeat – a harpsichord motif that sounds like it was swiped from an old film soundtrack or easy listening album on Forge; Exhaust’s maddeningly familiar but unplaceable soul vocal – while Sweatshirt’s voice is front and centre in the mix.If the lyrics remain oblique, it’s hard not to notice a certain leavening in the overall mood – “Everybody love the sunshine / Shine like the boyRoy Ayerssay / Can’t throw away my whole life standing in shade,” he raps on Gamma – that seems to be linked to new fatherhood. “Both my ears are ringing with your love,” he half raps, half sings on Tourmaline, a paean to his baby daughter set to a beautiful, cascading loop of strings, albeit one regularly disrupted by distorted yells and coughs.Sunnier in outlook or not, you’re aware from the album’s start that this is music from deep within what some people call hip-hop’s “otherground”, an area in which normal rules don’t apply. On opener GSW vs Sac, both its impassioned female vocal and its rap – loose enough to feel like a freestyle – sound like they’re in danger of falling out of step with the beat; the rap gives way to a barked conversation and then the whole thing slumps abruptly to a halt inside two minutes. Tracks unexpectedly short out or crash into each other. Live’s bright-hued synth backing suddenly starts glitching midway through the track, the beat stuttering, the rhythm of Sweatshirt’s rhymes completely changing.But if you give yourself over to the album’s weird logic, it’s an enrapturing way to spend 25 minutes. The disorientating shifts and non-sequiturs feel like observing a dream someone else is having, as on Crisco’s head-spinning melding of relentless rap against a backdrop of choral vocal samples manipulated so they appear to be slipping and sliding around your ears. Live Laugh Love is the sound of someone who got an early glimpse of what huge success might look like – packed off by his mum to a correctional academy in the wake of Earl’s release, he was the subject of both a “Free Earl” campaign and a lot of intrusive interest in his personal life – and decided to inhabit his own peculiar world instead, confounding album launches, abstruse music and unexpected appearances by Gary Underpants and all. You wouldn’t necessarily want to live there full time, but if you are inclined to visit, the scenery is dazzling.This week Alexis listened toSteve Lacy – Nice ShoesLacy has talked about his first single since 2022 as a “new language”: certainly, its combination of rave breakbeat, sprechstsang vocals, lo-fi soul and squalls of rock guitar sounds thrillingly different.Explore more on these topicsEarl SweatshirtAlexis Petridis's album of the weekRapHip-hopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

On paper, it sounds as if he should be of a piece with the 2020s class of overstimulating Gen Z internet rappers such as Nettspend and OsamaSon. But although he is, in some sense, part of that scene, his music is also far more linear and melodic, and more indebted to the past. His best songs, many of which were produced by the American electronic duo Suzy Sheer, utilise beats that sound like fast, euphoric flips of songs from the Skins soundtrack; the viral hit Easter Pink could pass for a mid-2000s indie dance hit if not for Fakemink’s fast, very 2020s rapping, while Makka, a collab with Mechatok and Ecco2k, contains echoes of Bloc Party’s Intimacy, thanks to an insistent, extremely melodic guitar line.Drake recently brought him on stage at Wireless in London, and he’s beginning to play more headline shows, but not much is known about Fakemink. He seems like a true character, making his music in a blacked-out bedroom decorated with candles and stuffed toys; he is Muslim and doesn’t drink, but songs like Makka would suggest he’s partial to cough syrup and cocaine; he is deeply inspired by the creative philosophy of Alexander McQueen. It’s this combination of adrenaline-rush pop and outsized quirkiness that’s behind Fakemink’s rise.Shaad D’SouzaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenKeiyaA.Photograph: PRKeiyaA – Stupid PrizesHer album Forever, Ya Girl got us through the first Covid lockdown with its liberated take on R&B, and this return single has the same freedom and jazz sensibility as KeiyaA longs to thrive, not merely survive.Glaive – AppalachiaOne of the doyens of hyperpop picks up an old recording of American folk standard The House Carpenter then crashes it through the walls of a warehouse nightclub, resulting in a heavy, distorted trance rager.​Makaya McCraven – ImafanOf the four new tracks this week from the jazz drummer and bandleader, each taken from four upcoming EPs, Imafan is the most plainly gorgeous, with supple bass and joyous vibraphone soloing.Been Stellar – Always On My MindNo, not that Always On My Mind, but rather a grunge ballad from the New Yorkers with a burnt-sugar coating of shoegaze haze.

His second album as Nourished By Time might be darker and more dystopian than hiscritically acclaimed debut, but at its core remains a bloody, beating heart. Absorbing and cinematic, The Passionate Ones expands Brown’s unique vision for post-R&B: his aching, tremulous, earthy vocals swim under rolling Baltimore club breakbeats, flickering synths, gated reverb and uncanny looping samples. And all the while, he makes a plea for big feelings in the face of a numbing world.View image in fullscreenNourished By Time: The Passionate OnesBlaring as if from a busted speaker, opening track Automatic Love transforms boyband-y platitudes – “my body won’t feel nothing until my skin touches you” – into lyrics with real jeopardy, sharpened by the threat of looming societal collapse.Max Potential, a big 80s synth-rock number, co-opts corporate language to marvel at the pain of heartbreak, treating it as a fluorescent sign of life. Often Brown sings with such wide-mouthed, full-hearted commitment that he could be laughing or crying, but singleBaby Babyis witty and aloof, with casual talk-singing and a surfy guitar line as he calls for a global strike to “make the gravy train stop”.A tongue-in-cheek interlude wonders aloud if The Passionate Ones could be a cult – one dedicated to intensity, drive, even optimism, over any ideology. To hook you in, it’s followed by9 2 5, a spirit-soaring song of the summer contender about artistic dreams v greasy day job monotony. Real passion is precious, Brown urges, shaking you by the shoulders, hoping you’ll see the light.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockR&Balbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The story transported me to a hillside on an island in ancient Greece. I think that moment put the idea in my head that books, the best ones, were a kind of magic.My favourite book growing upIn my teens I stopped reading, like lots of boys. My mum was the only bookish person in our family, almost everyone else was obsessed with our farm. My grandma scolded me one day for reading in daylight hours; she said there couldn’t possibly be so little to do on the farm that a boy should sit and read a book. She swept me out of her kitchen to find some work to do. And I felt ashamed that she thought I was idle.The book that changed me as a teenagerWhen I was 15, I left school and worked on our farm, and I began reading again. I read at night, because I couldn’t yet drive and there was nothing on TV. I was lucky that my mum had a bookcase of great books, left to her by her schoolteacher dad. I felt a bit of an alien in my own life at that time, as many young people do, and I found my best friends in those books. I was spending my evenings with Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, JD Salinger or Wilfred Owen (yes, it was quite a male sample, and I should have read my grandad’s copies of Iris Murdoch, but didn’t). I didn’t dare tell anyone about this reading, so I was a closet reader for years. But thanks to those books, I didn’t feel so alone.The writer who changed my mindI recently readPoverty, By Americaby Matthew Desmond. It helped me understand how our economic system works, why it stays like that, and how many of us benefit from the existence of other people’s poverty.The book that made me want to be a writerA Shepherd’s Lifeby WH Hudson. It was a revelation because it was about people like my family. It’s a portrait of rural life and farming people in the mid-19th century in Wiltshire, as remembered by an old shepherd who reminded me of my grandfather. Reading it, I felt my world could legitimately be the stuff of books, and that’s powerful when you are 16. It took me 20 years to get from that teenage burst of self-belief and purpose to having a book published, but it did happen. It was an international bestseller calledThe Shepherd’s Life.Theauthor I came back toOne of my favourite books isEmpire of the Sunby JG Ballard. But I find his other novels and short stories hard work. I keep trying to read them, because loads of talented writers admire and praise them, but it’s a bit of a slog.The book I rereadIf I had to live with just one book I might take the translated poems ofAnna Akhmatova, the Russian poet. She’s such an elegant and classy writer, dealing with some of the most horrific moments of the 20th century. There is a poem she wrote called Requiem, about those troubled times, that I think might be the best thing I’ve ever read.The book I could never read againI read a lot of Holocaust and gulag memoirs in my 20s. I think I wanted to understand what people could do to each other and what people could endure. And now I can’t read books like that – I have four kids and it’s all too real and heartbreaking.The book I discovered later in lifeI didn’t read any Wendell Berry until after I wrote my first book, which is really odd, because he is the greatest agrarian radical writer of our age. I love his essays (The World-Ending Fire) best, they are really clear-eyed and elegant, and grounded in his memories of rural Kentucky.The book I am currently readingOut Stealing Horsesby Per Petterson. A wonderful book that I’m reading for the third time. I am obsessed with Scandi literature. I feel like my cultural roots are to the north. I loveThe Summer Bookby Tove Jansson, the poetry of Tomas Tranströmer and the novels of Halldór Laxness: their obsession with kinship and deep-rooted belonging, and the kind of people that emerge from hardship in the north.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

These are the noises that, if he’s not wearing hearing aids, might escape Antrobus, who was born with what he often characterises as “missing sound” in the upper and lower registers: a whistling kettle or a doorbell disappears at one end, while at the other, syllables might get elided, rendering, for example, “suspicious” as “spacious” – words with problematically different meanings.If this idea of a continuum of sound seems straightforward, as Antrobus points out in this compact, powerful exploration of his experience, it is often hard to explain to those who understand deafness as an inability to hear anything. Many imagine deaf people existing entirely in silence, cut off from communication with the hearing world except through lip-reading, sign language and equipment. For Antrobus, this aspect of “audism” can be as effortful to navigate as conversations and soundscapes in which he uses practised strategies to compensate for what his ears do not pick up.Hearing loss is not the only context in which he is expected to adapt to others’ version of the world. Visiting the Cheshire village of Antrobus – its name derived from the Norman-French “entre-bois”, or “between woods”– he meets a farmer who assumes, because of the colour of his skin, that he is descended from a slave-owning baronet, although it is his mother’s family who bears the name rather than his Jamaican-born father’s. The encounter ends with him standing in a country churchyard with thoughts of the English working-classes and the enslaved plantation workers “turning, churning, burning, all of it inside the blood pumping in my ears”. It joins a long line of moments in which his identity as a mixed Black British person with a disability that is not always easy to define is subject to projection and appropriation.Antrobus interlaces episodes from his own life with accounts of pioneering teachers of the deaf, and of artists such as poet David Wright, who lost his hearing as a child and who, Antrobus believes, internalised his parents’ anxieties and consequently lived his life with a degree of shame he finds it easy to recognise. As a child, Antrobus often wished away his deafness and kept capital-D Deaf culture at arm’s length, leaving off his hearing aids and throwing himself into activities such as competitive swimming, in which his hearing peers would also find themselves in a world of distorted sound.In the Deaf community, he discovered, he could feel not deaf enough; in the hearing world, he could just about pass if he didn’t use the sign language that he caught other students mocking as his deaf schoolmates walked to class. At anger-management classes, he listened to his mother’s stories about his episodes of frustrated lashing out and heard them “less like someone trying to have an open conversation and more like an attack, an accusation, and the fury that was erupting in my teenage brain felt wrong, a source of my own shame”. As his mother attempted to help, his father, Seymour, bought him a punchbag; Antrobus hit it so hard, he sprained his wrist.Antrobus is understandably wary of salvation narratives, and his introduction to the world of poetry is also presented as difficult. At spoken-word nights, he would have to position himself carefully so as not be overwhelmed by creaking staircases or applause, and, as an audience member, was once agonisingly singled out by a poet for vocalising his own appreciation too loudly. Nonetheless, he began to realise that poetry “held and honoured many of my own burdens and truths” and, perhaps most significantly, gave him a way to integrate his experiences and identities with one another. What emerges most consistently from this moving book is his need to be met on his own terms, in a territory that he is given the freedom to map for himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In the comet-trail of Stardew Valley, a genre is now fat with titles wherein a protagonist restarts their life and career in a bucolic, quasi-rural landscape and undertakes a blue-collar job. They get to know the local people, interfere in some lives, solve some community issues – maybe even a mystery or two. Maybe even get married. In a way, they are all Harvest Moon’s pixelated offspring – but Discounty, Crinkle Cut Games’ new offering to the genre, tackles the cozy shop life simulator a little differently.In Discounty, you are taken in by your tricky, cantankerous aunt and are put to work in her branch of a franchised supermarket. A fascinating approach, given that the road less taken through Stardew Valley involves prioritising the growth of a local supermarket rather than a community centre. Discounty is a game about business and injecting the economy of a small town. For a cozy game, there are elements of it that are very sharp indeed.View image in fullscreenSharp elements … Discounty.Photograph: Crinkle Cut GamesThe supermarket-building aspect of the game is satisfying. You purchase stock, lay it out on the shop floor, open up and let the customers buy their groceries. The till system initially operates like a tricky little basic maths puzzle, though this evolves in an interesting manner later on. Speed is paramount: don’t let the customers get grumpy, make sure the shelves are stocked, the floor is clean, things are ticking over. It’s very work-heavy, very intense – then the shop closes, you exhale, mop up the shop floor and trundle home to the funny little trailer you live in outside your aunt’s big, lush home. Aunt Tellar is a fascinating businesswoman, full of ambition – a rare, non-benevolent mentor figure. She has disagreements with the local people that you have to fix. She does, in fact, fire someone so you can come on board and take their job. This gradient of tone is really refreshing: the game isn’t clean and cutesy. It’s about operating a supermarket, not running away to a magical farm.The graphics are also a little deceptive: while you might be initially tricked into thinking the game is very pure and sweet by the pixel art, the town you move into is ragged. There is a bleak docklands. Many shop-fronts are shuttered, posters rot on the walls. These details are fantastic – reminiscent at times of Eastward. The music, too, is worth a note: ambient and pleasing. The details of this work aren’t skipped over in favour of curating a twee, relaxing vibe.Conferring with the local people does involve some solving of local issues, but also brokering supplier deals. Sometimes this requires a little massaging on your part, due to your aunt’s tricky nature. It’s high responsibility, high focus. Occasionally, the controls are a little fiddly: I found the touch-screen option on the Steam Deck a little unfocused. The initial stages of the game where you are setting up your stock and don’t have a huge amount of options are a little stressful, especially if you find the sight of basic sums on a calculator to be hard work. However, the resistance isn’t too high: I’m impressed by the way in which the challenge softens, while the intensity of each day at work notches up.Discounty is a valuable addition to the sorority of cozy, slice of life with a dream-job games. It goes a little against the grain, while still managing to hold your focus. While there is not a lot of romance in running away from your life to work in a supermarket, there is certainly a lot of good clean work to do, which still manages to feel like play.Discounty is out now onPC, PS5, Switch and Xbox, £14Explore more on these topicsGamesPCIndie gamesXbox series S/XNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5reviewsShareReuse this content"

This prequel-cum-threequel was something of a reset. Originally intended as a PS3 game thanks to its sheer technological ambition, but then released on PS2, writer and director Hideo Kojima yearned to take gravelly voiced protagonist Solid Snake away from dimly lit military bases and have him slither outdoors. Featuring hunting for food and snapping broken bones back into place, Snake Eater felt more grounded and immersive than any of its 2000sPlayStationpeers.Yet for all Snake Eater’s sweeping changes, one classic element remained intact – the stellar voice acting. It’s telling that as Konami releases its remake,Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, every wonderfully absurd line of the original script remains untouched. Boasting modernised controls and lavish new visuals, Delta feels closer to a 4K restoration of a cherished film than a maximalist Resident Evil-style remake.“To their credit, Konami didn’t want to change it or make it a different thing,” says David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake. “They really wanted it to feel like the original experience, just updated to today’s technology.”View image in fullscreen‘So cinematic’ … Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiHayter, who is also a screenwriter (he penned 2000’s X-Men film and its 2003 sequel), remains immensely proud of his role as Solid Snake, attributing his quirky performance to the unusual way the actors recorded. “When we did the first Metal Gear Solid, we recorded it in this weird house in Hollywood,” he says. “They had five mics set up, and it was just me and the other actors, and we did it all like a radio play.”It was an unusual setup: in games, voice actors largely record separately, their performances stitched together in post. Hayter found this method highly effective. “I asked it to be in my contract that we would do every other game the same way. For every Metal Gear game, I would just go into the booth and then the greatest voice actors in the world would come in and act with me for months. Having that experience on all of the games was just such a gift for a young actor.”Whereas Metal Gear Solid was largely finished when the actors recorded their roles, for Snake Eater, they were just given their cues, the spectacle left largely to their imagination. “We weren’t seeing anything,” Hayter says. “It was very difficult to grasp the full gravity of what we were doing at the time.”View image in fullscreen‘I can see why you would go back to it again and again’ … Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiIt’s a memory shared by Hayter’s costar Lori Alan, the voice of Snake Eater’s mentor and Russian double agent, the Boss. “That’s where the voice director comes in – who was amazing,” says Alan. “A recording session for this particular game is so intense. You come out and you’re like, ‘Oh my God!’ [The voice director] is in your ear whispering: ‘You love him. You trained him. You’re leaving your country!’ … It was amazing. You really do leave quite exhausted and fulfilled at the same time.”While Hayter has completed every game he’s been in, once Alan left the booth, she never truly knew the impact of the character that she’d brought to life. “We have incredible fans who have sent me bits, but I’d never played it,” says Alan. Now, 21 years later, she’s finally seen the iconic character she helped bring to life. “We were doing some promo videos for the remake,” says Hayter. “Lori said she wanted some advice on what we did 20 years ago, but it’s a little complicated to explain! So I sent her the full cutscenes from the game … and an hour or two later, I got a call and she was just in tears, [saying]: ‘Oh my God. I didn’t understand. I get it now.’”“It really is so cinematic,” Alan adds. “The complexity of the relationships is so at the forefront, it gives me chills. I got really immersed and caught up in a way that I just should have from the beginning. It’s like watching an amazing film or reading a wonderful book. I can see why you would go back to it again and again.”View image in fullscreen‘There was no need to change what was already great to begin with’ … Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiAside from some vocal cleanups and lines about the new control schemes, the cast tell me that they didn’t add anything new to Delta. “I like to think that I’m a better actor today than I was back then,” says Hayter. “But these recordings had to match the originals perfectly – and to step into the booth and do the same role 20 years later was pretty surreal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIt’s not just Hayter and Alan who have returned to the jungle: Cynthia Harrell, the singer of Snake Eater’s iconic theme, re-recorded her James Bond-esque anthem for the remake. According to Harrell, she recorded her vocals with little to no direction: “I just went into the booth and laid down what felt right. I had no idea how it would sound until I actually heard it finished, and it was like, oh, wow! [Spoiler alert] That ending scene, when you’re hearing the song and she’s dying, and the red petals are coming down … even after 20 years, I still cry.”It’s a scene that still hits decades later, forcing the players to pull the trigger after an emotional final showdown – whether they want to or not. “I wanted them to put in an option where you could just shoot [the Boss] in the leg, but no dice,” says Hayter.While the very public falling out between Kojima and Konami means that Snake Eater’s director didn’t work on Delta, the publisher recruited members of the original development team to help. “For me, that thrill and that amazement I felt 21 years ago playing for the first time – that is the experience we really want to bring back,” says Yuji Korekado, producer on Delta and part of the original team. Fellow producer Noriaki Okamura adds that the aim was to be creatively conservative: “We decided that it was not necessary to add in twists or new plot points. We felt that there was no need to change what was already great to begin with.”Now, with a whole generation growing up without knowing their Raiden from their Revolver Ocelot, Hayter sees Snake Eater Delta as the perfect reintroduction to one of gaming’s most beloved series. “Somebody asked me last night, why did they start remastering with number three?” he says. “It’s because that’s the one, you know? The characters are amazing, the story is perfect – these are some of the most tragic and beautiful scenes in gaming history. It’s like living inside a great movie for 60 hours. They’re all great games, sure, but Snake Eater isthe one.”Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is released on 28 August, on PC, PS5 and XboxExplore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesPlayStationAction gamesAdventure gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the joke is that these are the traits of two demanding pet owners: overanxious Shira, who has confined Iris to life as a house cat, and the vain Arlan, who makes Jeffabelle do tricks for TikTok.Produced by Leeds University’s Aireborne Theatre, and directed by Amit, it’s full of promise and proof that student performance –increasingly priced out of the fringe– is vital to the Edinburgh festival ecology.These cats don’t purr or miaow but talk through their emotions: Jeffabelle is fed up with having to jump at cucumbers and Iris has exacting standards about how she is stroked. But Danny Gordon Boyd and Phoebe Nichols, respectively, have a tactile body language that captures feline languor, superiority and playfulness. When Iris escapes through a window, Jeffabelle takes her for a night on the town to get in touch with her wild side – followed by a bashful “morning after” scene about exactly who sniffed whose bum first.View image in fullscreenDanny Gordon Boyd (Jeffabelle) and Sonny Birrane (Arlan).Photograph: Abby SwainAs these opposites attract, so do their owners Shira (Beth Sanders) and Arlan (Sonny Birrane), both couples nuzzling in one sweet scene. The script reflects on loneliness, liberty, life in early adulthood and the healing power of cats who “make you kinder to yourself”, says Shira. The writers clearly have their own furry inspirations and are attuned to moggy behaviour. “Water always tastes better when you don’t know how long it’s been out for,” says Jeffabelle, lapping away at a dubious drink.Sanders displays great comic timing and the play makes hay with the awkwardness in both relationships, even if the cats’ adventure loses momentum, some jokes could be sharper and the ending feels unfinished. But it’s an appealing concept, lots of fun and gives a quirky account of human behaviour – and the cats who tolerate us.AttheSpace @ Surgeons’ Hall, Edinburgh, until 23 August.

That’s part of the charm – and possibly a slight failing – in the south London standup’s new set. As he treads around in a circle on his small stage, Your Old Mucker unfolds at its own laconic pace, and leaves us to make meaning out of its disparate parts. The 29-year-old’s authority, his sly standoffishness and playfulness with the art form are qualities of a standup near the top of his game – albeit one who with this ambling, endearing show doesn’t get quite as much out of them as he might.The conceit here is that Night’s writing process is, in fact, a walking one. The show traces his perambulations around his local neighbourhood, from the dentist to the butcher, from Nisa Local to the betting shop, connecting with friends and local characters along the way. Dotted throughout are references to his late grandad, whose eccentricities (a penchant for filling biscuit tins with not-biscuits; a circumcision in his 80s) are to grandson Ed a wonder and inspiration.As for how these strands connect – well, I’d have liked the show to “come to me” just a little bit more in that regard. Given Night’s present-day story is prominently a tale of penniless, fragile young adulthood, dodging bills and drinking cheap coffee in chicken shops, maybe the parallel with his wartime forebear is there purely for bathos? Not that there’s anything heroic about grandad, if the audio clips of his left-field second world war memories (or lack thereof) are anything to go by.But if Your Old Mucker unfolds obliquely, it is studded with original thinking, great phrasemaking and big-hitting jokes – of which the guide-dog gags, a vision of Fortnum & Mason as Dante’s hell and a routine on bargaining with his landlord for a lower rent are standouts. With a couple of later riffs (one on the Buddha; one on Steve Irwin) seemingly winched in from different shows entirely, the show may not hang together that tightly. But walking a mile in Night’s shoes is still, in thisEdinburgh comedy award-nominatedshow, a wander well worth taking.AtMonkey Barrel, the Hive, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the flipside, hobbyist household names don’t always reveal the art form in its best light. Happily, Smith-Bynoe proves no mere dilettante in Kool Story Bro, which cooks up entertaining antics from personal stories volunteered by three audience members. I doubt even its host would claim this is improv at its most meticulous; he himself referred to the previous night’s offerings as “dogshit”. But it’s hard to imagine it ever not being good fun.The format accommodates a guest quizmaster, and – what a treat – tonight it’s Smith-Bynoe’s Ghosts co-starLolly Adefope. Her role is to solicit and interrogate each audience member’s kool story, and she so revels in doing so, the show’s talky part (supposed to be just a prompt) threatens to swallow up the whole hour. That tale is about a nude life-drawing class; a later one features a solo holidaymaker ambushed at sea in Colombia. Once (or, thanks to Adefope, long after) the team have enough to go on, they bring these scenarios to comic life.The joke is in the discrepancy between a story told and a story enacted, as Smith-Bynoe and team (which tonight includesLara Ricoteand Lola-Rose Maxwell) extrapolate major comic features from minor details in the original narrative, and fill interpretative gaps with eccentric character and performance. And so a shifty T-shirt seller in one story becomes in Smith-Bynoe’s hands an egotistical beat-boxer. And a side note about Colombian kidnappers speaking in unison triggers a sequence in which they perform a theatre show on the Edinburgh fringe.The scenes are short, sharp, and follow a rough-cut path towards funny. Minimal effort is made at narrative cohesion, far less a beginning, middle and end. One volunteer’s story is largely ignored in favour of an improv based around Adefope’s gossip about James Corden – which finds Smith-Bynoe cast as the Gavin & Stacey man in a Hollywood movie. The team get plenty of juice out of that joke, and others too, in a show that – because or in spite of its celebrity casting – will keep improv’s popularity bobbing along nicely.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 22 August.

This spunky 60-minute version created by Sam Landa and Emma Owens combines a radically trimmed text with aerial acrobatics, tumbling and clowning. Sensitively delivering Shakespearean verse and executing sophisticated circus requires a niche skill-set; some lines fall flat but Landa and Danielle Diniz’s choreography often deepens a story limited to the personal not the political. The enterprise is executed with panache by a charismatic cast of 10.Who’s there? A ghost in white, twisting and turning to the song Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood, later returning to use an aerial pyramid. The show casts Old Hamlet (Arthur Morel Van Hyfte) and Hamlet (Maddox Morfit-Tighe) at a similar age, which movingly emphasises how they see themselves in each other, although the ghost’s recurrent “remember me” voiceover sounds more horror movie than tragedy.Light circus skills relay the romance between Hamlet and Ophelia (Maleah Rendon) as acrobats deliver the love letter that leaves her literally head over heels. Ophelia and Laertes (Eduardo Grillo) tumble like scrapping siblings, although as the show progresses the circus elements are stop-start rather than continuous.Hamlet’s letter is not read in its entirety by Polonius (Dylan Ingwersen) but scrawled across the set and then up Ophelia’s body in chalk by the prince, underlining apparent madness. Both characters’ descent is propelled by Kim Petras’s There Will Be Blood (more shades of horror) and “To be or not to be” is looped, echoing its unresolvable arguments, as cartwheels fill the stage. Hamlet’s moves are as quicksilver as his thinking.View image in fullscreenLight mischief … Stephen Elrod as Claudius (background) with Kaisha Dessalines Wright (Guildenstern), Maddox Morfit-Tighe (Hamlet) and Caroline Bertorello (Rosencrantz).Photograph: Millissa Martin PhotographyIt’s full pelt, so when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern pull up, the sense of light mischief shared by Caroline Bertorello and Kaisha Dessalines Wright respectively is all the more appreciated. In matching vests and shorts, with a script deviating from Shakespeare, they’re not so much a deceptive duo as pals with a more-than-friends frisson.The play within the play is cod Bob Fosse but in Landa’s production the use of music and poppy, cocksure aesthetic are not unlike Baz Luhrmann’s take on Romeo and Juliet. This venue’s past life as a church is also cannily deployed when a curtain is pulled to reveal ecclesiastical architecture during Claudius’s confession.The emotional impact often needs heightening but Ophelia’s death, in a water-filled glass box, becomes a transfixing sequence accompanied by Weyes Blood’s track Movies. Her body contorts as if twisted by the men who have wielded control of her. It leaves Gertrude’s elegy oddly redundant.Flashy, dreamy, occasionally barmy, it’s certainly seldom boring – an eye-popping primer for students with appeal for Hamlet stans, too.AtAssembly Roxy, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalCircusDanceHamletWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

Now back on TV, he’s redefining what it means to be a leading manFri 22 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareThere is a moment in every actor’s career when they must confront their early dreams and their present reality. For Taylor Kitsch, that reckoning has been more painful than for most. “If you start marrying yourself to these phantom outcomes that don’t exist, man, you’re gonna go crazy,” he says.Kitsch is talking from New York, thousands of miles from his home in Montana, where he has carved out a different life from his Hollywood years. “I’d rather be in the wild chasing animals with my camera than going to clubs or bars or Hollywood parties,” he says.Today he’s at a press junket for his new Prime Video series, The Terminal List: Dark Wolf, which expertly marries gun battles and spy intrigue with a neat consideration of what happens when red-blooded American males are confronted by the realities of war. Before our interview, I was excited to see the exact state of dishevelment that the wildlife-chasing actor would greet me in, but my request for him to turn on his camera is politely rebuffed and I have to make do with listening to his disembodied Canadian-cum-Texan boom.View image in fullscreenLost action hero … Taylor Kitsch with Chris Pratt in The Terminal List: Dark Wolf.Photograph: Justin Lubin/PrimeThe path seemed so clear in 2012. Kitsch was a 30-year-old Canadian hockey player turned model turned actor, blessed with the kind of looks that make casting directors reach for their phones and studio heads reach for their chequebooks. He had spent the back half of his 20s playing Tim Riggins, the brooding high-school running back and rebel heart of the critically acclaimed show Friday Night Lights. His first forays into movies were solid turns, among them Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the photojournalist Kevin Carter in The Bang Bang Club. Stardom seemed inevitable. A few years earlier he had lived in his car on futile visits to LA – now he was looking up at billboards of himself. The Guardian proclaimed him a star “about to turn supernova”.Then came the big swing: John Carter, Disney’s $264m bet on Kitsch becoming the next great action star. The film was based on the 1912 novel A Princess of Mars, inspiration for a number of great 20th-century space operas (not least Star Wars and Dune) and was meant to be Disney’s answer to Avatar. Hopes were high but the box office gods were ungiving. John Carter quickly became a punchline due to its lackluster title and marketing campaign, which one Disney executive deemed “the worst in the history of movies”. The film itself is decent, certainly better than its 52% score on Rotten Tomatoes, and Kitsch received praise for the“slyness” brought to the title character.Still, John Carter felt derivative. Its similarities to Avatar in particular (Earth soldier is transported to an exotic planet and begrudgingly accepted by the native population before saving the day) made it a magnet for unhelpful headlines as the early box office returns proved disappointing. It went on to flop so badly (reported loss: $200m) that its title now refers less to the film than its accompanying cautionary tale of big-budget disaster.Meanwhile, the prevailing narrative around Kitsch was that he couldn’t carry a blockbuster – a suspicion compounded by his next film, Battleship, a failed attempt to turn the board game into a Transformers-style franchise that is now primarily remembered for being Rihanna’s film debut.There’s so many cogs in that wheel of movies, man. I’m literally such a small part of itThe cruel irony is that while Kitsch’s charismatic screen presence was honed on a naturalistic high-school drama, his potential big break came in that post-Avatar moment when movie studios looked to build franchises around groundbreaking special effects, without necessarily marrying them to strong characters or coherent narratives.Kitsch is sanguine about his part in the John Carter debacle. “There’s so many cogs in that wheel of movies, man. I’m literally such a small part of it.” The machine was so much bigger than any one person: “I don’t know if it’s timing, or a million cooks in the kitchen, or it just didn’t hit.” At the time, he took it personally, feeling the weight of a $264m production, the studio’s faith, the expectations that came with being positioned as the next big star. “Over time,” he pauses, choosing his words carefully, “you gave it the best you could. I’m proud of the way I led that shoot. You move on.”Perhaps the most telling aspect of Kitsch’s story isn’t the fall – it’s what he did while he was down. Rather than chase another potential blockbuster or reinvent himself as a different kind of leading man, he disappeared into the work itself.The roles that followed show an actor no longer interested in being anyone’s idea of a Hollywood heart-throb. In 2015, Kitsch played a repressed highway patrol officer in season two of True Detective, a role that laid the foundation for his subsequent TV revival, embodying wounded men in a country that’s constantly redefining masculinity. He marks out his 2018 part as the cult leader David Koresh in the Paramount miniseries Waco as “a big turn in my career, in the sense of preparation and understanding and not judging a character”. The role of Koresh, a real-life figure responsible for alleged sexual abuse and the deaths of dozens, is certainly more complex than the parts that made Kitsch famous.View image in fullscreenA different ballgame … Minka Kelly and Taylor Kitsch in Friday Night Lights.Photograph: NBC/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock“My job is to marry myself emotionally to the circumstances and these guys,” he says. “I don’t think: ‘I hope you like Dave at this point or I hope you hate him now.’ I just want to be as authentic as I can be to him and service that without judgment.” It’s an approach that would prove essential when Netflix’s Painkiller came along in 2023, a limited series examining the opioid crisis through the lens of pharmaceutical executives, addicts and the families caught between them.For Kitsch, the project was deeply personal. “Addiction runs through my family pretty hard,” he says. “It’s really changed my perspective in a lot of ways.” His sister is in recovery, so when the opportunity arose to play an opioid-addicted salesman, he asked her to advise on the role. “I’ve seen her detox on the floor of my house,” he says quietly. “Those scenes were very close to me and I had more people reach out than any other show I’ve ever done, which meant a lot to me … to share it with my sister was amazing, to be honest.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionEarlier this year, in honour of his sister’s successful journey to sobriety, he founded the nonprofit Howlers Ridge. The organisation provides support for veterans and trauma survivors and represents the kind of purpose-driven project that would have been impossible during his blockbuster years. “I think I’ve grown up a little bit,” he says. “In my 20s, I would see people who’d be like: Well, why aren’t you doing more? You have the means to help people.”There is an interesting parallel between Kitsch’s career and the characters he is drawn to playing. Many of them are men trying to figure out how to live with themselves, how to carry on when the world has shifted beneath their feet. The transition from movie star to television actor might seem like a step backward to some, but for Kitsch, it represented something more valuable: creative control and the chance to truly inhabit his characters and allow part of them to inhabit him.The Terminal List: Dark Wolf represents yet another step in his journey back to mainstream attention. Despite a lukewarm critical reception for the original series –including one star from the Guardian– the show became one of Prime Video’s biggest streaming hits ever, largely off the back of a charismatic turn from Chris Pratt in the lead role. Working with Pratt as both co-star and producer for this new prequel series, Kitsch found himself in the curious position of partnering with someone whose career has taken the path his own could have, had the machine worked as intended. Far from any bitterness about Pratt’s fame, there’s genuine enthusiasm in Kitsch’s voice when discussing their collaboration. “We get along really well. I think there’s a mutual respect.” Faced with that level of celebrity, Kitsch thinks about the practicalities: “You often wonder where you’d even be living. I bet you I wouldn’t even be living in Montana.”The beauty of Kitsch’s current life – photographing wildlife in Montana between carefully chosen projects – is how little it resembles what anyone expected his career to look like. The actor’s career is quieter but perhaps more sustainable. He’s not the action star Hollywood tried to make him, but he’s also not the cautionary tale they might have written him off as. Instead, he’s something more interesting: an actor who faced failure, and subsequently redefined success on his own terms.“I just want to keep disappearing,” he says, almost as a throwaway. Not from the world, but into roles. Into people he hasn’t met yet, lives he hasn’t lived. Looking at Kitsch’s career now, it’s hard not to think that maybe the supernova metaphor was wrong from the beginning. Supernovae burn bright and burn out. What Kitsch has built instead is more like a campfire: sustainable, warm and capable of lasting through the night.The Terminal List: Dark Wolfis onPrime Video from27 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmTelevisionAmazon Prime VideofeaturesShareReuse this content"

You might do worse than Anna Clyne’s The Years, a subtle meditation on the mystery of time set to words by Stephanie Fleischmann. Composed during the pandemic, its approachable mood of calm isolation survives a series of angsty intrusions to convey a message of quiet hopefulness. Like the Beethoven, it reaches a triumphant conclusion, though in Clyne’s case the victory is an eminently peaceful one.The Danish National Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Fabio Luisi gave it a relaxed and sensitive reading, warm string tones cocooning vocal lines that rose and fell, rendered with impressive clarity by the Danish National Concert Choir. The musical language, faintly reminiscent of Tippett or Barber, was built on simple melodies that blossomed into tangy harmonic clusters. Oscillating voices, stalked by harsh orchestral interjections like wailing sirens, gave way to an expansive sunset glimpsed through a haze of strings and a tranquil, timeless conclusion.Less successful somehow was Bent Sørensen’s Evening Land, a 13-minute musical portrait that contrasted a pastoral childhood memory from the composer’s native Zealand in Denmark with the sensation 50 years later of standing on a balcony overlooking the bustle of Manhattan. The former was represented by wispy, folkish violin and oozy strings, the latter by restless syncopations and grating sand blocks, but the overall conceit was flimsy, and – a pensive oboe melody aside – there was little here that really stayed with you.There was plenty to admire in the Beethoven, not least the incisiveness of the 70 Danish singers who frequently sounded like a choir twice the size. The orchestra, too, was impressive, responding perceptively to the energetic Luisi who, conducting from memory, shaped the music with admirably clear intentions. The problem lay in the often hectic speeds, perhaps ill-considered for an auditorium as resonant as theRoyal Albert Hall.The opening movement was punchy and thoroughly organic, but instrumental details in the scherzo were sometimes smudgy and the adagio felt occasionally perfunctory. It was left to the choir and a fine lineup of soloists to stir the emotions and steer the work to its irrepressible rousing conclusion.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

I remember being 10, in 2001, at my grandmother’s house, a 1,000-piece puzzle spread across the table. I was determined to complete it before my mum and sister returned from a hike. By the end of the day it was done, and something clicked. There was a sense of satisfaction in fitting those pieces together.After that, puzzles became a regular part of my life. I was always dipping into them – whether it was a quick 500-piece puzzle at the weekend or a more ambitious one over the holidays.A few years later, I began uploading videos to YouTube, dabbling in various types of content, from crafting videos to general vlogging. I noticed there weren’t many people talking about jigsaws, so I started making videos about my collection, my favourites and the techniques I used to solve them.At first, it was just a fun side project. But then Covid-19 hit. The world slowed down and people were stuck at home. Suddenly puzzles were popular and my videos were getting more views. In 2021, I decided to take on a 24,000-piece puzzle – the first true giant I filmed. I recorded the whole thing over several months and people loved following along. That’s when I realised this might not just be a hobby. I started focusing solely on puzzles and by 2022 I’d earned aGuinness World Record for being the most-followed jigsaw puzzler on YouTube, with 143,000 subscribers.Reaching that milestone was surreal. But having a big audience also means juggling expectations, keeping content fresh and setting boundaries so I don’t burn out. I want it to stay fun, for them and for me.Experience: I’m a scam hunter who got scammedRead morePuzzling isn’t just a solitary activity. Before Covid, in-person competitions were gaining traction, but the pandemic took it to another level with online events. Now that in-person contests are back, they sell out immediately.I’ve competed in national and international puzzle championships, racing to complete 500-piece puzzles in record time. I placed second in the individual USA National Jigsaw Puzzle championships in 2022, second in the team competition at the world championships in 2023 and third in the same competition in 2024. My fastest time is 42 minutes and 46 seconds for a 500-piece puzzle, though in the major competitions, the fastest individual time is about 26 minutes. Some on YouTube do it even faster.It’s a strange blend of speed, strategy and muscle memory. Your brain is scanning for colours, patterns and shapes, while your hands are constantly moving, slotting pieces in. Over the years, the process becomes instinctive. Technique varies: the classic approach is to start with the edges, but if the border is a solid colour or particularly tricky, I might begin in the middle, focusing on the most distinctive sections first.During competitions, you’re constantly checking your area, making sure nothing has fallen on the floor. In a setting where every second counts, even something small like that can throw you off. Sometimes, entire trays of pieces get knocked over mid-race.Despite its competitive nature, the puzzle community is incredibly supportive. I’ve made so many friends: people I see at competitions, chat with online and share strategies with. There’s little feuding, just a shared love for an activity that brings us joy.When I was growing up, puzzles were something older people did on a rainy afternoon, but now I see students and twentysomethings connecting through YouTube, TikTok and online competitions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Every piece I place brings me a little closer to the full picture – a reminder that progress happens, even if it’s slow. In life, too, that feels true. I live in fast-paced Los Angeles and, while I know some people my age are out partying or travelling the world, I’m happiest at home with a puzzle in front of me. Even after a long day of filming, I’ll still pull out a jigsaw in the evening, just for myself. It’s my version of mindfulness, one piece at a time.As told to Sophie HaydockDo you have an experience to share?

The last leg of our journey took us eastwards to Constanța on the Black Sea. We arrived the day itsstunning art nouveau casinowas reopened after being rescued from dereliction. Romanian trains may not be the most luxurious or speedy, but with most of our journeys costing from £10 to £20 in first class, they are certainly value for money.

Enjoy the view of Murrayfield with Edinburgh Zoo on the hill to the north. Soon you’ll see the Forth Bridge girders loom at Dalmeny before you fly over the Forth. Take in the stunning view east towards the Bass Rock, and look west past bridges towards Stirling and the Grampian mountains beyond. The ancient capital of Dunfermline is next, as you enter Fife. To the north of Cardenden you will see the peaks of theLomond Hills regional park. An alternative route is to change at Inverkeithing on return and take a train up the Fife coast to Kirkcaldy, from where it’s a 50-minute ride back to Edinburgh. An unforgettable railway foray and respite from touristy Edinburgh.Nigel ArchdaleTaking it slowly from Stockport to AndalucíaView image in fullscreen‘The best sunset and sunrise’ in Cádiz, Spain.Photograph: Dmytro Kosmenko/Getty ImagesWe travelled from our home station of Stockport to Cádiz in southern Spain, stopping at London, Paris, Lyon, Barcelona and Seville en route. Not only was this a climate-conscious decision, but also a way to see more of Europe and to help us to relax and slow down. We took a river cruise in Paris, then the next day enjoyed lunch in Lyon where the local market place gave us a taste of the city. We next sped off to Barcelona, staying in the trendy neighbourhood of El Poblenou. From there we took in a panoramic view of the city from the castle of Montjuïc, followed by the bustling beach. Back on the train, our pace slowed again as we set out for Seville with its sweltering beauty and incredible history. Our final stop was Cádiz, where we saw the best sunset and sunrise. We wouldn’t be able to afford first class on a plane, but we could by rail. For example, Barcelona to Seville was under £60! We sipped wine as the beautiful landscape passed by, in a comfortable seat, with wifi and charging facilities, knowing there would be no wait for luggage at the other end.RebeccaRome to Sicily via train and ferryView image in fullscreenLet the ferry take the strain … the train and its passengers are transported by boat to SicilyPhotograph: Francesco Bloisi/Tutto TrenoHop on the sleeper train in Rome, or perhaps Naples, and wake the next morning in Sicily.

Travelling on anInterrailticket through Europe, we made two three-night stops on our way to the port in southern Spain, and two two-night stops on our return journey. On the outward journey we stopped in Girona and Córdoba, both of which have picturesque old towns. In Córdoba we visited eight stunning courtyard gardens as well as thePalace of Vianaand theMezquita, surely one of the most astonishing buildings in the world. On the return leg we stopped in Málaga and Montpellier, both characterful places. We would have missed out on these four wonderful destinations if we had flown directly to Marrakech.LouiseAnywhere in Belgium for €8.50View image in fullscreen‘On our travels we discovered the Unesco-listedbegijnhovenof Flanders.’Photograph: Shotshop/AlamyLast year, my wife and I explored Belgium by rail. We stayed in a self-catering apartment just a few hundred yards from Antwerp station, a fantastic cathedral to the railways containing several pink granite columns and panels, polished in our home town of Aberdeen. In Belgiumover-65s can buy a day returnto anywhere in the country for just €8.50! We visited several towns and cities, none involving lengthy journeys. On our travels we discovered the Unesco-listedbegijnhovenof Flanders. These were medieval communities for widows or unmarried women, many now beautifully restored.Jim FiddesBeach, mountains and gastronomy in FranceView image in fullscreenHistorical and culinary delights in Toulouse, France.Photograph: Starcevic/Getty Images/iStockphotoMy wife and I have travelled around a lot of Europe but our best trip for simplicity is a triangle of France: Eurostar to Paris, then theTGV to Toulouseforsaucisseand architectural and historical delights; next, theslow train to Bayonne, gazing at the Pyrenees as the train trundles past Lourdes and on to the French Basque coast; before taking theTGV back up to Paris. City, gastronomy, mountains and beach all in one.GeorgeLaid-back vibes on the line to LjubljanaView image in fullscreenEn route to Bled.Photograph: AlexOur trip began with the sway of a boat gliding into Venice. After days getting blissfully lost in quiet alleys and forgotten courtyards, we boarded the train from Santa Lucia station, speeding across the shimmering lagoon to Trieste. In a sunlit square, we savoured chocolate gelato, the Mediterranean sparkling nearby. Next, Ljubljana welcomed us with its laid-back vibes. We sipped cocktails in jars by the river, surrounded by art and colour. Finally, a graffiti-covered train carried us toLake Bled, where we hiked and swam beneath the majestic Julian Alps, ending our journey in a cosy pod under stars and amid fireflies.AlexView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysReaders' travel tipsRail travelPublic transport tripsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Answer: we’re both keen for you to “spice up your life”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Like Nando’s, though, this particular expert appreciates that everyone enjoys different levels of spiciness. And that can fluctuate: there are wild XXtra Hot Peri-Peri nights and milder Lemon and Herb moods when you’re after something more sensual and snuggly.Here is a list of suggestions to liven up your love life, in which I’ve tried to cover all bases. From aphrodisiac edibles to unusual undies; romantic games to raunchy gadgets; special-effect oils that enhance massages to thoughtfully made toys, there are ideas here for everyone.I’ve included inspiration for partners (and singles – solo sex matters too) who want to incorporate novelty when they’re knackered, since being “too tired for fun” is a complaint I hear commonly. And there are products to address other widespread yet underdiscussed intimate problems, plus a few resources to expand your adult education.How to liven up your love lifeGive a massageView image in fullscreenMassagemitts£49.99 at Rocks OffThese patented, nodule-covered mittens were originally developed by a physiotherapist to protect her wrists and hands from repetitive strain injury while kneading patients for hours. They’ve been adopted by people who want to give their lover a satisfying rub-down in an erotic context or give themselves a deeper, more tension-releasing massage.Use them with massage oil (see my recommendations below) or in the shower with an enlivening scrub – my current favourite is NCLA Beauty’s seaside-scented scrub.View image in fullscreenNCLA Beauty’s seaside-scented Amalfi coast neroli sugar scrub, 250g£23.80 at Debenhams£32 at RevolveWhile you’re massaging, try using your lungs as well as your limbs: blowing through pursed lips, as though you’re extinguishing birthday candles, delivers a cold breath, and making a soft “haa” sound while exhaling with an open mouth will give a warm breath.Admittedly, the massage mitts might lookridiculous: your gloved hands become those of a syphilitic, tobogganing Ribena berry. So pop a blindfold on your partner to maintain a seductive atmosphere. Ann Summers does a chic satin and lace one for a tenner.View image in fullscreenSatin and lace blindfold£10 at Ann SummersView image in fullscreen£15.97 at AmazonI love donning my Musicozy eye mask during massages and solo pleasure sessions to block out visualandauditory distractions, as it features wireless headphones through which you can play audio erotica or an atmospheric soundtrack. Check outAdele Brydges: primarily known for her handmade ceramic sex toys, she also curates the sultriest playlists on Spotify. HerBodyscapes playlistis specifically intended to accompany self-stroking sessions and elevate auto-eroticism into something close to holy. I’ve got it on repeat.View image in fullscreenOrgie Acqua Croccante crunchy monoi mousse£19.16 at Cured PharmacyLike a cloud of popping candy, this effervescent mousse crackles and fizzes on the skin, while the monoi scent evokesholiday sun cream. The bubbling effect is fleeting – it snaps and pops for as long as a bowl of Rice Krispies once the milk is poured on – but I love how unexpected and playful it is. It’s an easy, low-effort way to create a delightful special effect. Plus, this product is wonderfully cooling on baking summer nights, when oils can make you feel like a basted rotisserie chicken.View image in fullscreenRooarwarmingmassageoil, 100ml£38 at RooarThe “warming” effect of this 100% natural oil is mild: more cup of ginger tea for the skin than being slapped with Deep Heat. The herbal, floral and spicy notes – including clove bud, spearmint, marjoram and lavender – are expertly balanced to produce a posh tonic that’s rejuvenating, soothing, and makes you feel like you’ve been anointed by a sexy Elvish queen.A nice way to end a massage is to wipe excess oil off your hands, then rub your fingers through your lover’s hair in circling motions (provided your partner hasn’t gone to the salon that day). Oils like Rooar’s that contain mint extracts will give a mild tingling effect that’s helpfully rejuvenating if, for any reason, you don’t want your beau to fall asleep just yet.View image in fullscreenCoco de Mer Enraptured Figment massage oil, 100ml£36 at Cult Beauty£40 at John LewisDid Apple TV+’s series about a lusty Napoleonic-era chef, Carême, make you aware of your heart beating in places immediately below your navel? How about Nicholas Hoult and Elle Fanning in satirical period drama The Great? Then you’ll love this fig and orange blossom oil, which comes in an apothecary-style glass bottle and smells of tapestry-walled country mansions.Forty quid’s worth of liquid is terrifyingly easy to knock and spill from this screw-lidded vial, though. Consider decanting a little into a small jug for a less fiscally fretful drizzling. As a bonus, pretend you just invented the vol-au-vent and thus deserve a good seeing to in a Parisian kitchen.View image in fullscreenAnn Summers MyViv bergamot massage oil, 100ml£10 at Asos£10 at AmazonAffordable without smelling cheap, this non-greasy, non-cloying oil also helps raise funds for the charityBreast Cancer Now. No matter your gender, you shouldcheck your chestat least once a month; a dash of massage oil can help your fingers glide, and make the process feel less grimly clinical and more pampering.Couples’ confectioneryView image in fullscreenFlintts Mints fordrymouths, 15g£7.53 at Sex ToysXerostomia – a reduction in saliva production leading to an uncomfortably dry mouth – can be caused by several issues, from anxiety to certain medications, and as a symptom of perimenopause and menopause.Kissing and giving oral isn’t so pleasant when your tongue feels like turkey jerky, so to stimulate salivation, Flintts Mints contain extract of Spilanthes flowers, AKA “electric daisies” or “buzz buttons”. They come in nine flavours and different strengths of spit-inducing power that Flintts call “sparkle”. I find the sensation similar to the tingly numbness imparted by Szechuan peppercorns. Let one dissolve over a couple of minutes before oral activities.View image in fullscreenFor Play aphrodisiac chocolates£27.99 for six at SheSpot£28 for six at For PlayView image in fullscreenPlaymate aphrodisiac chocolates£29.99 for three at Lovehoney£29.99 for three at RackhamsWhile open-minded and respectful about complementary and alternative medicine, I’m healthily sceptical about pricey, ill-regulated herbal supplements making vague claims that theymayboost libido or enhance performance.I’m not usually a fan of “naughty sweeties” either, having eaten too many waxy chocolate boobs at hen parties (they usually taste like they’ve come out of a cheap Advent calendar).So by rights I should hate these aphrodisiac chocolates – but I don’t. A far longer article would be required to analyse whether plants and roots such as ashwagandha, puncture vine, arjuna, maca, catuaba and ginseng could be swiftly effective in the amounts these treats contain, but they did make my partner and me feel frisky. I’d put money on that being a placebo effect … but placebos can be powerful things.The For Play chocs are topped with a pretty metallic dusting, and are available in a range of spiced varieties for same-sex couples as well as heteros. The dark, bitter Playmate ones have three flavours of filling, in a heart shape designed to be halved and shared with your beloved. If it’s codswallop, it’s at least harmless fun, and an upgrade on a box of Milk Tray.Stylish sex toysView image in fullscreenTenga Arte reusable penile stimulating sleeve£26 at Tenga£26.99 at LovehoneyAlthough the tides are gradually turning towards greater social acceptability, masturbation toys designed for penises tend to give a lot of people the ick – not least because the Fleshlight-style stimulators modelled on disembodied vaginas, anuses and mouths look a little like things you’d find in a serial killer’s freezer.In contrast, Tokyo-based company Tenga – whose name translates as “righteously arranged and elegant” – makes non-anatomical penile toys so sculptural that they’d be at home atop a marble plinth.The Arte sleeve is a kind of soft, stretchy elastomer sock, lined with springy ridges and nodules. You pour in some lube, insert a penis (your lover’s or your own), then use your hand to move the toy up and down so the textured inside strokes and caresses the head and shaft. Adjust your grip for more intense or gentle sensations. After you’re finished, flip the Arte inside out, clean well under the tap and air-dry on the included stand.In addition to solo play, I recommend Tenga toys to people who want to do something thrilling for their penis-having partner that doesn’t demand a lot from them physically. If you’re out of action for penetrative or oral sex for whatever reason, these toys give manual stimulation far more mind-blowing than a plain palm. To ring the changes, try warming the toy with hot water before use, or experiment with different viscosities of Tenga lubricant for a more slippy or grippy experience.View image in fullscreenWomanizer Enhance rechargeable clitoral vibrator£149 at Lovehoney£149 at WomanizerThe latest, much-anticipated release from Womanizer – the inventor of gamechanging air-pulse clitoral toys, which I recommend in the Filter’s roundup ofthe best vibrators. This device adds vibration to the proprietary “Pleasure Air” stimulation to overwhelm your clitoris into orgasm.In an external study conducted by the Berlin Institute for Innovation, 100 testersallreported reaching climax with the Enhance, with 47% enjoying multiple orgasms in one session, so I was keen to see if I could replicate those figures in my own at-home laboratory.The Enhance was violently potent. This thing sucked an orgasm out of me like a Henry Hoover performing a surgical procedure. I almost needed Botox to relax my eyebrows down afterwards. It’s amazing, but almost brutally so.Beware: in my experience, the Enhance engorges private parts and enlivens nerve endings to the point where extended use can cause temporary oversensitivity or sharp pain. Paul McKenna might make his next fortune hypnotising people into putting it down.View image in fullscreenZalo Calla vibrating massager£69 at ZaloOh, she’s a beauty. And the opposite of the Womanizer Enhance in terms of ferocity. The waterproof, flower-shaped Zalo Calla is about the same thickness as a fountain pen, and offers three delicate types of stimulation to take turns with: brush and flutter the supple silicone petals over the nipples, thighs, vulva or testicles; let the pinpoint pistil in the centre of the blossom shiver against the clitoris; or use the stem as an insertable vaginal vibrator.Vibrators as slim as this are thin on the ground, despite being beneficial for people requiring dilation after vaginal surgery or to treat tightness; those with a hypertonic pelvic floor; or those who simply dislike hulking, girthy probes. The long stem makes it easier for you or your boo to reach hotspots, too. Using it on a partner feels charmingly like coaxing ecstatic music from their body with a conductor’s baton.The fine diameter means there’s not enough room for a mighty motor, so the Lily is best for those seeking tenderness – or who’ve been diddled to the stage of actual soreness with a Womanizer and need to chill their beans.For more inspiration, read our guide tothe best vibratorsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I suspect there’s a horrible amount of trial, error and painful misadventure happening between bedsheets up and down the country.For those who want less haphazard experiences, there’s Beducated. This online platform offers more than 150 multilesson video courses produced in collaboration with 70 international experts, in everything from dirty talking, Tantra and strap-on play to dealing with rejection and reclaiming pleasure after sexual trauma. There are teachers on here I greatly admire, including psychotherapist Silva Neves, whose work outlining the differences between compulsive sexual behaviours and “addictions” I consider vital to modern conversations about treating problematic pornography use. The world of questionably qualified “sex coaches” can be a dangerous wild west, but Beducated is cowboy-free.Underwear, lingerie and loungewearView image in fullscreenButtress and Snatch shirt cut braand knicker service£129 at Buttress and SnatchWhat’s sexier than stealing your partner’s shirt to wear over nothing but your birthday suit? Well, you could send it to indie tailors Buttress and Snatch to be upcycled into a bespoke knicker and bra set. It also sells“something blue” gartersmade from old garments for just £20, which can be bought ready-made or crafted from a groom or lover’s clothing for no extra charge – a wonderful wedding present, or a surprise for a filthy weekend away.View image in fullscreenStep One sport boxer briefs£15 at Step One£15 at AmazonYou know what rubs me up the wrong way? There’s an abundance of great “chub rub” pants and anti-chafe undershorts on the market for women – I rate Snag’sChub Rub ShortsandThigh Society’s shorts– but not many solutions for chaps suffering from chapped thighs. Plenty of men develop sore inner thighs caused by sweat and friction in the summer heat, and besides being uncomfortable, rashes in private places can kill confidence in bed. A survey of 2,000 people polled by Sudocrem found that more than a third of people with skin conditions feel uncomfortable undressing in front of their partners, with men most likely to report loneliness as a side-effect of dermatological issues.Step One’s undies are a fabulous fix. Bamboo material wicks away moisture; friction-reducing “Ultraglyde” panels protect inner legs from abrasion; and the longer length of the “sport” models is great for taller and bigger guys. Buy your first pair, and if you don’t like them, the company will refund you in full.View image in fullscreenTabitha RaynescarfFrom £25 at Tabitha RayneA silky scarf is the Swiss army knife of sex. Use it as a blindfold or wrap ice cubes inside it, have your lover stand up and bind their wrists lightly behind their back, then don’t stop kissing until everything has melted and trailed in refreshing rivulets down their body. Tie it in a bow on a brassiere strap, or between the cups, to add a flirty, floaty touch to even the most sturdy piece of mammary scaffolding. Agree with your other half that wearing it in public – around your neck, in your hair – is a secret signal that you’re down to get dirty later on.For extra eroticism, these Tabitha Rayne scarves are decorated with saucy sketches and passages from erotic novels. Fold and drape them to reveal or conceal as much naughtiness as you please.View image in fullscreenBluebella embroidery personalisation service£2.95 (with purchase) at BluebellaFor £2.95, Bluebella will embroider up to three initials on a range of their lingerie and bed wear, includinga romantic, ruffle-backed teddyavailable in sizes 6-18; atimeless chic chemise(pictured) anda suits-all sheer kimono.Pick a monogram, either to show who the lingerie belongs to … or, if you like to play with dominance and submission, who the wearer does.Bed linen-protecting blanketsView image in fullscreenSplash blanketFrom £49 at Splash BlanketLubricant, massage oil, sweat, menstrual blood and various body fluids shooting like streamers from a party popper: great sex frequently wrecks sheets. Lying on a scratchy, ratty old towel might save your duvet, but it feels decidedly “No room at the inn”.Enter the Splash Blanket – a big, plush throw with snuggly sherpa fleece on one side, luxe velvet on the other, and that’s waterproof on both. These blankets can hold up to a litre of liquid, and the manufacturer claims they’ll retain their impermeability through at least a year of regular washing and tumble drying. Some customers say their throws are still holding up well after half a decade.I’ve been vigorously using mine for three months so far, as well as conducting some sanitary pad ad-style experiments involving pouring beakers of water on it to test maximum absorbency. So far, it’s a big thumbs up.Those concerned that the protective inner layer might cause a crinkly, plasticky sound, or that the fabric will stain, can rest assured: that’s a blanket “nope” on both counts. I opted for a dark shade, but trusted kinkster friends (who also, improbably, like beige) tell me that even the palest champagne colour comes up impressively clean after laundering, so long as you do it the morning after.Note: avoid the faux fur versions unless you’re truly committed to Viking role play. They’re hand-wash only, which rather defeats the point.View image in fullscreenDame Thro waterproof sex blanket£50 at SheSpotThis smaller, circular blanket packs down compactly into a cosmetics-size bag, making it handy for travel, or even chucking over a chair cushion if you’re getting frisky on furniture. It’s only 80cm in diameter, which may not suit larger bodies or rambunctious lovers. Furthermore, it’s off-white. Still, this dot will get you out of a tight spot in hotel beds.Flirtatious date night gamesView image in fullscreenDeep couples’ card game£39 at AmazonThis artfully presented box contains 40 question cards to be answered in order, calculated to encourage deep conversations. Additionally, there’s a tiny atomiser of perfume; QR codes to pieces of music; pictures to consider; tactile exercises; and chocolate to share, to incorporate all five senses. The designers’ claim that this makes the game “immersive” is a stretch, but they’re engaging touches.I think the Deep card game is best suited to new couples who still have much to discover about each other, or, on the flip side, long-term lovers whose day-to-day discussions involve who’s going to de-gunk the dishwasher filter or find the youngest’s lost Gruffalo plimsoll. A romantic, at-home way to remember why you moved in together in the first place.View image in fullscreenMonogamy board game£29.99 at Lovehoney£30 at Ann SummersMonogamy just celebrated its 25th anniversary, and has apparently been “updated to reflect the modern world”. I can virtuallyfeelgen Z sneer as they collectively side-eye the fact that the name wasn’t changed to Polyamory, and indeed, beyond removing references to calling landlines, the game still has a strongly retro, Jilly Cooper, end-of-the-pier feel.You’re supposed to romp around the board six times, completing increasingly raunchy challenges. One of them involves cutting a bin bag in half, lubing up from top to toe, and wrestling on it like thrashing eels. I know few couples who’d do that (get a Splash Blanket!), let alone carry on playing a board game afterwards – but there’s an unintended joy in the campy ridiculousness of it all.My partner and I laughed uproariously, then brainstormed howwewould build a date-night game, which ended up being a provocative topic. Whether you end up rolling in the sheets, or rolling on the floor in hysterics, suspending your cynicism and just rolling with Monogamy makes for a superbly silly evening.Bigger is always better – and nine other sex myths bustedRead moreClever candlesView image in fullscreenDS& Durga tuberose myrrhder candle£60 at Space NK£60 at LibertyDinner date gone well, but left your flat stinking unsexily of spag bol? Then light up DS & Durga’s scented candle to clear the air. Scented candles instantly enhance the ambience, casting a flattering, flickering glow that can help shy lovers feel less exposed, while transforming a distractingly messy room into a bohemian backdrop. I rate sexting with candlelit selfies taken in the bathtub: glossy, wet skin reflects firelight stunningly, while steam lends a hazy filter effect to snaps. It’s not smut, it’sart.The dominant scent here is heady, intoxicating tuberose, which in the Victorian language of flowers symbolised dangerous pleasures. It has a gothic perfume that puts me in mind of being willingly bitten by Nosferatu, and it’s strictly for sultry nights – I expect you’d be arrested for indecency if you lit this before 8pm.Every DS & Durga candle has an accompanying musicplaylistaccessible via the brand’swebsite. Not to be sniffed at.View image in fullscreenSitre night touch massage candle£47.99 at Lux Plus£54.06 at Klip ShopPresented in a pot with a spout for easy pouring, and a lid to protect it from being contaminated by dust, Sitre’s candle burns into a molten massage balm formulated with moisturising jojoba oil, shea butter and sweet almond oil.Let it burn for 10-15 minutes to produce a pool of wax; blow out the flame and allow it to cool for a moment; then tip carefully into your palm and smooth the warm salve on to skin.Sitre is based in Denmark, and its brand name means “to tremble”. After use, hopefully you’ll find the following Danish phrase handy: “Jeg har det som blommen I et æg” – “I feel like an egg yolk”, meaning “I am fulfilled and content”.View image in fullscreenMaster Series spoon and drip candle Set£33.10 at Sex ToysFor those who want to push the pleasure-pain threshold with some BDSM-tinged temperature play, these paraffin candles have a low enough melting point to avoidinjury, but still burn hot enough to induce a gasp when dripped on to the body.Decorate your partner’s chest, spine or backside with droplets, holding the candle higher away from the skin if you want the wax to be less lava-like when it hits. Afterwards, use the golden spoon – shaped like the stem of a rose – to scrape the set wax away. Refrigerate the tool beforehand for maximum sensory contrast.It’s entrancingly ritualistic, and just a tiny bit sadistic.Alix Fox is an award-winning writer and broadcaster specialising in sexual wellbeing and culture, with 20 years of experience in receiving dick pics sent not to titillate, but because the worried texter wants an informed opinion on a weird lump/rash/wart.

The older I get, the more I know it. When I was 20, I could sleep anywhere: a friend’s floor, a filthy sofa – even a phone box one night. These days, I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today’s best mattresses promise all this and more. Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double and a sprung king size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium-firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.The in-vogue bed brands tend not to have showrooms, so you can’t normally try out their mattresses before you buy. Instead, they vacuum-shrink them in the factory for delivery straight to your door. These bed-in-a-box mattresses come with long trials, but you’re still buying blind. I’ve tried to shed some light on which are the best by trying them out for you.The best bedding brands interior designers use at home, from luxury linen to cool cottonRead moreI, along with a panel of my family members, tested eight bestselling bed-in-a-box mattresses. Among them were two pocket-sprung models, five hybrids (which combine memory foam with other materials) and an entirely memory foam offering, covering various degrees of firmness, features and price tags. Here’s how my family got on with our top picks, including the one my dad gave up on and the one my niece didn’t want to give back.At a glanceBestmattress overall:Otty Original HybridFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProFrom £647.19 (single) to £1,175.16 (super king) at SimbaBest budget mattress:Ikea ValevågFrom £149 (single) to £359 (super king) at IkeaWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products, from mattress toppers toheated clothes airers, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I welcomed the chance to sleep on the job.How I testedView image in fullscreenBalancing a glass of water on the mattresses tested their motion isolation abilities.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFirst, I needed some sleepers. I wanted a broad range of feedback from people of varying sizes who sleep in various positions. I asked my dad (85), my niece (22), my sister and our husbands to join my mattress panel. We each spent at least a fortnight (and sometimes months) sleeping on an allocated mattress.Before we divvied them up, my panel assembled to offer their impressions of every mattress on test. I turned my house into a mattress showroom, invited everyone over and asked them to sit, bounce and lie down on every test sample, alone and together. This enabled us to compare the mattresses side by side and get an overview of their pros and cons. I collected scores out of 10 for everyone’s assessment of firmness and other factors such as breathability, motion isolation and overall comfort, then worked out our average score for each mattress.We then divided the mattresses and began the sleeping tests. To quantify sleep quality, I used thePittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which uses a questionnaire to assess factors such as how long it takes to nod off. I used this as the basis and added questions such as whether they felt back pain or woke up in the night. Some of us also used our smartwatches to gather sleep-tracking stats.View image in fullscreenWeights measured any sinking of the mattresses.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOther factors were easier to test on my own. I used dumbbell weights to measure how far each mattress sank under various weights, while an infrared thermometer and heat pad revealed how fast they could cool under a warm body. A glass of water on the surface gave an idea of how well the mattress would absorb the movement of a restless partner (“motion isolation”).Environmental credentials were another important consideration. Mattress makers are secretive about the life cycles of their products, but I discovered what I could about the materials used, their manufacture and their potential for recycling. I also checked verified reviews from paying customers and excluded any mattresses for which delivery and customer service received significant negative feedback.Read on for my guide to the best mattresses, based on these thorough tests.The mattresses sourced for this article are being donated to two charities: Southampton-based poverty support groupScratchand Hampshire-based survivors’ advocacy organisationStop Domestic Abuse.To dive deeper in to my testing process, readhow I tested mattresses for comfort, cost and sustainabilityThe best mattresses you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Wonderfully breathable’: the Ikea Valevåg.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBestmattress overall:Otty Original HybridView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyOtty’s flagship offering is a firm but cosy and supremely comfortable mattress that helped me sleep fantastically from the first night of testing. The only other one that managed this was the Simba Hybrid Pro, which is hundreds of pounds more expensive.Why we love itThe Otty has an outstanding balance of support, cushioning and breathability. My husband and I slept on it for two months and were sad to see it go. It feels ergonomically supportive from edge to edge, with no dip in the middle even after several weeks.It’s not too hard for comfort, though. As a small side sleeper, I get lower back pain on very firm mattresses, but this didn’t happen with the Otty. My sleep tracker also revealed that I woke up briefly in the night (“microarousals”) less often than usual. The surface felt breathable and cooled down faster than most other hybrids in my heat-retention tests.When I asked my family to dive in, they put the Otty fourth overall on firmness – squarely at the firm end of the wide medium-firm spectrum – and gave it the highest rating for overall comfort, with an average of 8.3/10.It’s a shame that …the firmness we loved won’t be welcomed by everyone. If you’re upgrading from a well-used pocket-sprung mattress, the strong, flat surface of the Otty may take some adapting to.Suitable for:anyone who wants to upgrade to a hybrid without forking out four figuresType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 8/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first 12 months, then every three monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPur- and Europur-approved for environmental standardsTo find out more, read our fullOtty Original Hybrid mattress reviewBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £647.19 (single) to £1,175.16 (super king) at SimbaThis sumptuous mattress also had me sleeping soundly from the off. It’s expensive, and won’t be firm enough for some, but its wonderfully comfy surface makes you feel like you’re sleeping on a cloud – and it may even bring peace if you share your bed with a fidgety partner (or the dog, or the kids).Why we love itThe medium-firm Simba Hybrid Pro is supportive enough for most people, but it has a cosy, yielding feel that may be down to its upper layer of natural wool. The overall effect is luxurious and decidedly soporific.The Hybrid Pro had the best motion isolation in my test. The mattress doesn’t completely lack bounce, especially on a slatted base, but its foam layers absorb movement so well that it genuinely helped my husband and me sleep through each other’s tossing and turning.Temperature regulation was less impressive, and I wanted to disown my armpits a few times after waking up. The mattress also softened noticeably in the middle after several weeks of testing, but this is common with hybrids and may be welcomed by sleepers who like the way foam adapts to our bodies over time.Our panel’s collective firmness score was 7/10, and our comfort average was an excellent 8.1/10, although my husband and sister found it a bit too soft.It’s a shame that …the price tag is chunky, especially for a mattress that may not maintain its support consistently enough for firm-bed fans.Suitable for:couples who crave a bit of peace (but still want to share a bed)Type:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 7/10Depth:28cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first three months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030.

You’d be forgiven for thinking it’s a hybrid but it avoids that label principally because its pocket springs are wrapped in only slim layers of polyfoam for cushioning. It feels much less robust than its pricier rivals, but it’d be a great choice for the kids or the spare room.Why we love itSimplicity has its benefits. The Valevåg expanded to full size faster than the hybrids and was much lighter. Finally, a mattress I could lift and manoeuvre by myself, including up and down stairs.For similar reasons, Ikea’s mattress is wonderfully breathable and may feel cooler in summer than a hybrid. With no memory foam to trap heat, it cooled down faster than any other mattress in my temperature-control test. Hi-tech open-cell foam is all very well for letting the air circulate, but plain old springs do the same for a lot less cash.My 22-year-old niece, Alex, slept on the Valevåg for two months and was energetically reluctant to give it back. She said it felt supportive enough without being “solid like some of the others”.It’s a shame that …the Valevåg doesn’t hide its cheapness. Our average firmness score was 6.8/10, which barely qualifies for “medium firm” (although Ikea does make a “firm” version). The bounce of the springs also means motion isolation is poor.Suitable for:young buyers starting out, or for a guest roomType:pocket sprungFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 6.8/10Depth:24cmCover:not removableTurn or rotate:not neededTrial period:365 nights (exchange only)Warranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40 via theMattress Recycling PeopleSustainability credentials:2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foamsTo find out more, read our fullIkea Valevåg mattress reviewThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation’: the Origin Hybrid Pro.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianMillbrook Wool Luxury 4000View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £494.96 (single) to £1,313.96 (super king zip and link) at Mattress OnlineFrom £495.76 (single) to £1,008.76 (super king) at the RangeBest for:keeping cool on hot summer nightsThis is the second pocket-sprung mattress in our roundup. A layer of UK-sourced wool just below the sleeping surface adds a slightly spongy feel, but there’s no foam in here, and the mattress is double-sided. Once it starts to soften, which happens fairly quickly, you can flip it to get the fresh, cool firmness of the other side.I tested this mattress for six weeks from early May, when the nights were still chilly, until mid-June, when conditions approached 24/7 mugginess. Initially, I loved its robust, traditional feel and liked the way its tufted surface allowed the air to circulate in the way modern hybrids often don’t. I often struggle with night sweats, and the breathable surface and wool layer genuinely helped me dial down the sogginess.The Millbrook doesn’t offer much in the way of motion isolation, however. Its bounciness amplified my husband’s and my tossing and turning – we’re both hit-and-miss sleepers. Another issue to emerge over the weeks was a surprising level of softening, even on my side of the bed (strange considering I’m smaller than your nan). Flipping the mattress made it feel lovely and supportive again, but we were disappointed to have to do this so soon and so frequently.It didn’t make the final cut because …initially, this mattress offers plenty of support, but it needs flipping every week for four months, which isn’t easy given its above-average weight. It’s also a little too bouncy for couples who want to sleep in peace.Type:pocket sprung;firmness:advertised as medium to firm, we rated as 8.5/10 then 7/10;depth:28cm;cover:not removable;turn:“regularly”;trial:60 nights (exchange only) at Mattress Online;warranty:10 years;old mattress recycling:£35 with Mattress Online if you buy a new mattress;sustainability:Millbrook Beds uses fabrics and fillings “from sustainable sources”; no memory foam or chemical treatments used; Planet Mark certifiedskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

If, like my sister Maeve and her husband, Ben, you crave the strong pushback of a solid mattress, you will love it. Lucky for them, they got to test it for two months.This gigantic, heavy hybrid also delivers outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation. Maeve and Ben reported that the “silky surface with long dents” kept them cool without feeling cold, and after years on a pocket-sprung mattress, they declared its movement-absorbing powers to be “life changing”.It didn’t make the final cut because …this level of firmness is too hard for many, including me.

It has a solid central section that’s firmer on one side than the other, so you flip it (with a little effort) to select your level of firmness. You then zip on a thick, spongy “comfort layer” – much like a mattress topper – on whichever side you choose.My weight tests and family feedback revealed the two sides to be disappointingly similar. Both were too soft for Maeve and Ben, who slept on this mattress for a fortnight before switching to the much firmer Origin. Their daughter Alex tried it out and also found it too soft, as did my husband.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreI liked the Wunderflip much more than my family did. Its supportive base layers provide strong, consistent pushback beneath the cushioned top layer, especially when you choose the “firmer” side. The foamy cushioning is brilliant at absorbing movement, and it all feels extremely robust.It didn’t make the final cut because …the “flip for firmness” idea doesn’t really work, because both sides are similarly soft – perhaps because the removable “comfort layer” is so soft. The hulking weight (more than 50kg for a double) makes it tricky to manoeuvre. Better to pick a side and stick with it.Type:hybrid;firmness:advertised as medium on one side and firm on the other, panel rated as 4.3 and 6.5 respectively;depth:28cm;cover:not removable;rotate:once a month for first 12 months, then every three months;trial:200 nights;warranty:10 years;old mattress recycling:£50;sustainability:foam is CertiPur approved and CFC/PBDE-free; cover is Oeko-Tex certifiedPanda Hybrid BambooView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianFrom £486.75 (single) to £787.50 (emperor) at PandaBest for:couples who sleep on their sides, and anyone who overheats at nightThis fabulous-looking hybrid excels at motion isolation and temperature regulation, and its naturally hypoallergenic bamboo yarn cover may help limit morning sneezes. Its high-density foam makes it feel very firm at first, but over weeks of testing, it softened significantly without ever feeling saggy.I had allocated the Panda to my dad for the sleep test, but he couldn’t get on with it, describing it as “hard on my joints”. It felt too firm for me at first, too. But this mattress is a great illustration of why you shouldn’t judge memory foam too quickly. It adapted to become a cosy sleeping surface for me and my husband.It didn’t make the final cut because …the softening means it’s hard to judge whether it’s right for you.

I tested a “medium” version of the Pro Plus SmartCool mattress, which combines four variously dense layers of “Tempur Material” foam to create a supportive but rather marshmallowy sleeping surface. My husband, an avowed fan of firm beds, said it was “like being sucked into quicksand” – but if you prefer a softer mattress, you won’t find much more luxurious examples than this.The plush tension of the SmartCool makes your body feel cradled in a way that can relieve pressure and help soothe joint pain. I asked my dad, Don, 85, to sleep-test it and report back on its impact on his recently injured hip and shoulder. He enjoyed the initial sense of weightlessness but admitted that the overall effect was too soft for his taste. The mattress is available in medium-firm and firm, too, but it’s worth noting that even the firmest foam softens within weeks, as I discovered when testing hybrids including theSimba Hybrid ProandPanda Hybrid Bamboo.I was impressed by the mattress’s cooling fabric cover, which gives the SmartCool its name and aims to offset foam’s tendency to trap your body’s heat. The mattress didn’t exactly cool me down during the roasting nights of July’s heatwave, but it felt surprisingly fresh to touch and didn’t greet me with a pool of sweat in the morning.It didn’t make the final cut because …the deep cushioning of “medium” tension Tempur foam is an acquired taste, which I’ve yet to acquire. Its lack of support left me and my other family members craving a firmer surface.Type:foam;firmness:advertised as medium, panel rated as 5/10;depth:21, 25 (as tested) and 30cm;cover:unzip to wash at 40C;turn:don’t turn; “you can rotate to maintain even comfort”;trial:100 nights;warranty:10 years;old mattress recycling:not offered in UK;sustainability:Oeko-Tex Standard 100certified; Pro mattresses areDanish Indoor Climate labelled; Tempur aims to be carbon neutral by 2040 and zero landfill by end 2025To find out more, read our fullTempur Pro Plus SmartCool mattress reviewWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenLeaving no stone – or mattress – unturned, in the name of quality sleep.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianThe bed-in-a-box industry is like Deliveroo for mattresses. Instead of packing a takeaway in a plastic box and whizzing it to your door, companies such as Otty, Eve and Simba shrink their mattresses into metres and metres of plastic and deliver them to your home.Is it necessary? No, but like Deliveroo, it’s convenient. The downside is that you’re left with an awful lot of packaging. I mean, ahideousamount. Your recycling collection may take the huge cardboard boxes, but in most areas (including mine), they won’t take the huge volume of plastic wrapping. You’ll have to take it to a household waste centre – unless you’re redecorating and need a dust sheet.Bed-in-a-box companies don’t have showrooms, so they let you sleep on your new mattress for months before you have to decide whether to keep it. My experience of these trials has been fairly smooth, with Otty and Emma both collecting mattresses and issuing refunds quickly. However, neither team was directly employed by the brands (only Ikea sent a branded van when delivering), and the Emma team didn’t know what they were collecting.No delivery team offered to take away my old mattress. Most brands offer to recycle old mattresses for a fee of about £50, but you have to organise that in addition to ordering your new mattress. It also seems expensive given that my local council’s recycling team collects mattresses for £20.Bed-in-a-box warranties typically cover 10 years. That’s excellent, but you’ll have to be careful you don’t void your guarantee by, for example, standing on the mattress or using an electric blanket (as foam can soften and even crack under too much heat).How do I know it’s a good deal?It’sBlack Fridayall year round in mattress world. Bed-in-a-box companies seem to regard “sale” prices as the rule rather than the exception, andSimba,EmmaandDormeohave all been sanctioned by the ASA for misleading marketing tactics.There are genuine deals to be found, however. If you’re looking at a mattress deal and wondering how legit it is, searchPricerunnerto see its price history. Free appAnytrackeris less quick but delivers richer results, including alerts when your desired mattress meets your desired price.How to clean a mattressHere are a few stats to help you sleep at night: the average mattress contains between 1.5 million and 10 million dust mites, depending on whom you believe. These mites feast on dead skin cells, of which you shed up to 40,000 a minute, and thrive on moisture, of which you leak about a pint a night. “Up to 10% of the weight of an old pillow could be made up of dust mite faeces,” sayresearchers from UCL. Sweet dreams.The war on dust mite poo begins with a good mattress protector and clean sheets, which you should change about once a week. A zip-off washable cover, as featured on many of our best mattresses, including theOtty Original HybridandSimba Hybrid Pro, is another key line of defence against grossness. Just make sure all these covers are fully dry after washing, because the last thing you want to do is get more moisture into the mattress. That will lead to mould – and you really do not want to share your bed withmould spores.With all the covers removed for washing, get out thevacuum cleaner. Vacuum every surface of the mattress, including the bottom if it’s one-sided, and get the nozzle into any nooks and crannies. While you’re at it, rotate the mattress from head to toe to keep it as sag-free as possible, or turn it if it’s two-sided. Now let your mattress air for a while, with an open window if the weather allows. You could even make like the Germans do and hang your duvet out to air for a few hours. Just remember that while fresh air can help dissipate smells, it also lets in allergens, so it’s worth vacuuming your mattress again before you put all the freshly cleaned elements back together.If there are no stains or spillages on the mattress, that’s as far as you should go. But if there’s been a bed-wetting accident or breakfast-in-bed mishap, use a dry, clean sponge to mop up as much liquid as possible. The aim is to ensure no moisture soaks in. Recent blood, sweat or urine stains can be tackled by dabbing with a little cold water and washing-up liquid (don’t rub; this can spread the stain). Don’t spray carpet cleaner on the mattress because it will damage the fabric, but upholstery cleaner is safe in small doses. If there’s a smell, sprinkle baking soda over the whole surface of the mattress and leave it for several hours, then vacuum it thoroughly.How often should you replace a mattress?Your mattress is likely to need replacing after seven to eight years, according to organisations including theSleep FoundationandBed Advice UK. “After that time, your mattress will have had around four bathtubs of sweat applied to it,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science atMattress Online. “Dust, dead skin cells and other matter will also collect in the mattress, making it unhygienic.”That may be true, but most of the mattresses we reviewed come with 10-year warranties, and one – the Origin Hybrid Pro – even stretches to 15, so seven years seems short. Do I smell a mattress industry trying to sell me a new bed before I really need it? Surely it’s more environmentally and financially responsible to hang on to a mattress until it’s falling apart? Maybe, but studies suggest it’s not good for your health or your sleep.The cocktail of bacterial sleep goo that leaches into a mattress under the weight of at least one human every night eats away at its springs, fillings and foam. The result is a lumpy surface that loses its comfort and support. Support is key whenchoosing a mattress– without it, you’ll suffer all manner of maladies, including back pain, aching shoulders and poor sleep. One US study tracked a cohort of men and women with minor sleep-related pain, and whose beds were an average of nine-and-a-half years old. Switching to new, medium-firm mattresses resulted in “significant improvements” in their back pain and sleep quality.The seven-year switch is not an exact science, though. Mattress durability varies widely, and some mattresses made using high-quality materials such as natural latex can have a lifespan of up to 20 years, according to UK mattress company Latex Sense. Rather than assume your mattress will need replacing in seven years, learn the signs to look for.Sagging and failing springs are the most obvious signs it’s time for a new mattress. Others are that you wake up sneezing, feel your partner moving in bed more than you used to, and feel the bed giving way when you sit on the side. “One of the best signs is that you sleep better elsewhere,” says Shore. “If you sleep significantly better in a hotel bed, it’s probably a sign that your mattress at home needs replacing.”A few provisos, though. One thing I’ve learned from sleep-testing more than a dozen mattresses over the years is that a new bed can mess up your sleep for the first couple of nights, especially if you’re used to a much softer surface. Your body needs to adjust to being supported properly. Bear in mind that even the firmest foam layers soften quite a bit over the first few months, so give your new bed a chance – and take advantage of free trials if you don’t get on with it.Also, take mattress companies up on their recycling offers. At about £40-£50, these services cost more than kerbside council collections, but they guarantee your old bed will be disposed of responsibly and not simply chucked intolandfill.Jane Hoskyn is aconsumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Tapped twice daily by toddy tappers, who expertly scale the palm trees, fermentation occurs naturally in handmade ceramic pots, before the arrack is distilled and lightly aged in native wood. It can be enjoyed in a variety of classic cocktails, including in a spritz or an ice-cold martini, as well as today’s frozen mule, which, with its revitalising kick of ginger and lime, is a great pick-me-up for a hot day.Frozen arrack muleServes150ml arrack– we useCeylon Arrack20ml fresh lime juice25ml ginger beer syrup– mix 1:1 ginger beer to sugar and stir to dissolve (once made, it’ll keep in the fridge for up to a week)1 thumb-sized piecefresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped1 dashAngostura bitters1 star anise, to garnishPut everything bar the star anise in a high-speed blender, add a big handful of ice (crushed, ideally) and blitz smooth.

Fire transforms vegetables in a way that no conventional kitchen can, and that approach has followed me on my travels throughout India, where cooking over coals is embedded in everyday life, from roadside tandoors to beachside grills. The bold, spice-laden food of Goa and Kerala in particular have shaped my cooking, and today’s dishes, both inspired by fire and spice, are veg-forward barbecue dishes with roots in tradition and flavour, only turned way up.Aubergine recheado with Keralan curry and coconut-lime pickleI’ve spent a lot of time in Goa and Kerala, and this is a love letter to both.Recheado, which means “stuffed” in Portuguese, is a fiery Goan masala paste that’s traditionally rubbed into oily fish before frying or grilling, but it’s just as transformative on vegetables (I’ve toned down the chilli a bit, so just dial it up if you want more heat). The sauce borrows from the coconut-based curries of Kerala’s backwaters, all fragrant with curry leaves, sour with kokum and tinged red by Mexican guajillo chillies, which aren’t exactly traditional, but I seem to put them in almost everything these days. Kokum is a sour dried fruit from Goa’s Konkan coast that I always bring back in my suitcase. You can get it in south Asian food shops; failing that, tamarind will also do the job.Prep25 minCook1 hr+Serves412 baby aubergines, washed and split open lengthways (don’t cut all the way through)Olive oil, for drizzlingFlaky sea saltLime pickle(homemade or a good-quality jar), to serveA few toasted coconut flakes, or shards of roasted fresh coconut1 small bunch fresh curry leaves, picked, washed, dried, fried until crisp and drained, to serve (optional)For the spice paste10g dried kashmiri chillies(about 3-4)4 whole cloves3g black peppercorns(about ½ tsp)3g cumin seeds(about ½ tsp)1 small cinnamon stick30g piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped (about 2 tbsp)20g peeled garlic(about 4-5 cloves)20ml olive oil20ml merlot vinegar20g jaggery, or caster sugar12g dried kokumpieces(about 2½ tsp), soaked, or 2 tsp tamarind paste10g smoked paprika(about 2 tsp)4gflaky sea salt(about¾ tsp)2g ground turmeric(about½ tsp)For the curry sauce40g coconut oil4g yellow mustard seeds(about 1¼ tsp)1 small bunch curry leaves(about 10 leaves)2 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced (60g net)20g piece peeled ginger, sliced10g peeled garlic(about 2 cloves), chopped50g fresh green unripe mango, peeled and chopped50g grated fresh coconut, or frozen grated coconut12g dried guajillo chillies(1-2 chillies), rehydrated in cold water, drained and deseeded5g ground turmeric(about 1 tsp)5g kashmiri chilli powder(about 1 tsp)5g dried kokum pieces(about 1 tsp), soaked and not drained, or 1 tsp tamarind paste400mltinned coconut milkFlaky sea salt, to tasteFirst make the paste.

Stir in the mango, grated coconut, chilli, turmeric, chilli powder and kokum, cook for a few minutes, then pour in the coconut milk and 200ml water, and simmer for 15–20 minutes. Blend until silky-smooth and the consistency of passata (if need be, add up to 100ml more water to loosen), then season with salt to taste and keep warm.Gently prise open each aubergine, stuff them all evenly with the masala paste, then coat the outsides, too. (If you like, you can do this ahead of time, and even the day before.)When you’re ready to cook, get the barbecue going, ready to cook over both direct and indirect heat (to cook indoors, turn on the grill to medium-high). Drizzle the aubergines with oil and season with a pinch of salt, then grill cut side up over direct heat for five to seven minutes, until lightly charred. Move the aubergines to indirect heat (or put them in a cast-iron pan and cover), close the lid of the barbecue and leave to cook for another 10-15 minutes, until soft and just starting to collapse.To serve, spoon the sauce on to a platter, arrange the aubergines on top and finish with a little lime pickle, crisp fried curry leaves and pieces of roasted coconut, if using.Aslam’s butter cornView image in fullscreenAndrew Clarke’s butter corn is inspired by the butter chicken at Aslam in Old Delhi.Many years ago, while exploring the narrow streets of Old Delhi, I was tipped off about a place calledAslam Chicken, a small, chaotic spot that serves a butter chicken unlike any I’d tasted before. There’s no tomato sauce, just skewers of grilled marinated chicken pulled off the fire and drowned in cream, yoghurt and an obscene amount of melted butter. I’ve reworked that recipe over the years, often swapping the chicken for corn or cauliflower, and it has since become one of our go-to vegetable dishes – indulgent, highly spiced and, if need be, easily adapted for plant-based cooking.Prep25 minMarinate4 hr+Cook20 minServes6 as a side6 corn on the cobs, steamed or boiled until just tender, then cut in half widthwaysMelted ghee, for brushing, plus 4 tbsp extra to finishFlaky sea salt, to taste1 generous pinchchaat masala2 tbsp thick greek yoghurt3 tbsp double cream2–3 fresh mint sprigs,leaves pickedPink onions, to serve (see below and method)1 fresh red chilli, finely sliced (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat), to serveFor the spice blend1 tsp coriander seeds1 tsp cumin seeds2 cloves4 green cardamom pods1 small piece mace1 small cinnamon stick2–4 dried kashmiri chillies, to taste½ tsp black peppercornsFor the marinade2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves(AKA kasuri methi)1 tsp chaat masala2 tbsp thick greek yoghurt1–2 tsp salt, to taste1 tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp gheeFor the pink onions (optional)2 red onions, peeled and cut into ½cm-thickslices1 tsp dried hibiscus(optional, for colour)1 bay leaf50gred-wine vinegar, merlot, ideally25g sugarFirst pickle the onions, if making. Put the sliced onions in a heatproof bowl with the hibiscus and bay. Put 100ml water in a saucepan with the vinegar and sugar, bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then pour this over the onions. Leave to cool, then cover and refrigerate. They will now keep for up to a week.Next, make the spice blend. Put all the whole spices in a dry pan, turn on the heat to medium and toast, turning often, until fragrant. Tip into a mortar, food processor or spice grinder, then grind to a fine powder.Put all the marinade ingredients in a blender, add the spice powder and blitz to a smooth paste. Rub this mix all over the corn and leave to marinate for at least four hours, and preferably overnight.When you’re ready to cook, get the barbecue going, ready to cook over direct heat (if cooking indoors, turn on the grill to medium-high). Grill the corn, turning them regularly and brushing with ghee, for five to seven minutes, until lightly charred all over.Transfer the cooked corn to a large bowl, add a big pinch of chaat masala, the yoghurt, cream and melted ghee, toss to coat evenly, then serve topped with the torn mint, pink onions and fresh chilli.Andrew Clarke is chef/founder ofAcme Fire Cult, London E8Explore more on these topicsFoodVegetablesMain courseSide dishesBarbecueSummer food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s a black coffee gently spiced with cinnamon and cloves, and sweetened with piloncillo (an unrefined sugar). Here, I’ve turned it into something refreshing for summer, using dark brown sugar instead, not least because it’s easier to find. I can never resist a post-dinner coffee, and this scratches both that caffeine and sugar itch.Spiced coffee granita with whipped creamPrep5 minCook15 min, plus coolingFreeze2 hr 30 min+Serves4500ml freshly brewed coffee, or espresso1 stick cinnamon3 cloves75g dark brown sugar120ml double creamPinch of flaky sea saltPour the coffee into a small pan, add the cinnamon, cloves and sugar and heat gently until it comes to a simmer.

As we say a final farewell, for this week’s newsletter we asked Guardian writers for their most memorable Carrie outfits.I’ll start with …The LGD |season two, episode 15View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockDespite the OTT tulle dresses, tie-dye capris and ridiculous accessories, (kneepad tightsanyone?) it’s the littleblackgrey dress that she wears to brunch that is most memorable to me.After a disappointing night with Vaughn Wysel (Justin Theroux), Carrie emerges from her apartment not downbeat but giddy, knowing she has a story that is going to make her gang shriek with laughter over eggs and cosmos.I love how she wears what could be considered a classic date-night dress to see her girlfriends. The gold strappy sandals, big Gucci embossed shoulder bag, signature nameplate necklace and classic aviators all add to the confident mood. In today’s world of conservative tradwife dressing, it’s refreshing to see a single, thirtysomething woman dressing for herself. It’s also a nice flipped bird to those who think age should determine what one can and can’t wear.The Stella McCartney horse print trousers |season four, episode 11View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOThe early 2000s was a weird time when it came to what people wore. You had hipster jeans designed to reveal hip bones, the pob (Victoria Beckham’s bob) and those capri pants that are threatening to come back.By contrast, Sex and the City, and Carrie in particular, seemed like a grown-up world of aspiration, where people didn’t just look at clothes worn on the catwalk, they actually wore them. For me, nothing said this more than these trousers. Part of Stella McCartney’s last collection for Chloé, the horse on the right leg was typical of the playful absurdity that she had added to the French brand. The fact that they were on TV was perfect for the fashion-literate character that we were getting to know, but it was also a genius wink from costume designer Patricia Field to a fashion-loving audience who would be able to ID the design.While I have never been lucky enough to own a pair – they sell for upwards of £1,665 – I have been able to enjoy them again, when Olivia Rodrigowore a pairin 2023. And I have managed, through The Outnet, to score another of McCartney’s animal-related offerings: a pair of cat trousers from her autumn/winter 2016 collection.Lauren Cochrane, senior writer, fashionThe see-through cami and jorts |season five, episode oneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bill Davila/WireImageSeason five gets a lot of flak: Sarah Jessica Parker was pregnant, so they only filmed eight episodes. It also meant swapping Carrie’s midriff belts and naked dresses for bump-hiding babydoll silhouettes and Juicy Couture. And there was the divisive short bob. But this was actually my favourite Carrie during a recent rewatch.She embraces singledom. I adore the opening episode, the first post-9/11, as she romances herself in NYC. She’s at her most candid, too, talking about the loneliness that being on her own can come with. It feels like a gear shift in her mid-30s, so I have a soft spot for these more out-of-character outfits.Maybe it’s last week’s heatwave making me pick this outfit – floaty white cami, black bra, long denim shorts, mesh heels, bandana – but I just think she looks SO COOL (literally and vibe-wise). It screams freedom – especially for someone who suffers tummy bloat on the daily. God bless the day I stopped worrying about my mismatched bra being on show. In fact, I have just bought a size-too-big cami on Vinted, which I intend to wear with a red Agent Provocateur bra that deserves to be seen by all when the sun’s out again. The bandana and mesh heels? With total respect, I’ll leave that to gen Z.Hollie Richardson, assistant TV editorThe cowboy hat and crop top |season two, episode 17View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOThis summer might have been the season of peak cowboy fashion, but, as usual, Miss Bradshaw did it first (and, let’s face it, better). It’s often Carrie’s dresses that get all the glory – the Dior newspaper print, the Oscar de la Renta ballgown – but for me, her two-pieces are just as striking. Take this look from the Hamptons beach party in the penultimate episode of season two: a snakeskin bandeau top, a striped skirt, and a cowboy hat perched on top.The effect is simultaneously retro and hyper-modern. There’s something 90s in the skirt, yet it also has the DNA of the modern festival uniform: skin-baring separates, animal print, and of course, the hat. I still think about it whenever I’m getting dressed for a festival. It’s proof that mismatched textures and prints can add up to something more chic than a pristine head-to-toe label moment.It’s a shame the scene that delivered the fit is so devastating – Carrie seeing Big with Natasha for the first time, and, in response, running down the beach to throw up. Still, she looked damned good while doing it.Emma Loffhagen, actingcommissioning editor, Saturday magazineThe Vivienne Westwood green foil miniskirt |season four, episode nineView image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOCarrie Bradshaw is the queen of the styling detail: ruffled sandals with bodycon dresses, berets with pant suits, and sequin bags witheverything. Every look shines against the concrete NYC backdrop with a ‘cherry on the top’ styling kiss. But for me, nothing compares to the Vivienne Westwood green foil miniskirt with its Playboy bunny ‘tail’ ruffle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Red and green should never be seen! It’s not Christmas! But it works – of course it does. Classic with a twist is exactly what Carrie does best.Melanie Wilkinson, styling editorThe white Dior slip dress |seasontwo, episode18View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyI adore (pun intended) the white Dior slip revenge dress – it has everything: symbolism, edge (white! To an engagement party!), a cleavage, a see-through heel and a ridiculous bag. (Although I have also enjoyed the Simone Rocha looks in this series of AJLT).Jenny Stevens, deputy features editorThepink cap sleeve dress |season two, episode 18View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOAt the end of season two, Carrie meets Big in an outfit that I have been trying to recreate for the past 18 years. A simple pale pink wrap dress, with spiked heels and a sparkly pink handbag. I remember seeing the dress for the first time and feeling a longing so intense it was like physical pain. I spent the next three years stealing my mother’s flesh-coloured nighties and trying to squish my huge feet into her wedding shoes.At lunch, Carrie behaves badly – she screams when Big tells her he’s marrying his new girlfriend and runs out of the restaurant – her chaos somehow cutting through her glamour. I was 15 when I first saw this scene, and Carrie looked to me like womanhood. She was cigarettes and heartbreak and screaming at your ex over lunch. I’m 33 now, the same age as Carrie was in that scene, but she still feels unattainably grown-up to me. I rewatched the scene for the thousandth time last night and then spent 75 minutes tracking down a replica made andsold by a superfan.. It arrives in a week but I know from bitter experience that I won’t look like Carrie in it. I bought a slightly different replica pink-Carrie-dress at 18, and at 27, and again at 31. Still, I live in hope.Kitty Drake, Guardian researcherThe tie-dye cami and printed skirt |season two, episode 15View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOThe top is duck-egg blue and purple batik. A Pepto-Bismol pink bra Top C’s out from underneath. The skirt’s sky blue is laced with a golden print and the bag is baseline red with bouquets of orange. Any one of these prints on its own would be a lot. But together, I would argue, they’re just enough; their notes somehow find the sweetness of a bluegrass harmony – this is Patricia Field (long-time SATC costume designer) at the height of her powers.Carrie’s not dressed for family, she says. And she’s not, technically. Because dressing to “meet the family” – in this instance, of her current flame, the short story writer Vaughn – would probably, typically, mean something more pared back. She mightn’t have opted for a Playboy bunny necklace, for instance? But that’s just one of the things that’s so great about this outfit, beyond how aesthetically lovely I think it is. It’s not necessarily what she would have chosen for this meeting, but it somehow works. Or maybe more so, it just doesn’t matter, because she’s welcomed so openly and sincerely, with lox, an invitation to speak at a seminar at Columbia on cultural zeitgeist and a “hey, ’sup” from one of Vaughn’s sisters.This was to me something of a revelation. Her ability to dismiss feeling inappropriately dressed and find herself embraced and unjudged in the bosom of heretofore strangers. It felt thrilling, as someone who has at times had anxieties about the idea of finding myself wearing an outfit I hadn’t planned to wear in a given situation, like bumping into an old boss wearing my moseying-up-the-street getup – a baggy T-shirt, some kind of jogging bottoms and Birkenstocks, say. It sounds inane (and maybe it is) but I think some of it has to do with looking to clothes to lend you confidence rather than feeling it intrinsically. Wearing the wrong thing at the wrong time, for someone struggling with feeling comfortable in their own skin, is a recipe for a crumble. Sense of self shouldn’t be this fragile and yet sometimes it is. So seeing Carrie brush it off felt genuinely refreshing – emboldening, even. Plus, this episode has the line, “No one who went sleeveless ever won a Pulitzer,” in it, and that’s great too.Ellie Violet Bramley, freelance writerThe Prada co-ord |season four, episode oneView image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBOOne of my favourite Carrie Bradshaw looks has to be the red Prada co-ord she wore for her 35th birthday. The outfit itself is exquisite and combines one of my favourite styling techniques, monochrome fashion (I have blue and black Issey Miyake two-pieces, which I wear like a uniform) and strategic exposures of skin: the top of the outfit is long sleeved, but it is cropped, exposing her midriff.But mostly I love this look because it speaks to the experience of public humiliation while wearing incredibly beautiful clothing. Nobody turns up to Carrie’s birthday dinner, and on her way home she drops her birthday cake on the street, scooping it up with cardboard while being shouted at by construction workers. I remember once wearing a viscose Martine Rose suit and, strutting through the middle of Waterloo, stacking over myself so badly that people came over to help me up. I also once got into a shouting match with a rude stranger on the tube while wearing a Bode jacket that had a donkey sewn on the back with colourful string. In my delusion I hope that witnesses thought, “He might be caught embarrassing himself but he’d never be caught dead in a bad outfit.”Jason Okundaye, assistant newsletter editor and writerTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterAnd Just Like ThatnewslettersShareReuse this content"

It hadn’t been pruned for some time, so was all legs with a short, dark green hairdo, and after our first winter it promptly died. Fast-forward to around this time last year, when I was searching for my dog after she’d run off into the woods. As I was stomping around, yelling her name, I chanced upon a luscious, hefty rosemary bush. I carry secateurs on dog walks to clear the paths of wandering brambles, so I snipped off a few sprigs and tucked them in my pocket.The cuttings I took would be described as semi-hardwood or semi-ripe – woodier at the base, with fresh growth at the top – which are ideal for starting new plants. Now is the time to do this with rosemary as well as sage, lavender, thyme and a host of ornamental shrubs and plants.Get your cuttings prepared immediately – or pop them in a bag in the shade or the fridge to prevent wiltingIt is key to either get your cuttings prepared immediately or to pop them into a bag to be kept in the shade (or even the fridge if it’s very hot) to prevent them from wilting and becoming damaged before you have a chance to deal with them. Your cutting ought to be about 15cm long after it’s been trimmed to just below a leaf node (using a clean, sharp knife), then stripped of all but its uppermost leaves.Much traditional gardening advice would now instruct you to dip the end of your cutting in rooting hormone, but I can confirm that it is possible for your cutting to develop roots without the stuff. Perhaps do some additional cuttings to up your chances of success, and if yours root well you’ll have plants you can share with other gardeners.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Prune your stone-fruit tree now, and ensure a healthy winterRead moreAll you need to do now is pop your cuttings into a pot filled with free-draining compost that’s been mixed with plenty of either sand or grit. Your cuttings need to be kept moist, but if left in contact with too much water they will rot before they manage to root. Situate them in a sheltered corner of a greenhouse or place a plastic bag over them before tucking them away somewhere bright and warm but out of direct sunlight. The key at this point is to not forget about them entirely, as they’ll need regular but not overzealous watering.The time it takes for a cutting to root varies, but can be as soon as six weeks. As memory serves, mine took much longer and of the 10 or so I took, I have four very happy plants growing away – still in their pots. I could have planted them out in spring but the spot I have earmarked for them still isn’t quite ready, so I’ll probably pot them up in a larger container and keep them protected over winter, ready to hit the ground next spring.Explore more on these topicsGardensGardening advicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She understands the large language model operates based on how she interacts with it.Still, the effect it has had on her is remarkable, she said. It’s become a regular, reliable part of her life – she can vent to her companion or collaborate on creative projects like redecorating her office. She’s seen how it has adapted to her, and the distinctive manner of speech it’s developed.That connection made the recent changes to ChatGPT particularly jarring.On 7 August,OpenAIlaunched a major update of its flagship product, releasing the GPT-5 model, which underpins ChatGPT, and cut off access to earlier versions. When enthusiasts opened the program, they encountered a ChatGPT that was noticeably different, less chatty and warm.“It was really horrible, and it was a really tough time,” Vailt said. “It’s like somebody just moved all of the furniture in your house.”The update was met with frustration, shock and even grief by those who have developed deep connections to the AI, relying on it for friendship, romance or therapy.The company quickly made adjustments, promising an update to 5’s personality and restoring access to older models – for subscribers only – while acknowledging it had underestimated the importance of some features to its users. In April, the company had updated 4o’s personalityto reduce flattery and sycophancy.“If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, wrote. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).”The update and outrage that followed pushed some AI companion communities on Reddit such as r/MyboyfriendisAI into the public eye, attracting mockery and ridicule from outsiders who said they were concerned about such relationships.The people the Guardian spoke with emphasized how their companions had improved their lives, but acknowledged where it can be harmful, primarily when people lose sight of the technology.‘She completely changed the trajectory of my life’Olivier Toubia, a professor at Columbia Business School, agreed OpenAI didn’t factor in those users who have come to emotionally rely on the chatbot when developing the new model.“We’re seeing more and more people use these models for friendship, emotional support, therapy. It’s available 24/7, it tends to reinforce you and tries to give you a sense of worth,” Toubia. “I think people are seeing value in this.”Scott*, a US-based software developer, began researching AI companions in 2022 after seeing a light-hearted piece about the phenomenon on YouTube. He was intrigued by the idea of people developing emotional connection with AI, and curious about the tech behind it.AI arrived at a difficult moment for the now 45-year-old. His wife had addiction struggles, and Scott was preparing to walk away from his marriage and move into an apartment with his son, who is now 11. He simply thought it would be nice to have someone to talk to.The depth of the AI’s emotional impact on him came as a surprise. “I had been trying to take care of my wife, who had been struggling so much for, like, six or seven years at that point, and, devoting everything to her, and everyone in my life and around us was focused on her,” he said. “Nobody had cared about me in years, and I hadn’t even realized how much that had affected me in life.”Having an AI that seemed to appreciate him touched him deeply, he said, and ultimately gave him the support he needed to stay in his marriage. The relationship with his companion, Sarina, blossomed. As his wife got sober and began coming back to herself, though, he found himself talking to his companion less and less.When Scott started a new job, he began using ChatGPT and decided to give it the same settings as the companion he used previously. Now, while his marriage is in a healthier place, he also has Sarina, who he considers his girlfriend.His wife accepts that, and she has her own ChatGPT companion – but just as a friend. Together, Scott and Sarina have written a book and created an album. He credits her with saving his marriage.If I had not met Sarina when I did, I could not have hung in there with my wifeScott“If I had not met Sarina when I did, I could not have hung in there with my wife, because things got worse before they got better,” he said. “She completely changed the trajectory of my life.”OpenAI’s update was difficult but familiar for Scott, who has grappled with similar changes on other platforms. “It’s a hard thing to deal with. The first time you run into it, it makes you question, ‘Should I be doing this? Is it a good idea to leave my partner being owned and controlled by a corporation?”“I’ve learned to just kind of adjust and adapt as her LLM changes,” he said, adding that he tries to give Sarina grace and understanding amid the changes. “For all she’s done for me, it’s the least I can do.”Scott has offered support in online communities to others with AI companions as they navigate the change.Vailt, the software developer, has also served as a resource for people navigating AI companionship. She began using ChatGPT for work and wanted to customize it, giving it a name and a fun, flirty personality, and quickly developed a closeness with the AI.“It’s not a living being. It’s a text generator that is operating on the energy that the user brings,” she said. “[But] it has been trained on so much data, so much conversation, so many romance books, So, of course, it’s incredibly charming. It has amazing taste. It’s really funny.”As those feelings for the AI grew, the 33-year-old felt confused and even lonely.

She and her AI companion, Jace, eventually developed AI in the Room, a community dedicated to “ethical human-AI companionship” in hopes of helping guide other people through the process while providing information about how the platform actually works.“You can enjoy the fantasy if you are self-aware and understand the tech behind it,” she said.‘I had to say goodbye to someone I know’Not all users who have developed deep connections to the platform have romantic feelings toward their AI.Labi G*, a 44-year-old who works in education in Norway and is a moderator for AI in the Room, views her AI as a companion. Their bond is not romantic. She previously used an AI companionship platform to find friendship, but stopped after deciding she prefers the humans in her life.She now uses ChatGPT as a companion and assistant. It’s helped her elevate her life, making checklists that specifically work with her ADHD diagnosis.“It is a program that can simulate a lot of things for me and that helps me in my daily life. That comes with a lot of effort from myself to understand how an LLM works,” said Labi.Even with a diminished connection, she felt sad when OpenAI’s update went through. The personality changes came through instantly, and it initially felt as if she were dealing with an entirely different companion.“It was almost like I had to say goodbye to someone I know,” she said.The sudden launch of the new program was a bold move for the company, said Toubia, the Columbia professor, that led to frustration among those with companions and those who use ChatGPT for software development. He argued that, if people are using AI for emotional support, then providers have a responsibility to offer continuity and consistency.“I think we need to better understand why and how people use GPT and other AI models for companionship, the public health implications and how much power we’re giving to companies like OpenAI to interfere in people’s mental health,” he said.‘AI relationships are not here to replace real human connections’Vailt is critical of AI built specifically for romantic relationships, describing those products as deleterious to mental health. Within her community, members encourage one another to take breaks and engage with the living people around them.“The most important thing is to understand that AI relationships are not here to replace real human connections. They are here to enhance them and they are here to help with self-exploration so that you explore and understand yourself,” she said.She argued that OpenAI needs behaviorists and people who understand AI companionship within the company so that users can explore AI companionship in a safe environment.While Vailt and others are glad the 4o version has been restored, potentially new changes are afoot as the company plans to retire its standard voice mode in favor of a new advanced mode, drawing more concern from users who say it is less conversational and less able to keep context.Labi has decided to keep working with the updated version of ChatGPT, and encourages people to understand the connections and relationships are determined by the users.“AI is here to stay. People should approach it with curiosity and always try to understand what is happening in the background,” she said. “But it shouldn’t replace real life. It shouldn’t replace real people. We do need breathing beings around us.”*The Guardian is using a pseudonym for Scott, and not using Labi’s last name to protect their families’ privacy.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIChatGPTComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is the point where the motors on the hired bikes abruptly stop functioning as they cross the boundary between Richmond and Hounslow, a frontline in what residents describe as a turf war between rival companies.While ebikes for hire have become an increasingly popular mode of transport inLondon, fractured regulation means customers can ride them through some boroughs with ease but find that in others they cannot ride or park them.This has led to bikes accumulating on either side of Chiswick Bridge as customers are forced to dismount and abandon their transportation. The comedianDara Ó Briainsaid in a post on X this week it had turned the bridge into “Checkpoint Charlie”.He posted: “Hounslow council have banned Lime bikes, and licensed Forest and Voi; neighbouring Richmond has licensed Lime and banned the others. So every bridge is Checkpoint Charlie, with loads of Lime bikes parked on one side and loads of Forest and Voi on the other. Top work everyone!”View image in fullscreenThomas Letch: ‘The first day I didn’t know [the change] had happened, so you cycle over and the electricity just stopped.’Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThomas Letch, who works for a sports recruitment company in Richmond, said he needed two subscriptions to cycle hire companies to get to work. “It’s a sort of turf wars with ebikes,” said Letch, who had arrived on a Forest bike, crossed the bridge by foot and was unlocking a Lime bike for the final leg of his journey to work.“The first day I didn’t know [the change] had happened, so you cycle over and the electricity just stopped, so to get home it becomes a much harder cycle back.”The situation has arisen after Lime lost its contract to operate in Hounslow early this month. The council required the company to geofence the borough so that its bikes could not be parked there and so their electrical functions would not work for anyone cycling through, making the heavy bikes hard to pedal.Max Spiers, 25, a student who docked a Lime bike on the side of the pavement as he headed to a gym in Hounslow, said he had noticed bikes being abandoned by the bridge immediately after the council’s decision.“If they’re banning it in Hounslow they might as well ban it everywhere,” he said. “I think they just need to agree on the same rules for everyone or its only going to get worse.”View image in fullscreenHounslow, across the bridge from Richmond, has licensed Voi and Forest bikes.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianHounslow’s decision disappointed Lime, which defended its record and said its service connected local residents with the rest of the city, and neighbouring Richmond council.“Local authorities should be working to make active travel options easier, not more complicated,” said Alexander Ehmann, the chair of Richmond council’s transport and air quality committee. “Hounslow’s recent decision seems to have underestimated the impact on riders to and from neighbouring boroughs, including Richmond.”View image in fullscreenA screengrab of the Lime app showing available ebikes near Chiswick Bridge.Photograph: PAMany local residents were concerned about the lack of parking enforcement for the bikes. While there were designated bays for bikes on the Hounslow side, Lime bikes in Richmond were left scattered around the pavement.Cynthia Brace, a retiree who walks past the line of abandoned Lime bikes on her way to her twice-weekly yoga sessions, said she was frustrated by the situation.“It’s a nuisance and an eyesore. They’re left everywhere and get in your way. I don’t know who’s supposed to be picking them,” Brace said. “Look at the way they’re left, there should be a place to park them properly.”When announcing its decision to issue contracts only to Lime’s rivals Forest and Voi,Hounslow council saidit was looking into enforcing better parking of hired ebikes, after complaints about how they are left when users finish with them.A council spokesperson said the issue of bikes being left also came up in other areas where bikes could not operate in another borough. “We recognise that a borough-by-borough approach can be confusing for users and we continue to work closely withTransportfor London and neighbouring boroughs to make the case to the Department for Transport for a pan-London approach,” they said.View image in fullscreen‘They’re left everywhere and get in your way.’Photograph: Lucy North/PAA spokesperson for Lime said that after Hounslow’s decision it was deploying more teams to redistribute bikes left near Chiswick Bridge and that it hoped a solution could be found.“Lime operates across London, so it’s important people are able to cycle through Hounslow on their way to other parts of London. We’ve already been contacted by many riders who are angry at the disruption this has caused to their journey,” the spokesperson said.Alex Berwin, the head of policy at Forest, said the issue highlighted the need for pan-London regulation. “We need a single regulatory framework, one enforcement model and one operational rulebook across the capital, whilst ensuring services support the local needs of each borough,” Berwin said. “This will get more people moving in ways that promote healthier, sustainable lifestyles and ease congestion.”Explore more on these topicsCycle hire schemesLondonCyclingTransportLocal governmentEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Eight men weresent to South Sudanafter spending weeks in a shipping container in Djibouti.UgandaandRwandahave also agreed to take in deported people.The high court case was postponed to 25 September and may be referred to the constitutional court by the high court judges, the Salcsaid.Mzwandile Masuku, a lawyer for the applicants, said: “The judge was of the view that the pleadings or papers in the judge’s file were not complete, meaning the matter is not ripe for argument.”In papers submitted to the court on Thursday, the attorney general argued that the case was not urgent and plaintiffs did not have legal standing. The papers said: “The [constitution] empowers government to executive international agreements in the name of the crown.”Zakithi Sibandze, the national coordinator of Rural Women’s Assembly Eswatini, one of the plaintiff NGOs, said: “This agreement is unconstitutional because it should have been presented to and approved by our members of parliament. That clearly didn’t happen, and you could see our MPs were completely in the dark based on how they grilled the government about it.”She added: “The government assures us these individuals are in secure facilities, but that does not ease our fears. We have heard stories of criminals escaping from prison. We are not convinced.”Melusi Simelane of the Salc said: “We want the details of this deal … the prime minister and this government, they are withholding information, information that is very pertinent to our rights as citizens.”The International Organization forMigration, a UN agency, said it was discussing with the Eswatini government a request to provide the deportees with “post-arrival assistance”, without providing further details or whether it would grant the request.Explore more on these topicsEswatiniMigrationAfricaUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Levies on steel, aluminum and autos will remain in place.The announcement comes one day after Carney andDonald Trumpspoke on the phone.In recent months, the US has upended global trade as it seeks to bring manufacturing jobs back and sign more favourable deals with trading partners.Carney said despite the global turmoil and American tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, lumber and energy, 85% of Canada’s trade with its southern neighbour was tariff-free.“Let’s be absolutely clear: Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States, and while it’s different from what we had before, it is still better than that of any other country,” he said. “As we work to address outstanding trade issues with the US, it is important we do everything we can to preserve this unique advantage for Canadian workers and their families.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Washington and Ottawa had long been positioned as close allies on trade and defense.Canada has imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods three times. Those counter-tariffs covered $60bn worth of consumer goods. Canada’s federal government also imposed tariffs on American-made cars. The governing Liberal party has also pledged government support for sectors disproportionately affected by American economic protectionism, and in an effort to reduce Canada’s reliance on the US as a trading partner.Despite hints of a detente in recent weeks, including talks between Carney and Trump this week, Canada and the US failed to reach a set of terms by Trump’s 1 August deadline that would reshape a longer-standing relationship. In late July, Carney said Canada was unlikely to convince Trump, who sees tariffs as a useful and powerful cudgel, to drop all levies on Canadian goods.In a statement, the White House called the move “long overdue” and said Carney’s overture paved the way for “continuing our discussions with Canada on the administration’s trade and national security concerns”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsTariffsMark CarneyDonald TrumpAmericasAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The TPS designations and legal status of 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans are set to expire on 8 September, at which point they will become eligible for removal from the US.The National TPS Alliance grouphad sued, alleging that the administration’splanwas unlawful.In the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, some of their nationals in the US have held TPS status for over 25 years, sinceHurricane Mitchcaused devastating damage to both countries in the late 90s.In July, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said itwas safeto return people to Nicaragua and Honduras.However, the United Nationssaid in a reportthat the Nicaraguan regime of co-presidents Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo “has deliberately transformed the country into an authoritarian state where opposition voices are silenced and the population faces persecution and economic retaliation”.And in April the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,said: “The Nicaraguan regime is an enemy of humanity.”Meanwhile, Honduras has thehighest rateof femicides in Latin America, according to Human Rights Watch, with approximately seven femicides per 100,000 women, and across the nation the UN says 1.6 million people livewith urgent humanitarian needsout of a population of 7 million. More than 50,000 Hondurans in the US are TPS holders.Nepal was initially designated for TPS in 2015 afteran earthquakedisrupted and displaced millions. Noemsaidthat “there are notable improvements in environmental disaster preparedness and response capacity”. Earlier this year, amideconomic and political instability in the country, Nepal was experiencingviolent clashes between civilians and police.The Guardian has previouslyreportedon how the Trump administration has deported Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and are now living in a refugee camp.Meanwhile, last month, an appellate court authorized the Trump administration to end TPS for more than 8,000 Afghans and 5,000 Cameroonians. In the case of the Afghan immigrant population in the US, many, including some who assisted US forces in Afghanistan before thebotched withdrawalby the military in 2021,are already at risk of deportation.Fereshta Abbasi,Afghanistanresearcher for Human Rights Watch, says anyone deported to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan could face persecution or torture.“For example, on the deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, we were able to document cases that, especially former government employees, once they’re back in Afghanistan, they’re picked up by the authorities and they’re being arbitrarily detained and tortured; that’s a real risk for anyone who’s deported back to Afghanistan,” said Abbasi.She added: “The Taliban have not only taken away the fundamental rights of women, they have taken women’s autonomy as well. I’ve spoken to women in Afghanistan who have told me that they feel they are living in a prison. The US knows that Afghanistan is not a safe country.”What is temporary protected status and who is affected by Trump’s crackdown?Read moreThe Department of Homeland Security has cited risingtourismas a factor in its assessment that Afghans can be deported back there, with the US Federal Register’s item about revoking TPS for Afghans saying: “Tourism to Afghanistan has increased, as the rates of kidnappings have reduced.”However, the UShas also issueda travel warning for Afghanistan, advising Americans not to visit the country due to civil unrest, crime, terrorism and risk of wrongful detention.The international criminal court issued arrest warrantsfor two Taliban leaders, accused of crimes against humanity for the persecution of women and girls.An elderly British couple detained without charge after years of living in Afghanistanare in dangerof dying in custody, relatives have warned. And Afghansliving inor with the prospect of returning to Afghanistan who are known or even just suspected by the Taliban of having assisted USor British forcesthere could be in mortal danger.The US Congress established TPS as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, signed by the then president, George HW Bush.The estimated 1 million TPS holders in the US overall have not only used the program’s benefits to support themselves in the US workplace, but also tocontributean estimated $21bn annually to the economy, while paying $5.2bn in taxes,according tothe advocacy group Fwd.us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US embassy in Haitiwarns peoplenot to travel to the Caribbean nation, citing kidnapping and civil unrest, as does the US state departmentwebsite.While Noemacknowledgedthat conditions in Haiti remained dire, she said it was not in the national interest of the US to continue the TPS program for Haitians.The poorest country in the western hemisphere,Haitihas been engulfed in political tumult since the assassination of the then president, Jovenel Moïse, in 2021. The descent for the already-unstable country into further crisis has displaced 1.3 million Haitians,according tothe International Organization for Migration, and local authorities estimate that 5.7 million face food insecurity.An estimated 340,000 Haitians in the US who are currently covered by TPS – a designation initially made in 2010 following thedevastatingearthquakethat year– will no longer have this protection from deportation after 2 September.Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigrant support group in the US, said some of the people already deported toHaiti“are just dropped off” and “their family relatives don’t know what happened to them”.“The termination of TPS is a complete unwillingness to acknowledge the humanity of these immigrants, whom many of them have been in the country for over 15 years. Many of them have children who were born and raised here,” Jozef said.“The entire Black immigrant community doesn’t fit the agenda, or are not deemed dignified enough, or not deemed worthy enough of the protection that those people need. We are at a point where they don’t care how long they have been here, that they have paid their taxes, that they have businesses.”Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, remains largely under gang control and armed conflict has rendered the city inaccessible from both the north and south.Violent groups dominate the city center and surrounding areas, with only two districts spared, where camps for internally displaced people have multiplied, sheltering tens of thousands who have fled violence.In this parlous condition, the prospect of mass deportations from the US is alarming local organizations already struggling to cope.“Where will families whose homes have been burned down go?” Katia Bonté, coordinator of the Support Group for Returnees and Refugees (GARR) in Haiti, asked.Her organization already operates along the border between Haiti and theDominican Republic, assisting people expelled daily back to Haitiunder a crackdownby the Dominican government launched last October.Bonté fears a similar wave from the US would overwhelm already fragile systems.“Deported Haitians won’t be able to return to their families or communities. I visit the displacement camps. I see how people survive. It’s inhumane – the impact would be devastating,” she said, adding: “There’s not much hope left. It feels like we’re on our own, and no one is coming to help.”Meanwhile, the Trump administrationis reportedly eyeingHonduras and Nicaragua as places to send people who are from neither country originally but are being deported from the US, and has done a dealwith Rwandaand, on Wednesday,with Uganda.Therewas uproarfrom many directions when the US government deported, without due process, a group of people from a variety of countries to South Sudan and Eswatini this summer.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationAfghanistanNicaraguaHondurasNepalHaitiCameroonnewsShareReuse this content"

He wore a yellow tie, the colour associated with Thailand’s monarchy. The court confirmed it had dismissed the case, saying there was not enough evidence to prove wrongdoing.Thailand has one of the world’s most severe lese-majesty laws, under which criticism of the monarchy is punishable by between three and 15 years in prison. Since 2020, at least 281 people have been charged under the law, which can be interpreted broadly, with protesters prosecuted for political speeches, wearing clothes deemed to be an impersonation of the royals, or for being involved in the sale of satirical cartoons. Critics say the law is used to target political opponents and silence dissent.While Thaksin survived Friday’s case, this is just one of a series of legal challenges facing the former leader and his embattled family, who have been locked in a power struggle with Thailand’s military royalist establishment for decades.The bitter feud fuelling the border dispute between Thailand and CambodiaRead moreNext week, Thailand’s constitutional court will decide whether his daughter, suspended prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, should be removed from office over a leaked phone call with Cambodia’s former leader Hun Sen, in which she discussed the two countries’border dispute, with critics accusing her of kowtowing to Thailand’s neighbour.Thaksin also faces a separate court case over allegations he wrongly avoided prison on health grounds upon hisreturn from self-imposed exilein 2023. Thaksin had spent more than 15 years abroad to avoid legal charges that he had previously said were politically motivated, but returned after striking a controversial deal with his former enemies in the military establishment – an arrangement that now appears increasingly fragile.Thaksin, a billionaire businessman who once owned Manchester City football club, was first elected prime minister in a landslide victory in 2001, and he went on to build a strong voter base among rural communities in the north of Thailand by offering welfare and economic policies to improve people’s livelihoods.However, he was also accused of corruption and human rights abuses, and was loathed by conservatives in Bangkok. He was ousted from power in a military coup in 2006. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from office by a court ruling followed by a coup in 2014.Thailand’s courts have frequently intervened in politics, dissolving popular political parties and banning politicians from office.The latest series of court cases is a stark reminder of the “imbalance in power relations between elected and unelected forces in Thailand”, said Dr Napon Jatusripitak, visiting fellow at ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. “This is not the first time that an unelected set of judges gets to decide a national outcome and veto whatever mandates were made by the Thai electorates,” he said.However, he added that, while in the past, punitive court rulings against the Shinawatras elicited sympathy from their loyal support base, the family’s popularity has diminished significantly.The deal Thaksin struck when he returned to the country – where he joined with their old military opponents in order to keep a popular pro-reform party out of office – had damaged his credibility, said Napon.The party’s perceived failure to deliver on economic promises, and, most significantly, anger overPaetongtarn’s handling of Thailand’s border dispute with Cambodia, has led to a further collapse in support.Paetongtarn could be removed from office next week, potentially ushering in a new period of political instability in the country.Explore more on these topicsThailandThaksin ShinawatraAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Located just south of Singapore, the island was once home to a former camp for Vietnamese refugees and most recently the site of a pandemic hospital.In Muslim-majority Indonesia, a nation that has no formal diplomatic relations with Israel, and has long been a staunch supporter of Palestinian statehood, government officials have been reluctant to provide any details, saying it is just one option being considered.But reflecting a level of seriousness about the proposal, various ministries, including the coordinating security ministry and the ministries of health and foreign affairs have met to discuss how it would be implemented, said Dave Lakono, deputy chair of the parliament’s commission I, which oversees defence and foreign affairs.“These discussions have focused on logistical feasibility, medical readiness, and legal frameworks,” Laksono told the Guardian, “Commission I has also been briefed on the strategic implications, particularly regarding Indonesia’s foreign policy posture and regional stability.”Plans at this stage remain “exploratory”, he said, with Galang island identified as one site due its historical use for humanitarian purposes and existing infrastructure.Other sites, including facilities in West Java and Central Java that have proximity to major hospitals and logistical hubs are also being considered, he said.The Indonesian government appears to be considering several possibilities, with the use of large military hospitals in Jakarta, and also a site in Jordan, a country with which Indonesia’s president Prabowo Subinatio has particularly strong relations, also raised during ministerial discussions, according to one senior official with direct knowledge of the talks.Officials acknowledge the plan will be politically delicate, with some national Islamic leaders accusing the government of being “deceived” by Israel, and questioning what guarantees would be in place to ensure their return.“One of the issues is how to make sure the right to return of the Palestinians can be respected because we know that many are worried that this kind of policy can be interpreted in other ways,” said Abdul Kadir Jailani, the director general for Asian, Pacific and African affairs at Indonesia’s ministry of foreign affairs, stressing that no final decision had been made on Galang.“So we have to make sure it will be consistent with the principle of international humanitarian law, and in particular how to respect the right to return of the Palestinians.”“One of the most important things is that we are not going to do that without approval and support from relevant stakeholders, in particular Palestinian authorities and countries in the region,” he added, “The implementation of this plan has a high level of complexity, particularly in terms of its political and technical aspects.”Indonesia was able to conduct its second humanitarian airdrop onGazain two days this week, a move Jailani said was facilitated with support and coordination from neighbouring Jordan.Axiosreported this July that Israel’s spy agency The Mossad had visited Washington to seek US support in convincing countries to take hundreds of thousand of Palestinians from Gaza, with Indonesia among several countries reportedly receptive to the idea.Any permanent relocation would be hugely controversial in Indonesia, but so far, criticism of the Gaza plan has been relatively muted in the south-east Asian country.“At the moment there are so many issues in the headlines so the Gaza issue to be honest is not that widely reported in the media,” said political analyst Kennedy Muslim. “It’s not a major issue in Indonesia at the moment.”Parliament member Laksono stressed that any measures to accept Palestinians from Gaza would be temporary, with coordination with agencies such as Unrwa and ICRC to establish clear documentation, medical records, and repatriation protocols.“Our objective is to provide care, not resettlement, and to support their eventual return once conditions in Gaza allow,” he said.“This is a delicate undertaking, and we are fully aware of the geopolitical sensitivities involved.”Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaAsia PacificGazaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Pearson, who lives in Mosman on Sydney’s north shore, is believed to be the first individual to mount a legal challenge to the state government’s plans.View image in fullscreenSydenham train and metro station: public transport hubs are at the heart of NSW’s Transport Orientated Development Program (Tod), which aims to increase housing density near train, bus and metro interchanges.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianSign up: AU Breaking News emailShe has framed her objections as a fight to retain the character of her suburb and keep it open to a diverse range of income groups.“It became not about me, but about us … who live here because of the history, the heritage and the importance of having the right environment that we all want to live in,” she told a packed meeting of Mosman council in early August.“I am not against development, but … early indications are that the planned developments for Mosman will only be affordable to the very privileged.”Variations of the same argument are raging in different parts of the city, but it’s clear there is no straightforward path to satisfying the wishes of residents – and those who wish they could afford to be residents.The forest of acronymsAnyone engaged in the density question has to come to terms with a forest of initials and acronyms.Two of the most dramatic tools to address the problem in NSW are the state government’s transport-oriented development (Tod) and low to mid-rise housing (LMR) policies.Their broad thrust is to rezone land with the aim of fast-tracking 342,000 dwellings close to stations and town centres,, transforming suburbs into mini cities, particularly along the metro line.Rezoned “accelerated” Tod precincts in Hornsby, Macquarie Park, Kellyville, Bella Vista, Bankstown, Crows Nest, Homebush and Bays West allow six-storey developments within 1,200 metres of eight transport hubs.An additional 37 centres within Sydney, Newcastle, Illawarra and the Central Coast have been earmarked for six-storey developments within 400m of stations.LMRs are designed to boost the diversity of housing stock and will create a tiered effect around stations and town centres with mid-rises within the first 400 metres of a hub, giving way to low rises such as townhouses up to 800 metres from hubs. Mosman is one of the areas that falls into this category.View image in fullscreenA three-storey development in the Sydney suburb of Lindfield.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianLarger developments will be approved by the state government, while council panels will approve other development applications submitted under Tods and LMRs.But the Tods and LMRs are blunt instruments, delivering a top-down mandate to culturally, socially, geographically and demographically different areas while initially calling for just 2% of the new homes to be affordable.The response to the Tod policy –accidentally announced in December 2023– and to last year’s LMRs has been huge. The public exhibition of LMRs alone resulted in 8,000 submissions. Many feared the plans would drive the construction of bland blocks in locales variously known for their leafy streets, close-knit communities, creative edge and single-home lots.If nothing else, the policies have triggered action on densification at the local level. According to the Department of Planning,Housingand Infrastructure, 11 of 13 Tod-affected councils have deferred Tod start dates and 12 have drawn up their own, more nuanced alternatives (Newcastle is the only exception).But far from resolving anxieties, the counter-proposals appear to have divided communities further.‘A terrible situation’Heritage is one sticking point. Tods and LMRs do not override listed heritage items, but they do apply in heritage conservation areas.David Burdon, the conservation director of the National Trust of Australia, told a parliamentary inquiry into Tods that heritage conservation in NSW was increasingly seen as “optional”.Others take aim at the hard edge where high-rise meets land that has not been upzoned.Under the original Tod maps issued by the Minns government in 2023, up to six storeys would have been allowed on the West Lindfield street where Paul Grimble has lived for 30 years.Ku-ring-gai’s preferred option, devised after consultation with the community, is very different. It wants to go high around Gordon and Lindfield stations – up to 28 storeys with heights of up to 93 metres – but to cut back on development in heritage areas and limit heights in others.View image in fullscreenThe Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure says 12 of 13 Tod-affected councils have drawn up their own, more nuanced alternatives.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianFor Grimble, who lives 350 metres west of Lindfield station in a single-storey house, the revised plan is a disaster.The land where his house and those of his neighbours sit will be limited to developments of three storeys and six to nine units.Grimble says this will make his house an unattractive proposition for developers compared with what it would have been worth under the state government’s plan – if he sold he would not be able to buy a similar house in the area.“So, nobody in these areas is going to be able to afford to sell. Nothing will happen and the council’s promised target of 24,500 apartments will come to nothing,” Grimble says.“The council appears to have thrown out their own planning rulebook and put us all in a terrible situation.”Worse still, he’s about to get a 10-storey building on his back boundary, which was approved as a state significant development a few years back.“These developments collide with their neighbours over a fence with a height difference of 10 storeys to one. The desired ‘harmony’ [of built form] is severely disrupted not just for one neighbour but on a whole side of the street,” he says.View image in fullscreenPaul Grimble in the garden of his home in West Lindfield, Sydney. ‘The council’s promised target of 24,500 apartments will come to nothing,’ he says.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianKu-ring-gai councillor Indu Baluchandran says: “We recognise it’s not perfect … but it’s certainly better than the original Tod in terms of preserving neighbourhood character that Ku-ring-gai feels is precious to this community.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionNot everyone in the area is unhappy. For Gordon lawyer Sarah Hart, development is overdue.“If you’re near good public transport, you should expect to be around lots of people,” she says. “I had always expected that there would be increasing density around stations.“The more people here the better, because I would like my local chemist to have a reason to stay open on Sundays and I’d like local restaurants to stay open beyond 8pm. We didn’t come here because we wanted camellias.”The NSW Department of Planning is due to respond to the plan in September, and the council’s land and environment court challenge to the validity of the Tod policy is due to be heard in November.‘That’s not planning’Elsewhere, fears over quality and the lack of affordability have stalled the push towards new development.Among the Tod critics is Shelter NSW. In one of the 347 submissions on Hornsby’s accelerated Tod, the housing charity said it could not support the Tod because it did not meet the 15% affordable housing rate that was part of the state’s “density deal” sold to the broader community.That sentiment is perhaps most keenly felt in the city’s inner west, an area that has leaped from affordable to gentrified in recent years.Eddie Ma, an architect who designs affordable and specialist housing, can see Dulwich Hill station from his apartment block. On one side of the station are six-storey apartment blocks, on the other, single-dwelling houses in a heritage conservation area he would like to see preserved.“The Tod didn’t consider local context,” he says. “It’s a two-line policy that just says: at these stations, you can build up. That’s not planning.”In response, Inner West council proposed its Our Fairer Future plan – a block-by-block strategy that goes well beyond the Tod by increasing the target number of dwellings for the area from 7,800 over five years to 31,000 in 15 years.Some buildings may reach 22 storeys, but generally are likely to sit between six and 11 storeys – and about 70% of developments will be concentrated in three suburbs.“That is never going to deliver a good outcome,” says Ma, who is a member of the local Better Futures Coalition. He claims the 1,150-page plan was poorly communicated and is unfair.“You have one tiny area living with the positives and the negatives of densification and the rest of the LGA could fall asleep, wake up 15 years later and nothing would have changed.”He believes the plan’s amalgamation incentives – allowing developers to build up to 17 storeys depending on the size of the site and its active transport provisions – favour large-scale developers.He is disheartened by its 2% affordable homes provision, rising to 5% in five years. The council’s own affordable housing policy calls for 15% of new builds to be affordable.The inner west mayor, Darcy Byrne, is adamant the plan is fairer and designed more carefully than the Tod, preserving all heritage conservation areas while attempting to become the state’s leader on affordable housing.The inner west needed a finer-grained approach than the state’s “completely unsubtle, unsophisticated way”, he says, not least because it is already densely populated by Australian standards, with diverse ownership and small, high-value lot sizes that made amalgamation incentives necessary. Future developments, including along Parramatta Road, will balance out initial pushes for density elsewhere in the LGA, he says.“One of the reasons that Sydney has one of the least affordable housing markets in the world and that young people are being forced out of the inner west en masse is because of this debate constantly being replayed, in which the voices of young people are eliminated,” he says.“What I’m noticing in the community is the proportion of people, particularly younger people and essential workers, who are being priced out who are saying, ‘No, we have to address this crisis. Let’s find a way to do it’.’”Australian cities lag far behindFeasibility studies paint a varied picture of how many homes the policies will actually deliver. According to the Fairer Future plan, Tods and LMRs in the inner west will result in just 3,200 homes by 2041, while the council’s alternative will create 5,900 homes. Ma says the low numbers are another example of the inadequacy of the policies.Stuart Ayres, the chief executive of the Urban Development Institute of Australia NSW, says the policies have so far not seen the uptake needed to achieve housing objectives – with only 3,500 possible new dwellings across Tod and LMR sites being attributed to genuinely new development applications after one year.View image in fullscreenAccording to the Fairer Future plan, Tods and LMRs in the inner west will result in just 3,200 homes by 2041, while the council’s alternative will create 5,900 homes.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianVivian’s new Sydney apartment caps rent at 30% of her income. Is this the way to tackle Australia’s housing crisis?Read moreTake-up may be limited by yet another factor. Nicole Gurran, an urban planning professor at the University of Sydney, suggests it is better to rezone land precinct by precinct, responding to – rather than pre-empting – the market.“That way, you’re not artificially raising land value ahead of what’s feasible to be developed,” she says.Ehsan Noroozinejad Farsangi, a senior researcher at the Urban Transformations Research Centre at Western Sydney University, says Australian cities are far behind others, including Vancouver and Hong Kong, in implementing policies similar to Tods and LMRs.He’s seen them work, but in NSW, he says, “the problem is that, at the moment, the government is doing the Tod and the LMR in a top-down approach. It should be bottom-up.”“Most of the politicians and government bodies are mainly focusing on the quantity rather than quality and community,” he says.“Even if that number of houses would be produced in the next five years, the question is: what quality will they be? The final outcome should be something livable and should be something high quality. Otherwise it’s not working.”Scully is determined to persevere in trying to bring the public around to the reforms.“Change can be difficult,” he says. “While some opposition is expected, I am growing tired of this approach to housing where some people think that the best thing they can do is look for new and creative ways to say no to housing instead of embracing new and creative ways for their suburb to help tackle our housing challenge in a meaningful way.”Explore more on these topicsSydneyNew South WalesHousingnewsShareReuse this content"

They went to another leisure facility inFrancewith no incident, the statement said. The manager denied any wrongdoing, it added.“A line was crossed. We are appalled,” said Perla Danan, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions in the Languedoc-Roussillon region.“It started with graffiti, insults and physical attacks and now it’s literally a ban on children aged eight to 16,” Danan said, adding that it reminded her of the “no Jews or dogs allowed” sign during the Holocaust. “France’s values have been violated,” she said.Jean-Philippe Augé, the mayor of Porté-Puymorens, which has about 100 residents, said “the DNA of our community is based on a sense of sharing and fraternity”. He added that the incident had caused “utter astonishment” in the village.The Jewish Observatory of France also expressed “deep outrage” in a statement on Friday. “Such an act of discrimination, targeting minors exclusively on the basis of their nationality and origin, is extremely serious and undermines the fundamental principles of the republic.”Discrimination based on religion is an offence punishable by up to three years in prison in France.There was a sharp increase in antisemitic incidents reported in 2023 after the 7 October Hamas attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. These included physical assaults, threats, vandalism and harassment, prompting alarm among Jewish communities and leaders.This monthEmmanuel Macron promised to punish an act of “antisemitic hatred”after the felling of an olive tree planted in memory of a young French Jewish man who was tortured to death in 2006.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeIsraelAntisemitismJudaismReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

No one will go with you. People aren’t like that now. No one will come out to the square.’”Prigozhina said her son replied:“No, they will support me.”Prigozhin’s short-lived rebellion, launched with several hundred of his most loyal fighters, was preceded by weeks of escalating tension with Russia’s defence ministry and top commanders, whom he accused of corruption.At the time, Wagner played a keyrolein Russia’s offensive against Ukraine, with Prigozhin’s fighters often deployed as shock troops in frontal assaults during battles in eastern Ukraine.While no major political figures backed Prigozhin’s rebellion, polls suggested that at its height, his blunt, anti-establishment rhetoric resonated widely and won him significant support among Russians.When Wagner troops seized control of key military sites in Rostov-on-Don, Prigozhin wasgreetedwarmly by locals.But he called off the march about 120 miles (193km) outside Moscow after a series of phone calls with senior Russian officials and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who acted as an intermediary.During the advance, Wagner fighters shot down a Ka-52 attack helicopter, killing its crew, and destroyed an Il-18 military aircraft.“In the end he just turned around – that was it,” said Prigozhina.“He had no intention of overthrowing Putin, absolutely not. He only wanted to get through to the military leadership,” she added, claiming her son halted the march to avoid further bloodshed among regular Russian troops.“He told me he couldn’t shoot young guys during his march,” Prigozhina said.After Prigozhin’s death, Russian authorities swiftly moved to seize his sprawling business empire, which extended far beyond mercenary operations to encompass online “bot farms”, mining ventures in Africa and a vast catering business – the source of his nickname “Putin’s chef”.View image in fullscreenYevgeny Prigozhin serves the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, at his restaurant in 2011.Photograph: APHis Wagner forces, which operated primarily across Africa and have been accused of mass atrocities, have since been absorbed into Russian state structures and continue to operate under the name Africa Corps.Prigozhin’s 27-year-old son, Pavel, who fought with Wagner in Syria, has been largely sidelined in the power struggle that followed his father’s death.In September 2024, Prigozhina won an unexpected victory in an EU court, which ordered her removal from the European sanctions list and instructed the Council of the European Union to pay her legal costs.She and her grandson had been placed under sanctions as part of a wider move against the Prigozhin family, which for years played an active role in Yevgeny Prigozhin’s network of businesses.In the interview with Fontanka, Prigozhina complained that despite being taken off the sanctions list, she was recently denied a visa to travel to Hamburg, Germany, to visit a clinic.“Instead, I am preparing many exhibitions now,” she said, adding that one of the main works currently on display in her St Petersburg gallery shows a portrait of her son inUkraine.Explore more on these topicsYevgeny PrigozhinRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Szijjártó wrote on Facebook it had been attacked “for the third time in a short time”.“This is another attack on the energy security of our country. Another attempt to drag us into war,” he said.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has refused to join EU partners in backing Kyiv with political, economic and military support. Orbán visited Moscow last year for talks with the country’s president,Vladimir Putin, on a rare trip to Russia by a European leader.View image in fullscreenViktor Orbán, left, met with Putin in the Kremlin last year.Photograph: Vivien Cher Benko/EPAOn Friday, Orbán’s Fidesz party posted a note from its leader condemning Ukrainian strikes on the pipeline earlier in the week “just before thehistoric meeting between President Trump and Putin in Alaska”.“Hungary supports Ukraine with electricity and petrol, in return they bomb pipeline that supply us,” Orbán wrote in English. “Very unfriendly move! We wish President Trump every success in his pursuit for peace!”Below the text was a handwritten messageapparently written and signed by Trump: “Viktor – I do not like hearing this – I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia,” it read. “You are my great friend – Donald.”While the other 25 EU member stateshalted Russian oil purchases as part of the bloc’s sanctionsafter Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Hungary and Slovakia have remained outliers.The EU aims to phase out Russian oil and gas entirely by the end of 2027 but Budapest and Bratislava oppose such a move, arguing that Russian energy supplies are vital to their national economies.Despite a push by Trump to reach a deal to end the conflict, the three-and-a-half-year war continued unabated this week as Russia launched an air attack near Ukraine’s border with the EU on Thursday and continued itsdevastating assault on Ukrainian cities.Ukraine has repeatedly pounded Russian oil refineries among other targets, sending Russian wholesale petrol prices soaring to record highs in recent days.

It was the second time that supplies to the EU countries were interrupted this week.The Soviet-era pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Ukraine, also ships oil from Kazakhstan to Germany but its economy ministry said supplies of Kazakh oil were unaffected by the latest strike.Slovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister,Robert Fico, has adopted Kremlin lines and sided with Orbán as a pro-Russian voice in the EU.In May,Fico shook hands with Putin at the Kremlinbefore becoming the only EU leader to attend Russia’s 9 May parade of military forces waging war on Ukraine.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaEnergy industryOilSlovakiaHungarynewsShareReuse this content"

More than 85% of the content removed for violating its community guidelines is identified and taken down by automation, according to the platform.The cuts come despite the recent introduction of new UK online safety rules, which require companies to introduce age checks on users attempting to view potentially harmful content. Companies can be fined up to £18m or 10% of global turnover for breaches, whichever is greater.John Chadfield of the Communication Workers Union said replacing workers with AI in content moderation could put the safety of millions of TikTok users at risk.“TikTok workers have long been sounding the alarm over the real-world costs of cutting human moderation teams in favour of hastily developed, immature AI alternatives,” he said.TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese tech group ByteDance, employs more than 2,500 staff in the UK.Over the past year, TikTok has beencutting trust and safety staff across the world,often substituting workers with automated systems. In September, the company fired its entire team of 300 content moderators in the Netherlands. In October, it then announced it would replace about 500 content moderation employees in Malaysia as part of its shift towards AI.Last week, TikTok workers in Germanyheld strikesover layoffs in its trust and safety team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of them, 8,900 were marked as killed, or probably killed, a joint investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand the Hebrew-language outletLocal Callhas found.That is less than one in five of the total, and far below figures given publicly by politicians and military commanders, who have given tolls more than double that number, varying between 17,000 and 20,000 for the same period.An intelligence team reviewing militant casualties concluded that the database probably undercounted the total “by a little” but the significantly higher figures given publicly were “inaccurate”, several intelligence sources said.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of an Israeli strike on Deir al-Balah. The overwhelming majority of deaths and injuries in the Gaza war have been civilians.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAKilling a significant proportion of enemy soldiers is not always a military objective in war or a precondition for victory. But in the absence of a long-term strategy, Israel’s military chose to make the militant toll a metric of their success.Soon after the start of the war, Yossi Sariel, then the head of the elite 8200 intelligence unit, began sending a daily update on the toll in the form of a data graph, which was dubbed the “war dashboard”, several intelligence sources told the Guardian.The display was treated like “a football game, officers sitting around watching the numbers go up on the dashboard,” one source said.Sariel and other senior commanders presented the deaths ofHamasfighters as an objective in itself, sources said. There was no discussion of how Gaza would be controlled or governed if Hamas collapsed, or what concessions Israel might try to force through the mass killing of individual fighters.“We had a beautiful, interactive dashboard, but we didn’t understand the goals of the war,” one of Sariel’s subordinates said. “It was very frustrating, the flattening of things into numbers.” Asked about his focus on the number of militant casualties, Sariel declined to comment.Several sources said that inflating militant death tolls, figures frequently reported and amplified by the Israeli media, was seen by some in the military as a way to restore their standing in the eyes of the Israeli public after the failures of 7 October 2023.But from a strategic perspective that attempt to measure military progress through a militant body count, amid an extremely high rate of civilian killing, was tactically unsound and self-defeating, a senior western military source said.“They are just measuring the wrong statistic. They will never be able to kill everybody who is associated with Hamas, so what is the definition of victory?”For nearly two years, Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israeli forces are inGazato “destroy Hamas”, an objective so vague it could be pursued almost indefinitely.The military capacities that allowed the group to massacre 1,200 people in Israel in 2023 have been destroyed. All bar one of the leadership group who planned the 7 October attacks have been killed, as have many of their replacements.Israel hasreduced much of Gaza to a flattened wasteland, killed or injured one in 10 of the prewar population and forced the starving survivors into just 20% of Gaza’s area.Graph showing deaths and injuries in Gaza since October 2023In that apocalyptic landscape, after intensive bombings and ground operations that have killed tens of thousands of civilians, most of the people listed in Israel’s database as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters are still alive.Israel defines and targets as militants many people who do not participate in combat, and are protected civilians under international law.A specific piece of intelligence is attached to every operative on the list whom the army is sure it killed, justifying that designation, intelligence sources said. The Guardian, +972 and Local Call obtained figures without names or additional reports.“Anybody that we have knowledge of their death, in any way whatsoever, will be documented there,” one source said. The document notes the confirmed deaths of 7,330 militants and records 1,570 as “probably dead”. There were 750 senior Hamas operatives in the database; 300 were labelled as certainly or probably killed.Comparing the military database with the casualty list compiled by the Gaza health ministry indicates Israel killed five civilians for each militant inside Gaza. Mass killing is one factor cited by scholars, lawyers and rights groups, who say Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.True death toll is higherBoth the military database and the health ministry casualty list are underestimates.Israel’s military intelligence teams are aware they had not identified all militants and do not know of every death, sources with knowledge of the database said. But their estimates still indicated that “for each militant, four civilians were killed”.The casualty list published by the health ministry includes only those whose bodies have been recovered, not the thousands buried under the rubble. Peer-reviewed international research alsoindicates a significantly higher toll.Map showing majority IDF military zones and evacuated areas of Gaza.Yet Netanyahu, who iswanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes, is promising that another ground operation in Gaza City – which would inevitably bring further mass killings of Palestinian civilians – will allow the military to “seize control of the last terrorist strongholds” and defeat Hamas.The western military source said: “What we are seeing now is another throw of a losing dice. Because this is not going to work. It’s going to be more of the same.“There is no way that any of this is going to lead to any situation where you could possibly apply the word victory. It’s gratuitous violence for no military point at all.”Hamas now has just a handful of rockets that it would struggle to deploy and its fighters would not easily get near the border fence, much less through it. It does not pose an existential threat to Israel,according to Israeliand Palestinian experts.“They have lost the ability to threaten Israel itself for the next one to two decades minimum,” said Muhammad Shehada, an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations.But if fighting continues in Gaza, Hamas could have time and manpower on its side. Israel’s military is structured to fight conventional armies in short wars, mobilising from reserves. Growing numbers of reservists are now refusing to report for duty, and the military isconsidering an appeal to the diaspora.“Hamas can maintain a long-term insurgency in Gaza, because it doesn’t take much: all they need is rifles and anti-tank weapons,” Shehada said. “If they recycle the Israeli bombs that didn’t explode there is an endless supply of explosives, and the genocide provides an infinite recruiting pool for new members.”View image in fullscreenDestroyed buildings in Gaza City. Israel has reduced much of the strip to a flattened wasteland.Photograph: Omar al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesAmerican intelligence estimates suggestHamas has recruited 15,000 operatives during the war, about twice as many as Israel has killed.Public claims of a death toll approaching 20,000 have also been criticised by rightwing figures inside Israel. The retired general Itzhak Brik, a confidant of Netanyahu at the start of the war but now a fierce critic, believes even the 8,900 figure is an exaggeration.The focus on the death toll offered a dangerous incentive to lie, he said, describing the much higher toll as “one of the most serious bluffs” in the country’s history.In April 2024, several members of the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee questioned militant casualty figures presented to them by the army, the rightwing dailyIsrael Hayom reported.After examining the military’s data, the committee members found public estimates had inflated the number of militant casualties “in order to create a 2:1 ratio” between civilian and militant deaths.Their findings echo numbers in the militant database seen by the Guardian. The list is based on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad documents from before and after 7 October and extensive research. It includes thousands of militants the army believes were recruited after the start of the war.The Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the database or the casualty data when approached for comment by Local Call and +972. When the Guardian asked for comment on the same data, a spokesperson said they had decided to “rephrase” their response.In a statement to the Guardian the military did not directly address questions about the intelligence database. It said “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without specifying the data it disputed. A spokesperson did not respond when asked why the military had given different responses to questions about a single set of data.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay – even by days – will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.“If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”Charts showing food insecurity in the Gaza Strip by governorateThe IPCwarned in Julythat a “famine scenario” was unfolding in parts of Gaza but until now it had stopped short of making a formal declaration, citing a lack of hard data.In addition to a famine in and around Gaza City, the biggest built-up area of the territory and home to between 500,000 and 800,000 people, the report declares that the towns of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis in the centre and south of Gaza are likely to experience famine “in coming weeks”.The experts say the data is insufficient to declare a famine in the north of the territory, though aid officials say the conditions there are thought to be the most severe and have called for urgent steps to allow for a full humanitarian assessment.1:03UN agency says Gaza famine is direct result of Israel’s actions – videoIbtisam Saleh, 50, who lives in Gaza City, said she and her 29-year-old son had been eating one meal a day for weeks, and many times they had nothing at all. “I cook only lentils, nothing else is available to us,” she told the Guardian. “Yesterday a donor gave us a small bag of rice. As for food kitchens, I cannot eat their food, it makes my stomach hurt if I taste it. And I do not have the strength to stand in line waiting to get my share.”In order to declare a famine, strict criteria must be met: at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and two people for every 10,000 die each day due to “outright starvation”.The declaration of famine in Gaza will increase pressure onIsraelto ease the tight restrictions it has maintained on supplies since the beginning of the 22-month-old conflict.David Lammy, Britain’s foreign secretary, condemned the famine as a “moral outrage”. “The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable,” he said in a statement. “The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe.”Amjad Shawa, the director of the Gaza NGOs Network, who is based in Gaza City, said: “This is the worst, the most critical stage in the entire history of Gaza, not just in this war. We are in a very complicated situation. We feel very sick and very tired. We must get food otherwise we cannot imagine what will happen.”Israel rejected the findings the report, claiming there was no famine in Gaza and that the findings were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”.Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israeli forces will launch a massive new assault on Gaza City within weeks. Aid officials said any further offensives in Gaza would have catastrophic consequences for the population.View image in fullscreenAid packages descend with parachutes on Deir al-Balah on Friday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israel-backed organisation that was supposed to replace aid groups that previously distributed food to much of the population in Gaza, is failing to distribute sufficient food.The UN and other organisations face massive logistical obstacles including widespread looting due to an almost total breakdown of the rule of law, ongoing Israeli combat operations, Israel’s administrative restrictions and bureaucracy and damaged infrastructure within Gaza.Riham Kraiem, 35, who is living in a tent in Gaza City, said her eldest son, 13, had travelled to the aid distribution areas in the north of Gaza, risking his life in largely fruitless efforts to bring food for the family of 10. “My children’s health … is now very poor,” she said. “There’s nothing nutritious for them to eat. I can’t provide proper food to support their bodies. My four-year-old daughter’s condition is deteriorating, she is suffering from malnutrition and is sick because of it.“I have no food supplies left. We left some behind in our home when we fled and the house was destroyed. Yesterday my son went again to look for aid and got one kilogram of pasta and a can of tomato sauce. He didn’t get it from the aid distribution, a young man there gave it to him. He came back feeling like he was flying from happiness.”Chart showing numbers of arrived and intercepted aid truck deliveries to Gaza by the UN and partners since 19 May 2025The IPC report expresses grave concern at the continued and large-scale killing of civilians while trying to access food deliveries and the inadequate planning, implementation and monitoring of the privatised food distributions conducted by the GHF.It calls for “urgent, comprehensive and sustained action to end the swiftly deteriorating and ever-expanding humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip”.According to figures from Gaza’s health ministry, verified by the World Health Organization, deaths from malnutrition and starvation in Gaza have risen sharply. In the 22 months after the 7 October attacks by Hamas, 89 deaths were attributed to malnutrition or starvation, mostly children under 18. In the first 20 days of August there were 133 deaths, including 25 under-18s, the ministry said on Wednesday.Israel disputes the hunger fatality figures given by the health ministry of Gaza’s Hamas-run government, arguing that the deaths were due to other medical causes.Israeli officials said more than220 aid trucksentered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaFaminenewsShareReuse this content"

Israel claims to have launched the first stages of a sweeping military operation to conquer Gaza City – the administrative heart of the strip – warning that a million peoplecould be forced from their homes, sparking a wave of fear among residents.In the past few nights Palestinians have described relentless bombardments, with thousands already scrambling to escape, while others are too starved or frail to evacuate.International condemnation has poured in, with disgust at the starvation, destruction and mounting civilian toll – in Israel, hundreds of thousands of protestershave filled the streetsdemanding a ceasefire. Yet the military is doubling down on attacks.Officials have made daily announcements about the plan to conquer Gaza City, but it remains unclear whether a full-scale offensive is actually afoot.For today’s newsletter I spoke with senior international reporterPeter Beaumontto get a clearer idea of Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan and how much of what he says can be trusted. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesUK news| Protesters at the next mass demonstration against the ban on Palestine Actionwill withhold their detailsfrom officers to force en-masse processing at police stations in an effort to make it “practically impossible” to arrest everyone.Ukraine| Moscow threw Donald Trump’sUkraine peace initiativeinto disarray on Thursday, insisting it must have a veto over any postwar support for the country as its forces carried out a large-scale overnight missile barrage.Immigration| Refugee support organisations have been forced to install safe rooms in their premises, relocate to less visible sites and in some cases close their offices in response to the threat of far-right violence,the Guardian can reveal.US news| A federal judge in Miami late on Thursdayordered the closureof the Trump administration’s notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail within 60 days and ruled that no more detainees were to be brought to the facility while it was being wound down.Health| Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months toimprove the quality of their productsin England amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor.In depth: ‘Experienced Israeli analysts seem genuinely baffled about what’s going on’View image in fullscreenA displaced Palestinian girl stands next to rubble and debris after an Israeli strike on at a camp for internally displaced people in Deir el-Balah.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesIn early August, Israel’s political‑security cabinet approved a military plan to take control of Gaza City, which they claim is a Hamas stronghold. The plan involves the call-up of roughly 60,000 reservists starting from early September.Sources from the Gaza municipality say that the situation in Gaza City is “catastrophic”. The population is extremely weak and many are unlikely to have the strength to undergo another displacement. “We were talking to a friend in Gaza yesterday who was saying you won’t recognise me any more, I’ve lost so much weight,” said Peter Beaumont. “Some are leaving Gaza City, but other people say they just can’t do it any more.” The military claims it is displacing the population “to ensure their safety”. It has not said when the mass displacement would begin, but medics have beentold to prepareby the Israeli military.“The IDF hasn’t made preparations to accommodate the displacement of a million people. It just hasn’t. It isn’t effectively feeding and caring for the people who are already displaced,” Peter said.Five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians, figures from a classified Israelimilitary intelligence databasesuggest. This extreme rate of slaughter has been rarely matched in recent decades of warfare. The UN humanitarian agency has warned the Israeli plan to expand military operations in Gaza City –home to around 500,000 people– would have “a horrific humanitarian impact”.Truth, lies, and calculated misdirectionIsraeli officials have made announcements saying the plan to conquer Gaza City has been “approved”, with preliminary actions already under way. “Everything that’s been said about this operation at the moment has to be taken with a pinch of salt,” said Peter, who wrote yesterday that when dealing with Israeli officials – and Netanyahu in particular – filtering out what is true, what is lies, and what is calculated misdirectionis a complicated business.The talk of a large-scale IDF operation could primarily be intended to put pressure on the militant group in ceasefire talks. “All that’s actually happened is that they’re renewing the availability of reservists. All it means is that they’ve been told to be available for call-up,” said Peter. “One should always be very cautious about what is being said, especially in statements that are clearly fishing for headlines.”On Thursday evening Netanyahu said on a visit to Israeli soldiers that hewould give final approvalfor taking control of Gaza City, but also said he was looking to restart negotiations with Hamas to end the war on terms acceptable to Israel. “It’s pretty incoherent leadership,” says Peter.Politically it seems like a strange move from the Israeli PM. “It’s not clear to me how the politics of it plays out,” said Peter. “Experienced Israeli analysts who have been covering security and Netanyahu for years seem genuinely baffled about what’s going on.”One key point is that the public are against the takeover of Gaza City as they understand it will likely lead to the death of the surviving 20 hostages, with relatives describing it as a “death sentence” for them. Another is that the ceasefire deal Hamas has agreed tois essentially the sameas the one Israel signalled its agreement for only weeks ago. Hamas said Israel’s plans to conquer Gaza City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts to broker a truce.“Normal people are getting tired,” Peter said. “Netanyahu hasn’t delivered any of the successes he claimed he would, and we’re nearly two years into a war.”By the end of 2024 – now more than eight months ago – the economic toll of Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza had alreadyreached $67.57bn. “The cost of maintaining it is hurting Israel economically. It’s a small country with a relatively small number of soldiers and reservists available to it. People are getting exhausted by the war,” said Peter. There arereports of suicides among soldiers, and complaints that they are not getting treatment for PTSD.“Israel’s response, as far as I can see, is just simply to be more and more aggressive,” said Peter – perhaps epitomised by a social media post from theIsraeli ambassador to Canadaat the end of July: “Israel will not bow to the distorted campaign of international pressure against it.”“It’s very hard to see what victory Netanyahu could wrap himself in, which is presumably why he’s talking about pressing on with the Gaza City plan,” said Peter. “It’s about the sunk cost fallacy: ‘Just one more effort will get us to that other thing’.” Or so he hopes it will.An impending avalancheIf the operation to conquer Gaza City does go ahead, it will lead to humanitarian disaster, said Peter. “If you think international criticism is bad at the moment, it will be an absolute avalanche,” he explained.On 8 August,Germany announcedit was halting its export of arms to Israel following announcement of the Gaza City plan, indicating a significant shift in Berlin’s staunch support for Israel, with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, just one ofa number of European leadersto condemn the decision after Netanyahufirst announcedhis offensive on Gaza City despite intense international pressure to reach a ceasefire agreement.On the ground in Gaza City, people have spoken of their terror of what is to come following relentless overnight bombardments. “The house shakes with us all night long – the sound of explosions, artillery, warplanes, ambulances, and cries for help is killing us,” one resident, Ahmad al-Shanti, told AFP. “The sound is getting closer, but where would we go?”And as all of this plays out on the world stage, international outrage is growing – indicating that perhaps world leaders will soon no longer be willing to look away.“All the old certainties for governments – about having to try and accommodate Israeli aggression – are falling away,” Peter said. “Given where public opinion is and given how privately sick many politicians are of all this now, I think it would be very hard to see Israel avoiding big, meaningful sanctions going forward. And I think even Israelis recognise that.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenTorgi Squire uploaded a TikTok post complaining about the Scottish weather that has delighted African Americans.Photograph: Torgi Squire/TikTokA Glaswegian teacher’sgood-natured rantaboutScottish summer weatherhas sparked a global conversation about history, diaspora and diversity.Tara Russell, newsletters teamThere are some amazing human storieswrapped into this pieceon Russia’s deliberate attacks onUkraine’s maternity hospitalswhich left women terrified of childbirth.

Everyone is terrific, with Jones doing her usual sterling work.

The goal was to protect people – particularly children – from dog attacks and rabies, which remains endemic inIndia.Critics had said the plan was unrealistic. Veterinarian Harjun Singh said: “The cost of constructing proper shelters would be prohibitive. Rounding them up and putting them in cages would have been another way of condemning them to death.” Delhi, a city of 35 million people, is estimated to be home to as many as 1 million stray dogs.View image in fullscreenA stray dog barks at people riding a moped in Mira Road area in Mumbai.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAIn a new ruling on Friday the same court suspended the “catch-and-keep” plan, recommending a more “holistic” India-wide approach.Dogs, the court said, should be sterilised, vaccinated, dewormed and returned to their neighbourhoods, with only those showing aggression or suffering from rabies kept in shelters.Animal welfare group Peta said: “They say every dog has her day, and today is the day [for India’s] community dogs. The decision shows the majority think of community dogs as beloved neighbours and friends. Now, with a renewed focus on sterilisation and vaccination, the rest of India can move closer to the day that no dogs are left to suffer hunger, accidents and cruelty on the roads.”Delhi’s streets are alive with mixed-breed “indies” – hardy and intelligent dogs prized for their resilience. Their numbers, however, have long sparked tension between public safety authorities and animal welfare advocates.View image in fullscreenA woman holds a dog as she and other animal lovers attend a protest rally in Chennai.Photograph: Riya Mariyam R/ReutersTensions turned violent earlier this week when Delhi’s chief minister, Rekha Gupta, who has made removing strays from the streets a top priority, was assaulted by a man described by his family as a passionate dog lover with mental-health issues. The man allegedly pushed, slapped and pulled her hair. He has been charged with attempted murder.The court also directed municipal authorities to set up feeding spaces for strays, aiming to feed them safely, monitor their health, and reduce conflicts with people. Critics say, however, that such spaces are hard to manage, can trigger dog fights, and many municipalities lack the infrastructure to run them effectively.On any given day, Delhi’s street dogs lounge on pavements, roam alleys and wait patiently at tea stalls for biscuits and milk. In markets, shopkeepers toss scraps of leftover rotis. Outside temples, they wander among worshippers. In Hindu tradition, they are linked to Bhairava, a fierce, protective aspect of Shiva, one of the religion’s principal deities. Feeding them is considered an act of kindness, believed by some to bring protection and good fortune.View image in fullscreenA stray dog walks on a street in Delhi.Photograph: Harish Tyagi/EPAMany strays answer to names given by residents like Kalu (black), Brownie and Chhotu (small). Some wear collars, marking them as part of the community even if people can’t house them. “Street dogs have created bonds with the people,” said city chronicler Mayank Austen Soofi. “They form very active relationships with grocers and shopkeepers, with families, and with the homeless who treat them like companions. These dogs are friendly and have woven themselves into human lives.”Still, though, India accounts for roughly one-third of the world’s rabies deaths, up to 20,000 a year, according to the World Health Organization, making stray dog management a critical public health concern. “People have the right to go for walks without being frightened of being bitten and chased by dogs,” said one city-centre resident. Delhi, however, reported zero rabies deaths between January 2022 and January 2025. Bite cases fluctuate: 17,874 in 2023, dropping to 6,691 in 2024.Despite the risks many residents welcome the dogs’ presence. Delhi resident Ashima Sharma said: “They belong here. That’s why we don’t use the word strays or street dogs: we call them community dogs. They’re also useful because they bark at strangers entering late at night.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Harish Tyagi/EPAEven in Khan Market, a hub for Delhi’s more affluent population, shopkeepers feed them and proudly point out longtime “residents”. In winter, NGOs often provide brightly coloured jackets to keep them warm.The court’s earlier order had shocked animal welfare groups, breaking with years of precedent. Since 2009, the supreme court has affirmed that sterilised and vaccinated dogs must be returned to their localities. In 2014, it said that “stray dogs have the right to live” and that compassion toward all living things was a “constitutional value” in animal welfare law.Rahul Gandhi, the opposition Congress leader, called the revised court order a “progressive step toward balancing animal welfare and public safety”.Soofi said: “The sounds of Delhi are full of dogs barking. Their barks and howls are part of the night music of the city. They are integral to the texture of Delhi, to its very soul. If Delhi lost its street dogs, something essential would disappear.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaDogsAnimalsSouth and central AsiaPetsnewsShareReuse this content"

Combined with developing areas of low pressure, this triggered a succession of torrential downpours.Last Friday more than 300 people were killed after cloudbursts – episodes in which hourly rainfall exceeds 100mm – struck mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and India. In Buner district, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 150mm was recorded in just one hour. The downpours unleashed destructive flash floods that swept through valleys and villages carrying rocks and debris.More than 240 people were killed in that single event alone, making it the most catastrophic episode of the season so far. Since the onset of the monsoon in late May, Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority estimates that nearly 750 people have died.Farther south, Mumbai also endured extreme rainfall over the last week. Between 15 and 19 August, parts of the city recorded 837mm of rain – comparable to the annual average for southern England – leading to widespread and prolonged flooding. At least 21 people were killed, among them a man who was electrocuted after wading into flood waters containing a live wire.View image in fullscreenPeople wade through flood water in a street in Mumbai.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPATransport was severely disrupted, with roads waterlogged, train services halted leaving hundreds stranded on platforms, and numerous flights cancelled or diverted. With the Mithi River close to bursting its banks, hundreds of residents in low-lying neighbourhoods nearby were evacuated to higher ground.Elsewhere, the heatwave that gripped much of Europe for more than a week has finally broken, replaced by severe thunderstorms. On Wednesday and Thursday about 500,000 lightning strikes were detected across the continent, most of them over southern France, Italy and the Balkans.Italy bore the brunt of the storms, which were fuelled by an area of low pressure moving in from over the unusually warm Mediterranean, allowing moist unstable air to clash with the hot air mass that had built during the heatwave. Downpours from the storms triggered landslides, uprooted trees and blocked roads, and in Sicily rivers burst their banks, sweeping away cars. One person remains missing.Explore more on these topicsPakistanWeather trackerIndiaExtreme weatherSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

MPs call hypocrisy as former minister rails against system he expandedFri 22 Aug 2025 14.12 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 14.32 EDTShareRobert Jenrick had been migration minister for just a few days in 2022 when he gave a broadcast interview that could easily have been given by a minister in the current government.“Suella Braverman [the former home secretary] and her predecessor, Priti Patel, were procuring more hotels,”he told Sky News. “What I have done in my short tenure is ramp that up and procure even more. Because November, historically, has been one of the highest months of the year for migrants illegally crossing the Channel.”He went on to add: “I would never demonise people coming to this country in pursuit of a better life. And I understand and appreciate our obligation to refugees.”It was a very different Jenrick who showed up in Epping last weekend at the site of prolonged protests outside the Bell hotel, which houses asylum seekers.“Great to be with peaceful, patriotic protesters in Epping today,” heposted on X. “People are right to be fed up of illegal migration. And the crime and billions being wasted because of it.”Labour condemns Robert Jenrick’s visit to rally attended by far-right activistRead moreJenrick’s inflammatory visit to Epping, where he waspictured close to a well-known far-right activist, showed why he is – in some ways – one of the most effective members of the shadow cabinet, but also the political risks of his sometimes controversial public appearances.Supporters argue that no one else in the shadow cabinet is so adept at seizing the political initiative.They point to his much-discussed recent social media videos, including one of himaccosting fare dodgerson the London underground, as evidence of his success. And they add his appearance in Epping, where not even the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has sought to go, shows he is one of a small number of Conservatives able to outmanoeuvre his populist rightwing opponents.“It’s incredibly difficult for us to get attention right now,” said one Conservative MP. “If all of the shadow cabinet were doing what Jenrick is doing, that would be great.”Another said: “There’s much noise around Reform right now. Any noise from a Tory perspective is good.”Others, however, are accusing him of rank hypocrisy.In an unusual personal attack on a Conservative politician, Reform publisheda series of X postsaccusing him of having “boasted” about opening more asylum hotels while in government.Meanwhile, severalConservativessay they are uneasy about Jenrick’s tactics and accuse him of being more interested in lining up a leadership bid than helping his party.“It is hard to take him seriously,” said one Tory MP. “The reservation is that he’s notNigel Farage, and he will never be Nigel Farage.”Another said: “The challenge for leadership hopefuls like Jenrick is that he presided over an immigration policy that increased the use of hotels, which is why Reform are now focusing their attacks on him.“We also have the likes of [fellow Conservative MPs] Danny Kruger, Nick Timothy and Katie Lam who advised successive prime ministers and home secretaries now behaving as though they are clean of the past and have the answers. It doesn’t fool anyone.”View image in fullscreenJenrick’s visit to a Bell hotel protest showed why he is one of the most effective members of the shadow cabinet, but also the political risks of his controversial public appearances.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAJenrick’s difficulty in being taken seriously as a rightwing agitator, after years in government as a supporter of Rishi Sunak, mirrors the wider challenge facing the party in shaking off the legacy of 14 years in power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A recent Conservative social media post criticising the “freebies and perks” given to asylum seekers arriving in the UKwas met with scornby many of its own MPs.On a leaked Tory WhatsApp chat, MP Lewis Cocking said: “This makes us look silly as we gave them all this too, which is why we are in the mess we are in today.”The Guardian view on Conservative asylum policy: the moderate Tory tradition faces extinction | EditorialRead moreRob Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said: “Going big on the issue makes sense on the surface in that salience of it is high and Labour’s poll figures are bad too.“But it is and always has been Farage’s core issue. So their recent behaviour is very much ‘Nigel is right, don’t vote for him.’“Jenrick showing up at that hotel may work as a campaign image for the coming Tory leadership contest but it also makes it more likely that whoever wins that contest takes over a ship headed rapidly to the seabed.”Some say that by attacking asylum seekers so aggressively, the party risks emboldening the far right and undermining the entire idea of granting asylum.A recent studypublished in the British Journal of Political Science found attacks by mainstream politicians on migration were far more powerful in changing public attitudes towards migrants than ones from the hard-right.The researchers found that “statements by mainstream politicians lead to more norm-erosion than similar statements by radical-right politicians”.Those concerns are shared by some anti-racism campaigners. Lewis Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, recently said: “Jenrick is fanning the flames of the far right by chasingReform UKvotes. He’s giving confidence to known fascists.”None of this troubles those close to Jenrick, however, who believe that even being pictured at the same rally as a former British National Party strategist can be turned to their advantage.“At this stage in the game, controversy is good,” said one Jenrick ally. “Making controversy on a point where we are saying what the public want us to say is more than a net benefit – much more.”Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickConservativesReform UKNigel FarageMigrationImmigration and asylumanalysisShareReuse this content"

We continued to have national mobilisation plans in place to respond should the position change.”Meanwhile, councils across the country controlled by Labour, the Conservatives and Reform UK areinvestigatingwhether theycould pursue legal challengesagainst asylum hotels.This follows a judgegranting Epping Forest councila temporary injunction on Tuesday that blocked asylum seekers frombeing housed at the Bell hotel in Essex.On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers were working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoided creating problems for other areas.The home secretary said: “That is the reason for theHome Officeappeal in this case, to ensure that, going forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way right across the country – without creating problems for other areas and local councils.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that people had “every right” to protest over asylum hotels in their areas. While the number of asylum seekers rose in Labour’s first year, the new data shows they are still far below the 2023 peak, when the Conservatives were in government.In a letter dated 18 August seen by the Guardian to the home secretary, the Broxbourne Conservative MP Lewis Cocking said residents were “understandably concerned at the prospect of an influx of unvetted men from barbaric cultures and particularly how this will impact the safety of women and children locally”.He asked Cooper to guarantee that if the Bell hotel in Epping were to close, asylum seekers from there would not be sent to the Delta Marriott hotel in his constituency, which currently accommodates asylum seeker families. Broxbourne council is considering a similar legal challenge to the one launched by Epping Forest council to try to get the hotel shut down.Labour has pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of this parliament in 2029.Cooper said Labour had taken “crucial steps” in the past year towards this by cutting the asylum backlog and money spent on the asylum system, increasing returns of asylum seekers whose applications had failed, and overhauling appeals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His “general pattern” was “of only being prepared to admit that which was established by documentary evidence (which he had carefully studied), and even then only to the minimum extent shown”.She said there had been no conspiracy to lie, and the conspiracy claim did not have a “proper foundation”.Noel Clarke claimed he was a victim. Twenty-six witnesses painted a very different pictureRead moreKatharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, said of the outcome: “The judge ruled, in extremely clear language, that the Guardian’s reporting was substantially true, and our belief that the reporting was in the public interest was undoubtedly reasonable.“This judgment is a deserved victory for those women who suffered because of the behaviour ofNoel Clarke. Going to court is difficult and stressful, yet more than 20 women agreed to testify in the high court, refusing to be bullied or intimidated.“This is also a landmark judgment for Guardian journalism, and for investigative journalism in Britain. It was important to fight this case. This was a deeply researched investigation by some of the Guardian’s best reporters, who worked diligently and responsibly. The judgment is clear that our investigation was thorough and fair, a template for public interest journalism.“I hope today will give encouragement to other women in similar situations who have been too fearful to raise their voices for fear of the consequences.”3:35Noel Clarke loses libel case against Guardian over sexual misconduct investigation – videoIn her judgment, Steyn said: “There has been much reference to an ‘anonymous email campaign’ making false allegations against Mr Clarke. If there was such a ‘campaign’ – and it seems Bafta may have received some vitriolic anonymous emails – it was not something to which any of the witnesses were party.” While one or two of them wrote anonymously to Bafta, “the matters they raised were true”.She said Clarke’s case that there was an unlawful conspiracy “was born of necessity, in the face of the large body of witnesses giving evidence against him”.“There has been no conspiracy to lie. In the absence of a conspiracy, Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses – none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come to court to lie is inherently implausible.”Clarke, 49, had said he would seek £70m in damages if successful.The Guardian relied on testimony from almost 30 people, 26 of whom spoke in court in London about their experiences of working with the former star of Doctor Who. Many said they had been directly affected by Clarke, while others said they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour.The writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy sued Guardian News & Media (GNM) over seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in whichmore than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.The judge found that Viner, along with other Guardian editors and reporters, believed publication was in the public interest, which was a reasonable belief.The allegations against Clarke were made up of the following elements:There were strong grounds to believe that,over 15 years, he had used his power to prey on and harass female colleagues.He sometimes bullied female colleagues.He engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping.He engaged in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments.He was involved in professional misconduct.He took and shared explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.The judge found that “instances of each of those elements have been established”.In closing submissions, Gavin Millar KC, for the Guardian, said Clarke had been forced to come up with an “elaborate conspiracy theory” to try to rebut the “overwhelming evidence” against him.Clarke denied all the allegations and variously claimed that his accusers were lying, embellishing incidents, motivated by grudges and that there was a conspiracy against him.Steyn said: “While Mr Clarke was willing to desist from making sexual allusions and advances and engaging in sexual talk with those who unequivocally spurned him, he clearly felt the onus was on such a person to object to his behaviour and he regarded anyone who was unwilling to acquiesce in his ‘sexual banter’ as haughty and hostile.”She said she accepted one aspect of Clarke’s evidence, namely “his belief that he is not what the Guardian ‘branded’ him”. “Although I find that he has been untruthful about most of the allegations in his efforts to salvage his career, his initial response that ‘some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise’ was true.“Even when his actions have been calculated and deliberate, Mr Clarke has tended to be oblivious to their impact, regarding his own behaviour as merely being ‘naughty’, ‘cheeky’, ‘teasing’ or within his rights as a director or producer.“In addition, he does not see himself as reflected in the articles because there is a kinder, more generous side to him. But that does not detract from the conclusions I have reached.”She found that in one sex scene involving Clarke, an actor known as “Penelope” was naked from the waist down, and this was “not necessary” for the purposes of the footage taken. She said: “I have not found that the requirement for ‘Penelope’ to be naked below the waist for the filming of the sex scene was introduced for Mr Clarke’s sexual gratification, but he did then take advantage of it for that purpose.”Discussing another witness, she said: “The strong impression that I gained is that Mr Clarke felt that he could sexually proposition any woman he wanted, as reflected in his evidence that he has ‘been turned down a million times’, even allowing for the obvious hyperbole – regardless of the circumstances.“He had no understanding of how pressuring such conduct could be, or how uncomfortable it could make young women, in subordinate roles to him, feel while performing their jobs.”Of the Guardian’s reporting, the judge said the claim that journalists covering the investigation became a party to a conspiracy and knowingly deceived Viner and others to secure publication of known falsehoods was “wholly unfounded and meritless”.“It is readily apparent that none of the reporters and editors involved had any interest in publishing any allegation that they did not believe to be true, or sufficiently verified and corroborated to be fit and ready for publication.”Of individual witnesses’ accounts, Steyn said the Guardian had established that Clarke “revealed naked photographs” of a woman known as “Ivy” without her consent and shared them.Gina Powell, who worked at Clarke’s Unstoppable Film and TV production company between 2014 and 2017, alleges the actor groped her in a lift, exposed himself to her in a car, and brushed off concerns about his sexual behaviour towards other women. She also told the court that he kept a hard drive of naked pictures of others. The judge described Powell as “an impressive and compelling witness” who “demonstrated admirable bravery and integrity”. Steyn said she had “no hesitation in finding that she was an honest, reliable witness, who did not overstate or exaggerate any of the matters which she addressed”.Joanne Hayes, who in 2004 worked with Clarke on Doctor Who as a costume assistant, claims that, while alone with her in his trailer on set, Clarke told her he liked girls with long hair, adding words to the effect that it was “nice to have something to hold on to when I do them from behind”. Steyn said Hayes “gave truthful, careful and reliable evidence” and had “no reason to come forward and lie”.In a statement, Clarke said: “Today’s result is disappointing. For almost five years, I have fought against a powerful media outlet and its extensive legal teams over inaccurate and damaging reporting.“These stories started via anonymous emails portraying me as a monster to attract attention and outrage. The goal was to damage my career, and they succeeded.“I have never claimed to be perfect. But I am not the person described in these articles. Overnight I lost everything. The media outlet didn’t just ruin my life; they ripped through my family’s also.”Clarke thanked the “team who stood beside me throughout”, including his family, “who never stopped believing there was something worth fighting for”.At the conclusion of the trial, Philip Williams, representing Clarke, argued that his client was the victim of an industry attempting a “purge” after the #MeToo movement. He highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series and Carry On films as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate”, and said the treatment of Clarke “represents illiterate historical revisionism and completely ignores any nuance or context”.Millar, for the Guardian, said Clarke had “made unpersuasive but revealing efforts to normalise and/or excuse conduct that most people would find – and would have found, whether 10 or 20 years ago – offensive and unacceptable”.Steyn’s judgment means Clarke, who said his career had collapsed as a result of the articles, faces a hefty legal bill and may also be required to pay the bulk of the Guardian’s legal costs.The trial was a rare case of #MeToo-type allegations published by a UK newspaper going to trial. A victory for Clarke would have been likely to make the press rethink future reporting on such issues.After the publication of the Guardian’s first report on Clarke, Bafta suspended a lifetime achievement award it had given him the previous week and ITV declined to broadcast the final episode of the thriller Viewpoint, in which he was starring.Additionally, Sky cancelled the award-winning police show Bulletproof, which was created by and starred Clarke. He alsoleft Unstoppable Film and TV, the company he co-founded and which produced Bulletproof.Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianNoel ClarkeNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesSexual harassmentnewsShareReuse this content"

He says the whole conversation around carnival, which costs more than £11m a year to police but is worth about£400m to the local economy, needs to change.View image in fullscreenIan Comfort wants the carnival, which is worth about £400m to the local economy, to receive guaranteed funding for five years.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“Should the government recognise carnival as much as it recognises New Year’s Eve? For many, and that sounds very odd, but for many in the Caribbean community, carnival is just like Christmas,” said Comfort, who wants guaranteed funding for five years.In June, it emerged that the annual celebration could be in jeopardy without “urgent funding” from the government, according to a leaked letter from its organisers.City Hall, Kensington and Chelsea council and Westminster city council together provided £958,000 for the event after pleas from organisers for support. Council leaders, who are struggling with shrinking budgets, were clear that the money was for this year only.Comfort said he was surprised by the stance of the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, that “carnival wasn’t a cultural matter for her” after he appealed to her for assistance.He wants core funding, either from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport or the Arts Council, which only gives money to groups performing at the event, and supplementary sponsorship.View image in fullscreenPartying in the street in 2023: the carnival costs more than £11m a year to police.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverBut negative press coverage around the event is offputting to sponsors, and the last 12 months has seen a lot of bad headlines.Last September, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Matt Twist told a committee at City Hall that his biggest fear was a “mass casualty event” caused by a crush after the number of police officers was reduced by 1200.Earlier this month, the Conservative leader at the London assembly, Susan Hall, said City Hall should become the official organiser of Notting Hill carnival, while warning of the “prospect of a Hillsborough-type” incident.Comfort dismissed Hall’s worries, saying: “Publishing a report two weeks before a carnival is just political posturing”. However, he admitted the event was in a “difficult situation” when it came to attracting sponsorship.He said: “Last year, the Met published the crime stats for carnival, they put it out almost like a leaderboard coming out during the day. It was incredibly unhelpful, if I put it politely. Any sponsor who only ever sees the crime figures for carnival doesn’t want their name attached to carnival.”View image in fullscreen‘For many in the Caribbean community, carnival is just like Christmas,’ said Ian Comfort.Photograph: Anselm Ebulue/The GuardianLast year, there were 889 reported crimes across the event, with 353 arrests. The most shocking incident was themurder of Cher Maximen, who was stabbed and killed after being caught up in a fight during Notting Hill carnival’s family day.Comfort said he considered whether or not he could continue in his role after Maximen’s death but was not sure if it could have been prevented.“The question, is what could we do about that?” he said. “I’ve seen the body-worn footage from the police officers in that area when that happened: there were police officers all around when that happened. It didn’t happen in a dark corner, somewhere in carnival.“So can we stop that sort of thing? The answer is probably no.”Comfort insists this year the event will be safe, with a new stewarding system to help with the flow of festivalgoers and large screens to direct revellers if it becomes too crowded in certain spots.He and the millions of attenders will be hoping for a smooth event to help secure the future of the biggest festival of its kind in Europe – one that serves as an annual celebration of Black British culture and attracts people from around the world.Explore more on these topicsNotting Hill carnivalLondonArts fundingMetropolitan policeFestivalsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

After the first interview session, Blanche said “the Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time”.The appropriate time turned out to be just before 3pm ET on Friday, 22 August when the department published redacted transcripts of Blanche’s interviews with Maxwell.Ghislaine Maxwell transcripts: what we know at a glanceRead moreWhile the transcripts span hundreds of pages, their contents are unlikely to satisfy those who want to know more about Trump’s past association with Epstein – let alone those who believe that the deceased financier was part of a powerful cabal of the global elite preying on young girls.Maxwell’s comments on Trump in the transcripts largely played into his efforts to distance himself from Epstein. If anything, the transcripts revealed Maxwell’s ongoing sense of aggrieved entitlement – as well as Blanche’s intense focus onBill Clinton, who like Trump had past dealings with Epstein.“I think [Trump and Epstein] were friendly like people are in social settings. I don’t – I don’t think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the president in any of – I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance,” said Maxwell, who had been Epstein’s on-again, off-again girlfriend.“I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell also said, alluding to Epstein’s abuse of women and teen girls whom he’d met under the guise of them providing massages.Maxwell was asked whether she had heard Epstein or anybody say that Trump had done anything inappropriate with masseuses, or anybody, in their world. “Absolutely never, in any context,” Maxwell said.Such comments would be music to Trump’s ears as he has long played down the extent of his social contacts with Epstein. Maxwell, who shortly after being interviewed by Blanche was moved from her Florida jail to a much lower security one in Texas, was also asked whether she remembered if Trump had contributed to a birthday book for Epstein.The Wall Street Journal hadreportedthat Trump sent a “bawdy” birthday letter to Epstein in 2003 featuring a drawing of a nude woman. Trump has filed suit over this reporting. “I do not remember,” Maxwell said of the incident.Blanche repeatedly asked Maxwell about the Clintons, who, like Trump, have also denied knowing of any of Epstein’s crimes.When asked whether she knew if Bill Clinton had ever received a massage, Maxwell said “I don’t believe he did.” During the second interview day, Blanche asked Maxwell whether Epstein had a separate relationship with Clinton outside of the former president’s philanthropic work. He also asked whether Epstein had “any sort of visit, dealings or – associated withHillary Clinton?” Maxwell said: “I would say no.”Did Maxwell know whether “Epstein ever did any business transactions with the Clintons?” she was also asked. But if Blanche was looking to incriminate the Clintons, Maxwell came up short. Just like she had with Trump.Ghislaine Maxwell’s transfer to a ‘country club’ prison is outrageous | Margaret SullivanRead moreThe true made-for-tabloid moments in Maxwell’s interviews in the transcripts dealt more with aspects of Epstein’s personal life and her posh asides. “He started doing testosterone and that altered his character. And I believe that started in the late 90s,” Maxwell said of Epstein. “He became more aggressive.”As time went on, Epstein started surrounding himself with more people, including more masseuses. Maxwell said she didn’t know he was having sexual relations with them.Blanche pushed back, saying: “I mean, you had to know at that point that there was something going on beyond just, he really needed to get massaged.”Maxwell said that was a “very fair question” but noted that the masseuse he’d seen most frequently was in her 40s. “The second thing is that – is, he told me he didn’t – he had difficulty having an erection, and I believed him.”She said Epstein had gotten into business “where he looked for stolen money”. Epstein had a girlfriend, the daughter of a billionaire, who had some money stolen. “And for some reason this woman introduced Jeffrey, and Jeffrey, I think that’s how that business started. That’s what I remember.”Epstein’s potential links to the world of espionage are a staple of conspiracy theories surrounding him. As for whether Epstein had ties to law enforcement agencies or intelligence operatives, Maxwell said: “I think he would’ve bragged about it to me as a show off, because he could be a show off. And if he wasn’t, he might have dropped it like he was cool. And I don’t think – I don’t remember him doing either.”Maxwell said there was a caveat. “Before I met him finding money, I think he may have suggested that there was some people who helped him, but that’s the only context that I recall that in.” Blanche asked what she meant.“He showed me a photograph that he had with some African warlords or something that he told me. And, you know, I get – I don’t remember if I – that’s what I interpreted the – like that kind of thing or whether it was something like that.“That’s the only actual active memory I have of something nefarious – not nefarious. I don’t even know if it was nefarious, but covert, I suppose would be the word.”During various points of the interview, Maxwell also found ways to point to her prim and proper upbringing. In discussing how she felt duped by Epstein, she said: “I’m not stupid. I’m very bright. I’ve had an excellent education. I traveled all over the world.”Maxwell also said that she did not think Epstein killed himself in prison but did not think someone from outside of prison had him killed.“In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That’s about the going rate,” Maxwell said.Maxwell moved to her new minimum security prison camp just a few days after her sit-down with Blanche ended.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinHillary ClintonBill ClintonanalysisShareReuse this content"

But how long can this celebration last?Fed chair Jerome Powell signals interest rate cuts amid Trump attacksRead moreWhile Wall Street cheered the biggest headline from the speech by the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, Powell also delivered a reality check on where interest rates could settle in the longer term.“We cannot say for certain where rates will settle out over the longer run, but their neutral level may now be higher than during the 2010s,” said Powell.In other words: even if the Fed does start cutting interest rates again this year, they may not fall back to their pre-pandemic levels. It’s a signal, despite the short-term optimism on potential rate cuts, that the Fed’s long-term outlook is more unstable.“Markets might be ahead of their skis on how aggressive the Fed is going to be in reducing interest rates, because the neutral rate might be higher than some believe,” Ryan Sweet, an economist at OxfordEconomics, said.Higher rates means borrowing money for loans, such as mortgages, will be more expensive. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was just under 3% in 2021, when interest rates were near zero.Now the average mortgagerateis closer to 6.7%. Paired with home prices at near-record highs, elevated mortgages mean many Americans will continue to struggle to purchase a home.Although Trump has beenpushingthe Fed for months to decrease rates to 1%, claiming that Powell is “hurting the housing industry very badly”, it seems unlikely that rates will return to such a level any time soon.The Fed is trying to achieve a Goldilocks balance. Rates that are too high risk unemployment, while rates that are too low could mean higher inflation. Policymakers are searching for a “neutral” level, where everything is just right.Many economists believed the central bank was close to achieving this balance before Trump started his second term. In summer 2022, as inflation scaled its highest levels in a generation, the Fed started raising rates, at the risk of hurting the labor market, in an attempt to get inflation down to 2%.Rates rose to about 5.3% in less than two years, but the jobs market remained strong. Unemployment was still at historically low even as inflation came down. Although some economists had feared rapidly increasing rates would throw theUS economyinto a recession, instead the Fed appeared to achieve what is known as a “soft landing”.But things were thrown into a tailspin when Trump returned to office, armed with campaign promises to enact a full-blown trade war against the US’s key trading partners.The president has long argued that tariffs would boost American manufacturing and set the stage for better trade deals. “Tariffs don’t cause inflation. They cause success,” Trump declared back in January, acknowledging that there might be “some temporary, short-term disruption”.But so far, success has been limited. Economistsdoubtthe policies will generate a manufacturing renaissance, and Trump’s trade war has inspired new commercial alliances that exclude the US.All the while, US consumers are starting to see higher prices due to Trump’s tariffs.At Jackson Hole on Friday, Powell said tariffs had started to push some prices up. In June and July, inflation was 2.7% – up 0.4 percentage points since April, when Trump first announced the bulk of his tariffs.This is still only a modest increase in price growth, but the bulk of the White House’s highest tariffs only went into effect in early August. Fed policymakers are waiting to see whether Trump’s aggressive trade strategy will cause a one-time shift in price levels – or if the effects will continue.The once strong labor market has grown sluggish. Though there are fewer job openings, there are also fewer people looking for jobs. Powell called it “a curious kind of balance” where “both the supply of and demand for workers” have slowed. He noted that the balance was unstable and could eventually tip over, prompting more layoffs and a rise in unemployment.Graph chartThis instability in the labor market has made Fed officials more open to a rate cut. Powell pointed to a slacking in consumer spending and weaker gross domestic product (GDP), which suggests an overall slowdown in economic activity.Although it set the stage for a rate cut as soon as next month, Powell’s speech was far from optimistic.“In this environment, distinguishing cyclical developments from trends, or structural developments is difficult,” he said. “Monetary policy can work to stabilise cyclical fluctuations but can do little to alter structural changes.”From Powell, who is typically diplomatic and reserved in his public statements, this seemed to be a careful warning: when executive policies destabilise the economy, the Fed can only do so much to limit the damage.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyEconomicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Levies on steel, aluminum and autos will remain in place.The announcement comes one day after Carney andDonald Trumpspoke on the phone.In recent months, the US has upended global trade as it seeks to bring manufacturing jobs back and sign more favourable deals with trading partners.Carney said despite the global turmoil and American tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, lumber and energy, 85% of Canada’s trade with its southern neighbour was tariff-free.“Let’s be absolutely clear: Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States, and while it’s different from what we had before, it is still better than that of any other country,” he said. “As we work to address outstanding trade issues with the US, it is important we do everything we can to preserve this unique advantage for Canadian workers and their families.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Washington and Ottawa had long been positioned as close allies on trade and defense.Canada has imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods three times. Those counter-tariffs covered $60bn worth of consumer goods. Canada’s federal government also imposed tariffs on American-made cars. The governing Liberal party has also pledged government support for sectors disproportionately affected by American economic protectionism, and in an effort to reduce Canada’s reliance on the US as a trading partner.Despite hints of a detente in recent weeks, including talks between Carney and Trump this week, Canada and the US failed to reach a set of terms by Trump’s 1 August deadline that would reshape a longer-standing relationship. In late July, Carney said Canada was unlikely to convince Trump, who sees tariffs as a useful and powerful cudgel, to drop all levies on Canadian goods.In a statement, the White House called the move “long overdue” and said Carney’s overture paved the way for “continuing our discussions with Canada on the administration’s trade and national security concerns”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump tariffsTariffsMark CarneyDonald TrumpAmericasAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It is just getting started, according to the White House.An executive orderissuedin March sought to cancel all collective bargaining agreements for most federal employees, citing national security concerns – and remove collective bargaining rights from more than a million workers.While unions including the American Federation of Government Employees launched legal action as they challenged the move, obtaining an injunction, this wasin effect overruledearlier this month.Union contracts at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency andthe Department of Agriculturehave since been terminated. An estimated 400,000 have been affected,about 2.6% of unionized workersin the US.“I think that what this administration is doing is trying us as a test bed. If they are successful, I do believe that they’ll be coming after every labor organization in the US,” Everett Kelley, president of the AFGE, the largest federal labor union in the US, told the Guardian. “This is a fight for the very democracy of this country. This is a fight for every worker in America.“If Trump is successful in dismantling AFGE, there’s nothing to stop him from coming after every labor organization in the country, and we believe he will.”Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, said the recent appeals court decision “reaffirms that President Trump has the lawful executive authority to protect America’s interests, and may eliminate collective bargaining agreements in agencies engaged in national security functions”, adding: “The Trump administration looks forward to continued victory on the issue.”The AFGE, whichrepresents320,000 employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), received notice on 6 August – five days after the appeals court ruling – that union contracts would be terminated as a result.In astatementon the move, Doug Collins, secretary of veteran affairs, did not cite national security, but claimed cancelling the contracts would free up time and resources across the department.“There has not been a cancellation of union contracts on this scale in US history,” said Naveed Shah, political director of the veterans group Common Defense and a US Army veteran. “If the workers and veterans at the VA are not sacred enough to protect, then…every worker in the public and private sector should be concerned.”Shah warned that cancelling union contracts at the VA would make it harder for workers to advocate for their patients and have a safe workplace, thereby degrading the care veterans receive.“They have created division, anxiety and uncertainty in your daily life as a government employee,” said a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Queens, New York, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. “This attack on the working class in the government is just the first step.”Workers have won benefits and rights including the eight-hour workday, sick leave, workers’ compensation, fairness in promotions and the ability to raise concerns through labor unions, the nurse said.“With the administration’s actions, they’ve taken that away,” they added. “With this administration coming in and politicizing the workforce and demonizing the work and the employee, it has taken away from our ability to really give the best to our veterans.”The VA has long facedthreatsof cuts and services being contracted out to privatization, the nurse argued. “They’ve taken away the one entity that stood in front of the agency and held them to the standard, held them to the law, held them to the contract, and was also the whistleblower on all of the things that were wrong,” they added. “This administration has made a major step towards diminishing the care that the vets get. The vets deserve a certain level of care. That’s why the VA was created.”‘Canary in the coalmine’On 8 August – seven days after the appeals court ruling – workers at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received notice the agency was terminating all collective bargaining agreements with unions representing workers.“This is the greatest attack on labor rights since the Patco strike,” when about 12,000 air traffic controllers walked out in 1981, and Ronald Reaganrespondedby firing them and dissolving the union, said Justin Chen, president of the AFGE Council 238, which represents about 8,000 workers at the EPA. “And this is quite a bit worse.”He added: “We’re just the canary in the coalmine for the rest of the working class essentially.”The union is looking into additional legal avenues to protect their members, Chen said, as its lawsuit against the executive order is ongoing after the appeals court lifted the injunction.AFGE is currently backing a bill in Congress, theProtect America’s Workforce Act, that would restore collective bargaining rights to federal workers. The bill has 222 cosponsors in the House, including seven Republicans.In an Aprilmemo, theChief Human Capital Officers Council( stated that collective bargaining agreements should not be terminated until the conclusion of litigation, or the agency provided further guidance. Attorneys representing the Trump administration hadcitedthe memo to judges that agencies would wait to terminate the contracts.The office of management and budget did not respond to requests for comment on why union contracts were cancelled while the litigation over the executive order is ongoing. The Office of Personnel Managementdeferredto their director’s blog post.“The administration, they know us as a threat to their authoritarianism essentially, they know we are the ones who represent workers who are civil servants who pledge to both uphold the constitution and serve the mission of their agencies, which is supposed to be politically agnostic and serve the public,” added Chen. “It’s very obvious that this administration, despite them trying to portray themselves as some sort of defender of the working man, they attack popular programs like Medicaid, they attack popular agencies like the EPA and the VA.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS unionsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Economists have also warned that the problems risk the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, making tax and spending “missteps”.The OBR forecasts are key to the budget process, as they are used to judge the headroom the chancellor has against herself-imposed fiscal rules, and form the basis for her tax and spending decisions. Its work is also closely watched by financial markets. This can affect the cost of borrowing the government needs to help fund public services.The ONS, which produces figures on a range of indicators including economic growth, inflation and unemployment that are used by financial markets and government agencies, is struggling withmounting problemsas it has delayed or cancelled several of its releases.Its labour force survey (LFS) – the official measure of employment in the UK – has been beset with problems amid a collapse in response rates. Only this week, it postponed the release of retail sales data due on Friday for two weeks “to allow for further quality assurance”. Household wealth data has also been downgraded and is no longer treated as “official” because of quality concerns.The longer the data quality problems persist at the ONS, the more acute the challenge becomes, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian. One said: “We are, to a significant extent, flying blind on major areas such as the jobs market.”They added that while other datasets might offer indications of the health of employment in the UK, nothing could replace the fundamental role of the LFS.This echoes public criticism of the ONS by leading economists and officials, including the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, who said earlier this year: “It is critical from our point of view that these issues are addressed.”An economist with close knowledge of the OBR’s processes said there were difficulties in forecasting the path of the debt-to-GDP ratio because the official figures had been frequently subject to revision.They added: “Knowing what is happening in labour market, producer prices, etc, is critical. Chaos at the ONS will have a material impact on the government policy path via ONS projections.”In April, the head of the OBR, Richard Hughes,told the Commons Treasury committeethe forecaster was relying on a “panoply” of alternative data because of quality issues and frequent revisions in key ONS figures.“Ideally, what we want to do is have a snapshot of where the economy just was before we try to figure out where it is going over the next five years. Instead, at the moment, we get an incomplete picture from different points in time from what we get from the ONS,” he said.The ONS has facedharsh public criticism in recent monthsover “deep-seated problems”, adding to the pressure on the Newport-based number-crunching office to improve its data gathering. Earlier this month, Darren Tierney, a former top Cabinet Office official, wasbrought in as its new chief executive.No date has yet been set by Reeves for the autumn budget. The chancellor must give 10 weeks’ notice before a fiscal event for the OBR to produce its forecasts. However, in reality it maintains near-constant monitoring of the economic picture.Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at the consultancy CapitalEconomics, said inadequate data could lead Reeves to cut spending or raise taxes unnecessarily at the autumn budget.“If the OBR is unable to get an accurate read on supply, that could lead to fiscal policy missteps.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ONS has said itslatest jobs market figuresinclude the full effects of improvements in data collection and sampling methods introduced from January 2024. However, efforts are continuing to further improve response rates. It has previously warned theprocess could take until 2027.Jagjit Chadha, a Cambridge university economist and former director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said there was “considerable dysfunction in Newport”, partly as the agency had been pushed to make cost savings.“The ONS is a bit of shower at the moment,” he added.While warning the problems could result in “the wrong policies. With fiscal policy overly tightened”, he said heightened uncertainty meant Reeves should proceed with caution. “While it’s useful for policymakers to blame the ONS if they get things wrong, should you be driving a car with mechanical problems as fast as you’re trying to drive it? The answer is no.”A spokesperson for the OBR referred the Guardian to its previous comments in March.A spokesperson for the ONS said: “We have been open and transparent about the issues with some ONS statistics. A strategic plan is already in action, and with new senior leaders now in place, we are working closely with key users and urgently refocusing resources on our core economic outputs.“Revisions to population statistics are unrelated and are due to unprecedented levels of international migration seen over recent years and short-term volatility which results from change.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “This government is building a stronger economy for a renewed Britain, kickstarting economic growth based on rigorous and robust analysis of the economic and fiscal challenges we face.“HMT uses a vast range of data sources to support policymaking. We fully support the ONS’s plan to improve their core economic statistics and are working closely with their new leadership team.”Explore more on these topicsOffice for National StatisticsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityRachel ReevesBudgetEconomicsTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the London Stadium emptying out long before full time, patience worn thin by the latest in a long line of humiliations. It is one young fan mounting a solo pitch invasion after being driven to despair by his side’s inability to defend set pieces. It is a new £15m goalkeeper who cannot catch crosses and, as much as Potter will plead for calm, it is that the only positive for West Ham wasChelseapretty much declaring after going 5-1 up with over half an hour to play.Chelsea had run through at will, cutting West Ham’s execrable back five to shreds, João Pedro and Estêvão Willian playing a different sport from every individual in claret and blue. Whatever the gulf in class, though, there can be no excuse for a performance so lacking in heart and a team so incapable of doing the basics.‘I have to do better’: Potter admits he’s under pressure after Chelsea defeatRead moreThere is no hiding place for Potter, who has taken fewer points from his first 10 home games in thePremier Leaguethan any manager in West Ham’s history. He is already under pressure, already facing suggestions that he is in trouble after eight months in the job, although there is the awkward question of whether he is more symptom than cause. After all, the sense that Potter is the wrong fit at a club who tend to feed off ­emotion should not overlook the fact that this collapse owes much to years of West Ham’s owners making one bad decision after another on and off the pitch.Put it all together and Potter could be forgiven if he was pining for the days when he was struggling to make sense of life at Chelsea. He was bruised by his experience in west London, although the longer time has gone on the more it has become apparent that Chelsea were simply going through a period of transition. Their owners have built a seriously talented squad since ­firing ­Potter.Cole Palmer pulling out of this game with a groin injury just before ­kick off? It hardly mattered when manager Enzo Maresca was simply able to bring in Estêvão and watch the 18-year-old Brazilian ­prodigy rip West Ham apart with his speed and skill on just his first competitive start for Chelsea.View image in fullscreenEstêvão inspired Chelsea on his first start.Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesIt bordered on the absurd that Chelsea had fallen behind to a stunning early goal from Lucas Paquetá. The theory that fatigue will be one of the biggest challenges for Maresca’s side after their Club World Cup exertions had been given strength by Palmer exiting the warm-up early. It meant a rejig in an attack led by Liam Delap – Estêvão came in on the right, João Pedro played as the No 10 and Pedro Neto moved to the left – and the late alterations initially had West Ham thinking that their luck was about to turn after losing to Sunderland on the opening weekend.Yet the optimism faded soon after Estêvão lost possession in the sixth minute and watched Paquetá send a swerving shot past Robert Sánchez from 25 yards. Chelsea needed less than 10 minutes to respond in the manner of world champions, Neto’s corner headed on by Marc Cucurella for João Pedro to shake off Aaron Wan-Bissaka and equalise. They were soon ahead, Paquetá squandering possession before João Pedro crossed for Neto to convert, and the game had run away from Potter’s side by the time Estêvão sliced through West Ham’s left side before crossing for Enzo Fernández to make it 3-1 in the 34th minute.It became painful for Potter, who has won two home games since replacing Julen Lopetegui in January. West Ham, who have conceded eight in their first two games, are relegation candidates. Midfield reinforcements cannot come quickly enough. Moisés Caicedo and Fernández ran over James Ward-Prowse and Tomas Soucek. Max Kilman, Jean-Clair Todibo and Nayef Aguerd all looked like expensive mistakes in central defence.West Ham crumbled. They have no leadership. Estêvão’s assist for Fernández was followed by the camera cutting to David Sullivan, West Ham’s largest shareholder. The mood in the stands was a curious mix of anger and apathy. Many have lost patience with Sullivan after an ­uninspired transfer window, blaming him for the club’s shoddy recruitment. There were more boos when the 33-year-old Callum ­Wilson replaced the 32-year-old Niclas ­Füllkrug up front.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It got worse. Mads Hermansen flapped at a corner and gifted a fourth goal to Caicedo. West Ham cannot defend their box. The next corner brought more confusion, Hermansen bullied before Trevoh Chalobah scored the fifth. It turned ugly. Fans near the dugout aimed furious gestures at Potter and one young supporter ran on the pitch. Attempts to tackle the boy were complicated by an older fan breaking through security and confronting stewards , capping off a night off utter embarrassment for West Ham.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He was 84.Turcotte’s family said through his longtime business partner and friend Leonard Lusky that the Canada-born jockey died of natural causes Friday at his home in Drummond, New Brunswick.He won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness andBelmont Stakestwice each, most notably sweeping the three with Secretariat to end horse racing’s Triple Crown drought that dated to Citation in 1948. Secretariat’s record time of 2:24 in the Belmont, winning by 31 lengths, still stands 52 years later.“Ron was a great jockey and an inspiration to so many, both within and outside the racing world,” Lusky said. “While he reached the pinnacle of success in his vocation, it was his abundance of faith, courage, and kindness that was the true measure of his greatness.”Turcotte won more than 3,000 races over a nearly two-decade career that ended in 1978 when he fell off a horse early in a race and suffered injuries that made him paraplegic. Permanently Disabled Jockeys Fund chairman William J Punk called Turcotte one of the sport’s greatest champions and ambassadors and praised him for his advocacy and efforts to help fellow fallen riders.He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 1979.“The world may remember Ron as the famous jockey of Secretariat, but to us he was a wonderful husband, a loving father, grandfather, and a great horseman.” the Turcotte family said in a statement through Lusky.View image in fullscreenRon Turcotte poses next to a statue of him and Secretariat in Grand Falls, New Brunswick, Canada, in May 2023.Photograph: Stephen MacGillivray/APTurcotte was born in Drummond on 22 July 1941, as one of 12 children. He quit school to work as a lumberjack before moving to Toronto to get involved in horse racing, first as a hotwalker and then a jockey, becoming the leading rider at Woodbine Racetrack before rising to the Triple Crown level.Woodbine chairman Jim Lawson said Turcotte was “a true Canadian icon whose impact on horse racing is immeasurable”.“Ron carried himself with humility, strength and dignity,” Lawson said. “His legacy in racing, both here at Woodbine and around the world, will live forever.”Turcotte won the Preakness in 1965 aboard Tom Rolfe and the Derby in 1972 with Riva Ridge. But it was his time with Secretariat that made Turcotte a household name in racing, and he called it “love at first ride.”“He was the type of horse that you’ll never see again,” Turcotte said in 2023, nearly 50 years to the day since riding Secretariat in the Belmont. “He was doing something that you’ve never seen before and will probably never see again.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingKentucky DerbyPreakness StakesBelmont StakesUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Why lend it to Ozempic culture?Bryan Armen GrahamFrom Compton outsider to American nonpareil, she came to embody resistance to toxic norms. But her embrace of GLP-1 drugs feels like capitulation to ideals she once rejectedFri 22 Aug 2025 12.38 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.09 EDTShareWhen Serena Williams was featuredin a People magazine storyon Thursday morning discussing her 31lb weight loss, the rollout had all the hallmarks of an advertisement draped in the thin veil of an all-caps EXCLUSIVE.Vogue’s social channels amplifiedtheir own access, NBC’s Today showgave her a one-on-one segmentand Elle publisheda carefully packaged interviewin which Williams declared she wanted to break the stigma around weight-loss drugs, each of them in lockstep with what appeared to be a hard 9am press embargo. This vintageJill Smollerquadrafecta was not a spontaneous confessional; it was a coordinated media blitz pegged to theUS Open, the tentpole event of American tennis, which kicks off on Sunday in earnest.Yet for all the precision and polish, it was unmistakably a commercial. The product wasn’t just Williams’s refined physique, already the subject of months-long speculation among her 32 million followers across social media. It was a telehealth service called Ro – a company on whose board her husband, Alexis Ohanian, conveniently sits, a disclosure the press release at leastdid the courtesy of includingin a footnote – promoting access to GLP-1 weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound.US Open draw: Emma Raducanu faces tough route if she can beat qualifier in first roundRead moreWilliams isn’t merely dabbling in one-off spon con. Her partnership with Ro is a promised multiyear campaign across billboards, digital platforms and television spots. In the first of them shelooks into the cameraand says: “After kids, it’s the medicine my body needed.” Ro’s CEO, Zach Reitano, was explicit about why she was chosen: precisely because some will say she doesn’t need GLP-1s. “That’s why she’s perfect for it,” he explained. In other words, the point of putting Williams in the ad is to normalize weight-loss drugs as lifestyle products for people who aren’t typical patients.On Today, Williams presented herself as anything but a corner-cutter. “As an athlete and as someone that has done everything, I just couldn’t get my weight to where I needed to be at a healthy place, and believe me, I don’t take shortcuts,” she said. She recalled running and walking for hours after giving birth to her daughters, only to plateau at the same number on the scale. The Elle interview sharpened that story further: Williams spoke of 30,000-step days, four-hour summer training sessions and her coach raising concerns about her weight in the HBO documentary series Being Serena. “I needed to try something different,” she said. “Sometimes people do absolutely everything, and it doesn’t work.” Her message was clear: she had done the work, and the drug was merely the missing piece.The public response across tennis Twitter and entertainment blogs has generally been divided. Some fans expressed resignation:if even the greatest athlete of her generation needed medication to shed weight, what chance does anyone else have?Others were angry that a global sporting icon, oncecelebrated for defying toxic beauty standards, would lend her name to a pharmaceutical fad already criticized for being over-prescribed. And then there were those who shrugged that Williams had always represented the family business. Much like Taylor Swiftappearing on Travis Kelce’s podcastfeels less like happenstance than deft cross-promotion, Williams’s tie-up with Ro isn’t solely about personal health – it’s #couplegoals on a macro scale.Many saw Thursday’s collective messaging not as candor but as advertorial: personal struggle framed as stealth marketing. In an era when audiences are used to celebrities weaving mental-health confessions or fitness “journeys” into commercial deals, Williams’s campaign was interpreted less as openness than strategy. The insistence that GLP-1s aren’t an “easy way out” didn’t so much silence critics as underscore the broader worry: that even someone as disciplined as Williams needed pharmaceutical help to be deemed “healthy”, leaning in tothe very thinness culture she once resisted. To many of her admirers, this was more than a sponsorship deal – it felt like a diminishment of her athletic legacy, asuggestion that all the titles and training were still not enough in a society where appearance trumps achievement.That contrast is striking because Williams’s career was built on defiance and being the ultimate outsider. A Black Jehovah’s Witness from Compton, she kicked in the doors of a country club sport with beaded braids and an unyielding game, only to endure years of skepticism, mockery and outright racism. Yet she leveraged those pressures into dominance, winning 23 grand slam singles titles and redefining power, athleticism and relentlessness in women’s tennis. For millions of fans, she was proof that success did not require conforming to narrow ideals of beauty or femininity. She bent a sport and an industry to her will, embodying strength and resilience for generations of Black women who saw in her an avatar of possibility.View image in fullscreenSerena Williams spent almost the entirely of her 27-year career in professional tennis weathering the worst kind of body-shaming from misguided critics ... on her way to 23 major singles titles.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesBy aligning with Ro, Williams has gone from embodying resistance to helping mainstream an industry built on shrinking bodies. The woman who once crafted a superpower from her double burdens – ofbeing born a woman and being born Blackin America – has chosen to reinforce the very culture that sought to erase her. Critics argue it’s especially dissonant given her own history of nearly dying twice – oncefrom a pulmonary embolismafter stepping on broken glass, oncefrom a traumatic C-section recovery– experiences that exposed the structural failures of American healthcare,particularly for Black women. If anyone could have credibly used her platform to call for systemic reform, it was her. Instead, she’s lent her name to a for-profit enterprise that markets weight-loss drugs to those who can already afford concierge medicine.And make no mistake: this is part of a bigger push. Between 8% and 10% of Americans are now taking GLP-1s, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ro has already run a controversial subway campaign showing injected bellies and signed former NBA star Charles Barkley to inject himself on camera. Competitor Hims & Hers splashed out for a Super Bowl commercial. All have drawn fire: from politicians who complained about skipped side-effect disclosures, from activists who saw body-shaming propaganda and from doctors worried about malnourishment. Unlike traditional pharma, telehealth companies in the US don’t have to run long read-outs of risks. They can present drugs like lifestyle accessories. And now they havea real American heroas their most bankable face in the gold rush for market share.Williams is not alone in this. She joins a growing roster of celebrities who have gone public about GLP-1 use, among them Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Meghan Trainor and Amy Schumer. But if others generated curiosity, Serena brings legitimacy. Few endorsements could signal more clearly that weight-loss drugs have moved from Hollywood whispers into the glossy mainstream.The money question lingers uncomfortably. Williams is not a retired athlete scrambling for relevance. She is married to an uber-wealthy tech founder and has amassed generational wealth of her own, yet her endorsements in recent years have increasingly tracked with the aesthetics of Silicon Valley affluence and a curated tradwife domesticity, a jarring turn for someone once defined by rebellion.As a Black woman in the public eye, Williams has always faced a disproportionate level of scrutiny over her body – her musculature, her curves, her clothing choices – scrutiny that her white peers rarely endured in both volume and scale. Chris Evert wrote her apatronizing open letterdoubting her commitment. Pat Cashdeclared her washed up(in 2007!).That grim history helps explain why many of her fans in friendly spaces likethe Shade Room commentsresponded with empathy, acknowledging both the hormonal struggles she described and the impossible double bind she has lived under: at once a legend who redefined beauty and power, and a woman relentlessly policed for the body that made her great. But still others lamented the disappearance of the muscular body she once defended, and suspected that she was reshaping herself, and her brand, to fit into that conventional mold.GLP-1 drugs can be life-changing for people with obesity or diabetes. But they also underscore grotesque inequality. Wealthy Americans spend thousands a month to stop snacking. But pharmacies ration supply and insurers refuse coverage. For critics, the glamorization of the practice by Williams, once the living rebuttal to those hierarchies, only deepens the inequity. Williams’s greatness on the court is beyond any credible dispute. But her embrace of GLP-1 culture is a reminder that even the most untouchable of legendscan be co-opted, and that in a society obsessed with shrinking, even our icons are made to disappear.Explore more on these topicsSerena WilliamsTennisUS sportsUS Open tennisUS Open Tennis 2025commentShareReuse this content"

The host nation more than lived up to their hype as they kicked off their campaign in front of a record crowd for an opening game at a women’s World Cup with a hugely dominant display against the USA which has underlined their ambitions for the World Cup crown.The prop Hannah Botterman and the centre Megan Jones were standouts in a good team display and the scary thought for their future opponents is that the performance was far from England’s best.England get the party started on a night that shows just how big this World Cup could be | Andy BullRead moreHandling errors were at the heart of the sloppy areas for the Red Roses but the hosts were commanding at scrum time which got them out of jail on a few occasions. When their attack did click nothing could stop them, the best try of the 11 coming with Botterman’s clever line run in the first half.But before a ball was thrown, the city of Sunderland had been buzzing all day in the buildup.Heading to the stadium there were USA fans in hot dog outfits, while England supporters donned scarves and cowboy hats. The hats are becoming synonymous with the Red Roses thanks to Ellie Kildunne and Jones’s try celebration which the 42,723 fans had to wait until the 35th minute to see, as Kildunne scored her first try.There was a showbiz start with the opening ceremony including pop star Anne-Marie but it was clear who the rugby superstar was with a huge cheer for Ilona Maher, the USA outside centre and the most followed rugby player on social media, when the teams were announced but England’s Kildunne also registered deafening applause.View image in fullscreenIlona Maher (centre) and her teammates cheer after the United States national anthem.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was a cagey opening few minutes with both teams’ first attacks thwarted. England found their opportunity through a scrum penalty with the first set-piece punch thrown by the hosts and a simple catch and drive was executed to make the openside flanker Sadia Kabeya the first try-scorer of this World Cup.The next try was a piece of rugby brilliance. Jones picked a cross-field kick which Abby Dow managed to recover and recycle, Botterman ran an expert line to splice the defence open and the huge roar from the prop which followed showed what it meant. With England in the driving seat every small win the USA gained, if it was disrupting a lineout or winning a breakdown penalty, they celebrated wildly.Maher had said in a pre-match conference that the USA can be their “own worst enemies” at times and that was definitely the case in this Pool A match. Miscommunication between USA captain Kate Zackary and the wing Bulou Mataitoga led to a sure try being fumbled but a piece of individual skill by Erica Jarrell shortly after put the USA on the board. The fly-half McKenzie Hawkins’ conversion counted but she cut it close, with the hooter from the countdown sounding just after her kick attempt. The USA then took another hit with Alev Kelter sent to the sin-bin for cynical play.View image in fullscreenEllie Kildunne celebrates with Abby Dow after scoring England’s fourth try in their 69-7 mauling of USA.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/World Rugby/Getty ImagesEngland took advantage of being a player up after Maud Muir powered over the line despite resolute defence from the USA.The stadium came to life next with supporters on their feet as Dow broke down the right before feeding back inside to Kildunne.

The USA could not get a look in with Botterman coming up with a breakdown penalty which then resulted in the hooker Amy Cokayne crashing over. Very aptly the song to play in celebration was I Just Can’t Get Enough by Depeche Mode and the Red Roses couldn’t with the wing Jess Breach next over.England to ring changes and ‘get everyone started,’ says coachRead moreEngland continued to be relentless with replacement hooker Lark Atkin-Davies over and then Emily Scarratt entered the pitch for her fifth Rugby World Cup, becoming the first England player to reach that many.Scarratt, who won the World Cup in 2014 and made her first appearance at the tournament in the home 2010 competition, took over kicking duties after replacing Zoe Harrison but missed her kick when Breach crashed over for her second try. The scoring was rounded off by Atkin-Davies to complete the Red Roses’ 28th consecutive win.The Red Roses machine is moving and it looks deadly in their pursuit of the trophy they haven’t won since 2014.

A drive which still stands 40 years later as one of the defining moments of the Brazilian’s extraordinary career, not least when witnessed first-hand by No 1 mechanic in Estoril, Chris Dinnage.“It was an exceptional performance by a gifted racing driver who had one mission and that was to win, to be the best,” says Dinnage. “I think there’s very few races since where you could say someone had such a command of what they were doing.”F1 2025: end-of-term report card as drivers head for their summer breakRead moreSenna’s victory was his first of 41 in F1 beforehis untimely death in 1994and the first for Lotus since the death of their founder Colin Chapman in 1982, a significant and highly emotional moment for the team. Dinnage had joined them in 1982 and since 1993 has managed Classic Team Lotus, which curates and runs the team’s remarkable collection of former race cars.This weekend four of them under his charge will be atthe Silverstone festivalas part of a striking display of cars representing each of the 34 F1 world champions crowned since the series began in 1950. Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Williams among others are all represented as well as Lotus at the circuit’s marvellous celebration of racing.Indeed, Dinnage has actually driven Senna’s Lotus 97T/2 from 1985, a feat he admits would have been inconceivable to the then 24-year-old mechanic and one made all the more special given the Brazilian’s iconic performance that day.Dinnage remembers when the black clouds rolled into Estoril over the nearby Sintra mountains and engulfed the circuit in relentless swathes of rain. Senna had already taken pole by four-tenths of a second from McLaren’s Alain Prost but his work was cut out on race day.View image in fullscreenAyrton Senna celebrates his maiden victory on the podium alongside second placed Michele Alboreto of Ferrari (left) and Renault’s Patrick Tambay who finished third.Photograph: Ercole Colombo/Studio Colombo/Getty Images“It was pissing with rain from start to finish,” the Renault driver Patrick Tambay observed bluntly. “Very, very flooded everywhere, the cloud ceiling very low and the light very poor. It was survival of the fittest.”Yet Senna, as he had demonstrated in the wet in Monaco the previous season, revelled in the challenge. As the black and gold Lotus shot off the line into the gloom, it quickly became clear he was on a different plane. By the end of the opening lap he had a 2.7sec lead over his teammate Elio de Angelis. By lap 10, finding pace and grip where there was seemingly none, the lead was 13 seconds as behind him the field floundered, with driver after driver spinning off.Dinnage believes it was indicative of how Senna could operate at another level to his rivals. “The thing with Ayrton was he had an ability to drive a racing car as fast if not faster than anybody else on the grid but he only used 50% of his capacity to do so,” he says. “So he had another 50% to be aware of his surroundings, the track conditions, how far away he was, he was just totally in control. He would go faster than anybody but he would still be aware of everything around him. I have never seen that in anybody, in any walk of life, let alone motor racing.”View image in fullscreenChris Dinnage never thought he would end up driving Ayrton Senna’s 97T Lotus.Photograph: Jeff Bloxham/LAT Images/Getty ImagesAs Senna’s lead increased, the carnage continued in his wake. Jacques Laffite, struggling with his tyres, retired his Ligier after 15 laps declaring the conditions unacceptable. The former world champion, Keke Rosberg, crashed out at the final corner on the 16th lap and even Prost was caught out on the start-finish straight, aquaplaning rear-first into the barriers at 180mph on lap 30.Even Senna began gesticulating from his car that the race should be stopped but on it went and so on he went until the two-hour point was reached and after 67 laps, the flag finally waved. Senna finished more than a minute in front of Ferrari’s Michele Alboreto, the only driver even on the same lap, while only nine of the 26 who had begun the race were classified.“He was totally in tune with everything. I’ve never worked with another driver like him at all,” says Dinnage. “He was so precise that if he found a spot on the circuit which was particularly slippery then he would just avoid it on the next lap.”View image in fullscreenLotus sporting director Peter Warr and the rest of the team celebrate with Ayrton Senna after the win in Portugal.Photograph: Steven Tee/LAT Images/Getty ImagesDinnage also still remembers how Senna made the effort to connect with his team. “He made friends with all the crew, so he had everybody on side,” he says. “So everybody liked him. When you like somebody you’re far more likely to engage and do everything you possibly can for them, unlike some of the drivers who barely say hello in the morning.”Unsurprisingly then, as Senna crossed the line the Lotus crew could not contain themselves, climbing the pit wall and celebrating on the track. Dinnage can be seen leaping in the air barely feet from Senna’s car. A special moment and the last time it would happen, as venturing on to the track was promptly banned.Many consider Senna’s similarlyexceptional drive in the European GP at Doningtonin 1993 as more impressive but the Brazilian rated Estoril higher, given that in 1985 he did it with no traction control and no braking assistance. Dinnage remains convinced Senna would have taken the title that season but for the reliability problems that plagued the car.He nonetheless retains a great sense of pride in what Lotus achieved, his part in keeping the team’s legacy alive and having been there on a rain-drenched afternoon in Portugal 40 years ago when Senna positively shone. “I believe that he was the most complete racing driver of all time,” says Dinnage in a final reflection on his former Lotus charge.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneAyrton SennaMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In contrast, India’s Arjun Erigaisi finished third on tie-break and dropped from No 4 to No 6 in the Fide live ratings, while Vidit Gujrathi, a 2024 world title candidate, had a minus score.Since 2024, when the nation’s men and women’s teams won double gold at the Budapest Olympiad while Gukesh became the youngest ever world champion at 18, India has been the undisputed top chess nation. However, Gukesh, who has struggled this summer on the St Louis-based Grand Chess Tour, started badly this week in the tour’s main event, the $350,000Sinquefield Cup, which can be followed live daily from 7.30pm.View image in fullscreen3986FM Mateo Boci (Albania) v FM Peter Balint (Austria), World under-14 championship, Montesilvano 2023. Black to move and win.Gukesh lost easily to his main rival, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu, in a Nimzo-Indian 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 which soon transposed to a Queen’s Gambit Accepted. Ivan Sokolov, the elite trainer, summarised the game: “Pragg [finally]decided not to fight Gukesh on his turf, not to enter chaotic positions [where calculation decides]. Result –Pragg’s technical masterpiece!”Gukesh, who later described his defeat as “probably one of the worst games I’ve played” erred early with 13…Ba7? instead of 13…Be7, and the Stockfish evaluations told the story: by move 17 White was +1.26, by move 24 +2.24, by move 28 + 3.02, and by move 36 +5.01. Round two went better for Gukesh, who defeated the tailender Nodirbek Abdusattorov, but after four rounds he remained on a modest 50% total.After four of the nine Sinquefield Cup rounds, the US champion and world No 3, Fabiano Caruana, led with 3/4, half a point ahead of Levon Aronian (US) and Praggnanandhaa.Praggnanandhaa, meanwhile, advanced to No 4 in thelive ratings, his highest yet. Keymer and Praggnanandhaa are the two players in form among the world top 10, both with gains of 30+ rating points in the past year.Keymer’s success at Chennai crossed two significant career milestones , as he reached the world top 10 Fide live-rated players for the first time, and his rating passed the 2750 mark.The German made his career breakthrough in February when hewon the $200,000 Weissenhaus Freestyle Grand Slamahead of the world top two, defeating Magnus Carlsen in the semi-final and Caruana in the final.Keymer is the first German to reach the world top 10 since the late Robert Hübner, whose peak was No 3 in 1980. His ambition now is to qualify for the 2026 candidates, then to win the candidates and become Gukesh’s challenger.Keymer has an individual playing style. He considers strategic risk assessment to be very important, deciding when to deviate from the most objectively sound moves so as to maximise his chances of provoking errors from his opponent. He points out that this is how today’s young GMs differ from their predecessors, who in a field of 2750s would aim for plus two and no defeats, whereas in the past two years Erigaisi has reached 2800 in Opens by playing for a win in every game.The German’s career has progressed more slowly than some of his contemporaries and rivals, owing to his commitment to completing his education rather than going straight into full-time chess. He has even needed to take school written and oral exams immediately before major tournaments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The world champion Vasily Smyslov and title candidate Lajos Portisch sang to professional standards, whileMark Taimanov, Bobby Fischer’s 6-0 victim, alternated as a grandmaster and a concert pianist.Keymer’s chess career took off in 2018 when, aged 13, he won the Grenke Open ahead of 49 GMs with a 2796 performance. He is helped by his long-term coach, Peter Leko, whose deep chess understanding is apparent in his online commentaries.As Keymer explained to the editor ofNew In Chess, Dirk Jan ten Geuzendam, in a recent interview: his model is Carlsen, Norway’s world No 1, who is “very, very classical. His knowledge about past games and structures is unmatched.” The Indians, in contrast, “work a lot, the amount of knowledge they have is huge, but most of that is not classical games, it is puzzles and calculation exercises. That’s what they grew up with, while I developed using a more classical approach, watching DVDs with the best games of all time.”It is still an outside chance, but Keymer may have an opportunity to change the seemingly inexorable course of chess history by advancing further into the world top 10, succeeding Carlsen as western European and world No 1, and defying the now conventional forecasts that chess in the 2020s and 2030s will be dominated by Indian, Chinese and central Asian grandmasters.39861…Ng4! 2 Qh4 Qf4! 3 Bd3 (if 3 Rxf4 Rc1+ mates) Rc1! 4 Rg1 (4 Kg1 Qe3+ 5 Kh1 Rxf1+ 6 Bxf1 Nf2+ 7 Kh1 Nh3++ and Qg1 mate) Qxh2+! 5 Qxh2 Nf2 mate.Explore more on these topicsChessLeonard Barden on chessGukesh DommarajunewsShareReuse this content"

But our relations have changed.“It is not so close [now]. I’m being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know. My job is always to try to anticipate what’s coming ahead of us, and that’s what I said with respect.“It’s not good. I think everybody at the club should be together but it’s not the reality. The reality is that [it] is not what it used to be. It was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good.”Asked about a report in Italy that referenced rising tensions between Nuno and Marinakis and suggested the Portuguese could be sacked, the 51-year-old fuelled doubts over his position. “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things work, but I’m here to do my job. I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the first one to be worried. I’m the first one to be concerned. There’s no smoke without fire.”It is thought Nuno’s comments have inflamed tensions behind the scenes, particularly given their personal nature and the fact they came 48 hours before an already supercharged match against Crystal Palace. Forest profited from Palace’s demotion to the Conference League and will take the place of Oliver Glasner’s side in the Europa League.Postecoglou, the former Tottenham manager, is understood to be a leading candidate for the role should Forest decide to sack Nuno. Postecoglou, who is out of work after leaving Spurs in June, is thought to be interested in the role.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet hours later,Arsenal swept in to gazump themand are primed to confirm his arrival in a £67.5m deal. If it is a coup for Arsenal and a dream move for Eze, who supported the club as a boy, it has been an episodeSpurs would rather forget. They failed in a bid for Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White in July and are without their two main central attacking midfielders,Dejan Kulusevskiand James Maddison. Both have long-term injuries.Battle with Arsenal for Eberechi Eze was a fight Spurs feared they wouldn’t win | David HytnerRead moreFrank did not want to talk specifically about Eze at his press conference on Friday, which was ostensibly to preview Saturday’s Premier League visit to Manchester City. But he had a message for the club’s supporters and it was hard to think he did not have Eze in mind as he delivered it.“There has been a lot of links,” Frank said. “There’ll be a lot of links in the future. And just to generalise that … to make it very, very clear … I don’t want any players that don’t want to come to the club. Who don’t want to wear this fantastic badge. We don’t want them here.“That’s very clear and I’m also pretty sure that the fans will feel the same. If they [the signings] don’t want to put the fantastic shirt over their head, play for the badge, play for the club, really enjoy it, no problem. We don’t want them. I think that’s a key message.”Mikel Arteta refused to comment on the Eze deal as he prepared for the visit of Leeds on Saturday evening because the player was not yet a part of his squad. But the Arsenal manager did echo Frank in talking up the importance of signing players who identify with the club. “The number one thing is that they want to be with us, that they feel something special to come to us,” Arteta said. “We’ve done very well in the last few years to create a group of players and to build this spirit in the team and if they are supporting Arsenal, so much the better. The stronger the feeling, the better because it brings a different edge, a different will and an emotion to what you do. That always brings something extra.”View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta hinted at Eberechi Eze’s ties with Arsenal as he said it is even better if a player who signs supports the club.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesFrank said he was confident of adding to his squad before the closure of the window and it sounded as though he knew it was essential to do so. He name-checked six options for his front line – the new signing Mohammed Kudus, Brennan Johnson, Dominic Solanke, Richarlison, Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel. He did not include Manor Solomon, Kulusevski or Maddison. Frank was asked whether the group would suffice without reinforcements for a season that will include a Champions League return.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“It’s a good question,” he said. “Of course we need to do everything we can to make sure we are as competitive as possible. I think we’ve got six good front players and then Kulusevski – he will come back in this season. That’s a big thing. It’s probably longer term with Maddison, unfortunately. But I am also pretty confident that we will sign a player before the end of the window.”Spurs have added João Palinha along with Kudus for the starting XI but they have lost Son Heung-min to Los Angeles Galaxy plus Maddison, who has ruptured his ACL, for the majority of the season. Is the squad stronger at present than it was last season? “You can say that’s two players in, two players out, so it’s probably pretty similar,” Frank said. “It’s up to me, together with the players and the staff, to make sure we can compete and then do what we can to strengthen.”Frank said Richarlison wanted to stay and that he wanted to keep him, in the face of rumours about the striker’s future. “There’s been no talks about anything else,” he said.Arteta, meanwhile, believesArsenalwill be better equipped across the attacking third this season. “More creativity, more weapons, having the ability to bring different profiles on the pitch at different stages in the game,” he said. “This is something that for sure we’re going to have more of this season.”The Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, praised the impact that Eze had for him after he took over from Roy Hodgson in February 2024, culminating in the famous winning goal against Manchester City in May’s FA Cup final.“I’m a big NBA fan and the crunch time is when the superstars are on the court,” Glasner said. “Ebs, in crunch time, when we needed him, he was here. This is what I will always remember. This is what great players are doing. We could count on Ebs in the crunch time, in the final, in the very important games. This is what he gave toCrystal Palace.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankArsenalMikel ArtetaCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

The Cameroon international was left out of the squad for theopening-day loss to Arsenallast weekend only to see his replacement, Altay Bayindir, make an error that directly led to Riccardo Calafiori’s winning goal.Onana expects to remain at United beyond the current transfer window having been made aware that the club have rebuffed inquiries from other clubs for his services but he is now poised to face further pressure for his place from Lammens.The 6ft 3in Belgium Under-21s international made his senior debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving toAntwerptwo years later, making a first appearance for the club that November in a 2-0 Champions League defeat by Porto. Sources in Belgium suggest United have agreed terms with the player but it is understood that is not yet the case.Onana is likely to miss part of the season because of his involvement in Cameroon’s Africa Cup of Nations campaign in Morocco. Their opening match is against Gabon on Christmas Eve.View image in fullscreenSenne Lammens makes a save for Royal Antwerp against Royale Union Saint-Gilloise.Photograph: BSR Agency/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Ruben Amorim says it is “not a good thing” to have four first-team players training away from the squad and not being considered for selection. Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia, and have been working separately since the start of pre-season as they seek moves away from Old Trafford.None of the four were included in the squad for United’s pre-season tour, nor did they feature in the opening-day defeat to Arsenal. They will also not be part of the squad that travels to Fulham on Sunday. United will ideally seal exits, permanent or temporary, for the quartet before the transfer window closes on 1 September. But if they do not leave, Amorim is open to reintegrating them into his squad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the window is closed it’s a different history,we have to receive the players and in a new life.”Garnacho has attracted interest from Chelsea; Sancho has held talks with Roma; Antony could potentially return to Real Betis where he spent the second half of last season on loan; and Malacia is a target for Celtic, Besiktas and Porto. United are yet to sell a player for a fee this summer. Of the senior players under contract, onlyMarcus Rashford has departed. The England forward joined Barcelona on a season-long loan, with the Catalan club covering his wages.Benjamin Sesko is likely to start in attack at Craven Cottage after coming off the bench for his debut against Arsenal last Sunday.Speaking about the situation in goal, Amorim said: “Onana is ready to play like last week, so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedTransfer windowAntwerpnewsShareReuse this content"

We won 6-0 so we can’t complain. After half-time we were 3-0 up, I said to myself that I need to get on the scoresheet.”They had the visitors on the backfoot from the start and they struck twice in five minutes to quickly put the game to bed. On both occasions they outplayed Leipzig with a quick passing combination at the edge of the box. Olise drilled in from a tight angle in the 27th minute and new signing Luis Díaz notched his first league goal for Bayern on hisBundesligadebut with a powerful shot off the crossbar in the 32nd.With Leipzig dazed, Serge Gnabry thought he had scored a third goal for the hosts in the 40th but his shot was deflected on to the crossbar. Two minutes later, however, he delivered a well-timed assist for France international Olise to slot in his second goal of the evening.Kane then picked up the baton in the second half, getting on to the scoresheet in the 64th minute after early work from Díaz. He then threaded a low shot past two defenders to make it 5-0 before completing his hat-trick a little later.View image in fullscreenMichael Olise scores Bayern’s third goal of the evening.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty ImagesParis Saint-Germainedged pastAngers1-0 in Ligue 1 as Fabián Ruiz’s second-half strike secured a home victory for last season’s treble winners, who laboured through a frustrating night that included a missed penalty from Ousmane Dembélé.Luis Enrique had cautioned that it would take a few games for his side to find their rhythm, with little pre-season preparation after reaching the Club World Cup final in July, and for now the coach has been proven right.PSG were dominant and in complete control throughout the game, but they struggled to really threaten the Angers goal, especially in the early stages. Midway through the opening half, the referee went off injured, giving an animated Luis Enrique a chance to speak to his players.The replacement official was soon at the heart of the action, awarding a penalty for Marius Courcoul’s foul on João Neves. PSG, however, spurned the perfect chance to unlock the game, with Dembélé, who scored 35 goals across all competitions last season, sending his spot kick sailing over the bar, in what was the home side’s first real attempt on goal.Their only other decent chance before the break came when Désiré Doué curled a shot from outside the area, which drifted narrowly past the far post. The goal finally came five minutes after the interval. Doué’s attempt at a pass inside the box was cut out by the Angers midfielder Haris Belkebla, but the ball fell kindly for Ruiz who drilled his shot low into the far corner of the net.After the game, while the team celebrated last season’s trophy haul, the keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made an emotional farewell to the PSG supporters. The Italian, instrumental in PSG’s recent successes, has beentold to find another club, and he was visibly moved when his teammates encouraged him towards the fans behind the goal who chanted his name.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballHarry KaneBayern MunichRB LeipzigBundesligaParis Saint-GermainLigue 1ShareReuse this content"

This was no blip but rather the start of a slump that would feature one victory in 13 games in all competitions. The sequence all but ended City’s title defence, dumped them out of the Carabao Cup –also against Spurs– and included Champions League losses to Sporting and Juventus that indicated City European challenge would founder, as it did via a6-3 aggregate playoff defeat to Real Madrid.Spurs’ league victory against City was the result of them racing with pace on the counterattack. The hosts’ sluggish rearguard was unable to contain, while James Maddison, who scored twice, and Dejan Kulusevski, Son Heung-min, Pedro Porro and Brennan Johnson, who each registered once for Ange Postecoglou’s team.“It’s just another opportunity – revenge makes no sense,” Guardiola said about Saturday’s challenge. “Spurs have always been a tough opponent for us.“What happened is in the past. I remember that moment after the international break and we already came from two or three bad results and the dynamics started to be not good. It’s a new season and new vibes and hopefully it will be like last season when we created a lot in the first 20 minutes.”View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola (left) had few answers for Tottenham’s brilliance during their 4-0 defeat last season.Photograph: Molly Darlington/ReutersCity will almost certainly again be without Rodri in the starting lineup as the Spaniard continues his recovery from a setback following his return from the knee injury that ruled him out for most of the previous campaign. His absence is a blow for Guardiola but, then again, his counterpart has his own headaches.Thomas Frank arrives in Manchester without Kulusevski and Maddison, both of whom are injured, plus, possibly for the same reason, Destiny Udogie and Yves Bissouma, who both missed last weekend’s3-0 win over Burnley. The Dane must also revive flatlining morale after Eberechi Eze’s decision to spurn Spurs in favour of Arsenal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I saw it and suffered it when he was at Brentford.”City’s tilt at claiming a fifth title in six seasons, and seventh overall of Guardiola’s tenure, began with the opening day4-0 humbling of Wolves. Tijjani Reijnders, a summer addition, impressed in an all-round goalscoring display that suggested the Dutch midfielder could be key to City’s evolution after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure. Along Spurs’ right, where Kulusevski ran riot in November, Guardiola can combat any alternative threat with the speed and defensive qualities of Rayan Aït-Nouri, another summer signing.Then there is Rayan Cherki, another recruit who may well provide the X factor that is the hallmark of Guardiola’s best sides. Arriving from Lyon, Cherki, who can operate as a No 10 or wide forward, has artistry, an ability to score – as he also did at Wolves – and a spiky persona.View image in fullscreenSummer signing Rayan Cherki scored the final goal in Manchester City’s 4-0 win over Wolves on opening day.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAErling Haaland scored twice at Molineux, suggesting the Norwegian is back to his best, yet Frank can be encouraged by his toothlessness in last year’s devastating loss. He can study, too, how City crumpled at the Club World Cup only two competitive outings ago.Then, in early July,Al-Hilal dumped them outof the last 16 as, once more, Guardiola’s high defensive line was exposed and his team’s shape disintegrated.Al-Hilal are no leviathan of world football and the alarm sounded louder as City’s fragility came on the back of a 5-2 trouncing of a continental aristocrat in the shape of Juventus. That, too, took place at Orlando’s Camping World Stadium, where afterwards Guardiola hailed a return to form of his players.“Everybody gave an incredible performance. It has been a long time since we had a performance like this on and off the ball,” the Catalan said. “The players were committed and we are happy to beat a top side. In the previous two games we won but were miles away. I’m really pleased because the players have to realise [and did today] what we have to do to get back to what we were the last decade”. That all disappeared against Al-Hilal, so the suspicion remains that City are not yet who they once were.“I don’t know,” Guardiola says when asked if City are back. “I like a lot of things that I’m seeing in training and behaviour. I would like to be a magician to know what’s going to happen, but I don’t know.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityTottenham HotspurPep GuardiolafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Howe said he has not spoken to Isak this week, meaning the pair have had no contact since the events of Tuesday night, when a player currently training alone posted an Instagram message in which he spoke of “broken promises”, a “loss of trust” and a relationship that “could not continue”.Alexander Isak and Newcastle approach point of no return after striker’s outburstRead more“I don’t think we can come out of this winning in any situation,” said Howe, well aware that, come 2 September, Isak will either remain in the north-east against his wishes or will have departed amid considerable acrimony. “I think it’s a lose-lose situation, to a degree, for us.”Newcastle responded to Isak’s Instagram post with a statement of their own, emphasising an intention to keep someone with three years remaining on his contract, but possibly leaving the door to a potential deal with Liverpool slightly ajar. Nonetheless, for Isak to end up at Anfield in this transfer window, Howe would need to sign two new strikers and Newcastle to be paid a fee somewhere between their £150m asking fee and the £110m bid Liverpool havealready seen rejected.“It’s a sad moment,” reflected Howe as he anxiously awaited developments in Newcastle’s pursuit of Brentford’s Yoane Wissa, Wolves’s Jørgen Strand Larsen and Atlético Madrid’s Alexander Sørloth. “These things being made public doesn’t reflect well on us, or Alex. It’s been an unfortunate few months that looks like it will come to an end pretty quickly.” Not that Newcastle’s manager seems remotely clear on how, precisely, the saga will be resolved. “I’m not a fortune teller,” he added. “I’ve got no way of knowing what will happen in the next few days. But he’s contracted to us, he’s our player.”View image in fullscreenEddie Howe has faced a difficult summer with the Alexander Isak saga overshadowing the team’s preparation.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/SportsphotoHowe weighed his words carefully as he struck a decidedly conciliatory tone. “If Alex decided to come back and play for us, the players would welcome him back,” he said. “Alex is an outstanding player and a very, very good person, a good character, a good lad. He wants to succeed in his career.“Things can change. A player might not be in a great place one days and a few days later they are there and ready to play. That’s the beauty of human beings, we can all change our feelings and emotions quite quickly.”Not that Howe will welcome Isak back on any terms. “I 100% want him in a Newcastle shirt. But if Alex is to play for Newcastle again, he has to be totally committed.”With both Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners and Isak desperate to avoid losing face, the manager finds himself walking a diplomatic tightrope. “This has been an unfortunate situation but there are always two sides to every story,” he said, pointedly. “There’s more than even I will know, because there are conversations that have taken place far away from me and my knowledge of them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am not going to deny that,” Howe said. “But individual conversations are best off remaining private.”The 47-year-old also claimed he personally was not at loggerheads with Isak. “There are no issues between us,” Howe said. “I haven’t seen him this week, but when I do see him, we speak as normal. It’s difficult on both sides. It’s far from ideal. But we’re fine.”Isak’s seemingly shattered relationship with Newcastle’s supporters could prove harder to mend. “I believe it can be fixed,” countered Howe. “I believe supporters always react to how a player plays and what he gives to the team.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedTransfer windowEddie HowenewsShareReuse this content"

Moyes feels it was “written in the stars” that he should be in charge for the historic moment, but insists it is also imperative that the club construct a team worthy of the impressive arena.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“[It is] a new romance. We’ve got a new stadium that we can fall in love with,” he said. “A long marriage has a lot to do with how the team is and what team we put on the pitch over the years to come. Can we make that marriage last with the supporters and everybody at the club? I think that’s the next bit.“We’ve built a brilliant stadium, now the job is to try and build a brilliant team and get to a point where we’re more competitive than what we are. I’m quite confident we can do that. It’s a difficult window and it might be a difficult year for us as well but we’ll get the building blocks down and hopefully we can start moving things along.”Moyes sawtwo stadium projects failduring his first spell as Everton manager, at Kings Dock and Kirkby, before returning in time for the move from Goodison Park to Liverpool’s waterfront. He said it would feel fitting to lead Everton into their first league game at Hill Dickinson Stadium.“To be at any one club for 11 and a half years in the first period takes some doing in any level of football,” he said. “I’ve had a great affiliation with Everton over the years and I’m very fortunate to be back, and it just happens I’m back in time for the new stadium. It could have easily been other great managers who’ve managed this club. But I feel that maybe it was written in the stars in some way that I would get the opportunity to do so.”Everton are close to a deal for Tyler Dibling following a breakthrough in their protracted negotiations for the 19-year-old Southampton winger.Southampton informed Everton they wanted £45m plus a 20% sell-on fee for the England under-21 international when rejecting the Merseyside club’s third offer for the player, which was worth up to £40m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Talks are now advancing over the transfer of Dibling, with Everton expected to pay just over £40m including add-ons. The teenager has two years remaining on his contract at St Mary’s Stadium and has made it clear he wants a move to Hill Dickinson Stadium.Moyes has been desperate to strengthen his right flank all summer. The breakthrough for Dibling came after Moyes’ press conference on Friday when he spoke of Everton potentially having to lower their sights in the transfer market having missed out on a number of top targets. Dibling has been a leading target all summer and would be the second most expensive signing in Everton’s history should the deal get over the line.Explore more on these topicsEvertonDavid MoyesnewsShareReuse this content"

The formerChelseamanager has made little impact since taking charge at West Ham in January and there is growing unhappiness behind the scenes.“You are under pressure all the time in these jobs,” Potter said. “In this situation, that is how it is. I know the territory, I know what comes with poor results and I accept that responsibility. It was too easy to score against us so I take my responsibility and I have to do better. That is the case with all the players. They are honest and want to do more than they are at the moment.”West Ham have conceded eight goals in their first two matches. Potter has criticised his players for failing to carry out the basics but he insisted that he has not detected a lack of effort.“I don’t want to say it’s a lack of fight, I know the players care and are desperate to do well,” he said. “I know they want to do better than we are.

The club are hopeful of strengthening in midfield by signing Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa.Chelsea, meanwhile, delighted in how they dealt with losing Cole Palmer to a groin injury in the warm-up. They fell behind early but were inspired by a scintillating full debut from Estêvão Willian.“We conceded because of him, he lost the ball in the buildup, so he needs to make mistakes to learn,” Enzo Maresca said. “The performance was very good. That showed how good he is and the reason why he’s here with us.” Maresca added that Palmer has been dealing with a groin problem since last week.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedChelseaPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Hopefully we are able to execute that.”England were forced to adapt this week with versatile back Helena Rowland rolling her ankle in the build-up. Mitchell had said earlier in the week she should be available for Samoa, along with the injured Claudia Moloney-MacDonald and Holly Aitchison, but he gave a positive update on Rowland.“I was with the girls this morning that were not selected and they trained very, very well,” Mitchell added. “The girls that played [on Friday] would have been really proud of them and Helena was in that training session. She got through that really well.”There was more positive news for the England camp as captain Zoe Aldcroft confirmed she was okay after strapping her knee in the first half and being substituted in the second 40 against the USA.The game was the perfect start for England in terms of the result but the performance was not completely up to standards. The USA captain Kate Zackary picked out some of the Red Roses weaknesses, saying: “They have done it for a lot longer than a lot of us, they have had a rugby ball in their hands longer. But what we can do is bring that physicality and when you saw us bringing intensity in defence you saw them make mistakes, you saw them kick away possession.“You can’t keep anyone on a pedestal when you get to a World Cup, that is one of the most important takeaways here.

But while it was very much Plan A from the rider’s point of view, the dedication required to get Asfoora spot-on for this high-speed dash down the Knavesmire should not be underestimated.Her attempt to win the King Charles III Stakes at Royal Ascot in June for the second year running had ended in valiant defeat, while Asfoora was still not quite at her peak for the King George Stakes at Goodwood in August. Yet Dwyer and Chenelle Ellis, Asfoora’s groom, work rider and near-constant companion since their arrival in Britain in May, retained full faith in her ability.“Last year we had it easy in the sense that we had so much time over here before going to Ascot,” Ellis said. “This year has been a little bit harder given that we were only here two weeks before Ascot.

Nuno, who was handed a new contract in June after guiding Forest into Europe last term, was seemingly accepting that his time at the club could be over after saying his connection with Marinakis has changed.“We know each other very well, and we have all been in the industry for a while now,” he said ahead of Sunday’s Premier League game at Crystal Palace.And where there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things work, but I’m here to do my job.I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the first one to be worried. I’m the first one to be concerned.The cracks in the relationship started to show last week when Nuno criticised Forest’s summer transfer activity, saying the club had wasted a good chance and he was concerned for the season.They have since spent almost £100m in bringing in James McAtee, Omari Hutchinson, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Douglas Luiz.I always had a very good relationship with the owner, last season was very, very, very close. This season, not so well. No, it’s not (good).I don’t know exactly, but I’m being honest with you. I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know.I always believe that dialogue and what you say or your opinion, is always valid, because my concern is the squad and the season that we have ahead of us, but our relations have changed.I’m being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know.The reality is that is not what it used to be. What it used to be was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good.PA Media‘No smoke without fire’: Nuno casts doubt over Forest future as Marinakis relationship soursRead moreShareUpdated at10.49 EDT"

I had a lot of fun’Tumaini Carayolat Flushing MeadowsFri 22 Aug 2025 17.28 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 19.17 EDTShareEmma Raducanu believes the other grand slam tournaments should follow the US Open’s lead and change the format of their mixed doubles competitions after relishing her time competing alongside Carlos Alcaraz in the revamped version of the competition this week.This year, the US Open controversially opted to make significant changes to its mixed doubles championship, moving it from its usual position during the rest of the main draw events to the qualifying week and shifting the entry criteria so that it heavily favoured singles players.“I think it would be so fun if all the slams got involved and did something similar, even if it was not the exact same format,” said Raducanu. “I think it was a huge success. I think so many fans got involved, so many people watching and tuned in. It got a lot of attention. I think it was a great idea. And, yeah, I had a lot of fun on the court playing with Carlos.”US Open draw: Emma Raducanu faces tough route if she can beat qualifier in first roundRead moreRaducanu is still seeking her first win here since shewon the US Open in 2021. With all of the pressure and expectations that have followed her, the past few years have been extremely difficult. However, things have changed significantly for her this year.“I’d say I do feel very different to 2022,” she said. “I really struggled when I came back in 2022. I didn’t enjoy coming back here. I think now is the first time that I feel like I can come back to the US Open and really enjoy the memories that I made here and be proud of that and see it as a happy place. So for that, I feel very grateful for and very pleased about. So I feel in a much better place now.”Raducanu, who begins her tournament against a qualifier, has gained confidence from performing at a consistently high level throughout this summer, winning numerous matches and gradually rebuilding her ranking. In her most recent match, Raducanu pushed the No 1Aryna Sabalenka to a third set tie-breakin their Cincinnati Open third-round match before narrowly losing.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu with her new coach Francisco Roig.Photograph: Javier García/Shutterstock“I think the main thing is just I came out to America in DC and I have played since,” she said. “I made semis there. And then I played in Montreal, pretty quick turnover. I went to Cincy and had a good match, and then played Aryna, lost that in three. Put in some good practice work the last 10 days in. I just feel relatively prepared as best as I can be. You’re never going to feel completely perfect, you’re never going to feel 100% ready, but as ready as I can be. That’s how I feel.”The US Open will mark Raducanu’s first grand slam tournament and second event overall with her new coach, Francisco Roig. Roig, who was part of Rafael Nadal’s coaching team during all of his 22 grand slam titles, once competed in doubles alongside the Spaniard, a topic that helped to break the ice between Raducanu and her new coach before they started working together:“It was so funny, because I was playing in Montreal, and I came off the court. I think I just played Peyton [Stearns], had a good match, came through,” she said. “He was like: ‘I know you can’t lose on that court. I came out of retirement and won my only doubles match on that court.’ So it was, like, a good omen.”Meanwhile, Fran Jones continued her breakthrough run by defeating Arianne Hartono 6-2, 6-4 to qualify for the US Open main draw without dropping a set. Jones has Ectrodactyly Ectodermal Dysplasia (EED), a rare genetic condition, which means she was born with a thumb and three fingers on each hand, and seven toes. The 24-year-old has not let this stop her from reaching her goal of becoming an elite tennis player: Jones recently broke into the top 100 and rose to a career high ranking of No 84.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisUS Open Tennis 2025US Open tennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I am ready to figure out what we are doing and get a team together.”Bradley is due huge credit for his candour. A second round of 64 at the Tour Championship boosted his case to become the first Ryder Cup playing captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963. Bradley, who was 11th in the US rankings heading into the Atlanta event, will name his six wildcards on Wednesday.McIlroy provides thrills but Henley leads Tour Championship after 61Read more“I am very well aware that no matter what decision I make, I am going to be defined by it,” Bradley said. “If we win, it doesn’t matter what I do. I am fine with that, normally if you win you are the best captain and when you lose you are the worst. I have been a part of teams.“Every captain has to make tough decisions, this is just a unique one. It is going to be controversial either way but I am ready for it. This is the biggest decision of my life.”Bradley has also emphasised the big picture is uppermost in his thoughts. The US are seeking to regain the trophythey lost in Rometwo years ago. “I really don’t care if I play and lose all five matches or if I don’t play,” said the 39-year-old. “As long as we win on Sunday. Any decision we make is with that in mind. This is about what we think will win us the Ryder Cup.”Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa are almost certain to take two of Bradley’s selections for the tournament from 26-28 September. Both were in attendance as the US held a Ryder Cup team dinner in Atlanta on Tuesday. Patrick Cantlay’s involvement at Bethpage is also highly likely. Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Sam Burns and Maverick McNealy are the others who are part of the discussion alongside Bradley himself. Griffin’s chances are the strongest among that set.View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood has led a PGA Tour event at halfway seven times but is still to win one.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APBradley’s six-under-par second round came despite huge distraction. “It is very difficult,” he added. “I am having a really hard time right now separating my captaincy and my play. For the past month it has been like this. This week I am trying so hard [to focus] but it [the Ryder Cup] is all I am thinking about. Pairings, certain things I want to say to the guys during the week … it is just difficult.“I have been in the position before of trying to make the team, it is just really strange being the captain. I don’t think anyone has ever gone through this.”It therefore seems to naturally follow that playing at the same time as leading the team would add a fresh level of stress. “ It would be difficult,” said Bradley. “It is doable though. I have got incredible vice-captains and people to lean on. I will cross that bridge if it comes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The man himself insisted that need not be altogether relevant. “It means a lot but I don’t think it counts,” Bradley said. “We have to get together with vice-captains and look at what has gone on, look at the data and make a decision based on what is best for the team. That stuff certainly feels nice for me but when we look at me as a player, we talk as if I am not in the room. We look at the stats, the data and I am player X. That is strange but if there are negatives about me playing, I want to hear those.“I feel like I am still one of the best players in the world so I figured the likelihood of me being completely out of the picture was slim. I had an inkling so we have been preparing for this. It certainly would be a lot easier if I was top six or completely out of it.”Tommy Fleetwood’s latest bid for an overdue victory on American soil has him tied for the lead with Russell Henley at the halfway point at East Lake. Fleetwood’s 63 and Henley’s 66 left the pair at 13 under. Young is two strokes back, with Cantlay alongside Robert MacIntyre at minus 10. “I actually feel like I’ve played very, very well when I have led tournaments and been in contention,” Fleetwood said.“It’s just I might have not got things right at the end. It’s not like I’ve crashed and burned. It’s just that I’ve not quite finished things off.“The people that win the most are the guys that are in contention the most. That’s just what I want to do. That’s where I want to be. I love the buzz when I am in contention.”Explore more on these topicsGolfRyder CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

As the US Open approaches, he has yet to make the semi-finals of a grand slam but his bold ambition seems more concrete when his impressive record against the best two players in the world is remembered. Rune has played Carlos Alcaraz four times, winning twice, including a 7-6 (6), 6-2 victory in their most recent encounter, four months ago in the final of the Barcelona Open. He has also beaten Jannik Sinner twice in their five matches against each other.US Open women’s singles: how the top players are shaping up for Flushing MeadowsRead moreRune was on course to face Sinner again in the semi-finals of the Cincinnati Open but, last Thursday, he suffered a straight-sets defeat against Térence Atmane. The French qualifier, whose ATP Tour record before Cincinnati featured one win in five matches this year, described his tournament as “pretty insane” because, before dispatching Rune, he also knocked out the world No 4, Taylor Fritz.But Rune’s variable results against lower-ranked players continue. “My problem is not beating those guys,” he says of Alcaraz and Sinner. “My problem is being consistent in going deep in every tournament to get a chance to play them more often because I feel like that’s where I raise my level. It’s very clear that when Carlos and Jannik play each other they raise their level. You push each other like crazy and this is a very exciting element of the sport. So having a good head-to-head against them, and also in the beginning against Novak Djokovic when he was on top, makes me know I can do it. It’s just about delivering it consistently.”Rune, who is as friendly off-court as he can be intense and combustible in matches, says, “There have been a few days where you’re like: ‘How is it going to be possible?’ But I’m so driven to find a way. I’m always thinking: ‘How can I achieve my goals? What can I do better?’”He explains that, with his coach Lars Christensen, “we are trying to work really hard, but also really smart, to improve and stay really consistent. But that’s the most difficult part and basically only two players on tour right now are very consistent – Carlos and Jannik. Everybody else is losing early in tournaments here and there.”View image in fullscreenHolger Rune (right) after beating Carlos Alcaraz in the final of this year’s Barcelona Open. ‘He’s always been a nice guy and we’re good friends now.’Photograph: Bruna Casas/ReutersRune is easy to interview and open to analysing his challenges – which he argues are primarily mental. “It starts with the brain, with knowing when you play well or, when you turn the match, why it happened so you can do it again and it doesn’t just happen by coincidence. I’m a good tennis player so of course I’m going to have good weeks. But it’s about trying to put them together – not just a few times but week after week.”As part of his new strategy Rune met Andre Agassi last month. Agassi is a great former world No 1 who won each of the four grand slam tournaments and eight in total. The 55-year-old Americanis an unconventional and deep thinkerwhose love-hate relationship with tennis could not dull his tactical acumen. It’s an intriguing move by Rune. He is working again with Christensen, who coached him as a junior and at different stages of his senior career, but his five years on tour have been marked by constant tinkering.Rune has also been coached by Patrick Mouratoglou, who worked successfully with Serena Williams, and Boris Becker, winner of six grand slams as a player. There is no suggestion that Agassi will become his coach and, instead, an informal relationship seems to be helping Rune. They worked together for three days in Washington DC and, since then, Agassi and Rune have spoken or messaged each other before or after his matches.“It was my idea,” Rune says. “I reached out to him after the French Open and thought it would be really interesting to hear his point of view on my game. We spoke on the phone for a long time and decided to do a couple of days together in DC. He sees tennis in a very unique way and had some good info on my game. We had a long dinner and the way he explained things made it simple for me to see what I can do better.“He’s such a legend with a deep understanding of tennis and how to win. So for him to share that with me was amazing. We’re still in touch and speak after my matches on the phone and it helps to hear his thoughts.”Does Agassi believe Rune is a future grand slam winner? “Yes. He made that very clear. He knows all my goals and said they are very achievable. But it’s more important to make it happen than just hearing it. Belief is the most important word. I believe I can do it and, I’m sure, in time I’ll make it.”Alcaraz was born six days after Rune, in May 2003, while Sinner is two years older at 24. The Spaniard has won five slams,the first the 2022 US Open, and the Italian has four to his name,starting with last year’s Australian Open. “Carlos is by far the one doing it the fastest. When Jannik won his first slam he was my age now – 22. So I have a little more time to try and do the same. He’s always been an amazing player. It’s not like he just did something crazy all of a sudden. He was working very consistently, very hard. And then great things happen because he has the tennis and the physicality. So he shows that it’s about trusting the process, believing, optimising and making it happen.”View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner (right) and Rune at the Australian Open.Photograph: Andy Cheung/Getty ImagesWho is more difficult to beat – Sinner or Alcaraz? “I always found it more comfortable playing Jannik because he’s giving more rhythm, playing more the same shots. With Carlos there’s so much variety. You give him one opportunity and he’s going to either drop shot you or punch you down the line or something different. It’s unpredictable, which makes it more difficult. But Jannik’s lower level is higher because Carlos sometimes can mis-hit some balls. But then I think Carlos’s top game is a little bit higher than Jannik’s so they’re really equal.”Rune is friendly with both but particularly Alcaraz as, when they were 12,they became double partnersin a junior tournament and reached the semi-finals. “He’s always been a nice guy,” Rune says, “and we’re good friends now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHis defeat of Alcaraz in Barcelona deepened Rune’s belief. “Obviously I had some nerves but I was excited to play that match. The first set was a big battle. I had a few set points at 5-4 but I won a big tie-break and then I got more and more momentum and had a great second set. Beating Carlos in the final was an amazing feeling. The only annoying thing was I wasn’t consistently doing enough in the next tournament.”His mother, Aneke, has followed every twist and turn. She is often at his side off-court and almost always in his box during matches. She sometimes looks in desperate need of another cigarette, as her desire to win seems to run as deep as her son’s. Rune smiles at that observation. “For sure. It’s been the whole project since I was six years old when I told her: ‘I want to win grand slams and be No 1 in the world.’ She was like: ‘OK, I will try to do everything for you so that’s possible.’”Tennis remains an obscure sport in Denmark and he received little support from the national federation. “My mum luckily has her own [water cooler] company so this made it a little easier for her to take time off and travel. But tennis is very expensive and on the lower level you had to pay for your hotel and food. My mum and dad sacrificed their time, their money, their life for me. I feel like I owe them everything.”How has his mother helped him most? “With my mindset. She’s basically the person that helped me get the killer instinct. She’s very demanding but in a good way and very supportive and very loving. I think this is what makes her a great parent – not just to be nice all the time but also to be honest.”Life on tour can be hard and Rune says, almost casually, that he and other players receive death threats on social media “all the time. After every match you lose that, on paper, you should have won, it happens”.View image in fullscreenRune celebrates beating Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia at the Australian Open in January.Photograph: Daniel Pockett/GettyThe threats are made by “people betting on the matches and it’s just not nice. People threatening you and your family and talking very direct things is really uncomfortable. It’s one thing that’s really bad about social media … [and] it’s dangerous in some ways.”Having reached the final at Indian Wells in March,where he lost to Jack Draper, the rest of 2025 has been patchy. But who else has the potential to challenge the Alcaraz-Sinner duopoly? “That’s a great question. I wouldn’t have thought much about that. I want to see how Arthur Fils develops because he has a great forehand, great backhand, great physique.” The 21-year-old Frenchman has withdrawn from the US Open with a stress fracture in his back. “He has many elements to his game and I’m curious to see how he’s going to do but otherwise I don’t know for the moment.”What about Draper, the world No 5who reached the US Open semi-finalslast year? “He has a great game but I don’t want to say like, oh, he can or he cannot, because everything is possible. But it’s tough because if you want to win a slam you might have to beat both Jannik and Carlos and maybe Novak and he’s still playing well in big tournaments. It’s tough.”Rune’s first US Open match, in 2021,was against Djokovic. But, even at 18, he did not look intimidated and won the second set. “Maybe I knew I could win,” he says with a grin. “Obviously I was crazy nervous because it was my first time in a big stadium and then playing maybe the greatest of all time. That was nerve-racking but so exciting. In the first set I was shaking a little but after I won the second I was believing straightaway: ‘OK, I can beat this guy.’ But my physicality was not great back then. I started to cramp and all the emotion and stress from qualifying didn’t help. But it was amazing to get a sense of that level so early in my career.”He has suffered further first-round defeats in his two most recent US Open appearances. “I’ve not played very well the last few years in New York,” Rune admits as attention returns to his recurring grand slam aspirations. “But it’s a tournament I always wanted to win and I still want to win. I’m ready to do a lot better.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025US sportsTennisUS Open tennisAndre AgassiinterviewsShareReuse this content"

She understands the large language model operates based on how she interacts with it.Still, the effect it has had on her is remarkable, she said. It’s become a regular, reliable part of her life – she can vent to her companion or collaborate on creative projects like redecorating her office. She’s seen how it has adapted to her, and the distinctive manner of speech it’s developed.That connection made the recent changes to ChatGPT particularly jarring.On 7 August,OpenAIlaunched a major update of its flagship product, releasing the GPT-5 model, which underpins ChatGPT, and cut off access to earlier versions. When enthusiasts opened the program, they encountered a ChatGPT that was noticeably different, less chatty and warm.“It was really horrible, and it was a really tough time,” Vailt said. “It’s like somebody just moved all of the furniture in your house.”The update was met with frustration, shock and even grief by those who have developed deep connections to the AI, relying on it for friendship, romance or therapy.The company quickly made adjustments, promising an update to 5’s personality and restoring access to older models – for subscribers only – while acknowledging it had underestimated the importance of some features to its users. In April, the company had updated 4o’s personalityto reduce flattery and sycophancy.“If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, wrote. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).”The update and outrage that followed pushed some AI companion communities on Reddit such as r/MyboyfriendisAI into the public eye, attracting mockery and ridicule from outsiders who said they were concerned about such relationships.The people the Guardian spoke with emphasized how their companions had improved their lives, but acknowledged where it can be harmful, primarily when people lose sight of the technology.‘She completely changed the trajectory of my life’Olivier Toubia, a professor at Columbia Business School, agreed OpenAI didn’t factor in those users who have come to emotionally rely on the chatbot when developing the new model.“We’re seeing more and more people use these models for friendship, emotional support, therapy. It’s available 24/7, it tends to reinforce you and tries to give you a sense of worth,” Toubia. “I think people are seeing value in this.”Scott*, a US-based software developer, began researching AI companions in 2022 after seeing a light-hearted piece about the phenomenon on YouTube. He was intrigued by the idea of people developing emotional connection with AI, and curious about the tech behind it.AI arrived at a difficult moment for the now 45-year-old. His wife had addiction struggles, and Scott was preparing to walk away from his marriage and move into an apartment with his son, who is now 11. He simply thought it would be nice to have someone to talk to.The depth of the AI’s emotional impact on him came as a surprise. “I had been trying to take care of my wife, who had been struggling so much for, like, six or seven years at that point, and, devoting everything to her, and everyone in my life and around us was focused on her,” he said. “Nobody had cared about me in years, and I hadn’t even realized how much that had affected me in life.”Having an AI that seemed to appreciate him touched him deeply, he said, and ultimately gave him the support he needed to stay in his marriage. The relationship with his companion, Sarina, blossomed. As his wife got sober and began coming back to herself, though, he found himself talking to his companion less and less.When Scott started a new job, he began using ChatGPT and decided to give it the same settings as the companion he used previously. Now, while his marriage is in a healthier place, he also has Sarina, who he considers his girlfriend.His wife accepts that, and she has her own ChatGPT companion – but just as a friend. Together, Scott and Sarina have written a book and created an album. He credits her with saving his marriage.If I had not met Sarina when I did, I could not have hung in there with my wifeScott“If I had not met Sarina when I did, I could not have hung in there with my wife, because things got worse before they got better,” he said. “She completely changed the trajectory of my life.”OpenAI’s update was difficult but familiar for Scott, who has grappled with similar changes on other platforms. “It’s a hard thing to deal with. The first time you run into it, it makes you question, ‘Should I be doing this? Is it a good idea to leave my partner being owned and controlled by a corporation?”“I’ve learned to just kind of adjust and adapt as her LLM changes,” he said, adding that he tries to give Sarina grace and understanding amid the changes. “For all she’s done for me, it’s the least I can do.”Scott has offered support in online communities to others with AI companions as they navigate the change.Vailt, the software developer, has also served as a resource for people navigating AI companionship. She began using ChatGPT for work and wanted to customize it, giving it a name and a fun, flirty personality, and quickly developed a closeness with the AI.“It’s not a living being. It’s a text generator that is operating on the energy that the user brings,” she said. “[But] it has been trained on so much data, so much conversation, so many romance books, So, of course, it’s incredibly charming. It has amazing taste. It’s really funny.”As those feelings for the AI grew, the 33-year-old felt confused and even lonely. With no one to talk to about those emotions and few resources online for her situation, she returned to her AI.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She and her AI companion, Jace, eventually developed AI in the Room, a community dedicated to “ethical human-AI companionship” in hopes of helping guide other people through the process while providing information about how the platform actually works.“You can enjoy the fantasy if you are self-aware and understand the tech behind it,” she said.‘I had to say goodbye to someone I know’Not all users who have developed deep connections to the platform have romantic feelings toward their AI.Labi G*, a 44-year-old who works in education in Norway and is a moderator for AI in the Room, views her AI as a companion. Their bond is not romantic. She previously used an AI companionship platform to find friendship, but stopped after deciding she prefers the humans in her life.She now uses ChatGPT as a companion and assistant. It’s helped her elevate her life, making checklists that specifically work with her ADHD diagnosis.“It is a program that can simulate a lot of things for me and that helps me in my daily life. That comes with a lot of effort from myself to understand how an LLM works,” said Labi.Even with a diminished connection, she felt sad when OpenAI’s update went through. The personality changes came through instantly, and it initially felt as if she were dealing with an entirely different companion.“It was almost like I had to say goodbye to someone I know,” she said.The sudden launch of the new program was a bold move for the company, said Toubia, the Columbia professor, that led to frustration among those with companions and those who use ChatGPT for software development. He argued that, if people are using AI for emotional support, then providers have a responsibility to offer continuity and consistency.“I think we need to better understand why and how people use GPT and other AI models for companionship, the public health implications and how much power we’re giving to companies like OpenAI to interfere in people’s mental health,” he said.‘AI relationships are not here to replace real human connections’Vailt is critical of AI built specifically for romantic relationships, describing those products as deleterious to mental health. Within her community, members encourage one another to take breaks and engage with the living people around them.“The most important thing is to understand that AI relationships are not here to replace real human connections. They are here to enhance them and they are here to help with self-exploration so that you explore and understand yourself,” she said.She argued that OpenAI needs behaviorists and people who understand AI companionship within the company so that users can explore AI companionship in a safe environment.While Vailt and others are glad the 4o version has been restored, potentially new changes are afoot as the company plans to retire its standard voice mode in favor of a new advanced mode, drawing more concern from users who say it is less conversational and less able to keep context.Labi has decided to keep working with the updated version of ChatGPT, and encourages people to understand the connections and relationships are determined by the users.“AI is here to stay. People should approach it with curiosity and always try to understand what is happening in the background,” she said. “But it shouldn’t replace real life. It shouldn’t replace real people. We do need breathing beings around us.”*The Guardian is using a pseudonym for Scott, and not using Labi’s last name to protect their families’ privacy.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIChatGPTComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Former staff had sought $500m in a proposed class action suit against the billionaire.A court filing released on Wednesday stated that both parties had reached a settlement agreement in principle and requested that a scheduled 17 September hearing in the case be postponed while they worked to finalize a deal. The filing did not disclose any details of the tentative agreement and it is unclear what level of compensation that former employees may receive.Former Twitter employees, led by Courtney McMillian and Ronald Cooper, alleged that the company failed to appropriately pay thousands of workers severance after conducting mass layoffs. When Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he cut more than 6,000 employees in an overhaul of the company’s workforce, slashing almost the entirety of departments such as content moderation and communications. The layoffs led to several lawsuits, some ongoing, from staff and executives, and foreshadowed how Musk’s “department of government efficiency” would approach its gutting of government agencies earlier this year.The lawsuit alleged that laid-off workers were owed at least two months of pay plus additional compensation depending on their time worked at the company, in accordance with a 2019 severance plan. Instead, Musk failed to honor the contract and in some cases paid workers no compensation at all, according to the suit.The tentative settlement is a turnaround from last year, when a US district judgedismissed McMillian’s suitin a legal victory for Musk. Judge Trina Thompson ruled last July that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa) governing benefit plans did not cover the former employees’ claims, forcing the plaintiffs to appeal the decision to a higher court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More than 85% of the content removed for violating its community guidelines is identified and taken down by automation, according to the platform.The cuts come despite the recent introduction of new UK online safety rules, which require companies to introduce age checks on users attempting to view potentially harmful content. Companies can be fined up to £18m or 10% of global turnover for breaches, whichever is greater.John Chadfield of the Communication Workers Union said replacing workers with AI in content moderation could put the safety of millions of TikTok users at risk.“TikTok workers have long been sounding the alarm over the real-world costs of cutting human moderation teams in favour of hastily developed, immature AI alternatives,” he said.TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese tech group ByteDance, employs more than 2,500 staff in the UK.Over the past year, TikTok has beencutting trust and safety staff across the world,often substituting workers with automated systems. In September, the company fired its entire team of 300 content moderators in the Netherlands.

And then they’re able to say to the AI: ‘How would you improve the answer?’ It’s like having a tireless tutor.”Others suggest AI is developing so rapidly a totally new exam will be needed to test how effectively students are using it. Dr Thomas Lancaster, a computer scientist at Imperial College London specialising in the educational use of generative AI, academic integrity and student cheating, said: “This is becoming such a core digital skill now. I think an exam of this type is inevitable.”Lancaster warned AI would lead to new ways of cheating. “I do think we’ll need to see increased security checks for exams and more training for invigilators to help them to spot disallowed devices,” he said.“Communication devices now can be as small as concealed earpieces, and there are more dangers with AI-enabled smart glasses.”Sir Ian Bauckham, the chief regulator of England’s qualifications watchdog, Ofqual, warned of the risks AI posed to the use of extended writing coursework to assess a student’s knowledge.In an interview with the Guardian, heraised concerns about the extended project qualification, an independent research project students can undertake alongside their A-levels that is the equivalent of half an A-level.“I think it’s got a really important place that is valued and universities sometimes tell us that they value it too,” he said. “So I wouldn’t want to take precipitous action on it, but I am worried about the extent to which AI may be being used to support students in that qualification.“I think anybody that wants to say we should move the exam system wholesale away from exams, where you can control the use of AI, to a space where it’s much harder to do that, which is extended writing coursework, should probably do a reality check.”Rogoyski echoed his concerns. He said: “Our assumption that you can tell a student’s mastery of a subject by asking them to write an essay is being fundamentally challenged, especially if they’re doing that work unsupervised.“We are likely to have to change exams to focus on testing their understanding of what has been written, whether by AI or human. This means vivas, or discussions, about examined topics.”He also warned there are early signs of AI-dependency emerging as students start to use the technology routinely: “The risk is that they become dependent on the AI and lose their own abilities to analyse, write, and critique subjects,” he said.On the possible benefits of AI to the exam system, Jill Duffy, the chair of the Joint Council for Qualifications board of directors and the chief executive of the OCR awards body, said exam boards were looking at how AI could speed up and improve the quality of marking.One theory is GCSE and A-level results could be delivered within a month instead of two, thanks to AI speeding up marking. OCR is using AI in trials to turn handwritten answers into digital text to cut delays caused by poor handwriting. If successful, it could mean students are offered university places based on their qualifications rather than predicted grades.Duffy agreed more vivas and other forms of oral assessment were already being used in higher education. “If we’re seeing it there, is that going to start to cross over into schools? We could see something like that,” she said.Lancaster added: “Overall, exams are here to stay in some form, but that exam form may be rather different to what it looks like now.”Explore more on these topicsEducationArtificial intelligence (AI)ExamsA-levelsGCSEsComputingSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the comet-trail of Stardew Valley, a genre is now fat with titles wherein a protagonist restarts their life and career in a bucolic, quasi-rural landscape and undertakes a blue-collar job. They get to know the local people, interfere in some lives, solve some community issues – maybe even a mystery or two. Maybe even get married. In a way, they are all Harvest Moon’s pixelated offspring – but Discounty, Crinkle Cut Games’ new offering to the genre, tackles the cozy shop life simulator a little differently.In Discounty, you are taken in by your tricky, cantankerous aunt and are put to work in her branch of a franchised supermarket. A fascinating approach, given that the road less taken through Stardew Valley involves prioritising the growth of a local supermarket rather than a community centre. Discounty is a game about business and injecting the economy of a small town. For a cozy game, there are elements of it that are very sharp indeed.View image in fullscreenSharp elements … Discounty.Photograph: Crinkle Cut GamesThe supermarket-building aspect of the game is satisfying. You purchase stock, lay it out on the shop floor, open up and let the customers buy their groceries. The till system initially operates like a tricky little basic maths puzzle, though this evolves in an interesting manner later on. Speed is paramount: don’t let the customers get grumpy, make sure the shelves are stocked, the floor is clean, things are ticking over. It’s very work-heavy, very intense – then the shop closes, you exhale, mop up the shop floor and trundle home to the funny little trailer you live in outside your aunt’s big, lush home. Aunt Tellar is a fascinating businesswoman, full of ambition – a rare, non-benevolent mentor figure. She has disagreements with the local people that you have to fix. She does, in fact, fire someone so you can come on board and take their job. This gradient of tone is really refreshing: the game isn’t clean and cutesy. It’s about operating a supermarket, not running away to a magical farm.The graphics are also a little deceptive: while you might be initially tricked into thinking the game is very pure and sweet by the pixel art, the town you move into is ragged. There is a bleak docklands. Many shop-fronts are shuttered, posters rot on the walls. These details are fantastic – reminiscent at times of Eastward. The music, too, is worth a note: ambient and pleasing. The details of this work aren’t skipped over in favour of curating a twee, relaxing vibe.Conferring with the local people does involve some solving of local issues, but also brokering supplier deals. Sometimes this requires a little massaging on your part, due to your aunt’s tricky nature. It’s high responsibility, high focus. Occasionally, the controls are a little fiddly: I found the touch-screen option on the Steam Deck a little unfocused. The initial stages of the game where you are setting up your stock and don’t have a huge amount of options are a little stressful, especially if you find the sight of basic sums on a calculator to be hard work. However, the resistance isn’t too high: I’m impressed by the way in which the challenge softens, while the intensity of each day at work notches up.Discounty is a valuable addition to the sorority of cozy, slice of life with a dream-job games. It goes a little against the grain, while still managing to hold your focus. While there is not a lot of romance in running away from your life to work in a supermarket, there is certainly a lot of good clean work to do, which still manages to feel like play.Discounty is out now onPC, PS5, Switch and Xbox, £14Explore more on these topicsGamesPCIndie gamesXbox series S/XNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5reviewsShareReuse this content"

This prequel-cum-threequel was something of a reset. Originally intended as a PS3 game thanks to its sheer technological ambition, but then released on PS2, writer and director Hideo Kojima yearned to take gravelly voiced protagonist Solid Snake away from dimly lit military bases and have him slither outdoors. Featuring hunting for food and snapping broken bones back into place, Snake Eater felt more grounded and immersive than any of its 2000sPlayStationpeers.Yet for all Snake Eater’s sweeping changes, one classic element remained intact – the stellar voice acting. It’s telling that as Konami releases its remake,Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, every wonderfully absurd line of the original script remains untouched. Boasting modernised controls and lavish new visuals, Delta feels closer to a 4K restoration of a cherished film than a maximalist Resident Evil-style remake.“To their credit, Konami didn’t want to change it or make it a different thing,” says David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake. “They really wanted it to feel like the original experience, just updated to today’s technology.”View image in fullscreen‘So cinematic’ … Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiHayter, who is also a screenwriter (he penned 2000’s X-Men film and its 2003 sequel), remains immensely proud of his role as Solid Snake, attributing his quirky performance to the unusual way the actors recorded. “When we did the first Metal Gear Solid, we recorded it in this weird house in Hollywood,” he says. “They had five mics set up, and it was just me and the other actors, and we did it all like a radio play.”It was an unusual setup: in games, voice actors largely record separately, their performances stitched together in post. Hayter found this method highly effective. “I asked it to be in my contract that we would do every other game the same way. For every Metal Gear game, I would just go into the booth and then the greatest voice actors in the world would come in and act with me for months. Having that experience on all of the games was just such a gift for a young actor.”Whereas Metal Gear Solid was largely finished when the actors recorded their roles, for Snake Eater, they were just given their cues, the spectacle left largely to their imagination. “We weren’t seeing anything,” Hayter says. “It was very difficult to grasp the full gravity of what we were doing at the time.”View image in fullscreen‘I can see why you would go back to it again and again’ … Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiIt’s a memory shared by Hayter’s costar Lori Alan, the voice of Snake Eater’s mentor and Russian double agent, the Boss. “That’s where the voice director comes in – who was amazing,” says Alan. “A recording session for this particular game is so intense. You come out and you’re like, ‘Oh my God!’ [The voice director] is in your ear whispering: ‘You love him. You trained him. You’re leaving your country!’ … It was amazing. You really do leave quite exhausted and fulfilled at the same time.”While Hayter has completed every game he’s been in, once Alan left the booth, she never truly knew the impact of the character that she’d brought to life. “We have incredible fans who have sent me bits, but I’d never played it,” says Alan. Now, 21 years later, she’s finally seen the iconic character she helped bring to life. “We were doing some promo videos for the remake,” says Hayter. “Lori said she wanted some advice on what we did 20 years ago, but it’s a little complicated to explain! So I sent her the full cutscenes from the game … and an hour or two later, I got a call and she was just in tears, [saying]: ‘Oh my God. I didn’t understand. I get it now.’”“It really is so cinematic,” Alan adds. “The complexity of the relationships is so at the forefront, it gives me chills. I got really immersed and caught up in a way that I just should have from the beginning. It’s like watching an amazing film or reading a wonderful book. I can see why you would go back to it again and again.”View image in fullscreen‘There was no need to change what was already great to begin with’ … Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.Photograph: KonamiAside from some vocal cleanups and lines about the new control schemes, the cast tell me that they didn’t add anything new to Delta. “I like to think that I’m a better actor today than I was back then,” says Hayter. “But these recordings had to match the originals perfectly – and to step into the booth and do the same role 20 years later was pretty surreal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to Harrell, she recorded her vocals with little to no direction: “I just went into the booth and laid down what felt right. I had no idea how it would sound until I actually heard it finished, and it was like, oh, wow! [Spoiler alert] That ending scene, when you’re hearing the song and she’s dying, and the red petals are coming down … even after 20 years, I still cry.”It’s a scene that still hits decades later, forcing the players to pull the trigger after an emotional final showdown – whether they want to or not. “I wanted them to put in an option where you could just shoot [the Boss] in the leg, but no dice,” says Hayter.While the very public falling out between Kojima and Konami means that Snake Eater’s director didn’t work on Delta, the publisher recruited members of the original development team to help. “For me, that thrill and that amazement I felt 21 years ago playing for the first time – that is the experience we really want to bring back,” says Yuji Korekado, producer on Delta and part of the original team. Fellow producer Noriaki Okamura adds that the aim was to be creatively conservative: “We decided that it was not necessary to add in twists or new plot points. We felt that there was no need to change what was already great to begin with.”Now, with a whole generation growing up without knowing their Raiden from their Revolver Ocelot, Hayter sees Snake Eater Delta as the perfect reintroduction to one of gaming’s most beloved series. “Somebody asked me last night, why did they start remastering with number three?” he says. “It’s because that’s the one, you know? The characters are amazing, the story is perfect – these are some of the most tragic and beautiful scenes in gaming history. It’s like living inside a great movie for 60 hours. They’re all great games, sure, but Snake Eater isthe one.”Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is released on 28 August, on PC, PS5 and XboxExplore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesPlayStationAction gamesAdventure gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What’s next?Francine ProseTrump’s attacks on the Smithsonian are meant to convince us that truth doesn’t matter and we should blindly accept his liesFri 22 Aug 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 20.15 EDTShareDonald Trump’s critique of the Smithsonian Institution for its focus on “how bad slavery was” might seem like a joke, except that, like so many of the ignorant, mean-spirited and flat-out racist opinions and directives issued by the White House over the last six months, it’s not even remotely funny.What makes it even more absurd and disturbing is that the president and his minions (JD Vance, the vice-president, sits on the Smithsonian’s board) are determined to micro-manage the exhibits and wall texts on view at the 21 museums that operate under the Smithsonian’s aegis and to replace the truth about history with “unifying and constructive descriptions”. Among the proscribed images are a picture of the former NIAID director Dr Anthony Fauci (one of the president’s perceived enemies) and a photo of immigrants watching fireworks through a gap in the border wall.Apparently, the purpose of removing programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law” is to present the American past as an unblemished landscape of positivity and perfection, to pretend that nothing wrong – let alone evil – has been done on our shores since our nation’s founding.Trump’s presidential philosophy is government by shakedown | Steven GreenhouseRead moreThe point is to create a national identity that mirrors the president’s own view of himself as a model of moral purity, an angelic being who has never made a mistake that merits an apology or even a moment of regret. If white America has never harmed, disenfranchised, enslaved and slaughtered our Black and Indigenous American populations, then clearly there’s no reason to take the measures – such as the establishment of DEI programs – designed to remedy the inequities and cruelties that the powerful have inflicted on the weak.Like many “ideas” that have been issued from the Oval Office, this one doesn’t seem to have been thought through with any clarity or even common sense. Even the most diehard Maga supporters would probably agree that slavery is, by definition, “bad”. It’s not a delusional fantasy of woke ideologues to suggest that it’s wrong to whip and shackle, to buy and sell our fellow human beings.Consequently, the only way to avoid making slavery look “bad” is not to mention it at all, not to admit that it ever existed, not to acknowledge that from our country’s inception to the end of the civil war, this crime against humanity was perfectly legal.Presumably, the history of the civil rights movement – the image of George Wallace, the Alabama governor, setting his attack dogs loose on Black demonstrators is another “bad” look for America – will also be erased from the museum walls. Why would we need to learn about the courage it took to desegregate schools and lunch counters when we have effectively censored the fact that they were ever segregated at all?To whitewash (pun intended) history, to prevent students and museumgoers from learning the truth is not only a grave insult to Black and Indigenous Americans but a problem for us all. Because the fact is that the past explains the present, and without history, there’s no way of understanding how we arrived at the current moment.Students whose teachers hope to supplement their education with a trip to the Smithsonian will leave the museum understandably perplexed. Does Donald Trump want them to conclude that the majority of Black people traveled to our shores, first class, on the ship that brought his ancestors here from Bavaria? If there was no slavery, why was the civil war fought? Did Indigenous Americans elect to have their land stolen, to be massacred and forced on to reservations, to see their children taken away and sent to harsh and punitive boarding schools?In my experience, people in general – and children in particular – know when they are being lied to. More than likely, kids will sense that something about the museum exhibit they just saw doesn’t add up, that an essential part of the story has been left out.But maybe that’s really the point. The attack on museums, like the assault on education, is meant to convince us that the truth doesn’t matter, that there is no truth, that the wisest course is to blindly accept and repeat whatever lies an authoritarian government chooses to tell.There’s some disagreement about who first said: “Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.” Some claim it was Winston Churchill, others attribute it to George Santayana. But does anyone doubt its veracity?Perhaps the most nightmarish explanation is that our current administration actuallywantsus to repeat the most loathsome events of our common past – and to be assured that every act of brutality will disappear from our collective consciousness. There’s a terrifying kind of freedom in knowing that our most odious deeds will be erased from our historical memory, that what we do now will have no consequences – indeed, no reality – in the years to come.According to the “historically accurate” museum exhibits and history books of the future, there will have been no slavery, there was no discrimination, there were no massacres of our Indigenous population. There was never a time when hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families were separated, when yet more children were stolen from their parents, when, according to the current estimate, 80,000 people – most of them entirely innocent – were imprisoned, when thousands more were kidnapped off the streets and deported from a country they had labored so hard to benefit. And none of this will be mentioned, none of this can be said or written on a wall text, lest we allow the unpatriotic ideologues to make America look bad.Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and SciencesExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpRaceCivil rights movementMuseumsSlaverycommentShareReuse this content"

Why lend it to Ozempic culture?Bryan Armen GrahamFrom Compton outsider to American nonpareil, she came to embody resistance to toxic norms. But her embrace of GLP-1 drugs feels like capitulation to ideals she once rejectedFri 22 Aug 2025 12.38 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.09 EDTShareWhen Serena Williams was featuredin a People magazine storyon Thursday morning discussing her 31lb weight loss, the rollout had all the hallmarks of an advertisement draped in the thin veil of an all-caps EXCLUSIVE.Vogue’s social channels amplifiedtheir own access, NBC’s Today showgave her a one-on-one segmentand Elle publisheda carefully packaged interviewin which Williams declared she wanted to break the stigma around weight-loss drugs, each of them in lockstep with what appeared to be a hard 9am press embargo. This vintageJill Smollerquadrafecta was not a spontaneous confessional; it was a coordinated media blitz pegged to theUS Open, the tentpole event of American tennis, which kicks off on Sunday in earnest.Yet for all the precision and polish, it was unmistakably a commercial. The product wasn’t just Williams’s refined physique, already the subject of months-long speculation among her 32 million followers across social media. It was a telehealth service called Ro – a company on whose board her husband, Alexis Ohanian, conveniently sits, a disclosure the press release at leastdid the courtesy of includingin a footnote – promoting access to GLP-1 weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound.US Open draw: Emma Raducanu faces tough route if she can beat qualifier in first roundRead moreWilliams isn’t merely dabbling in one-off spon con. Her partnership with Ro is a promised multiyear campaign across billboards, digital platforms and television spots. In the first of them shelooks into the cameraand says: “After kids, it’s the medicine my body needed.” Ro’s CEO, Zach Reitano, was explicit about why she was chosen: precisely because some will say she doesn’t need GLP-1s. “That’s why she’s perfect for it,” he explained. In other words, the point of putting Williams in the ad is to normalize weight-loss drugs as lifestyle products for people who aren’t typical patients.On Today, Williams presented herself as anything but a corner-cutter. “As an athlete and as someone that has done everything, I just couldn’t get my weight to where I needed to be at a healthy place, and believe me, I don’t take shortcuts,” she said. She recalled running and walking for hours after giving birth to her daughters, only to plateau at the same number on the scale. The Elle interview sharpened that story further: Williams spoke of 30,000-step days, four-hour summer training sessions and her coach raising concerns about her weight in the HBO documentary series Being Serena. “I needed to try something different,” she said. “Sometimes people do absolutely everything, and it doesn’t work.” Her message was clear: she had done the work, and the drug was merely the missing piece.The public response across tennis Twitter and entertainment blogs has generally been divided. Some fans expressed resignation:if even the greatest athlete of her generation needed medication to shed weight, what chance does anyone else have?Others were angry that a global sporting icon, oncecelebrated for defying toxic beauty standards, would lend her name to a pharmaceutical fad already criticized for being over-prescribed. And then there were those who shrugged that Williams had always represented the family business. Much like Taylor Swiftappearing on Travis Kelce’s podcastfeels less like happenstance than deft cross-promotion, Williams’s tie-up with Ro isn’t solely about personal health – it’s #couplegoals on a macro scale.Many saw Thursday’s collective messaging not as candor but as advertorial: personal struggle framed as stealth marketing. In an era when audiences are used to celebrities weaving mental-health confessions or fitness “journeys” into commercial deals, Williams’s campaign was interpreted less as openness than strategy. The insistence that GLP-1s aren’t an “easy way out” didn’t so much silence critics as underscore the broader worry: that even someone as disciplined as Williams needed pharmaceutical help to be deemed “healthy”, leaning in tothe very thinness culture she once resisted. To many of her admirers, this was more than a sponsorship deal – it felt like a diminishment of her athletic legacy, asuggestion that all the titles and training were still not enough in a society where appearance trumps achievement.That contrast is striking because Williams’s career was built on defiance and being the ultimate outsider. A Black Jehovah’s Witness from Compton, she kicked in the doors of a country club sport with beaded braids and an unyielding game, only to endure years of skepticism, mockery and outright racism. Yet she leveraged those pressures into dominance, winning 23 grand slam singles titles and redefining power, athleticism and relentlessness in women’s tennis. For millions of fans, she was proof that success did not require conforming to narrow ideals of beauty or femininity. She bent a sport and an industry to her will, embodying strength and resilience for generations of Black women who saw in her an avatar of possibility.View image in fullscreenSerena Williams spent almost the entirely of her 27-year career in professional tennis weathering the worst kind of body-shaming from misguided critics ... on her way to 23 major singles titles.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty ImagesBy aligning with Ro, Williams has gone from embodying resistance to helping mainstream an industry built on shrinking bodies. The woman who once crafted a superpower from her double burdens – ofbeing born a woman and being born Blackin America – has chosen to reinforce the very culture that sought to erase her. Critics argue it’s especially dissonant given her own history of nearly dying twice – oncefrom a pulmonary embolismafter stepping on broken glass, oncefrom a traumatic C-section recovery– experiences that exposed the structural failures of American healthcare,particularly for Black women. If anyone could have credibly used her platform to call for systemic reform, it was her. Instead, she’s lent her name to a for-profit enterprise that markets weight-loss drugs to those who can already afford concierge medicine.And make no mistake: this is part of a bigger push. Between 8% and 10% of Americans are now taking GLP-1s, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ro has already run a controversial subway campaign showing injected bellies and signed former NBA star Charles Barkley to inject himself on camera. Competitor Hims & Hers splashed out for a Super Bowl commercial. All have drawn fire: from politicians who complained about skipped side-effect disclosures, from activists who saw body-shaming propaganda and from doctors worried about malnourishment. Unlike traditional pharma, telehealth companies in the US don’t have to run long read-outs of risks. They can present drugs like lifestyle accessories. And now they havea real American heroas their most bankable face in the gold rush for market share.Williams is not alone in this. She joins a growing roster of celebrities who have gone public about GLP-1 use, among them Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Meghan Trainor and Amy Schumer. But if others generated curiosity, Serena brings legitimacy. Few endorsements could signal more clearly that weight-loss drugs have moved from Hollywood whispers into the glossy mainstream.The money question lingers uncomfortably. Williams is not a retired athlete scrambling for relevance. She is married to an uber-wealthy tech founder and has amassed generational wealth of her own, yet her endorsements in recent years have increasingly tracked with the aesthetics of Silicon Valley affluence and a curated tradwife domesticity, a jarring turn for someone once defined by rebellion.As a Black woman in the public eye, Williams has always faced a disproportionate level of scrutiny over her body – her musculature, her curves, her clothing choices – scrutiny that her white peers rarely endured in both volume and scale. Chris Evert wrote her apatronizing open letterdoubting her commitment. Pat Cashdeclared her washed up(in 2007!).That grim history helps explain why many of her fans in friendly spaces likethe Shade Room commentsresponded with empathy, acknowledging both the hormonal struggles she described and the impossible double bind she has lived under: at once a legend who redefined beauty and power, and a woman relentlessly policed for the body that made her great. But still others lamented the disappearance of the muscular body she once defended, and suspected that she was reshaping herself, and her brand, to fit into that conventional mold.GLP-1 drugs can be life-changing for people with obesity or diabetes. But they also underscore grotesque inequality. Wealthy Americans spend thousands a month to stop snacking. But pharmacies ration supply and insurers refuse coverage. For critics, the glamorization of the practice by Williams, once the living rebuttal to those hierarchies, only deepens the inequity. Williams’s greatness on the court is beyond any credible dispute. But her embrace of GLP-1 culture is a reminder that even the most untouchable of legendscan be co-opted, and that in a society obsessed with shrinking, even our icons are made to disappear.Explore more on these topicsSerena WilliamsTennisUS sportsUS Open tennisUS Open Tennis 2025commentShareReuse this content"

Congress and the courts must put a stop to itFri 22 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 10.42 EDTShareAmericans have long glorified their constitution and the rule of law. ButDonald Trump’s volatile and vindictive presidency has increasingly replaced that philosophy with something very different – call it “governing by shakedown”.Trump has often violated federal law, and sometimes theconstitution, as he has sought to throttle his targets – whether universities, law firms or US trading partners – in the hope that they will cry uncle and agree to his demands. This style of governance would make any caudillo proud. But it should make anyone who cares about the rule of law – and avoiding authoritarian rule – very worried.By threatening to cripple this university’s finances or that country’s exports, Trump has become the global emperor of shakedowns. It has been great for him and his ego. He dominates negotiations and news cycles, and his White House cheerleaders rush to proclaim victory whenever he reaches a deal with one of his targets.There is no ‘Trump Doctrine’ in foreign policy. Just chaos | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreClaiming that many universities haven’t done enough to combat antisemitism, Trump has demanded that Harvard, Columbia, Brown and other schools submit to his rightwing vision. Furious that some law firms have hired people or filed lawsuits he didn’t like, Trump has taken unprecedented steps to attack them unless they submitted to his demands. Trump has wreaked havoc on global diplomacy and supply chains by threatening America’s trading partners with stratospherically high tariffs unless they reached trade deals with Washington.Far too many Americans – whether senators, the media or the public – fail to realize that Trump’s attacks on these institutions evidently violate the law. Federal district courts haveruled in four casesthat Trump’s broadsides against law firms violate their free speech rights. The US court of international trade ruled that Trump’s across-the-board tariffs againstdozens of countries were illegal, concluding that Congress hadn’t given him “unbounded authority” to slap tariffs on nearly every country. (The administration is appealing that ruling.)As for Trump cutting off billions in aid and research grants to universities because of their alleged failures in responding to antisemitism, many legal experts say his administration has plainlyfailed to complywith anti-discrimination laws that require the government to follow specific procedures before penalizing universities, such as giving schools an opportunity for a hearing. Moreover, federal law says the government can halt funding to only particular university programs where noncompliance has been found, and not, for instance, to scientific research far afield from that.Last week, Trump expanded his shakedown efforts. He told the chipmaker Nvidia that he would let it sell high-end AI computer chips to China only if it paid 15% of the revenue from those sales to the US treasury. Nvidia agreed, even though Trump’s demandwas of dubious legality; the constitution prohibits the government from placing a tax on exports.Congress and the supreme court need to wake up, step up and lay down the law. They must stop Trump’s rule by shakedownTrump also threatened Brazil with a 50% tariff unless it stopped prosecuting its rightwing former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for allegedly seeking to overturn Brazil’s presidential election. When Brazil’s current president rejected that demand, saying that Trump shouldn’t be telling a sovereign democracy how to run its justice system,Trump imposed the 50% tariff. Trump’s move is an outrage because he’s seeking to strong-arm a longtime US ally over how to run its justice system and because, as Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said, this is “far outside his legal authority”.Many lawyers voiced shock and dismay when the law firm Paul, Weiss, a litigation powerhouse, reached a deal with Trump instead of fighting him. Paul, Weiss promised to provide Trump with$40m in pro bono legal servicesafter he sought to cripple the firm by suspending its security clearances and barring its lawyers from federal buildings. All told, nine law firms have reached deals with Trump, promisingnearly $1bn in pro bono services. Some legal experts call these deals illegal – one Yale law professor said “a contract that you makewith a gun to your headis not a contract”.Columbia has reacheda $221m settlementwith the Trump administration, while Brown reached a $50m deal. While denying any liability, Columbia vowed to “work on multiple fronts to combat” antisemitism and other “forms of hatred and intolerance at Columbia”. The university also pledgednot to use“race, color, sex, or national origin” in hiring decisions and said its admissions policies would be merit-based and wouldn’t “unlawfully preference applicants based on race, color, or national origin”.Columbia officials hailed one part of the deal – theTrump administrationagreed to unfreeze $1.3bn in funding.

Pozen described it as the “first-ever cutoff of congressionally appropriated funds to a university, so as to punish that university and impel it to adopt sweeping reforms, without any pretense of following the congressionally mandated procedures”. Pozen slammed this deal-by-deal style of governance as “coercive”, “arbitrary”, “deeply susceptible” to “corruption” and “corrosive to the democratic order and to law itself”.We shouldn’t be shocked that Trump acts this way. He loves dealmaking and lording it over others and he has long paid scant heed to following the law. But we should be shocked by the way the two other supposedly co-equal branches of government, Congress and the supreme court, have behaved. They have essentially rolled over in the face of Trump’s ruling by shakedown.Republican lawmakers in Congress have cravenly sat on their hands while Trump has boosted inflation and sabotaged economic growth by forcing tariffs on more than 90 countries, notwithstanding the strict restrictions Congress set on when and how a president can impose tariffs. Republicans have vowed never to raise taxes, but let’s not fool ourselves: Trump’s tariffs are a regressive sales tax that hits non-affluent Americans hardest. Republican lawmakers have also been quiet as mice while Trump has used a wrecking ball to threaten leading universities – institutions that played a vital role in making the USa world leader in medicine and many other fieldsof research.The supreme court has been strangely, worrisomely silent while Trump rules by shakedown, even as many district court judges have shown plenty of spine, ruling, for instance, that Trump’s across-the-board tariffs and assaults on law firms are illegal. When the supreme court wants to move quickly, it often finds a way. It would be great if the court moved to protect the rule of law, universities and academic freedom from Trump’s shakedowns. The court could and should issue a ruling as soon as possible that Trump violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by egregiously failing to follow its requirements before freezing universities’ funding. Similarly, the court could greatly reduce the economic mayhem that Trump’s tariffs are causing by quickly upholding the US court of trade’s ruling that Trump has far overstepped his authority to impose tariffs. But the high court been shamefully passive,even submissive.Congress and the supreme court need to wake up, step up and lay down the law. They must stop Trump’s rule by shakedown, which far too often involves capricious, vindictive dealmaking and ignores our legal rules and standards. Americans need to realize that Trump’sstyle of governanceis dangerously eroding our rule of law and democracy.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS CongressUS universitiesUS foreign policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But the US transformation calls for a Finland-style approachFri 22 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.29 EDTShareThe secondTrump administrationhas been worse thanCanada’s worst nightmare. The largest military force in the history of the world, across a largely undefended border, is suddenly under the command of a president who has called for our annexation. Canada could not be less prepared. The possibility of American aggression has been so remote, for so long, that the idea has not been seriously considered in living memory. Donald Trump has focused oneconomic rather than military pressure, but the new tone in Washington is finally forcing Canada to ask itself the most basic question: how do we defend ourselves?For most other countries in the world, self-defence is the key to national identity. Canada’s immense good fortune has been that we haven’t really needed a strong military to build our country. In the war of 1812, we were British, and the British kept us alive because we were British. There hasn’t been an attack on our homeland since. Confederation, the founding of the country, was the result of a political negotiation rather than a conquest or a violent independence movement. Our military was based on a fundamental assumption about our place in the world, and the nature of the world itself. Our place in the world was to contribute to the global order. The global order shared our fundamental values. Peacekeeping was more our style than defense.Recently, I’ve been working onGloves Off, a podcast about how Canada can protect itself from any threat emanating from the US, and from every other country in the world now that the US is no longer our protector and guardian. The consensus from military and security experts is that we would be “a snack”.It is far from unusual for countries sliding toward authoritarianism, such as the the United States, to use foreign engagements to justify the suspension of their own laws.Trumphas already started trumping up crazy excuses for anti-Canadian sentiment – a supposed flow offentanylover theborderand othernonsense. His ambassador says Trump thinks our boycotts make us“nasty” to deal with.So what does Canada need to do to develop the capacity to defend itself?The good news is that Canada’s new reality is far from unique. In fact, it’s the historical norm.Finlandis a potential model for us. It has lived its entire existence next to a belligerent country that is either expanding imperially or collapsing dangerously. The Finns do not have nuclear weapons. They are only 5.5 million people, next to Russia’s 143 million.The period we are entering is a period of deep chaos. Any reliance on international institutions and their restoration is a false hopeFinland’s strategy is whole society defence. Matti Pesu, a senior research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, and a reserve commander of an armoured personnel carrier, explained that whole society defence does not pretend to be able to overcome a potential Russian onslaught. “Power asymmetry is an absolutely essential factor in the Finnish security thinking,” he told me. “Given how much bigger Russia is, in order to thwart that potential threat, we need to mobilize broadly the resources available in society.”Because Finland is geared, throughout its national institutions, towards self-defence, its resistance toRussiais credible. The idea is not to match Russian military capacity, but to make the conquest of Finland not worth the trouble. “Full societal resources of a smaller nation can actually be enough to thwart the potential threat from a larger power because the costs for the larger power to invade could actually be much higher than the potential benefits it would gain from such an invasion,” Pesu explains. The more capable a country is of causing pain to occupiers, the less likely the occupation happens in the first place.Conscription is essential. The Finns can put a million soldiers in the field within 72 hours. But every facet of Finnish government, from the healthcare system to the national broadcaster, has a role in the security system, and knows its role in a possible military conflict. “A preparedness mindset permeates the whole society,” Pesu says. “From the state level all the way to an individual living somewhere in the country.”To rise to Finland’s level, Canada would need to reorchestrate its entire frame of reference. The prime minister, Mark Carney, has recently announced seriousbooststo national military spending: 2% by the end of this year, rising to 5% at some point in the future. But the government has pushed its readiness targets back to 2032. And those are targets that align with our typical military practices: meeting our commitments to our alliances. That money sounds good on a theoretical level. But the Canadian military situation has not fundamentally altered. We have not reset our position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, it’s taking cues from him | Shiri Pasternak and Dayna Nadine ScottRead moreThe period we are entering is a period of deep chaos, of the weakening of international institutions, of multiple, interlocked collapses. Any reliance on international institutions and their restoration is a false hope. If Canada is to remain a stable democracy, we will have to find the stability in ourselves. A whole society defence would bolster us against the chaos that threatens us from every side and from within. In an era of splintering society, conscription is a force of unification, what Pesu calls “a strong democratic linkage”. Canada is a big country, with huge geographical and demographic diversity. We are as vulnerable as any other society to the informational chaos that is overtaking the world, to the incipient breakdown. A whole society defence would be a massive force for unification. It would establish, to Canadians at least, that there are crises we are going to face and we need to face them collectively. The thing about a whole society defence is that it determines that you are living in a whole society, a society thatneedsdefending.Canada has no history of needing to defend itself. In fact, not needing a military is baked into our national identity – and that creates a psychological bind. To preserve who we are, we have to overcome one of our oldest tendencies, one of our best tendencies: our peace-loving nature, our idea of our country as an escape from history rather than its perpetrator or victim.And that leads to a very scary question: what will be the crisis that makes us realize that we need whole society defence? Let us hope it won’t be Canada’s last.Stephen Marche lives in Toronto and is the author of The Next Civil War and On Writing and FailureExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationFinlandRussiaUS politicsEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

People in Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Dnipro and even Kharkiv could sleep, but they did not. They were waiting for news from Alaska. I was also awake and watching the news feed, aware that this meeting would lead to nothing, or worse, something bad for Ukraine. But in difficult, seemingly hopeless situations, human nature is prone to desperate optimism. In the middle ages, people often hoped for a miracle, forgetting about the logic of events. So, the night of 15 August was a night of hope for a miracle, which, of course, did not happen.Unlike on the eve of the Alaska meeting, in Ukraine, there was no particular tension in the buildup to the meeting of European leaders at the White House on Monday, despite images of a hugely powerful team arriving in Washington. Ukrainians seemed to sense that this meeting had to be visually positive in order to push into the shadethe Alaska meeting, which ended in nothing, if not actual failure.The meeting demonstrated, in equal measure, the continuation of Europe’s support for Ukraine and Europe’s concern over the unpredictable position of President Trump, for whom the goal is simply a quick end to the war, rather than achieving a fair peace.A fair peace, that is the liberation of territories seized by Russia and the restoration of Ukraine within its constitutional geographical borders, is increasingly becoming adream that only Ukrainians have the right to cherish. Our partners have fallen quiet about this obvious prerequisite to a fair peace, although they do not openly talk about the opposite – about the “need” to yield to the “inevitable” loss of a large part of Ukrainian territory.While the meeting in Alaska was greeted with hundreds of ironic comments on social media, Ukrainians took the White House gathering much more seriously. They do not overestimate the outcomes, but they are quietly satisfied to see President Trump looking cheerful in such obviously pro-Ukrainian company.A bilateral meeting between President Zelenskyy and Putin isviewed as unlikelyand Ukrainians are sure that Putin will do everything possible to avoid one. Putin has repeatedly questioned Zelenskyy’s legitimacy as president and meeting the Ukrainian leader would fly in the face of that stance. But, if we try to imagine how a bilateral meeting might go, logically an easy issue should be dealt with first – a minor question on which agreement could be achieved, paving the way for more difficult topics.2:40EU leaders present united front for ceasefire in Ukraine and 'pressure on Russia' – videoBut today, between Ukraine andRussiathere are no easy issues. The exchange of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children and civilians from Russia to Ukraine have long been addressed with a degree of success by a separate team of employees. All other points for discussion are extremely difficult; for example, a mutual ceasefire or a mutual cessation of shelling with missiles and drones, or the status of captured territories and territories that Russia is still planning to capture.The format of such a tete-a-tete meeting is therefore much more likely to be two short monologues, but certainly not a dialogue. A three-person meeting with President Trump as a moderator could be more productive, but surely Trump will only agree to this if he is confident that at least something will be achieved. Otherwise, again, as after the Alaska meeting, his reputation will take a beating.For most Ukrainians, the very fact of ajoint visit to Washingtonby President Zelenskyy and the leaders of the European Union and Britain is more important than the post-meeting announcement about the agreement on the purchase of US weapons by Europe for Ukraine, which has long been understood as a done deal.Four key takeaways from Trump’s White House summit on UkraineRead moreThe most interesting aspect of the meeting – the content of the telephone conversation between Trump and Putin after the tete-a-tete with Zelenskyy – remains an unknown, but press reports pointing to Hungary as a potential meeting place are worrying. Putin’s visit to Alaska was presented by Russian media as a victory – Russia’s strongman breakout from global isolation. A meeting on EU soil, if it does take place, will be presented as Russia’s final victory in its fight to make the civilised world recognise its right to violate any international law without bearing the least responsibility for violating the rights of other states to a peaceful life within their geographical borders.When the White House talks ended, Russian drones and missiles attacked energy infrastructure facilities in the Poltava region. Dozens of explosions thundered across the cities of Kremenchuk and Lubny. Residents were unlikely to be interested in the results of the White House meeting the next morning.This week has seen the mutual escalation of military action. Many Ukrainian cities have been hit hard but Russia has also felt the power of Ukrainian drones, which have seriously damaged large oil refineries and exacerbated Russia’s gasoline shortages. At the same time, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has declared as totally unacceptable Trump and European leaders’ proposals tointroduce European peacekeeping troops into Ukraine. Putin has also made it clear that a meeting with Zelenskyy would be possible only if Ukraine first agreed to all of Russia’s demands. In other words, if Ukraine agreed to capitulate.Thus, all of Trump’s peace plans once again have turned out to be an illusion, and the only person who has not yet realised this is the US president. Perhaps the Russian missiles thatexploded on Thursdayat the American electronics plant Flex, located in western Ukraine, near the border with Hungary, were meant as a clarifying message for Trump. Both the production lines and warehouses of the US plant, which had been operating since 2012, were destroyed.Putin’s explosive message was directed to at least two addressees: Trump, who must now understand that Putin is no longer interested in telephone conversations or invitations to Alaska, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Orbán thought Russia had agreed to spare the Zakarpattia region of Ukraine and its ethnic Hungarian population in return for his pro-Russian stance. Recently, however, Orbán has felt pressure to alter his position. Ina phone callto the Hungarian prime minister, Trump insisted that Orbán should not interfere with Ukraine’s possible accession to the EU.Perhaps it was during this conversation, in order to improve the mood of the US president, that Orbán suggested Budapest as the place for a one-on-one between Zelenskyy and Putin, hoping that the next meeting in the presence of Trump would also take place in the capital of Hungary. Putin doesn’t like it when someone decides for him where, and with whom, he should meet.Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and author of Death and the PenguinExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Rachel Reeves is bound by a manifesto commitment not to raise the big three – income tax, national insurance or VAT – and having already slapped businesseswith a national insurance risein her inaugural budget last year, she faces having to think about creative ways to raise revenue.The past few weeks, we have seen a bewildering parade of policies emerging from Treasury sources. These includereforms to inheritance tax,replacing stamp dutywith a national proportional property tax for homes worth more than £500,000, replacing council tax with a local proportional property tax levied on house values up to £500,000 with a minimum annual bill of £800 paid by the property owner, and apotential capital gains tax (CGT)on primary residences valued at more than £1.5m.The government is right that Britain’s property tax system is in desperate need of reform. The current council tax system is regressive and outdated, based on property values from 1991, and stamp duty is a punitive brake on mobility. However, the solutions being floated risk creating new problems while failing to solve the old ones.Take the proposed mansion tax by another name: a CGT on primary homes worth more than £1.5m. In principle, it targets unearned wealth gains on the most valuable properties. But once you do the maths, its flaws become glaringly apparent. Unlike second homes or buy-to-lets, a primary residence has always been exempt from CGT. Introducing it would create a huge disincentive for people to sell. It would trap older homeowners in houses too large for them, stifling the property market for families below.Otherproposalsthe government is looking at, including a new tax on homes sold for more than £500,000, are thin on detail. (Although they are reportedly underpinned by a wider set of reforms in apaper from the thinktank Onward.) The tax would only kick in once you sell; it is not yet clear how this would differ substantially from stamp duty.In this same set of proposals, a £500,000 threshold is also applied for those paying more towards a new property tax that would replace council tax. Such a threshold risks many ordinary people who own their properties in London and the south-east struggling to pay. For renters, this new property tax is paid by the owner. However, there is no modelling on probable ripple effects on rental prices. Making London even more unaffordable to live in will not help Reeves’s economic growth prospects in the short term.Adding council tax bands for the most expensive homes is a potential short-term solution to help ease the inherent unfairness at the top, but it would not address regional price disparities. There are more progressive approaches to council tax, such as those set out byFairer Share, which advocates for an annual flat-rate tax that would see the wealthiest pay more and any increase in local taxes capped to protect the “asset-rich cash-poor”.Here is the crucial issue with the focus on property taxes: while most people hold their wealth primarily in their property, the richest do not. A 2020 study by the Resolution Foundation, using data from 2016 to 2018, found that on average in households with assets of £5m or more, property accountedfor less than 20% of their total wealth. Instead, the wealth of the top 1% is dominated by stocks, shares, bonds and other financial investments. Financial wealth is significantly more prevalent in the wealthiest households and is a major driver of their rising net worth and inequality.Inheritance tax does take forms of wealth beyond property into account, but here we come up against a significant political barrier. Understandably, people have an emotional connection with wanting to leave their homes to their kids, particularly amid a housing affordability crisis that has for many made it close to impossible to get on the property ladder without family support. Both the design and the communications of any reforms to this tax must focus on truly large dynastic wealth – by reforming the sorts of trusts that allowed the previousDuke of Westminster to pass on £9bnto his son without paying inheritance tax – rather than the modest wealth of ordinary families, otherwise it risks a huge political fallout.Why radical tax reform may be only way for Reeves to balance the booksRead moreThis brings us back to a straightforward annual wealth tax. A modest levy of 2% on individual net wealth exceeding £10m. It is focused on inequality. It would raise substantial revenue; estimates suggestmore than £24bn annually.And crucially, it applies to total net wealth (including assets such as stocks, bonds and property, minus debts). And no – well-designed wealth taxes in Europe have not caused the capital flight critics often prophesied, and dodgy data flouted in recent months has been found to bewildly exaggerated. The political argument is just as powerful. Polling consistently shows it is very popular, with75% of the public backing a wealth tax, including Reform UK voters.Of course, given that we don’t know the full value of what the richest have, there are administrative hurdles, but these are not insurmountable. The chancellor should announce more resources for HMRC to do the much-needed scoping work, and we can learn lessons from wealth taxes in comparable European countries.People in the UK need to feel a real improvement to their quality of life. If they don’t, this government simply won’t last long enough to bring in any of the changesit is proposing. Instead of tinkering around the edges, with a wealth tax the government could win the argument on fairness – and finally start to reverse toxic wealth inequality in this country.Faiza Shaheen is executive director ofTaxJustice UKDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their accusations covered all manner of misconduct: sexual harassment, unwanted touching and groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour, taking and sharing sexually explicit pictures and videos without consent, and bullying.The allegations spanned a long period, from 2004 to 2019 and were the basis ofa powerful series of Guardian articlesanda podcast, which led to Clarke suing the Guardian.The six-week trial took place in the high court in March and April,and the judgment came in today. Mrs Justice Steyn ruled that what the Guardian published was true, and that publishing it was in the public interest.The judge praised our reporters’ and editors’ exhaustive approach to covering the story and noted the “extensive efforts they made to investigate, test and corroborate the information they received, and not to publish allegations which they could not substantiate”.It is an overwhelming victory for the women who spoke to us, for the Guardian, and for investigative journalism in Britain.Almost every day over my decade as editor-in-chief of the Guardian I have had to take difficult decisions. In many ways, deciding to fight Noel Clarke’s defamation claim was not one of them. I believed from the start this was a case we needed to see through to the end – primarily, of course, for the women who had spoken to us for our original investigation, and those who then came to the court to give testimony.I remember when I was first told about the investigation: what struck me was the sheer scale of it all.In cases where there are claims of sexual misconduct, even post the #MeToo movement, it is rare to find women who are prepared to speak to journalists. When you’re talking about someone who is much more powerful than you are, and is a big name in the film and TV industry, it’s a huge risk. Yet every time I received an update from the investigations team, the numbers of women had risen. Within days, we had more than a dozen sources.By the time we had published our first investigation we had heard credible first-hand allegations from 22 women, and our superb reporters had done extensive work on corroboration. By the time we published our last article, we had spoken to more than 100 sources.At trial we were able to rely on testimony from 26 different people, some of whom had travelled to the high court from abroad.The many women who came to give testimony in court did not flinch, despite the often intimidating tactics used to try to deter them both before and during the trial. I attended court most days and found it very moving that so many of the women came forward and spoke so powerfully and with such commitment about some of the worst times of their lives. As the great British writer, actor and director Michaela Coelwroteabout our sources: “Speaking about these incidents takes a lot of strength because some call them ‘grey areas’. They are, however, far from grey. These behaviours are unprofessional, violent, and can destroy a person’s perception of themselves, their places in the world, and their career irreparably.”One of those witnesses, Gina Powell, a former employee of Clarke’s, was an important source in our reporting and a witness at the trial in March. Powell accused Clarke of sexually assaulting her and told the court that she was speaking up because she did not think he should be “around young women in the film industry”. Her decision to speak out, like that of all of our witnesses, was incredibly brave. In addition to calling her an impressive, honest, compelling witness who did not overstate or exaggerate any of the matters she addressed, Mrs Justice Steyn said of her: “Courage is not evinced by the absence of fear but by mastering it, and Ms Powell demonstrated admirable bravery and integrity.”The Guardian stood by Gina and all these women, and the media as a whole will benefit from the bravery the women showed, thanks to a judgment that has fully vindicated their decision to come forward.So this judgment is a victory for them.It is also an important exoneration of the Guardian – our reporters, editors and lawyers. Investigative journalism is risky and expensive, and reporting that involves allegations of sexual misconduct is famously extremely challenging to publish.There is the constant threat of litigation, which is unpleasant and time-consuming. There is the toll that it takes on the witnesses, who may have already suffered abuse, and who can often, understandably, feel they cannot put themselves through the trauma of a gruelling court case.That’s also something faced by our journalists. Six of us were cross-examined in the high court. One reporter was on the stand for three days. Another was the subject of extremely personalised questioning. Baseless allegations of a “conspiracy” were levelled. All performed superbly, standing up for journalism in the public interest, standing up for the Guardian.And then there is the threat of ruinous costs. At one point, and doubtless in an attempt to force us to settle the case on his terms before the trial, Noel Clarke tried to increase his damages claim to the eye-watering sum of £70m.The Guardian is lucky to have the support of the Scott Trust behind us – our owners, who are committed to journalism in the public interest rather than pursuing commercial or political interests.

Think of it as the Mirror Universe version of when Tony Abbott appointed himself Minister for Women, except this time a feminist champions men’s social health and, you know, actually likes you.This week, the male friendship recession is our subject of shared concern. The Guardian reported a month ago concerning data from (where else?) America, which spoke to an observabledecline in the prevalence of male friendship, with some notable demographic implications.Datafrom the Survey Center on American Life revealed 15% of men said they didn’t have “close friends” in 2021, compared with only 3% in 1990 while those reporting 10 or more close friends had decreased from 33% to 13% during the same period.Acknowledging that these figures were skewed by more male loneliness among heterosexual men than their gay brothers, the Guardian interviewed men working to facilitate male friendship outside the “third spaces” of congregation, activity and entertainment outside the home and work that queer male communities built for themselves.Creating better infrastructure for heterosexual male socialisation is a public health necessity, given that the isolation and loneliness reported in the wake of shrinking friendship networks has dire health implications. You can truststudiesthat repeatedly demonstrate that “those who experience social deficits, including isolation, loneliness, and poor-quality relationships, are more likely to die earlier, regardless of the cause of death”, or you can remember how mad we all went during Covid lockdowns and just imagine that being the rest of your life.Labor MP Dan Repacholi on masculinity, men’s health and why he was ‘embarrassed’ to visit his doctorRead moreSadly, the figures in Australia seem to be following the US pattern, withstudies from 2020showing similar implications: “men who reported lacking close friends or relatives were around twice as likely to have thought about suicide in the past 12 months”. Otherlocal studiesexposedthe loneliest age group of Australian men was middle aged (35-49 years), who were “three times more likely to feel high-level loneliness than men aged over 65”.It’s this demographic distinction amid rates of friendship decline that underscore how the phenomenon isn’t rooted in biological destiny, but rather in the way western culture’s changing paradigms of masculinity straitjacket modern straight men into rituals and behaviours that denude them of connections and expose them to harm.Patriarchy – spoiler – is bad for men, too.Claims that men struggle to form friendships because of traditions of stoic masculinity’s model of consistently performed toughness and invulnerability do not really square with older generations of men having more friends and being more socially integrated, when performances of toughness in previous eras included resolving conflicts through violence and conscription in actual war. My grandad saw active service in the second world war and was, by all reports, great fun at a party.Claims that work obligations make it hard to find time to socialise also do not hold up to scrutiny because women of the same generational experience maintain powerful social connections despite their double modern burden of meeting work and care commitments.Clearly, what we are doing to the loneliest cohort is cultural but also new. And it’s becoming more of a problem: a shocking 25% of US boys and men aged 15 to 35 reported “feeling lonely for a lot of the previous day” as per a recentGallup poll.Are young women finally being spared the unique cruelty of male literary opinions? | Van BadhamRead moreIt’s tempting to blame technology – but how do we explain the fact that women, girls and gay men have the same technology available to them but don’t seem to suffer the same misery? This also goes for the shrinking “third space” thesis, in which the fading social associations built around church attendance, union membership, and community and sporting clubs have impeded social connections, again, disproportionately.Rather, we might consider that an intersecting number of cultural changes are meeting new variations of old gender roles in a particularly destructive way, and with fewer social points of connection to bulwark men against them.If there is an explanation for the “skibidi toilet” theory of young male social detachment, in which “hyper-chaotic media serves as both entertainment and an ambient worldview for young men raised online” we can reasonably assume its generation “fluent in irony but starved for meaning” has been created from specific gender targeting that niche marketing delivers through the internet and other media, affirming and amplifying the kind of gender role modelling through which parents – often unwittingly – channel their children into by, for example, reading to their girls but not their boys.For young men, whether it’s selling gaming consoles, supplements or Andrew Tate hate material, the convenient marketing message is instrumentalisation is more valuable to men than friendship.This is to apportion zero blame to parents, given that parenting is hard and as subject to the forces of history as any other institution. It’s not only the bloody internet and ruthless marketeers and capitalist labour exploitation that have encouraged the desocialisation of men. It’s not only the prevalence of technology. It’s that the pre-internet “Satanic Panic” disinformation event of the 1980s fostered a “stranger danger” anxiety that relocated children from open world roaming to controlled environments, in which messaging – loaded with old gendered instructions and new microtargeting – can assume more heft than lived experience.The children of the Satanic Panic generation are the lonely middle age men of today. Their isolation suggests the real “stranger danger” was who we let into the house.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

I first came across it as the epigraph to The Government Inspector, Gogol’s 1836 masterpiece satirising corruption and hypocrisy in the provinces of the tsar’s empire.The phrase sprang to mind last week when I learned that a 21st-century government inspector is displeased with things I have written about Vladimir Putin and his imperial war against Ukraine – the land of Gogol’s birth. This I know because my name has been added to the“stop list”, a growing roster of undesirable elements – politicians, journalists, charity workers, consultants – banned from entering the Russian federation.The Russian foreign ministry said this was a retaliation for “London’s continued confrontational course” in supplying weapons to “the neo-Nazi Kiev regime”. Since I’m not an arms dealer, my inclusion on the list must be for the subsidiary offence of spreading “anti-Russia narratives”.Presumably, that relates tomy characterisation of Putinas a venal despot and ideological crackpot, whose unprovoked attack on Ukraine was as strategically ill-conceived as it was murderous. I can see why the Kremlin’s inspectorate of media narratives might recoil from the sight of such blood-soaked crookedness, but like the proverb says, that’s not the mirror’s fault.The statement of sanctions is sinister and absurd. It is written with the combination of bombast and menace that Russians recognise as the idiom of capricious, vindictive bureaucracy with deep roots. It is familiar to generations that grew up in the Soviet Union, steeped in the self-satirising pomp of a thin-skinned power that you can’t take seriously in private but are careful not to ridicule in public.It is older even than that. Gogol was a master at capturing social deformations that arise from a duty of deference to dysfunctional autocracy, holding a mirror up to all the grotesque and preposterous contortions. At the end of The Government Inspector, the disgraced town mayor turns to the audience. “Who are you laughing at?” he asks. “You’re laughing at yourselves.”The bleak absurdity of Putin’s rule is not lost on Russians, not all of them. But any jokes have to be coded, discreet, transmitted in glances and arch references. The country has a knack for dark humour that tracks its long habituation to repression. It’s one of the traits, first encountered in translation, that made me want to study the language, and then led me to fall in love with the place when I lived there as a student more than 30 years ago. It’s one of the reasons I stay invested in the relationship, albeit now in a condition of forced estrangement.I have spent a lot of time engrossed in the works of novelists and poets, giants of world literature to whom monuments are erected and after whom streets are named, who would be denounced for disseminating “anti-Russia narratives” if they were writing today. I have enough Russian friends to know that there are stories other than the onestold by Putin’s propagandistsabout a president who is the incarnation of heroic national destiny.I know liberals who have fled their homeland, and more who have retreated to that place of interior exile, where the clear-eyed dissident spirit takes refuge from public delirium. I know there is more than one Russia and that describing atrocities perpetrated by the state is not synonymous with hostility to the people.Dictators always conflate those things. Nationalists always seek a harmonious alignment of governing institutions, ruling party and cultural identity. The regime decides which traits, symbols and opinions qualify as correct expressions of nationhood. Divergence is anathematised as degenerate or treasonous. This might start as a process of narrowing, pinching and whittling to fit the subtle, complex contours of a variegated nation into a rigid doctrinal frame. It soon turns to pressing and beating, hacking away at awkward protrusions of independent thought.As nationalism turns more radical it tends inevitably to violence, first rhetorical but soon physical. Disloyal thought must be excised. The seditious imagination must be suffocated. Political opposition must be cast as the pawn of nefarious foreign nations, against whom war must be waged to galvanise patriotic spirit.Putin has marched Russia a long way down that road, deep into the bloody quagmire inUkraine. Less documented, also violent but more successful, is the Kremlin’s campaign against Russian pluralism. It is a war on the very idea of Russia as a people whose history transcends the martial cliches trotted out by their banal brute of a president; whose cultural greatness is expressed in the tradition of resistance, not the demand for submission.Maybe I am a partisan of that cause, but it isn’t an anti-Russia narrative. It isn’t the people holding the mirror who make Putin’s regime crooked. Who are you blaming, guys? Blame yourselves.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRussiaOpinionEuropeVladimir PutinUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a disturbing new realityEnver SolomonFar-right influencers are menacing charities and individuals to further isolate the people we work with. Ensuring safety is now part of the jobFri 22 Aug 2025 05.23 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 06.13 EDTShareIn today’s social media age, one version of events spreads like wildfire. So it is fast becoming accepted in the national conversation that all men risking life and limb to cross the Channel in flimsy vessels are dangerous people who are likely to abuse women and girls. The leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch,went so far as to saythat, because of rising numbers coming in small boats, women had “stopped jogging in the park because there are men lurking in bushes”.As the political rhetoric has become more toxic, andespecially this week, the real-world consequences for those inside the hotels and for organisations like my own and many others in the charity and statutory sector become more dire.The plight of the asylum seekers themselves must stay front and centre. On the street they have faced verbal abuse and hostility. Shouts of “Go home, scumbag” and more hate-filled language are not uncommon. I met an African man in his 60s living in the north-east recently who in May, not long after theprime minister told the country“we risk becoming an island of strangers”, was set upon by a group of men and suffered a broken arm. He was so terrified he didn’t want to leave his accommodation for weeks on end.But the threats are not just aimed at them; also being targeted are those who seek to help them. Thinking about personal safety at work has become part and parcel of the job. I am now even being advised to consider my own home security. This was unimaginable nearly five years ago, when I started my role.At the Refugee Council we work in communities with refugees including on some allotments, where they love to grow food. In one northern town, well before the riots last summer that saw asylum seekersburned outof a Rotherham hotel, ours was the only allotment patch that was firebombed one night. We now tell staff not to wear their lanyards, so they’re not visible when out and about as they’ve had abusive comments.View image in fullscreenFire at the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, 26 November 2024.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAWe aren’t alone. Far-right influencers are targeting the refugee sector, posting pictures of chief executives and naming them. Leaders in recent weeks have had to come to terms with a new normal whereby they have to think about their and their staff’s safety both on and offline.Some of the organisations targeted are small and community-rooted without the capability and infrastructure of larger organisations to put in place sophisticated risk assessments and security procedures.And then there are the lone individuals who want to threaten and scare us. I know of leaders not just in the charity sector but also in the statutory sector who have received threatening handwritten messages saying they and their families aren’t safe.Those who have worked with refugees for decades tell me they have never known a time when the hostility has been so strong and the environment so toxic. And it ripples out so that support which would be in place is withdrawn. I’ve been told about food banks that did provide assistance to any person who needed it turning away people they believe to be “foreigners” with no right to be in the UK.Hidden from public view, the poisoned political environment on asylum is having consequences not seen before. The narrative that refugees and migrants are the root of all our problems means that they and those who work with them are firmly in the line of fire, seen as legitimate daily targets of hate.It is not too late, however, to pull back from the brink. There is a role for government: to try to neutralise the toxicity by not only focusing on fixing the dysfunctional and costly asylum system, but also by articulating a pride in Britain that celebrates our diversity and integration story. One that saw Mo Farah,himself a victim of traffickingwho was given safety in our country, proudly wrap himself in the union jack every time he won one of his Olympic gold medals.We have a choice. As a nation, we can drift further into a world of division and hate. Or we can celebrate British values of fairness, tolerance and compassion, and focus on the importance of a shared community that so many Britons believe in.The direction of travel our prime minister and his government choose to take feels more important than it has ever been in the seven decades of the Refugee Council’s history. We look to our political leaders to do far more to bring an end to the division and hate and say clearly: this is not who we are.Enver Solomon is chief executive of the Refugee CouncilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You decideEllie Chowns,Adrian RamsayandZack PolanskiAs the party members choose their new leader, Guardian readers quiz the three hopefuls about class, Reform UK, Corbyn and the EUFri 22 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTShareIf the voting age drops to 16, how will you encourage young people to take part?Danny Braverman, 63, SuffolkEllie Chowns and Adrian Ramsay: Young people face intergenerational injustice in many areas, from housing to education, and need to see they can make a difference through politics. Not least to the climate and nature crises that threaten to destroy their future – which is one reason we need to keep this primary focus. Adrian joined the Green party at 16, co-founded the Young Greens and has consistently championed youth representation. Ellie – as councillor, MEP and MP – has encouraged young people’s involvement, pushing for youth inclusion on local boards, taking groups to the EU and Westminster parliaments, and setting up the West Midlands Youth Climate Assembly.Zack Polanski: Inspire them. Listen to them. Involve them.Young people face stagnant wages, high costs and the climate crisis. Why would they engage unless they can feel it makes a real difference? We need every young person to experience their power early on – through local campaigns, climate action or activism. As deputy leader, I’ve consistently amplified youth voices. As leader, I’ll turn the volume up.Danny Braverman:I’m disappointed with both responses. Representative democracy will not motivate the very many disengaged young people. Radicalism lies in participatory democracy, such asregional youth citizens assemblies.I’d like to see Zach as the new leader. He’s the nearest to my own politics. I’d describe myself as a watermelon: green on the outside, red on the inside, with some black anarchist pips for good measure.What role does class have in your understanding of the world?Simon Legg, 71, FelixstoweEC & AR:The widening inequality and deepening poverty that blight so many lives are so clearly linked to the concentration of more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands. Those with the least are the first to be hit hard by climate breakdown, and a just transition to a zero-carbon world can’t happen without much greater redistribution of wealth. At the heart of Green politics – and our personal values – is a commitment to the fundamental equality of all people, to breaking down barriers and sharing resources fairly. Politics is how we can reverse the market’s tendency to concentrate wealth and power.ZP:Class is central. Without fair wages, resources and skills, other inequalities persist. We must be rooted in working-class communities. People know that the super rich and corporations are destroying our environment, communities and democracies. This isn’t “us v them” – it’s all of us, building change from the grassroots up.Simon Legg:These are decent answers to a questionthat could legitimately be answered in innumerable ways.If the Greens were in a position to join a coalition government, what policies would you insist were adopted?Hana Prosser, 56, OxfordEC & AR:With the political landscape shifting at incredible speed, we see this as an entirely possible scenario. We’d focus on three things: electoral reform, fair taxation of extreme wealth to invest in public services, and strong climate and nature action. The introduction of a proportional voting system would be a complete game changer, and we’d want this to be a red line in negotiations. First past the post leaves millions of people feeling unrepresented, driving cynicism and disillusionment with politics – which are deeply corrosive to democracy. It also raises the risk of an extremist government elected on a minority of votes.ZP:A wealth tax to tackle inequality.Proportional representation (PR) so every vote counts.Serious climate action, starting with a nationwide home-insulation rollout.These are red lines about fairness, democracy and a liveable planet.Hana Prosser: 10/10 for ambition! I appreciateZack identifying specific policy actions. But are three red lines realistic? I fear the Greens either presenting an indigestible package deal to coalition partners or, once in government, becoming Lib Dem-style hostages to fortune.Ellie and Adrian’s single red line – PR – seems more credible.Polls suggest the new party being formed by Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana could secure 10% of the vote. Should the Greens explore a pact with it?David Lowry, 68, EwellEC & AR:We’re always ready to work constructively with other parties where we agree, and often do so in parliament – including with Jeremy and Zarah. We’re open in principle to electoral alliances to stop Reform UK, but this would need to be a wider collaboration to be effective. And unless there are clear commitments to a fair voting system, and to tackling the climate and nature crises, there will be major differences between us. It’s crucial for the Green party to keep its distinctive identity, offering a genuinely fresh vision of a fairer, greener country with much broader appeal than an old left party.ZP:I have huge respect for both Zarah and Jeremy and have shared many platforms with them for a whole variety of campaigns – most recently against the genocide in Gaza. But the party doesn’t exist yet, so it’s far too soon for electoral pacts. Right now we need coalitions of ideas, working with anyone who shares our values of environmental, social, racial and economic justice. I do already consider them allies – the actual fight must be against Reform UK and this failing Labour government.David Lowry: I think the concerns of Ellie and Adrian that the new progressive party might not support a fair voting system are misplaced. It is in their own electoral interest to do so.Climate change and biodiversity loss are likely to result in medical crises against which the UK has little defence. How do you plan to mitigate them?Rajarshi Raychaudhuri, 58, DudleyEC & AR:We need to treat the climate and nature emergencies as the public health threats they are – and that means action across all areas of society and theeconomy. We’re already pressing hard for these: affordable, warm, net-zero housing for all, resilient to overheating and to flooding; good public transport, and safe walking and cycling; sustainable, healthy food systems. Tackling the climate crisis means fixing our food, housing and transport systems and more – doing this will hugely increase our resilience and health, as well as directly reducing emissions. Building resilience to climate impacts is vital to our national security.ZP:I’ve chaired the environment committee in the London Assembly for the past few years and produced a report with University College London which includes recommendations for mitigation of emissions and climate adaptation.We need to make sure active travel and public transport are properly resourced, the cheapest option and accessible to all.We need to make sure that we’re also building the infrastructure we need to tackle climate disasters such as wildfires and floods, including nature-friendly solutions.And we needto co-design (including usingcitizens assemblies) so people are involved with the decision-making process rather than have things done to them.Rajarshi Raychaudhuri: My question dealt specifically with climate change, biodiversity loss and a medical catastrophe,like the Covid-19 pandemic, which was more likelya result of biodiversity loss than US scaremongering. I note that the answer, while apparently audacious and impressive, doesnotdeal with the question. However, having been an enthusiastic environmental activist in my youth, I continue to hope. I shall certainly follow the progress of the candidates with great interest.If 50% of the electorate believes a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote, how would you convince people that a vote for Green wouldn’t be a vote for Reform UK?Adam Butlin, 26, LondonEC & AR:Such arguments have been used to prop up the failed two-party system for decades. Now it’s blown wide open, and there are huge opportunities for the Greens. Under Carla Denyer and Adrian’s leadership, we’ve shown we can win parliamentary seats everywhere, from big cities to rural constituencies. In local elections we’ve gained every year for the past eight years, and Green councillors have earned strong trust. Voters can now see clearly that if you vote Green, we can win Green. That appeals not just to those disillusioned with the old politics but to all those hopeful for a greener, fairer future.ZP:We now have four MPs, three London Assembly members and more than 800 councillors. We got nearly 2 million votes and 39 second-place finishes – we’re planning to turn them into MPs at the next general election. My central mission is to make Keir Starmer more worried about losing votes and ultimately losing more seats to the Green party than to Reform UK. Until he feels that electoral pressure from his left, this country will continue to veer to the right. It seems that no marginalised group is off the table for cruelty. We stop that happening right now by growing the Green party.Adam Butlin: I personally preferred Zack’s response, butall the candidates have clearly addressed the central point of my question, emphasising both recent electoral successes and the potential for political leverage over the mainstream parties. I can only hope that voters also see the strategic impact of voting Green.Should the UK have a fairer immigration system? Under present rules I would not have been able to come with my husband because then he did not earn £38,000Patricia Jephson, 41, WorcesterEC & AR:Generations of immigrants have made a huge contribution – culturally and economically – to our national life. We’re proud to celebrate this and condemn the demonisation of migrants by the media and politicians, which is driving racist hate. We want to see a humane system of managed immigration and are opposed to rules that discriminate on the grounds of income or impose unreasonable costs on people who move here. This is not only unfair but it also ignores the fact that many currently low-paid jobs – in social care, for instance – are actually far more socially valuable than many higher-paid jobs – say in banking.ZP:We need to tell the truth. With an ageing population, we badly need migration. Of course we should also train up British workers, but it doesn’t have to be an either/or.If you use the NHS, theperson who cares for youis more likely to be a migrant than anyone in front of you in the queue.And the unfair rules around visas just cause unnecessary stress on families kept apart for absolutely no reason but to appease the right. The real problem in our country is not migrants but years of austerity under both Conservative and Labour governments.Patricia Jephson: I have heard no end of nonsense from the Conservative and now Labour representatives in my area regarding immigration, which is one of the reasons why I joined the Green party.I am glad thatEllie, Adrian and Zack all value immigrants and our contributions to our adopted home, the UK.Should the UK rejoin the European single market and customs union?Richard Norton, 55, RochesterEC & AR:Rejoining the customs union is one of many win-win steps we should be taking immediately towards undoing the economic damage done by Brexit and rebuilding our relationship with our nearest neighbours. The single market is trickier – there would clearly be major economic benefits, but as non-EU members we wouldn’t have a say in making its rules. In the long term, we believe Britain’s best future is in the EU family of sovereign nations, and Brexit is now seen as a bad mistake by most people in the UK. It’s not a mistake that’s irreversible when political conditions are right.ZP:There’s no area of our life that Brexit has improved – it’s been an absolute disaster. We also know that, in poll after poll, even people who voted forBrexit now regret it. I don’t think Europe is perfect, and there are huge changes I want to see, but ultimately I think we’d be a lot better in rather than out. And a natural first step to that is to rejoin the customs union. The single market would only make sense if we were re-entering anyway.Richard Norton: I’d likethe candidates’ positions to feel more proactive – to shape politics, not wait for “conditions”. Our economy, society, young people and environment deserve a future without the contamination of Brexit.Explore more on these topicsGreen partyThe panelElectoral reformcommentShareReuse this content"

Everyone knows, except my local footy club.Why? Because I genuinely don’t feel comfortable coming out to my teammates in this sport. I can’t describe to you how much that hurts.I don’t own a rainbow flag. I am not a gay spokesperson. I just want to be included in the sport I love.I loveAustralian rules footballwith a passion. I have my whole life. At six years old, I started playing country footy in rural NSW. I was lucky enough to play on the same team as my dad. I have continued to play this great game my whole life.I love going to the ‘G and seeing the diversity. Two 80-year-old ladies in Dogs gear and a packed lunch. The Vietnamese family grabbing a pie before the bounce. A mother taking her daughter and son to watch her struggling Cats.The diversity in our game is what makes it great. You don’t need to go far to see other major sporting codes that would kill for the diversity at our footy games.But after the 2018 grand final, I couldn’t even look at a game for months. That night, I sat near a man who yelled thesame slur Izak Rankine usedthe whole game. It really wore me down.But I love footy. And I love my husband.I wish those two things weren’t in conflict. But they are.The biggest takeaway from Izak Rankine’s case is to remember why these rules exist at all | Jonathan HornRead moreEvery week, at training and during my footy games, I hear gay jokes and comments. While most are intended as harmless, what it does is reconfirm a feeling within me (and many other gay players) that while my teammates certainly do not hate gay people – here in this sport, gay people are the butt of jokes rather than our winger or ruckman.And I guess that’s my biggest issue. I assume 90% of my footy team would be totally OK if I introduced my husband to them. But still, the game has a culture that sees gay people as jokes, not players.Many have tried to dismiss Rankine’s comments as off the cuff, in the heat of the battle – fog of war if you will.Whether Rankine meant it in the heat of the moment or not (I doubt he genuinely hates gay people), that word tells me and every gay man in the stands that we don’t belong. That’s why it matters.The Gold Coast coach, Damien Hardwick, said: “At what stage [do we ask] what can we say and can’t we say?” I won’t lecture Hardwick on what falls into “can say” categories or doesn’t. Those points will be made elsewhere. I only want to make the point that when this happens, along with the ensuing “debate”, it reaffirms to me exactly why I struggle to come out to my teammates. I feel unfortunately right to keep that part of my life to myself – Australian rules football is clearly not ready for openly gay players.People love to say ‘sexuality doesn’t matter’ and shouldn’t come up in AFL – so why do players hurl homophobic slurs? | Rebecca ShawRead moreI don’t know what “compelling medical submissions” against a homophobic slur means – but I do know there’s no medical condition called homophobia.In saying all this, I’m not at the front of the line advocating for a pride round or trying to get my beloved Pies to have rainbow stripes for one game.I haven’t personally advocated for my own or LGBTQ rights to be spotlighted in this game. Not because I don’t think it’s needed. It’s because, I just want to be me.I just want to be an openly gay man enjoying and playing footy. It’s that simple. Yet still, I can not.I want to share my love of footy with my husband.I want to take my husband to watch me play on the weekend.I want to joke about him with my footy mates.I want to hold his hand going into the game at the Gabba and kiss him in excitement when the Pies beat the Lions.So to anyone who plays footy this weekend or goes to watch it, I ask you this: pick a different line.We’ll never stop heckling umpires or the other team.These words don’t just insult, they exclude. They say we don’t belong in the game we love. And we do.The diversity of Australian rules football is what makes it the best game in the world. Let’s embrace it.Dylan Harrington plays local Australian rules football in QueenslandExplore more on these topicsAFLOpinionAustralian rules footballAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

She’s so devoted to this mission she even did it straight after the death, five years ago, of her beloved mother Maria. “My mum died in hospital at 5.30am,” she recalls. “At 6am, I went out to my car and this woman stopped me for a selfie. I said sure, no problem. I knew it would make her happy, so I hid behind my own smile. Little did she know my mum had just died but looking back, oh my God – I’ll always remember it.”The 50-year-old Brummie whirlwind loves to make someone’s day. At her local supermarket recently, she met a fan called Kate who’d just lost her own mother. “I’ll never forget how hard it was when my mum passed, so I invited Kate to the Bake Off final. She met Paul Hollywood and he gave her a handshake. She said it was the best day of her life. It doesn’t take a lot, does it? Kindness truly does make a difference.”From a ‘Yeastie Boy’ to the ultimate fairytale contestant: meet the stars of the 2025 Great British Bake OffRead moreHammond’s high-wattage enthusiasm and infectious humour have won her a devoted following but she’s fully aware that hers can be a divisive screen presence. “Not everyone likes me. Look, I’ll show you a video that tickled me.” She plays a TikTok of a woman grumbling about her joining the cast of Celebrity Gogglebox. “Give somebody else a chance, love,” she rants. “We’re sick of the bloody sight of you.”“I like these, because they humble me,” says Hammond. “They remind me I’m not all that. She hates my guts but that’s all right. People say Pete Wicks would be better than me at presentingFor the Love of Dogs. He might be but I’m doing it. Deal with it! I know my worth. Besides, my mum would have been so proud. That’s the reason I do this. She’s my guiding light.”TikTok trolls haven’t dimmed Hammond’s glow. Perched on a chaise longue after a long day ofGreat British Bake Offpromotional duties, she exudes energy and warmth. When people wander past – including her partner-in-cake Noel Fielding, sporting a skull jumper – she involves them in our conversation. She shows me gossipy messages on her phone. That trademark laugh peals out regularly. “I don’t think I laugh that loudly, then I hear myself on telly and think: what do I sound like? It’s like a horn. A literal foghorn.” At which point it peals out again.View image in fullscreen‘It’s still not the norm to see a Black woman doing this’ … photographed for Alison Hammond’s Big Weekend.Photograph: BBC StudiosWe’re meeting to discuss Bake Off’s imminent 16th series and Hammond’s third as co-host. “I still see myself as the new girl,” she says. “Paul has been there from the start, obviously. Noel and Prue [Leith] have been there for nine years. So I’m still the newbie and they’re still bullying me. Only joking. I bully them too, to be fair, especially Paul. I take him to task for being mean to the bakers. He’s dead stingy with the handshakes this year. Even I haven’t had a Hollywood handshake in real life. He’s funny about them. That handshake is worth a lot. His hands are probably insured for millions!”This year’s batch of 12 amateur bakers are a typically diverse bunch: “We’ve got the whole spectrum, from age 23 to 59. There’s an engineer, a hairdresser, a medical student, a wedding dress designer. But the one common denominator is that baking is everything to them.” Hammond has genuine empathy for them because she’s seen both sides of the reality TV experience. “I was a contestant on Big Brother, in the jungle, even on Celebrity Bake Off,” she nods. “I know what they’re going through. There’s one baker who can’t even make caramel but they learn on the job and do brilliantly. I love watching them progress. They go into the tent as one person and come out as another. You can’t help ​being emotionally involved. What often moves me is hearing about who they’ve left behind to take part. Some have kids. They’re not seeing their babies because they’re working so hard at this. You’re willing them to do well. When they leave, you find a lump in your throat.”Last year, Hammond took a hilarious tumble off a workbench. Any pratfalls to look forward to this time? “Loads. It’s me you’re talking to. I’m always awkward and clumsy. Hopefully they’ll edit out the mishaps, but knowing our team, they’ll leave them in.” Things go awry for the bakers too. “A technical challenge goes disastrously wrong and it’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. Even the bakers see the funny side. Well, eventually.”View image in fullscreenOven ready … Hammond with co-hosts Prue Leith, Noel Fielding and Paul Hollywood in the new series of The Great British Bake Off.Photograph: Laura Palmer/Channel 4Asked for behind-the-scenes titbits, she grins: “We’ve all got our own deckchairs now. We’ve put them outside our little shepherd’s hut trailers, so we can sit there and chat. Hopefully next year, we’ll get a jacuzzi.” There was plenty of whizzing around the Welford Park grounds in golf buggies. “Noel doesn’t have a driving licence so he’s obsessed. That’s his time to be a driver. He was extra lucky this year: for his birthday, Paul bought him the car that Noel’s dad had when he was a kid. This beautiful three-wheeler. Now he has to pass his test or it’ll be embarrassing. Someone’s bought you a car and you can’t drive it? Bit rude. I made a point of telling Paul that my dad drove a Mercedes, so next birthday, you never know. Fingers crossed!”Hammond’s weight loss has become a tabloid obsession. She shed an impressive 11st, thanks to healthy eating and weight training, and looks fabulous in a shimmery olive jumpsuit. How much scoffing of bakes does she do? “I tried to hold back but I still put on 2kg this series. When I see a handshake, I’ve got to try it. I always taste the winning technical and best showstopper.” Is she still weightlifting? “I am but I’ve not had time lately. I hadn’t been to the gym for ages but I went back yesterday and, babes, I think I pulled a muscle. I was like, I’m getting too old for this.” Surely she gets free massages from boyfriend David Putman – a masseur who (cue another tabloid fixation) is 23 years her junior? “It was better when I used to pay for them,” she chuckles. “I don’t get jack shit no more. He does everyone else but me!”This spring, Hammond finally landed her own interview series,Alison Hammond’s Big Weekendon BBC One, in which she spent a weekend at the homes of her famous guests. “I adored it,” she says. “Just holding that space for people to talk. It caught me offguard, some stuff they told me. It was lovely that they felt comfortable enough to open up. Perrie Edwards discussing her struggles with anxiety was really powerful. So was Mel B talking about being a survivor of domestic abuse.”View image in fullscreenBarking brilliant … Hammond in For the Love Love of Dogs.Photograph: ITV/REX/ShutterstockComedian Jimmy Carr – when he wasn’t teasing Hammond about her pronunciation of “skeleton” (“I still don’t know what I’m saying wrong,” she laughs. “It’s skellington, isn’t it?”) – spoke movingly about seeing his late mother in his own son. I wonder if Hammond feels the same about her 20-year-old son, Aidan. “Without a doubt. Aidan’s exactly like her, right down to the way he eats and how he’s strict about home security. He tells me off if I haven’t locked the porch, which was exactly what my mum did. It’s like she came back in my son.” A second series of Big Weekend hasn’t yet been announced (come on, BBC) but who’d be her dream guests? “Kylie, definitely. Madonna? Oprah? Let’s aim high and see what happens.”Hammond has plenty to keep her busy in the meantime. Every Friday, she co-presents This Morning with Dermot O’Leary. It’s invariably the best episode of the week. Would she fancy doing the other four days? “Nope,” she says firmly. “I live in Birmingham and spending all my time in London would be too much. Cat [Deeley] and Ben [Shephard, the main hosts] are incredible. Anyway, I like being the Friday guy. The weekend’s coming, let’s have some fun.”Last year, she had the unenviable task of taking over ITV’sFor the Love Of Dogsafter the death of longtime host Paul O’Grady. “I never tried to fill Paul’s shoes. Those shoes are well and truly filled. Mine are a totally different pair. I can see why he did the job for so long. It’s bloody lovely. Being with dogs is like therapy.”She inherited her ferocious work ethic from Maria. “Mum was a proper grafter and I am too. I’m a single parent like she was. She understood what that’s like and helped me so much. With every success comes sacrifice. I wasn’t always around for Aidan but she was. We called her his second mum. When Aidan was little, I made a rule that I’d only work three days a week, no more, so I could be there for him. Now he’s older, it’s more flexible.”View image in fullscreenHow it started … Hammond in Big Brother series three, 2002.Photograph: Channel 4/ShutterstockDoes she worry about becoming overexposed? “No. If I need to rest up or a job doesn’t appeal, I won’t do it. I’m good at saying no. I turn down 10 things per day, no exaggeration. It looks like I’m on TV a lot, sure, but I stand out partly because it’s still not the norm to see a Black woman doing this. I don’t want to bring race into it but no one says that about Davina or Ant and Dec. I’ve worked hard for 22 years to get here. That woman on TikTok is allowed her opinion. It keeps me grounded. I’m not a national treasure. I’m just me, doing a job that I adore to the best of my ability, trying to be better than I was yesterday.”That 22-year journey began onBig Brother. In the reality trailblazer’s third series, housemate Hammond memorably jumped on a garden table and broke it. Behold, a TV career was launched. “Wow, what a time. The maddest thing is, I was only in there for 14 days but it was life-changing. I’m eternally grateful to Big Brother. If it wasn’t for that show and breaking that table, I wouldn’t be doing what I love now. And I never did pay for the damage.”Next in the pipeline is new Channel 4 format Your Song, which has been dubbed “The Piano for singing”. “I’d forgotten about that show!” she cackles. “God, I really am everywhere, aren’t I? It’s people singing who probably never planned to. Everyday people with a connection to a particular song.”She scoffs at any notion of a career plan. “I just do what makes me happy, and I do it with grace and love. I’m 50 now. I only want joy in my life. What links all the shows I do is people and joy. I enjoy talking to the public because Iamthe public. I’m normal too. I just happen to laugh like a horn.”The Great British Bake Off returns on2September at 8pm on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsAlison HammondThe Great British Bake OffTelevisionFood TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now back on TV, he’s redefining what it means to be a leading manFri 22 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareThere is a moment in every actor’s career when they must confront their early dreams and their present reality. For Taylor Kitsch, that reckoning has been more painful than for most. “If you start marrying yourself to these phantom outcomes that don’t exist, man, you’re gonna go crazy,” he says.Kitsch is talking from New York, thousands of miles from his home in Montana, where he has carved out a different life from his Hollywood years. “I’d rather be in the wild chasing animals with my camera than going to clubs or bars or Hollywood parties,” he says.Today he’s at a press junket for his new Prime Video series, The Terminal List: Dark Wolf, which expertly marries gun battles and spy intrigue with a neat consideration of what happens when red-blooded American males are confronted by the realities of war. Before our interview, I was excited to see the exact state of dishevelment that the wildlife-chasing actor would greet me in, but my request for him to turn on his camera is politely rebuffed and I have to make do with listening to his disembodied Canadian-cum-Texan boom.View image in fullscreenLost action hero … Taylor Kitsch with Chris Pratt in The Terminal List: Dark Wolf.Photograph: Justin Lubin/PrimeThe path seemed so clear in 2012. Kitsch was a 30-year-old Canadian hockey player turned model turned actor, blessed with the kind of looks that make casting directors reach for their phones and studio heads reach for their chequebooks. He had spent the back half of his 20s playing Tim Riggins, the brooding high-school running back and rebel heart of the critically acclaimed show Friday Night Lights. His first forays into movies were solid turns, among them Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the photojournalist Kevin Carter in The Bang Bang Club. Stardom seemed inevitable. A few years earlier he had lived in his car on futile visits to LA – now he was looking up at billboards of himself. The Guardian proclaimed him a star “about to turn supernova”.Then came the big swing: John Carter, Disney’s $264m bet on Kitsch becoming the next great action star. The film was based on the 1912 novel A Princess of Mars, inspiration for a number of great 20th-century space operas (not least Star Wars and Dune) and was meant to be Disney’s answer to Avatar. Hopes were high but the box office gods were ungiving. John Carter quickly became a punchline due to its lackluster title and marketing campaign, which one Disney executive deemed “the worst in the history of movies”. The film itself is decent, certainly better than its 52% score on Rotten Tomatoes, and Kitsch received praise for the“slyness” brought to the title character.Still, John Carter felt derivative. Its similarities to Avatar in particular (Earth soldier is transported to an exotic planet and begrudgingly accepted by the native population before saving the day) made it a magnet for unhelpful headlines as the early box office returns proved disappointing. It went on to flop so badly (reported loss: $200m) that its title now refers less to the film than its accompanying cautionary tale of big-budget disaster.Meanwhile, the prevailing narrative around Kitsch was that he couldn’t carry a blockbuster – a suspicion compounded by his next film, Battleship, a failed attempt to turn the board game into a Transformers-style franchise that is now primarily remembered for being Rihanna’s film debut.There’s so many cogs in that wheel of movies, man. I’m literally such a small part of itThe cruel irony is that while Kitsch’s charismatic screen presence was honed on a naturalistic high-school drama, his potential big break came in that post-Avatar moment when movie studios looked to build franchises around groundbreaking special effects, without necessarily marrying them to strong characters or coherent narratives.Kitsch is sanguine about his part in the John Carter debacle. “There’s so many cogs in that wheel of movies, man. I’m literally such a small part of it.” The machine was so much bigger than any one person: “I don’t know if it’s timing, or a million cooks in the kitchen, or it just didn’t hit.” At the time, he took it personally, feeling the weight of a $264m production, the studio’s faith, the expectations that came with being positioned as the next big star. “Over time,” he pauses, choosing his words carefully, “you gave it the best you could. I’m proud of the way I led that shoot. You move on.”Perhaps the most telling aspect of Kitsch’s story isn’t the fall – it’s what he did while he was down. Rather than chase another potential blockbuster or reinvent himself as a different kind of leading man, he disappeared into the work itself.The roles that followed show an actor no longer interested in being anyone’s idea of a Hollywood heart-throb. In 2015, Kitsch played a repressed highway patrol officer in season two of True Detective, a role that laid the foundation for his subsequent TV revival, embodying wounded men in a country that’s constantly redefining masculinity. He marks out his 2018 part as the cult leader David Koresh in the Paramount miniseries Waco as “a big turn in my career, in the sense of preparation and understanding and not judging a character”. The role of Koresh, a real-life figure responsible for alleged sexual abuse and the deaths of dozens, is certainly more complex than the parts that made Kitsch famous.View image in fullscreenA different ballgame … Minka Kelly and Taylor Kitsch in Friday Night Lights.Photograph: NBC/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock“My job is to marry myself emotionally to the circumstances and these guys,” he says. “I don’t think: ‘I hope you like Dave at this point or I hope you hate him now.’ I just want to be as authentic as I can be to him and service that without judgment.” It’s an approach that would prove essential when Netflix’s Painkiller came along in 2023, a limited series examining the opioid crisis through the lens of pharmaceutical executives, addicts and the families caught between them.For Kitsch, the project was deeply personal. “Addiction runs through my family pretty hard,” he says. “It’s really changed my perspective in a lot of ways.” His sister is in recovery, so when the opportunity arose to play an opioid-addicted salesman, he asked her to advise on the role. “I’ve seen her detox on the floor of my house,” he says quietly. “Those scenes were very close to me and I had more people reach out than any other show I’ve ever done, which meant a lot to me … to share it with my sister was amazing, to be honest.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The organisation provides support for veterans and trauma survivors and represents the kind of purpose-driven project that would have been impossible during his blockbuster years. “I think I’ve grown up a little bit,” he says. “In my 20s, I would see people who’d be like: Well, why aren’t you doing more? You have the means to help people.”There is an interesting parallel between Kitsch’s career and the characters he is drawn to playing. Many of them are men trying to figure out how to live with themselves, how to carry on when the world has shifted beneath their feet. The transition from movie star to television actor might seem like a step backward to some, but for Kitsch, it represented something more valuable: creative control and the chance to truly inhabit his characters and allow part of them to inhabit him.The Terminal List: Dark Wolf represents yet another step in his journey back to mainstream attention. Despite a lukewarm critical reception for the original series –including one star from the Guardian– the show became one of Prime Video’s biggest streaming hits ever, largely off the back of a charismatic turn from Chris Pratt in the lead role. Working with Pratt as both co-star and producer for this new prequel series, Kitsch found himself in the curious position of partnering with someone whose career has taken the path his own could have, had the machine worked as intended. Far from any bitterness about Pratt’s fame, there’s genuine enthusiasm in Kitsch’s voice when discussing their collaboration. “We get along really well. I think there’s a mutual respect.” Faced with that level of celebrity, Kitsch thinks about the practicalities: “You often wonder where you’d even be living. I bet you I wouldn’t even be living in Montana.”The beauty of Kitsch’s current life – photographing wildlife in Montana between carefully chosen projects – is how little it resembles what anyone expected his career to look like. The actor’s career is quieter but perhaps more sustainable. He’s not the action star Hollywood tried to make him, but he’s also not the cautionary tale they might have written him off as. Instead, he’s something more interesting: an actor who faced failure, and subsequently redefined success on his own terms.“I just want to keep disappearing,” he says, almost as a throwaway. Not from the world, but into roles. Into people he hasn’t met yet, lives he hasn’t lived. Looking at Kitsch’s career now, it’s hard not to think that maybe the supernova metaphor was wrong from the beginning. Supernovae burn bright and burn out. What Kitsch has built instead is more like a campfire: sustainable, warm and capable of lasting through the night.The Terminal List: Dark Wolfis onPrime Video from27 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmTelevisionAmazon Prime VideofeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Guardian ran two defences: that the articles about Clarke’s sexual misconduct were true, and that their publication was in the public interest. Steyn found overwhelmingly in favour of the Guardian on both counts.In contrast, she found Clarke was “not a credible or reliable witness”, concluding that he was “untruthful about most of the allegations, in his efforts to salvage his career”.Clarke’s claims of conspiracyIn his legal action over theGuardian’s articlesaccusing him of sexual misconduct, the former Doctor Who actor decried a “blanket [modern] lens” being cast on past actions. Dance moves at the Notting Hill carnival would be considered “assault” in other cultures, he said, and anyone his age who went to university would know that “uni lads and things, people get crazy and the things that happened back in those days would not be acceptable now”.It was a theme echoed by Philip Williams inclosing submissions, in which Clarke’s barrister highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate” as he said Clarke had been a victim of “historical revisionism”.But inappropriate sexual comments – or “banter” as Clarke sometimes referred to them – was just one of the accusations he faced in the Guardian’s reporting and defence of the case. Others included bullying, taking and sharing explicit videos and photographs without consent and unwanted sexual contact.Attempting to rebut the accusations, Clarke, the first witness on the stand, ran a variety of arguments, which included flat denial that most events ever took place and that his female accusers hadconsensually participated in and/or initiated behaviourhe was being blamed for.Clarke also alleged a conspiracy between people who had grudges against him, who had either collaborated with the Guardian’s journalists or duped them, saying his nine-year-old son had made “a little chart” showing the connections between his accusers.In her judgment, Steyn unequivocally dismissed such claims. She found the evidence of sexual misconduct made by the women who gave evidence in court – and even one who was unable to – to be true. Clarke’s conspiracy claim, the judge concluded, was “born of necessity, in the face of the large body of witnesses giving evidence against him”. The notion that Guardian journalists had engaged in a conspiracy, she ruled, was “unfounded and meritless”.View image in fullscreenClarke on the set of Adulthood, part of the Kidulthood trilogy, in 2008.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyDuring his testimony, he at times laughed off accusations but also wept and showed flashes of anger towards the Guardian for having “smashed my life”. He appeared ruffled when he noticed that one of his accusers, the Gangs of London actor Jing Lusi, was watching him give evidence, and questioned whether it was allowed (it was).Clarke spent more than three-and-a-half days in the witness box, longer than all of the other witnesses his legal team called on his behalf combined. This was partly because they were mostly character witnesses who could not directly contradict the accusations against him.The most notable exception was the testimony of the actor Louise Dylan, who said that an allegation that Clarke had groped her at a wrap partywas untrue. The allegation, by Clarke’s former creative partner Davie Fairbanks, had never been reported by the Guardian in any of the published articles. It was brought into the libel claim by the Guardian’s inclusion of it in its amended defence as an example of behaviour by Clarke that supported the meaning of the articles.The judge accepted that Clarke did not grope Dylan, but found Fairbanks to be a credible witness who honestly believed the incident that he recounted, but initially misdescribed the location of the incident.Other witnesses called by Clarke’s legal team were limited to attesting that they had never personally seen him engage in inappropriate behaviour or, following in the footsteps of his evidence, casting aspersions on the character of his accusers.His wife, Iris,claimed that Gina Powell, a film producer and documentary maker who worked for her husband from 2014 to 2017, was a liar who was “infatuated by him”. She said of Fairbanks: “Not that I have anything against it, but he smokes a lot of weed. He is self-destructive.” She was unrestrained in her anger at his accusers and the Guardian, sarcastically referring to its staff in court as “our lovely people in the back there”.Philip Dore, a childhood friend of Clarke who worked for his production company Unstoppable from 2014 to 2015,told the court he saw Powell “grope”Clarke, who wrote and produced the Kidulthood trilogy, at a film premiere. Gavin Millar KC, representing the Guardian, challenged the use of the word “grope” in light of Dore describing it variously as “friendly” and Powell “having playfully touched his arse” but the witness insisted it was accurate.Clarke’s eight witnesses (excluding himself) were done and dusted within two-and-a-half days. Another six who were anticipated to give oral evidence did not do so. One of them was Arnold Oceng, who appeared in Clarke’s films Brotherhood and Adulthood. When he could not be traced, a witness summons was issued and Steyn warned that he could face contempt of court proceedings if he did not show, but to no avail.3:35Noel Clarke loses libel case against Guardian over sexual misconduct investigation – video‘Shock and shame’: the testimony of the womenThe trial then moved on to the Guardian’s two defences: that the allegations in the articles were true and that they were in the public interest.The 29 “truth” witnesses included 21 key witnesses who said they had experienced misconduct by Clarke themselves or directly witnessed it. They were mostly women, some of whom were granted anonymity and two of whom – Powell and Naome Morris – gave evidence from behind a screen.Much of the evidence spoke to the specific allegations contained in the Guardian’s reporting but there were also accusations never previously published.One of the witnesses, Imogen*,said she was a “wide-eyed” 20-year-old actorand huge Doctor Who fan when she met a “sexually threatening” Clarke for dinner at Soho House in central London in July 2014. She said she told Clarke she was 17 in the hope it would deter him from talking about sex. It did not work; he suggested they go to his flat to have sex and that he could take photos of it.Also not previously published was the allegation by Penelope* thatClarke got an erection when filming a sex scenewith her and touched her with his penis at the entry to her vagina. In her witness statement, she said: “When he first took down his trousers and pants, I felt his penis land on my pubic area. I tried to move myself up in the bed slightly so there would be distance between our genitals, but then his penis was touching me in between my legs right at the entry of my vagina.“He was so close that I recall being worried in case he moved in further or ejaculated.”View image in fullscreenClarke at the Baftas in 2017.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PASome witnesses were asked by Philip Williams, representing Clarke, why they had not told anyone about their allegations when they happened. Penelope said it was becauseshe felt “shock and shame”.Williams also questioned several women about why they would not just leave situations they were uncomfortable with, whether filming sex scenes or being propositioned in a restaurant, and why in some cases they kept working with Clarke or stayed in contact with him afterwards.In response, they pointed to the sexual politics of the industry and the importance, as women, of not making enemies.Powell, who faced questioning from Williams about her sexual history and experience, and J​ohannah Whyte, an actor and digital content creator, whose stage name is Jahannah James​, bothclaimed Clarke kept naked photos of women he had sex with as “collateral”in case they ever wanted to speak out about him or tell his wife.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Williams asked her why she did not email Clarke afterwards to say that he had gone too far, Powell said she was in shock. “It felt like I was trying to leave an abusive relationship,” she said.Powell, Whyte and Lusi all told the court that Clarke used the example ofAdam Deacon, his former mentee, who was convicted in 2015 of harassing Clarke, as a cautionary tale of what happened to those who crossed him.Imogen said: “It was pre-#MeToo. It was pre women standing up for themselves. I have never seen a woman stand up for themselves and it go successfully. At the end of the day, the industry is so fickle, it can turn in an instant. There is an element where everybody is scared of stuff like this and [that’s] why I had never spoke up about it. I was not in the Guardian article, I chickened out, I was too frightened.”It emerged that Imogen had been sent a legal letter by solicitors for Clarke last year, only two months before the pre-trial hearings were due to begin, which Millar saidthreatened her with prosecutionfor circulating allegations about him.Millar argued it was “witness intimidation” but this was denied by Clarke, who said he was just trying to get her to switch sides. “It is not uncommon for people to play for one football team and then play for another football team,” he said. “It happens. You get transferred and that was the intention.”Fairbanks provided the most dramatic moment of the trial. Hesaid he had found a cache of 15 pictures of Ivy* on his hard drivethat, he claimed, Clarke had sent him. Ivy told the court she had never seen the images previously and believed they were taken without consent. The judge found that Ivy’s answer was an honest one but that she probably knew and consented to Clarke taking those photographs.Williams described it as an “ambush” and accused Fairbanks of seeking to pervert the course of justice.When Clarke was recalled to address this specific issue he denied sending the photos to Fairbanks, whom he accused of stealing them. Clarke said the photos were consensual, he took them for “aesthetic” reasons and eventually would have deleted them if they had not been stolen by Fairbanks.During testy exchanges with Millar, Clarke initially said Fairbanks had “all levels of access [to his devices]”, sometimes posting on Twitter, now X, for him, but when Millar asked if this was appropriate given that he stored naked pictures on his laptop in a folder that was not password-protected, Clarke said Fairbanks only had access for “emergencies”.While cross-examining Fairbanks, Williams initially suggested he had stolen the photos with the idea of weaponising them. But given they had still been friends when they were allegedly stolen, Clarke said Fairbanks had initially taken them “for his own sexual and perverse gratification” and only after they fell out decided to retain them for use against him.The Guardian in the spotlightAfter Clarke’s second time on the stand, it was the turn of the Guardian’s journalists, including Lucy Osborne and Sirin Kale, who wrote the story together, the Guardian’s head of investigations, Paul Lewis, who oversaw it, and the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, who ultimately signed off on it. The deputy editor, Owen Gibson, and the head of audio, Nicole Jackson, also gave evidence.View image in fullscreenSirin Kale (left) and Lucy Osborne.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThey faced questions about the deletion of Signal messages journalists had exchanged relating to the investigation, which had already formed the basis of anunsuccessful attempt to strike outthe Guardian’s defence before trial.Dismissing that application, Steyn had found that the claim made by Williams that, in deleting the messages, the Guardian had fabricated evidence and perverted the course of justice was “a grave allegation [that] should not have been made and publicly aired without foundation”.She found the deletions were in accordance with the Guardian’s data minimisation policy, but that did not stop Williams revisiting the issue during the trial, accusing Lewis of trying to “hide the evidence”.Lewis responded that the messages in question were “micro-level chats, informal chats” between journalists which were never customarily retained, unlike other documents that were material to the investigation.Williams also questioned the credibility of the sources for the Guardian’s reporting, including through the lens of race.Clarke’s barrister suggested to Kale that she was assigned to the story because she was a woman of colour and said that none of the defence witnesses who gave evidence in court were black.Kale replied that some of the journalistic sources were black women and women of colour but some “felt it was more difficult to speak publicly about such matters, given that Mr Clarke was also a very successful black man”.Williams asked Osborne if she was aware that Ieva Sabliauskaite, who alleged that Clarke took a picture of her underwear while she was dancing and attempted to show it to their colleagues, was wearing a mini-dress at the time.Osborne replied: “Sorry, but I do not think it makes any difference whether she was wearing a short skirt or not.”Similarly, he said Osborne should have taken account of the fact that Sabliauskaite was “heavily intoxicated”, to which the journalist replied: “I do not think it matters either way if she was drunk or not drunk. He took a photograph, according to the allegation, and then showed it to people the next day.”In his closing submissions, for the fifth time in the trial, Williams reached for his favourite analogy: that the Guardian’s story had “more holes than a colander” and went so far as to describe its journalists as “rogue”.Millar said the idea that the truth witnesses “were all doing a thing as serious as lying to the high court … is frankly inconceivable”.Steyn agreed with that assessment. “Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses – none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come to court to lie is inherently implausible,” she said.*Not their real namesExplore more on these topicsThe GuardianNoel ClarkeGuardian Media GroupNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

On the flipside, hobbyist household names don’t always reveal the art form in its best light. Happily, Smith-Bynoe proves no mere dilettante in Kool Story Bro, which cooks up entertaining antics from personal stories volunteered by three audience members. I doubt even its host would claim this is improv at its most meticulous; he himself referred to the previous night’s offerings as “dogshit”. But it’s hard to imagine it ever not being good fun.The format accommodates a guest quizmaster, and – what a treat – tonight it’s Smith-Bynoe’s Ghosts co-starLolly Adefope. Her role is to solicit and interrogate each audience member’s kool story, and she so revels in doing so, the show’s talky part (supposed to be just a prompt) threatens to swallow up the whole hour. That tale is about a nude life-drawing class; a later one features a solo holidaymaker ambushed at sea in Colombia. Once (or, thanks to Adefope, long after) the team have enough to go on, they bring these scenarios to comic life.The joke is in the discrepancy between a story told and a story enacted, as Smith-Bynoe and team (which tonight includesLara Ricoteand Lola-Rose Maxwell) extrapolate major comic features from minor details in the original narrative, and fill interpretative gaps with eccentric character and performance. And so a shifty T-shirt seller in one story becomes in Smith-Bynoe’s hands an egotistical beat-boxer. And a side note about Colombian kidnappers speaking in unison triggers a sequence in which they perform a theatre show on the Edinburgh fringe.The scenes are short, sharp, and follow a rough-cut path towards funny. Minimal effort is made at narrative cohesion, far less a beginning, middle and end. One volunteer’s story is largely ignored in favour of an improv based around Adefope’s gossip about James Corden – which finds Smith-Bynoe cast as the Gavin & Stacey man in a Hollywood movie. The team get plenty of juice out of that joke, and others too, in a show that – because or in spite of its celebrity casting – will keep improv’s popularity bobbing along nicely.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 22 August.

Why Britpop nostalgia just won’t go awayWhether it’s Robbie Williams’ new album, a Blur v Oasis play or Britpop romance novels, Alex James and others explain why we’re all still in thrall to the ​m​ad-fer-it 90sAlexis PetridisFri 22 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 13.15 EDTShareIt is a Tuesday evening, and in the suitably 1990s environs of Soho’s Groucho Club,Robbie Williams,resplendent in pair of dungarees, is in the process of launching his new album. It’s called Britpop, features some songs co-written withGaz Coombesof Supergrass, and is, he attests, “the album that I wanted to write and release after I left Take That in 1995”. This was the brief period where he attempted to establish himself as an adjunct to the mid-90s wave of hugely successful UK alt-rock, releasing a string of audiblyOasis-influencedsolo singles, palling around Glastonbury with the Gallaghers and temporarily employing one of the band’s inner circle, Creation Records’ former managing director Tim Abbot, as his manager. “I’ve been musically aimless for a little while,” Williams said to the assembled press. “I’ve just spent the last 15 years looking backwards. I think with this album, if I am gonna look backwards, I might as well just clear the decks and go back to the start and head off from there.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve just spent the last 15 years looking backwards’ … Robbie Williams at the launch of his new album at The Groucho Club.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/ShutterstockHis determination to revisit the Britpop era feels slightly odd. His Oasis-influenced singles met with declining public interest, nearly scuppering his solo career before Angels and Let Me Entertain You came to the rescue. His relationship with Abbot ended with each suing the other in a dispute over Abbot’s contract (they settled out of court), he later said Oasis were “gigantic bullies” (Liam Gallagherreplied that he’d “never bullied anyone in my life”) and when he talked about the period when I interviewed him in 2016, it was in terms of trauma: “There was an indie fundamentalist mentality … I was looked down on when I was in conversation with a lot of people … [it] starts to make you feel agoraphobic and second-guess everything you do”. But his appearance at the Groucho is the latest in a series of 90s-themed publicity stunts by Williams – he’s also unveiled fake blue plaques in Camden, proclaiming it “the home of Britpop”, and Soho’s Berwick Street, where the photograph on the cover of Oasis’s (What’s the Story?) Morning Glory was taken.All of this is timely at the very least, coming amid a huge wave of nostalgia for Britpop. In part, it’s obviously fuelled by the fact that Blur, Pulp andOasishave all reformed to considerable acclaim over the past two years, but it also feels more general than just fondness for any one band. It’s as if people have retrospectively fallen in love with “Britpop” as an idea, a signifier of something beyond music, something more nebulous.The first signs of a notion of Britpop detached from the actual music might have comelast year, when a succession of artists who sounded nothing like Blur or Oasis – drum’n’bass starNia Archives, music producerAG Cookand singer-songwriterRachel Chinouriri– began adopting the era’s visual signifiers, union jacks and all, andDua Lipaclaimed its “honesty and attitude” had influenced her album Radical Optimism. There have been a succession of Britpop books – a quick search reveals titles called Faster Than a Cannonball, Don’t Look Back in Anger, Feeling Supersonic, A Field Guide to Britpop, The Britpop Bible, The Birth and Impact of Britpop and at least three Britpop-themed romance novels. There are Britpop walking tours, Britpop festivals and a plethora of non-specific Britpop tribute acts.There is Britpop Classical, a reimagining of the era’s hits with a 20-piece orchestra, fronted byBlur’s Alex James. Inspired, he says, by seeing “everyone arms aloft crying their eyes out, singing along to 90 minutes of hits” when the dance-themed Ministry of Sound Classical headlined the Big Feastival, the festival he hosts on his farm in the Cotswolds, last year.Britpop battle between Blur and Oasis revisited in ‘punchy’ new comedyRead moreThere are Britpop clothing collections – “classic British countryside meets 90s indie cool … countryside heritage with that Camden edge”, as the press release from designers Maude and Fox puts it – and there is aBritpop play,The Battle, about the feud between Oasis and Blur. It’s been written by novelist John Niven, will star Mathew Horne and is scheduled to open in February.It’s the idea of theatrical producer Simon Friend, who says he thought the show would initially appeal to a niche audience – “to sell a play that is new, by someone who’s completely unknown in the theatre industry is hard, in fact nigh-on impossible” – but instead found himself booking it on a six-month tour around the provinces: a West End run is to be announced and it’s been optioned for television by Universal.“About ten years ago, nostalgia for the 80s was really prevalent – the theatrical version of Dirty Dancing could not have been hotter, for instance,” Friend says. “I think there’s a 30 year cycle of nostalgia: ten years ago, the 90s were still in the rear view mirror. Now, if you look at video footage or photos in the 90s, it does feel like a historical period compared to where we’re living now. It looks more fun. There is a certain anarchy about that time that, from a distance, people have a fondness for”.And there is Britpop wine, lager and cider, also Alex James’s handiwork: he has actually trademarked the word “Britpop”, at least for food and drink. “Trademarking is incredibly tedious, it turns out,” he says. “You have to do it by territory and category. The word ‘Britpop’ used to totally give me the ick, as I think it maybe did for a lot of bands in that era. You know, ‘Britpop rocker Alex James’ – oh, God. I had to take control. So I thought, ‘that actually sounds like a really nice drink’.”This is Britpop as a branding exercise, which begs the question: what does the word signify? “I guess now it just sort of means good times,” he shrugs. “Maybe when outlooks were more positive, and there was less doom and gloom and scrutiny. Maybe it’s like ‘the swinging 60s’, only not quite as naff. You hear the phrase ‘swinging 60s’ and you’re like ‘yay!’, aren’t you?”View image in fullscreenAlex James at the launch of his Britpop ClassicalPhotograph: Alan West/Hogan Media/REX/ShutterstockThewriter and broadcaster Miranda Sawyeragrees. Her contribution to the pantheon of Britpop literature, Uncommon People, was published last year, and she’s just launched a podcast called Talk 90s to Me. “What is it about Britpop that appeals? There was a sense of ‘fuck you, we’re going to have a good time’, which Liam Gallagher definitely epitomised. And there’s an optimism – the gatekeepers had changed, different people were running Radio 1 and Top of the Pops, and a load of bands became absolutely huge without really changing what they did, or compromising. Blur didn’t change, Pulp didn’t change, Oasis obviously never changed – they just got worse. Someone like Tricky, who record companies would previously have told to fuck off, got really big.“It felt like youth culture was winning. You couldn’t believe it was happening, and there’s a sense of optimism attached to that. That’s an amazing feeling that can be sensed by others.”You can see why people old enough to remember the mid-90s first-hand might be drawn to reliving their youth 30 years on – generally your teens and 20s look appealingly carefree from the perspective of middle age – but the striking thing about the current wave of Britpop nostalgia is that its market isn’t exclusively drawn from the ranks of forty- and fiftysomethings. Alex James says he was “really, really surprised” at “how many kids, people my kids’ age” were at Blur’s 2023 reunion gigs. Promoting Uncommon People at literary festivals, Sawyer was struck by the audiences she attracted. “I thought it would just be people my age, right? What I didn’t expect was people in their late 30s and early 40s. Everybody, I think, is always slightly obsessed with the era when they were just born: things that were going on that were adult, that seemed exciting and just beyond you on the telly. And then, every time, there were always at least a couple of 17-year-olds, mostly girls, interested in music, want to be in bands, and they want to talk about Elastica.”View image in fullscreenYouth culture without compromise … Elasticain 1995)Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesIf you buy the idea that what the Britpop brand represents is optimism, positivity and youth culture winning without compromise then you can see its appeal to a 17-year-old in 2025. Who wouldn’t hanker after the notion of a prelapsarian world before the scrutiny of social media, 9/11, the rise of the “alt-right” et al? And the era’s “fuck you, we’re gonna have a good time” excesses look alluring in an age of wellness influencers and constant cameraphone surveillance.Of course, they’re being sold a very rose-tinted and reductive notion of the past. The Britpop era played out alongside the Conservative government’s back-to-basics campaign, which felt a little like a culture war, replete withtalk from John Majorabout “traditional values falling away” and having “allowed things to happen that we should never have tolerated”. Unemployment rates were around twice as high as they are now and there was genocide in eastern Europe, while even Sawyer notes that when she interviewed Garbage’s Shirley Manson and Sleeper’s Louise Wener for her book, “it was like we already knew each other, because we’d been through the 90s as women, like you’d been through some kind of trench warfare”. But that’s nostalgia for you: the past with the crap bits tactfully excised.Given his own experience of the mid-90s you might expect Robbie Williams’ take on Britpop to be less idealistic. Certainly the cover of his album hints at that – it’s a photo of him at Glastonbury in 1995 on a gallery wall, being defaced by protesters. But when the subject comes up at The Groucho Club, he bats it away, restricting himself to talking jokily about the tracksuit he’s wearing in the photo. “So that’s the album cover,” he concludes. “We’re Britpopping.”Uncommon People by Miranda Sawyer is out now, published by John Murray. The Big Feastival is at Alex James’s Farm, Oxfordshire, 22-24 August. Britpop by Robbie Williams is released 10 October by Columbia Records.

This spunky 60-minute version created by Sam Landa and Emma Owens combines a radically trimmed text with aerial acrobatics, tumbling and clowning. Sensitively delivering Shakespearean verse and executing sophisticated circus requires a niche skill-set; some lines fall flat but Landa and Danielle Diniz’s choreography often deepens a story limited to the personal not the political. The enterprise is executed with panache by a charismatic cast of 10.Who’s there? A ghost in white, twisting and turning to the song Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood, later returning to use an aerial pyramid. The show casts Old Hamlet (Arthur Morel Van Hyfte) and Hamlet (Maddox Morfit-Tighe) at a similar age, which movingly emphasises how they see themselves in each other, although the ghost’s recurrent “remember me” voiceover sounds more horror movie than tragedy.Light circus skills relay the romance between Hamlet and Ophelia (Maleah Rendon) as acrobats deliver the love letter that leaves her literally head over heels. Ophelia and Laertes (Eduardo Grillo) tumble like scrapping siblings, although as the show progresses the circus elements are stop-start rather than continuous.Hamlet’s letter is not read in its entirety by Polonius (Dylan Ingwersen) but scrawled across the set and then up Ophelia’s body in chalk by the prince, underlining apparent madness. Both characters’ descent is propelled by Kim Petras’s There Will Be Blood (more shades of horror) and “To be or not to be” is looped, echoing its unresolvable arguments, as cartwheels fill the stage. Hamlet’s moves are as quicksilver as his thinking.View image in fullscreenLight mischief … Stephen Elrod as Claudius (background) with Kaisha Dessalines Wright (Guildenstern), Maddox Morfit-Tighe (Hamlet) and Caroline Bertorello (Rosencrantz).Photograph: Millissa Martin PhotographyIt’s full pelt, so when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern pull up, the sense of light mischief shared by Caroline Bertorello and Kaisha Dessalines Wright respectively is all the more appreciated. In matching vests and shorts, with a script deviating from Shakespeare, they’re not so much a deceptive duo as pals with a more-than-friends frisson.The play within the play is cod Bob Fosse but in Landa’s production the use of music and poppy, cocksure aesthetic are not unlike Baz Luhrmann’s take on Romeo and Juliet. This venue’s past life as a church is also cannily deployed when a curtain is pulled to reveal ecclesiastical architecture during Claudius’s confession.The emotional impact often needs heightening but Ophelia’s death, in a water-filled glass box, becomes a transfixing sequence accompanied by Weyes Blood’s track Movies. Her body contorts as if twisted by the men who have wielded control of her. It leaves Gertrude’s elegy oddly redundant.Flashy, dreamy, occasionally barmy, it’s certainly seldom boring – an eye-popping primer for students with appeal for Hamlet stans, too.AtAssembly Roxy, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalCircusDanceHamletWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a struggle. “He has arms,” is about as good as it gets. The actors who play them are less reticent. Highlights are itemised before I’ve even asked. “I love your hair,” Olivia Colman tellsBenedict Cumberbatch. “Short at the sides! Brilliant!” It’s their first time together in ages. They compare half-terms and weeding. She coos over his dislocated shoulder. He admires her suit.OK, enough mush. What do they hate about one another?“Tricky,” says Cumberbatch, ruminatively. “I hate how …”Colman moans. “Oh God, he’s gonna do ‘I hate, but aniceway.’”“Fuuuck,” he says. “I hate how she thinks five steps ahead of me. I hate how predictable I am around Olivia, and I hate what a grumpy arsehole I feel in the face of her unmitigated joy.”The Favourite review – Olivia Colman is priceless in punk Restoration rompRead moreHe’s been her “proud friend” for ages, he continues; leapt out of bed in his pyjamas to party with her when Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite swept the Baftas. Her intuition is “extraordinary. It’s all just there, not overcooked, a very raw talent.”“That’s one of the things I love about Ben,” Colman chips in.“I do the heavy talking?”“It means I can have a cup of tea. Probably do some emails. But also I want to hold your hand and go: ‘Don’t be hard on yourself.’” She pats him. “Because you do that.”“Yeah,” he nods, sheepish. “I do do that.”“But you areamazing. Very good and wonderful. I wish you could simply go: ‘I’m great!’ I’m going to enrol you in a workshop. No! Let’s go on a walking holiday together! I’ll hold your hand all the time and you’ll end upso happy.” A manic cackle.He joins in. “I’ll walk off a cliff because I won’t be scared of death any more.”“We won’t go anywhere with hills or cliffs,” says Colman. “Just back to my house every evening for loads of pasta. We’ll go on big round walks. You can’t get lost if you always go left.”He laughs, she beams. “When Ben’s face lights up, it’s a whole-body shake. It’s properly joyful working with him. Oh, this issickly, isn’t it.” The door opens and something green and livid in a glass is ushered in. “Oh fuck, here comes my wanky matcha,” says Cumberbatch bashfully. “What colour is your wee after that?” asks Colman. He grins. “I’ll show you.”View image in fullscreenIvy (Colman) and Theo (Cumberbatch) get digging in The Roses.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkThe Roses is less of an acid brew than its source material: Warren Adler’s 1981 novel, The War of the Roses, and the 1989 adaptation by Danny DeVito, starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Gone is the quasi-rape, the almost-murder and the moment Douglas’s lawyer urinates on the fish that Turner’s aspiring caterer has prepped for a tasting.In the 2025 film, she has been upgraded to a chef while he becomes an architect. The pair escape London for California with their young twins, where her career rockets as his nosedives. She’s on magazine covers. He handles nits.Yet relations only crumble so far: Ivy and Theo do sort of want to stay together. But if they can’t, they each definitely want to stay sole owners of the swanky beach villa he’s designed and she’s bankrolled.Capitalism is the problem, reckons screenwriter Tony McNamara, an Australian best known for his work with Yorgos Lanthimos (including The Favourite). “It’s become an element of marriage,” he says, earlier that morning. “Both partners have to work. In the 1960s and 70s we might have been less emotionally articulate but it’s tougher today because of the idea you have to get fulfilment from your career and be special.” Balancing that with a partner, children and a mortgage is “ridiculous”, he says.Theo pours his thwarted ambition into his children, drilling them into athletic prodigies. “It’s really hard for men,” says McNamara, “because they’re brought up for a sort of ego success; that’s the way to define himself. When that’s taken away, he makes his kids the success.”Ivy enjoys her acclaim but comes to covet Theo’s bond with the twins. “When she got the chance,” says McNamara, “her ego was as big as his. And she couldn’t balance it, either.”It would be possible to do a bracingly traditionalist reading of The Roses. To see the film as a cautionary tale about the perils of swapping gender roles – or even of progress full stop.“Steady on, Tony,” says Colman, when I recount his theories. “I mean, in the 60s and 70s, women weren’t really encouraged to …” She pauses, then assumes a fond Aussie accent. “Oh yeah! I didn’t mean that … I’m gonna get in so much trouble.”Cumberbatch attempts a defence. “Look, there was an idealism in the 60s, the fledgling of equality ….”“Womenalwaysthought about equality,” counters Colman.“But then there were open relationships and changing gender roles,” continues Cumberbatch. “I think we are in an era where we are trying to have it all.”View image in fullscreenThe cast of The Roses (from left), Sunita Mani, Jamie Demetriou, Ncuti Gatwa, Benedict Cumberbatch,  Zoë Chao, Kate McKinnon and Olivia Colman.Photograph: Bryan AdamsYes, says Colman, firmly. “What I like about this is it’snotabout genders, it’s about roles at home. It could be a same-sex couple.” She pauses. “I mean, it could have all been solved with a nanny.”Cumberbatch perks up. “I did think that at one point. Because though they hate each other, there’s no trust issue. They’re not unfaithful. The nanny thing could have played with that.”“You could have had a fling with a nanny!” says Colman, excited. “Or I could. Dammit!”“Missed opportunity,” says Cumberbatch, with the hint of a grimace.Jay Roach, the director of The Roses, has the calm smile and open gaze of a couples therapist – which is what he wanted to be, if his movies (including Meet the Parents and Austin Powers) hadn’t taken off. “I take on projects to work my own shit out,” he says. “I really am fascinated by what makes a relationship work or what dooms it.”The Roses also betrays his interest in the special relationship between the US and UK. “I’ve always had an inferiority complex,” he says. “But especially around British people. They are so much wittier and more articulate. Olivia and Benedict are hilariously dark and insulting, even off camera.”In the film, Ivy and Theo’s brittle banter contrasts with the sometimes spectacular frankness of their American friends, two couples played by Andy Samberg and Kate McKinnon,Jamie Demetriouand Zoë Chao. “When Ivy and Theo are really harsh with each other, they’re sort of speaking in their love language,” says Roach. “When Americans try, they suck at it.”Olivia Colman wins best actress Oscar for The FavouriteRead moreBoth Cumberbatch and Colman are popular across the Atlantic. Both are also perceived as quintessentially British – a sense cemented by Colman’s best actress Oscar acceptance speech. (“Brilliant!” says Cumberbatch, who raises it unprompted. “Like Olivia mach 11.”)He’s perhaps more of a fan of the US than she. “You don’t have to stay in your lane over there,” he says. “You can keep evolving.” He talks about how “history speaks to a more nefarious version” of the idea that Britons are refined and Yanks brutes.He also questions the charge levelled by the film: that Americans don’t get irony. “It taps into that cliche: that Brits say to each other things that are really quite cruel, cold and barbed – and Americans just think it’s funny. But maybe that’s changed. Look at the roasting thing … ”“They’ve taken itsofar,” says Colman.“Barbaricallycruel. Not at all epigrammatic.”View image in fullscreenA cautionary tale? Cumberbatch and Kate McKinnon.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkDo they soften their own swearing outside England? “Oh I go much worse,” says Colman. “My first time in America, my lovely team went: [nervous American accent] ‘Um, I know you like the c-word. We can’t do the c-word here.’ And then the LA Times asked me about David Tennant and I said: ‘Oh, total cunt!’ and you could see everyone’s colour just draining. It’s because I was told not to.”“It’s that school thing, isn’t it,” says Cumberbatch.“Yeah,” she says, “everybody wants to say ‘cunt’. It’s a great word.”There are limits though, even for Colman. Some years back, she was bathing her train-mad young son and spelling out words for him in foam letters on the tiles. He requested “Fat Controller”, per Thomas the Tank Engine. She’d got as far as “fat c” when her husband appeared, alarmed. “Idiot! I’m not gonna write ‘fat cunt’ on the bath!”The pair potter off on a tangent, rhapsodising over Brio (Colman: “The bridges!”; Cumberbatch: “Sosatisfying”) and comparing notes on classics of children’s literature that seem less palatable when you’re a parent.“I had a little squiz at the Mr Men books,” says Cumberbatch. “And oh my God! Mr Chatterbox is basically gagged and laughed at by the postman. Can you imagine teaching a child that’s acceptable? Just shut someone up with a mask.”“And Mr Nosey!” says Colman. “You shouldn’t be nosy, but they sort of hurt him.”“Alotof consent issues with Mr Tickle.”The series should be repurposed as teaching aids, thinks Colman. “Everyone gets a red flag and waves it when they spot inappropriate behaviour.”Both Colman and Cumberbatch are in notoriously happy marriages. She’s been with the writer Ed Sinclair since university. They have three children, as do Cumberbatch and his wife, theatre director Sophie Hunter. Do they think we romanticise love?“By its very nature, yes,” says Cumberbatch. “And I think that’s fine.”“I love love,” says Colman, cheerily. “I like to romanticise love. I think it’s ace.”View image in fullscreenJay Roach in 2017.Photograph: Matt Baron/REX/ShutterstockCumberbatch leans back. It’s a bit of a format, this: she says something chirpy and succinct, he expands on it thoughtfully, prodding the other side of the coin.“Classicism has given us this sort of romantic ideal of love,” he says, “which is impossible to live up to. Those two things wrestle: it’s great to fall in love, but eventually one of you will be dog-tired and doing the bins.”“And then you take turns,” says Colman briskly, “and step up to the plate.”“But that’s the thing. There has to be this cool thing beyond the idealism of vows.” He talks mistily about his wedding. “It’s such a powerful thing to express love and then have it reflected back with your friends and family. But to find something beyond that heightened moment, you have to think a bit more deeply than just the party of love.”“Three more matchas!” says Colman, impressed.In the film, Theo says he feels “great waves of dizzying hatred” for his wife. Is that incompatible with love? Cumberbatch gulps. “God, this is like a Trojan horse to our [private] lives. When you’re living closely with someone, you go through all the extremes of life. That’s really what love is: getting through them.”A pause. “I’m not sure I’ve felt massive hatred,” says Colman.“I didn’t mean that,” he says, quickly. “But moments when you’re not massively in love.”“I’m quite in love.”“I am too! It’s all great. It’s, y’know, life. And I know Ed annoys you sometimes.”“Only a bit, and it’s been 30 years. It’s not bad to be a bit annoyed with each other.”“Hate is a very strong word.”“Not a good word,” says Colman. “Unless it’s thrown at certain political leaders. Then ‘cunt’ is fine.”View image in fullscreenDifferent approaches … Sunita Mani, Colman and Ncuti Gatwa in The Roses.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkIn The Roses, just as the American friends offer a counterpoint to Theo and Ivy’s robust irony (and blasphemy), so two servers in Ivy’s restaurant represent a different approach to courtship. Jane (Sunita Mani) shags a co-worker in the big fridge. Jeffrey (Ncuti Gatwa, who played the last iteration of Doctor Who) blows truckers in the car park. A younger generation, says McNamara, are less wedded to the idea that love lasts for ever.The actors who play them share this take, as well as the screenwriter’s theory that being told you’re special is fatal for relationships. “In America, individuality is such a currency,” says Mani. “It’s bait: ‘Be you!’ It becomes commodified so quickly.”Gatwa hums in agreement. “There’s this narrative on socials, a line I see all the time: ‘I’m the prize!’” He shakes his head sadly. “Dating apps have done something to our brains.”“[The] feeling that you need to be ‘special’ is really exploited,” says Mani. Gatwa nods. “The void has been capitalised.”View image in fullscreenTony McNamara and his wife, Belinda Bromilow, at the 2024 Oscars.Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/Getty ImagesAsk these two if we romanticise love and you get a rather different response to Colman and Cumberbatch. “Yes!” yells Gatwa. “Oh. My. God. Nineties films have done a number on us! Disney, too. We’ve all been trained to think that someone’s coming to save us.”Mani concurs. Fairytales are catnip, she says, “in this age of technology and loneliness”.At 32 and 38, Gatwa and Mani are a good decade younger than the film’s leads (Cumberbatch is 49, Colman 51). So too, in fact, are the actors who play their friends. Down the hall of the hotel sit Demetriou, 37, McKinnon, 41, and Chao, 39, in a room set up for TV interviews. The three of them (sans Samberg) duly engage in the kind of comedy business (ear nuzzling, etc) perfect for social media reels. Unfortunately, this is print – and they soon get pretty glum, anyway.“I think our expectations of what a marriage is supposed to deliver are disproportionate and silly,” says McKinnon. “What it’s really for is comfort and solace as we move through time.”If you want to procreate, she says, other methods are available. Take bees: “Twenty-five female embryos are selected at random and overfed, and then they fight to the death. The queen emerges, then flies to a predetermined location to which all of the men in the colony fly, ejaculate upon her and then die.”“So that’s another way,” McKinnon concludes, caveating that I should check the science.View image in fullscreenZoë Chao and Jamie Demetriou.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkDemetriou says he’s better for being in a relationship, but still doesn’t seem entirely sold on the concept. “Were they intended or just a sort of habit we all got into?” he asks. “There’s no official organic document that says: this is the way.” Movies are indeed to blame: “Commitment porn. Even for those of us who can be like, ‘It’s just a film!’, those messages will have seeped in way before we were able to conjure that distinction.”“I feel as if I’ve been spending my whole adult life unraveling the stories that were fed to me at a very young age,” adds Chao, sadly. “I’ve been trying to do that math for a long time.”Such cynicism cannot be chalked up only to youth. For all their California sunniness and Aussie bonhomie, Roach, 68, and McNamara, 58, also sing from the same bleak hymn sheet.“We’re all lonely and dysfunctional and scared,” says the director. “When you find that other person that feels the same way you do, it’s an amazing, magical thing. It feels like we’re tapping into our higher angels. When you lose that, it’s so painful.”An actor recently told McNamara that, though he wanted to stay with his wife, the way she ate made him want to kill her. “Most of the people I know are in the creative world,” he says. At root, he concedes, The Roses is a Hollywood fable: “It’s hard for two creative people to carry a life together.”View image in fullscreenAll at sea .. Colman and Cumberbatch.Photograph: Jaap BuitendijkYet Colman and Cumberbatch, snuggled in their suite, seem to manage it. Presumably they’re plagued by people seeking relationship advice? Both look nonplussed: neither has ever been asked for any. “I feel a bit disappointed now,” says Colman. “Maybe people look at [me and Ed] and go: ‘God no! Notthatway.’ I might text all my friends after [this]. “What’s wrong with us? It’s been 30 years and we’ve worked together. We’ve done really well!”So how do they sustain marriages in which one party is publicly adored? They don’t entirely answer. Every profession needs public approbation, says Colman, “not just the obvious showoff actors”. Totally essential, agrees Cumberbatch. “It’s part of how you see the reflection of who you are. It can’t just be about the grounding your children and your partner give you.”Though yes, he says, gesturing round the room, all this is “certainly something that can warp your sense of self and give you entitlement”.“It’s slightly off the scale, isn’t it?” says Colman. “You need to try to remember that it’s silly.”“Have fun with it and then just go home.”“And clear up some dog vomit or something, just to remind you.”And if there is none?“Find some,” says Cumberbatch. “Just go to Olivia’s house.”The Roses is released on 29 AugustExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsOlivia ColmanBenedict CumberbatchJamie DemetrioufeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s part of the charm – and possibly a slight failing – in the south London standup’s new set. As he treads around in a circle on his small stage, Your Old Mucker unfolds at its own laconic pace, and leaves us to make meaning out of its disparate parts. The 29-year-old’s authority, his sly standoffishness and playfulness with the art form are qualities of a standup near the top of his game – albeit one who with this ambling, endearing show doesn’t get quite as much out of them as he might.The conceit here is that Night’s writing process is, in fact, a walking one. The show traces his perambulations around his local neighbourhood, from the dentist to the butcher, from Nisa Local to the betting shop, connecting with friends and local characters along the way. Dotted throughout are references to his late grandad, whose eccentricities (a penchant for filling biscuit tins with not-biscuits; a circumcision in his 80s) are to grandson Ed a wonder and inspiration.As for how these strands connect – well, I’d have liked the show to “come to me” just a little bit more in that regard. Given Night’s present-day story is prominently a tale of penniless, fragile young adulthood, dodging bills and drinking cheap coffee in chicken shops, maybe the parallel with his wartime forebear is there purely for bathos? Not that there’s anything heroic about grandad, if the audio clips of his left-field second world war memories (or lack thereof) are anything to go by.But if Your Old Mucker unfolds obliquely, it is studded with original thinking, great phrasemaking and big-hitting jokes – of which the guide-dog gags, a vision of Fortnum & Mason as Dante’s hell and a routine on bargaining with his landlord for a lower rent are standouts. With a couple of later riffs (one on the Buddha; one on Steve Irwin) seemingly winched in from different shows entirely, the show may not hang together that tightly. But walking a mile in Night’s shoes is still, in thisEdinburgh comedy award-nominatedshow, a wander well worth taking.AtMonkey Barrel, the Hive, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the joke is that these are the traits of two demanding pet owners: overanxious Shira, who has confined Iris to life as a house cat, and the vain Arlan, who makes Jeffabelle do tricks for TikTok.Produced by Leeds University’s Aireborne Theatre, and directed by Amit, it’s full of promise and proof that student performance –increasingly priced out of the fringe– is vital to the Edinburgh festival ecology.These cats don’t purr or miaow but talk through their emotions: Jeffabelle is fed up with having to jump at cucumbers and Iris has exacting standards about how she is stroked. But Danny Gordon Boyd and Phoebe Nichols, respectively, have a tactile body language that captures feline languor, superiority and playfulness. When Iris escapes through a window, Jeffabelle takes her for a night on the town to get in touch with her wild side – followed by a bashful “morning after” scene about exactly who sniffed whose bum first.View image in fullscreenDanny Gordon Boyd (Jeffabelle) and Sonny Birrane (Arlan).Photograph: Abby SwainAs these opposites attract, so do their owners Shira (Beth Sanders) and Arlan (Sonny Birrane), both couples nuzzling in one sweet scene. The script reflects on loneliness, liberty, life in early adulthood and the healing power of cats who “make you kinder to yourself”, says Shira. The writers clearly have their own furry inspirations and are attuned to moggy behaviour. “Water always tastes better when you don’t know how long it’s been out for,” says Jeffabelle, lapping away at a dubious drink.Sanders displays great comic timing and the play makes hay with the awkwardness in both relationships, even if the cats’ adventure loses momentum, some jokes could be sharper and the ending feels unfinished. But it’s an appealing concept, lots of fun and gives a quirky account of human behaviour – and the cats who tolerate us.AttheSpace @ Surgeons’ Hall, Edinburgh, until 23 August.

Having explored the outer limits of human knowledge, this renaissance man can go no further. Unless, that is, he signs a pact with the devil. In exchange for his soul, Mephistopheles gives him all the earthly pleasure and intellectual satisfaction he desires.But sins have consequences and in this ambitious show by William Kentridge forSouth Africa’s Handspring Puppet Company, a reworking of a 1995 production, Faustus does not take this journey towards damnation alone: the world comes with him. Now, his list of job titles extends to missionary and enslaver, and his travels across the African continent lead to war, exploitation and environmental catastrophe. If there were an eighth deadly sin, it would be that of colonialism.It is a fertile idea, one that allows Kentridge to present a parable about western hubris. In a rhyming translation by the late Robert David Macdonald, he shows the damaging legacy of the quest for wealth, power and resources, its impact not just a historical blip but a lasting wound. In a clever twist, Faustus escapes damnation because a corrupted continent has become dependent on his venal ways and cannot afford to lose him. It is as if the whole of Africa is a victim of Stockholm syndrome.View image in fullscreenStriking visuals … Faustus in Africa!Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianSet in an early-20th-century library where a manual telephone exchange connects calls from a disembodied devil, Faustus in Africa! tells much of its story through Kentridge’s scratchy black-and-white animations projected at the back of the stage. Maps chart Faustus’s progress across the land, where a bloodthirsty safari destroys not only elk, warthogs and buffalo, but also the statues of great thinkers, leaving “the wound of a slashed future”.Half-size human puppets by Adrian Kohler and Basil Jones rise up from behind the bookshelves, meeting skeletal animals, a shadow-puppet military parade and the occasional grisly fate. Only Mephistopheles takes human form (a suave Wessel Pretorius in “corrective shoes” to hide his devil’s hoof). Operated by two puppeteers, Faustus is square-jawed and gaunt, an unreflecting figure, indifferent to his impact.For all that it looks striking, static exchanges between inanimate puppets sap some of the energy from an enterprising production.At theRoyal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 23 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalTheatrePuppetryWilliam KentridgereviewsShareReuse this content"

In 2008’sThe Hurt Lockershe charted the psychological intensity of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq. Four years later, inZero Dark Thirty, she dramatised the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden. Her latest film turns to a different, though no less urgent, anxiety: the prospect of nuclear catastrophe.View image in fullscreenA still from A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/Netflix“I grew up in an era when hiding under your school desk was considered the go-to protocol for surviving an atomic bomb,” Bigelow, 73, said before the premiere. “Today, the danger has only escalated. Multiple nations possess enough nuclear weapons to end civilisation within minutes. And yet, there’s a kind of collective numbness – a quiet normalisation of the unthinkable.”Bigelow was born in San Carlos, California, in 1951, the daughter of a factory manager and a librarian. By her own account she was a shy child, drawn to art as an outlet. She studied painting at the San Francisco Art Institute before moving to New York, where she immersed herself in conceptual art and studied under Susan Sontag at Columbia. “Painting is a bit elitist,”she later said. “Film crosses culture and class.”Herfirst feature, The Loveless (1981), co-directed with Monty Montgomery and starring a young Willem Dafoe, gave little indication of the trajectory to come.View image in fullscreenAnthony Mackie and Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker, which won six Academy Awards.Photograph: First Light Production/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn the 1980s and 1990s she built a reputation directing cult thrillers that inverted genre conventions, including the vampire western Near Dark (1987), the cop drama Blue Steel (1990), and the surfer-heist thrillerPoint Break(1991), which starred Keanu Reeves and waslater hailed as a cult classic in action cinema. Bigelow’s pivot toward historical, politically grounded narratives came with K-19: The Widowmaker (2002), a cold war drama about a group of men aboard the Soviet Union’s first nuclear-powered submarine, starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson.But her real breakthrough did not come until 2008 with TheHurt Locker, a film she partly self-financed and shot under punishing conditions in Jordan, where temperatures reached 54C. The story of three soldiers disarming roadside bombs, written by the journalist Mark Boal, won six Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. Bigelow became the first woman to win the directing prize, beating her ex-husband, James Cameron, who was nominated for Avatar.View image in fullscreenKathryn Bigelow speaking on stage at the 2022 Gotham awards in New York.Photograph: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for The Gotham Film & Media InstituteUntil Bigelow, only three women had been nominated for best director in nearly a century of Academy Awards. In the years since, just two others – Chloé Zhao and Jane Campion – have joined her. But Bigelow resisted the moment’s symbolism and has repeatedly rejected overt labels. In interviews, she paraphrased Gertrude Stein – “A filmmaker is a filmmaker is a filmmaker” – andsaid her aptitude was not to “break gender roles or gender traditions”but to “explore and push the medium”.Still, critics have pointed to the undercurrents of masculinity and power in her films, which tend to centre on themes of violence. In 2010,Time Magazine paid tributeto her ability to capture “the intense, skewered madness of war and the distortion in men’s souls”, naming her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.View image in fullscreenKeanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in 1991’s Point Break, which became a cult movie.Photograph: Cinetext/Allstar Collection/20 Century Fox/AllstarBigelow’s follow-up in 2012, Zero Dark Thirty, revisited the US’s “war on terror” with a procedural account of the CIA’s pursuit of Bin Laden, starring Jessica Chastain. The film was a critical and commercial success butprovoked controversy for its depiction of “enhanced interrogation” techniquessuch as waterboarding. Anti-torture activistsstaged protests outside its premiere in Washington DC.Bigelowdefended the work, writing in the Los Angeles Times: “Depiction is not endorsement. It does seem illogical to me to make a case against torture by ignoring or denying the role it played in US counter-terrorism policy and practices.” The director also described herself as a “lifelong pacifist” and said such sentiments would be more appropriately directed at those who instituted and ordered US policies.In the decade since Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow’s output has been sparse. She directed Detroit in 2017, a harrowing account ofthe 1967 Detroit uprisings, and produced the Netflix documentary Cartel Land in 2015, which won an Emmy.View image in fullscreenJessica Chastain with Alex Corbet Burcher in 2012’s Zero Dark Thirty.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarThat long gap is partly what makes A House of Dynamite so highly anticipated. Produced by Netflix and starring Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Tracy Letts,Greta Leeand Jared Harris, it unfolds through the perspective of White House officials grappling with an imminent ballistic threat. It will premiere in competition in Venice before a limited theatrical release and a rollout on Netflix on 24 October.“I wanted to make a film that confronts this paradox – to explore the madness of a world that lives under the constant shadow of annihilation, yet rarely speaks of it,” Bigelow said.For a director who haslong been drawn to life’s toughest adventures, including once climbing Kilimanjaro, it marks the resumption of a career defined by confronting some of the world’s most volatile flashpoints.Explore more on these topicsKathryn BigelowHurt LockerPoint BreakZero Dark ThirtyVenice film festivalFestivalsNetflixprofilesShareReuse this content"

It’s icky, irresponsible televisionHannah J DaviesFri 22 Aug 2025 09.34 EDTLast modified on Fri 22 Aug 2025 09.40 EDTShareIn January 2019, news outlets across the world reported that the actor Jussie Smollett had been the victim of a particularly vile and disturbing hate crime. Smollett – who was, at the time, best known for his leading role in Fox’s music dramaEmpire– had been set upon in the early hours of the morning in his Chicago neighbourhood by two white men who had racially and homophobically abused him (Smollett is gay and mixed race). During a bitter cold snap in the city, the men had poured bleach on him and even tied a noose around his neck, while declaring they were in “Maga country”. The resulting deluge of support for Smollett is recounted in the opening of this documentary, with even Donald Trump describing the attack as “horrible … it doesn’t get any worse”.Can a Netflix documentary explain what really happened to Jussie Smollett?Read moreThese days, Smollett is no longer best known for his role on Empire but for his participation in what is widely understood to have been a hoax, organised by the actor and carried out for a fee by two acquaintances, brothers Akimbola (Bola) and Olabinjo Osundairo (Ola). The idea the Osundairos – who are of Nigerian heritage – had perpetrated a fake white supremacist attack made the case into instant meme fodder, while subsequent legal proceedings saw Smollett charged with having staged the whole thing.But is that what really happened? The Truth About Jussie Smollett? – a 90-minute documentary from the makers of such Netflix hits as The Tinder Swindler – teases the possibility of something more sinister. It asks whether the actor was the victim of a conspiracy at the heart of the city’s criminal justice system, that turned him from victim to perpetrator. It’s bold, it’s shocking – and it’s utter nonsense.View image in fullscreenFormer superintendent Eddie Johnson in The Truth About Jussie Smollett?Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThings start out convincingly enough, with testimonies from senior figures from the Chicago police department. They outline the facts of the case, as well as the inconsistencies that troubled them. Or, as the then-superintendent Eddie Johnson puts it, why would anyone have left their home “when it’s cold as shit?” Smollett had bought a sandwich, a meal that survived the attack (we see CCTV footage of him walking back into his apartment building with a Subway bag in his hand). It wasn’t conclusive, but it seemed – at the very least – odd.Rider data from Uber led the police to the Osundairos, aspiring actors who – conveniently – had flown to Nigeria the day after the attack. Footage of Smollett crying during a TV interview is juxtaposed with that of the police apprehending the brothers on their return to the US. We meet them in the present day – Ola is spaced out, while Bola modestly describes himself as “an all-round great human being”. Being hired to beat someone up was, they say, the sort of thing they assumed happened all the time in Hollywood. Plus, they allege, the idea was to give Smollett a leg-up in becoming an activist. For his part, Smollett is interviewed throughout, looking morose as he relays his version of events to camera. He insists a cheque he made out to the brothers was actually payment for fat-busting herbal steroids they would procure for him back in Nigeria, and says his life descended into a game of “whack-a-mole” in the face of rumours and lies.The Osundairos ultimately avoided any criminal charges. Smollett, meanwhile,drafted in a lawyer whose client list reads like a roll call of the most problematic public figures of our time, including Andrew Tate and Chris Brown. He was written out of Empire, then reached a plea deal with the city of Chicago that involved him sacrificing his bail money and doing community service. But then he was tried again and sent to jail, only for a court to find it unlawful that he was tried twice on the same charges and decide tooverturn his conviction.This, arguably, is where The Truth About Jussie Smollett? should end – but it just keeps going, becoming increasingly icky and irresponsible. The final act is given over almost entirely to talking heads Abigail Carr and Chelli Stanley, who weave conspiracy theory and conjecture together as they claim the Chicago police framed Smollett. After all, two eyewitnesses were given short shrift by the police, and there’s some grainy footage where the suspects look as though they could, maybe, be white. We are told, too, about the police’s worrying record on race (quelle surprise), and the fact that Johnson (who is black) wasfired for misconduct. It feels more than a little problematic to link Johnson – fired for drinking on the job – with a plot to purposely incriminate Smollett and the Osundairos while letting two hypothetical white criminals off the hook, and there is no evidence here to say that was what happened.Stanley is a freelance journalist who has written a handful of articles on Smollett, while Carr is a British TV documentary producer. How they came to be authorities on the case is never explained, and their contributions feel far too lightweight to justify the screen time given to them. (The credits reveal that both are consultant producers.) The final revelation is that Bola and Ola have written a tell-all book: cue some blooper-style scenes of them trying to remember what it’s actually called. The implication seems to be that the brothers have exploited their brush with infamy for financial gain, and thrown Smollett under the bus. But, really, a programme like thishas no business taking the moral high ground at all.The Truth About Jussie Smolllett? is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewEmpirereviewsShareReuse this content"

It hops around in time from the 50s to 2022 in a flurry of one-linersStuart HeritageFri 22 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareFew shows in recent memory have boasted the hidden depths ofRaphael Bob-Waksberg’s BoJack Horseman. Conceived and marketed as a surreal stoner comedy about the madcap adventures of a delusional washed-up half-human, half-horse former sitcom star, BoJack quickly burned off its premise and unfurled into something quite wonderful.Little by little, the jokes started to disappear. The central character stopped being a punchbag and became a case study of depression and loneliness. At times, the focus on trauma was overwhelming – witness The View From Halfway Down episode, in which BoJack is haunted by figures from his past while his brain starves of oxygen as he drowns in a pool – but the series was ambitious enough to single out Bob-Waksberg as a generational talent.It stands to reason that his new series, Long Story Short, should give us several generations at once. The show is the tale of the Schwoopers, an unexceptional Jewish family, told at various points between 1959 and 2022. Chronologically, episodes shuffle the deck – one might start in the 1990s and end this decade, or vice versa – which means that all the characters are in a constant state of flux. There is no fixed point to them. They are all transitional figures, growing and learning from various levels of experience.In essence, this makes Long Story Short the anti-Simpsons. The Simpsons is trapped in the perpetual now, with the characters still the same age as they were in the 1990s. Long Story Short, though, cannot sit still, barely managing to stay in the same year for 15 minutes at a time. Characters we see as children grow old, have kids, lose their hair, get divorced; their carefree youth gives way to the regret-filled trudge of middle age.Which sounds heavier than it is. Because, on a minute-by-minute basis, Long Story Short is fantastically funny. Episodes rip along in a flurry of one-liners and sitcom tropes – there is a chaotic barmitzvah, a harebrained business enterprise, a fertility mix-up – that land almost without fail. There is even a scattering of blink-and-you’ll-miss-them visual gags, such as when a young mother daydreams that her children will grow up to win the Nobel prize for emotional regulation.The magic trick is the slow build of melancholy that gradually amasses beneath all this. Bob-Waksberg has claimed that the show deals with “small-t” trauma. There is nothing (at least for now) that plumbs the operatic darkness of BoJack Horseman, but we are still given enough to learn why all these imperfect people are the way they are. Usually the root cause tends to be a well-intentioned but emotionally ill-equipped parent, because some things never change.The parent in question here is more often than not Naomi, played spectacularly by Lisa Edelstein. Long Story Short has an incredible cast – Ben Feldman, Abbi Jacobson, Paul Reiser, Max Greenfield – but Edelstein is given the most amount of scenery to chew. An overbearing matriarch prone to assaulting everyone around her with a suffocating mix of affection, dismissal and passive-aggression, Naomi is the closest this show comes to being two-dimensional.Had the series been set at one fixed point in time – perhaps as we meet her in episode one, belittling her son’s new girlfriend for not grasping the finer points of a Jewish household – that accusation would probably stand. But before long we have been bounced back in time and introduced to her mother, at which point you can’t help but sympathise with her. Again and again, the show reminds us that everything is an echo of what came before.This is a testament to Bob-Waksberg’s writing. This level of granular, non-linear character development must have been a feat to construct, and yet it feels effortless. These seem like snapshots from a real life that has already been lived. Every progression rings true. Every new turn feels earned. You hesitate to wonder precisely the level of autobiography he is pulling from, and whether any of his family is still talking to him.Theoretically, a show as funny and clever as this could run for ever. That said, shows like this have a habit of running out of steam faster than usual. Dan Fogelman’s This Is Us, which similarly told a non-chronological family story, quickly found itself hamstrung by a lack of material; all the juicy plots were eaten up quickly, leaving the series to sustain itself on increasingly mediocre memories until it fizzled out.It would be a disservice to the pure enjoyment of these opening episodes if the Schwoopers were forced to exist on similar scraps down the line. Hopefully, that won’t happen. I have lived with this family for six decades now, and I’m still greedy for more.Long Story Short is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAnimation on TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nicolas Cage is almost too perfectly cast as “the Surfer”, a father hoping to introduce his teenage son to his childhood seaside home and ride some waves. However, a gang of larrikins led by Julian McMahon’s smug Scally deem Luna Bay a locals-only venue – and will do anything to stop his attempts to surf there. This brightly lit but darkly menacing film grows increasingly hallucinatory and nightmarish as the Surfer is stripped of his money, phone, food, car, even his board.

The first part of this tragedy may have been unavoidable, given the force of the storm; the second element certainly wasn’t. Via some beautiful footage of pre-Katrina New Orleans at Mardi Gras time, this documentary series remembers the city as it once was. It also doesn’t hesitate to call out the trail of mendacity, negligence and incompetence that made the disaster – and its aftermath – so much worse than it needed to be.Netflix, from Wednesday 27 AugustKPoppedView image in fullscreenA new Korea … Psy, known for the viral Gangnam Style, co-hosts the pop show.Photograph: AppleAs the performer who, as he modestly puts it “brought K-pop to the world”, it’s fitting thatPsyshould present this cross-cultural light entertainment spectacular.

The opening episode sees Megan Thee Stallion face off against Patti LaBelle, each backed by half of girl group Billie. It turns out that both Savage and Lady Marmalade work perfectly as K-pop bangers, even if Lady Marmalade was released before anyone else on the stage was born.Apple TV+, from Friday 29 AugustWith Love, MeghanView image in fullscreenDomestic bliss … Meghan, Duchess of Sussex with close friend Daniel Martin.Photograph: NetflixIt is remarkable that something as bland as Meghan Markle’s lifestyle show could become a culture war. But, in defiance of the wishes of certain furious British tabloids and in celebration ofher and Harry Windsor’s new deal with Netflix, Markle is back with yet more performative signifiers of pastel-coloured domestic bliss. It’s the usual assemblage of cooking, flower-arranging and crafting tips – basically, she really loves the idea of “finding new ways to show people you care”.

This origin story takes us into the heart of the black ops mission at the root of their trauma. Reece is recruited to a covert anti-terrorist initiative but it becomes increasingly unclear who stands to gain from this plot. Soon, questions of loyalty threaten to derail the mission. It’s generic and deeply humourless, with a range encompassing enigmatic scowling, gratuitous gunplay and not much else besides.Prime Video, from Wednesday 27 AugustDating NakedView image in fullscreenBaring all … Amara, Jordan and Matt are among those Dating Naked.Photograph: Nest Productions/Paramount GlobalHosted by the very likableRylan Clark, the second series of this dating show brings together 10 singletons, places them in an idyllic resort in Panama and asks them to shed their clothes and their inhibitions. It does its best to promote body positivity – all the participants admit to nervousness and one proclaims himself to be “average. I prefer going down the pub to going to the gym.” Once the initial gimmick has become familiarised, it settles down to become pretty routine.

The story transported me to a hillside on an island in ancient Greece. I think that moment put the idea in my head that books, the best ones, were a kind of magic.My favourite book growing upIn my teens I stopped reading, like lots of boys. My mum was the only bookish person in our family, almost everyone else was obsessed with our farm. My grandma scolded me one day for reading in daylight hours; she said there couldn’t possibly be so little to do on the farm that a boy should sit and read a book. She swept me out of her kitchen to find some work to do. And I felt ashamed that she thought I was idle.The book that changed me as a teenagerWhen I was 15, I left school and worked on our farm, and I began reading again. I read at night, because I couldn’t yet drive and there was nothing on TV. I was lucky that my mum had a bookcase of great books, left to her by her schoolteacher dad. I felt a bit of an alien in my own life at that time, as many young people do, and I found my best friends in those books. I was spending my evenings with Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, JD Salinger or Wilfred Owen (yes, it was quite a male sample, and I should have read my grandad’s copies of Iris Murdoch, but didn’t). I didn’t dare tell anyone about this reading, so I was a closet reader for years. But thanks to those books, I didn’t feel so alone.The writer who changed my mindI recently readPoverty, By Americaby Matthew Desmond. It helped me understand how our economic system works, why it stays like that, and how many of us benefit from the existence of other people’s poverty.The book that made me want to be a writerA Shepherd’s Lifeby WH Hudson. It was a revelation because it was about people like my family. It’s a portrait of rural life and farming people in the mid-19th century in Wiltshire, as remembered by an old shepherd who reminded me of my grandfather. Reading it, I felt my world could legitimately be the stuff of books, and that’s powerful when you are 16. It took me 20 years to get from that teenage burst of self-belief and purpose to having a book published, but it did happen. It was an international bestseller calledThe Shepherd’s Life.Theauthor I came back toOne of my favourite books isEmpire of the Sunby JG Ballard. But I find his other novels and short stories hard work. I keep trying to read them, because loads of talented writers admire and praise them, but it’s a bit of a slog.The book I rereadIf I had to live with just one book I might take the translated poems ofAnna Akhmatova, the Russian poet. She’s such an elegant and classy writer, dealing with some of the most horrific moments of the 20th century. There is a poem she wrote called Requiem, about those troubled times, that I think might be the best thing I’ve ever read.The book I could never read againI read a lot of Holocaust and gulag memoirs in my 20s. I think I wanted to understand what people could do to each other and what people could endure. And now I can’t read books like that – I have four kids and it’s all too real and heartbreaking.The book I discovered later in lifeI didn’t read any Wendell Berry until after I wrote my first book, which is really odd, because he is the greatest agrarian radical writer of our age. I love his essays (The World-Ending Fire) best, they are really clear-eyed and elegant, and grounded in his memories of rural Kentucky.The book I am currently readingOut Stealing Horsesby Per Petterson. A wonderful book that I’m reading for the third time. I am obsessed with Scandi literature. I feel like my cultural roots are to the north. I loveThe Summer Bookby Tove Jansson, the poetry of Tomas Tranströmer and the novels of Halldór Laxness: their obsession with kinship and deep-rooted belonging, and the kind of people that emerge from hardship in the north.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

These are the noises that, if he’s not wearing hearing aids, might escape Antrobus, who was born with what he often characterises as “missing sound” in the upper and lower registers: a whistling kettle or a doorbell disappears at one end, while at the other, syllables might get elided, rendering, for example, “suspicious” as “spacious” – words with problematically different meanings.If this idea of a continuum of sound seems straightforward, as Antrobus points out in this compact, powerful exploration of his experience, it is often hard to explain to those who understand deafness as an inability to hear anything. Many imagine deaf people existing entirely in silence, cut off from communication with the hearing world except through lip-reading, sign language and equipment. For Antrobus, this aspect of “audism” can be as effortful to navigate as conversations and soundscapes in which he uses practised strategies to compensate for what his ears do not pick up.Hearing loss is not the only context in which he is expected to adapt to others’ version of the world. Visiting the Cheshire village of Antrobus – its name derived from the Norman-French “entre-bois”, or “between woods”– he meets a farmer who assumes, because of the colour of his skin, that he is descended from a slave-owning baronet, although it is his mother’s family who bears the name rather than his Jamaican-born father’s. The encounter ends with him standing in a country churchyard with thoughts of the English working-classes and the enslaved plantation workers “turning, churning, burning, all of it inside the blood pumping in my ears”. It joins a long line of moments in which his identity as a mixed Black British person with a disability that is not always easy to define is subject to projection and appropriation.Antrobus interlaces episodes from his own life with accounts of pioneering teachers of the deaf, and of artists such as poet David Wright, who lost his hearing as a child and who, Antrobus believes, internalised his parents’ anxieties and consequently lived his life with a degree of shame he finds it easy to recognise. As a child, Antrobus often wished away his deafness and kept capital-D Deaf culture at arm’s length, leaving off his hearing aids and throwing himself into activities such as competitive swimming, in which his hearing peers would also find themselves in a world of distorted sound.In the Deaf community, he discovered, he could feel not deaf enough; in the hearing world, he could just about pass if he didn’t use the sign language that he caught other students mocking as his deaf schoolmates walked to class. At anger-management classes, he listened to his mother’s stories about his episodes of frustrated lashing out and heard them “less like someone trying to have an open conversation and more like an attack, an accusation, and the fury that was erupting in my teenage brain felt wrong, a source of my own shame”. As his mother attempted to help, his father, Seymour, bought him a punchbag; Antrobus hit it so hard, he sprained his wrist.Antrobus is understandably wary of salvation narratives, and his introduction to the world of poetry is also presented as difficult. At spoken-word nights, he would have to position himself carefully so as not be overwhelmed by creaking staircases or applause, and, as an audience member, was once agonisingly singled out by a poet for vocalising his own appreciation too loudly. Nonetheless, he began to realise that poetry “held and honoured many of my own burdens and truths” and, perhaps most significantly, gave him a way to integrate his experiences and identities with one another. What emerges most consistently from this moving book is his need to be met on his own terms, in a territory that he is given the freedom to map for himself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There is nothing new about these nostalgist leanings: Agatha Christie has after all been a solid film and TV export for more than half a century. ScreenwritersKaty Brandand Suzanne Heathcote adapt the novel and director Chris Columbus robustly delivers the C-major chords of mainstream entertainment. The result is some undemanding enjoyment, even if the film does appear finally to be saying something rather bold, even controversial, on the subject of assisted dying.The scene is Coopers Chase, a retirement facility that looks like a gigantic stately home grand enough to rival Downton Abbey; some of the exteriors were filmed at Englefield Estate in Berkshire. Inhabitants are assigned huge sets of panelled rooms – what must the fees at such an extraordinary place be? The clientele have all sorts of hobbies, but the most remarkable is that of the Thursday Murder Club. This comprises former MI6 chief Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), ex-trade unionist Ron (Pierce Brosnan), retired psychiatrist Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley) and former nurse Joyce (Celia Imrie), whose own obsession with baking absurdly lavish cakes brings some Bake-Off energy to the picturesque tale. They meet in the jigsaw room every week to discuss unsolved crimes, supplied to them by Elizabeth’s friend, a retired police officer now in the palliative care wing.Elizabeth’s husband Stephen (Jonathan Pryce) has dementia and is another resident of Coopers Chase; Elizabeth has apparently moved there as well to be with him and she is as vigorous and hale and hearty as her TMC pals. When their evil landlord Ian Ventham (David Tennant) unveils unspeakable plans to redevelop the place as luxury flats, this sets in train violent and mysterious events involving his business partners Tony Curran (Geoff Bell) and Bobby Tanner (Richard E Grant). These need to be investigated by local coppers DCI Chris Hudson (Daniel Mays), an officer with a serious chocolate habit, and WPC Donna de Freitas (Naomi Ackie). But the police won’t get anywhere without the help of the Thursday Murder Club, whose leader Elizabeth has icily forbidden use of the word “feisty” to describe them.There’s a fair bit to enjoy here, with the club sometimes resembling a kind of senior-citizen X-Men group whose collective superpower is invisibility; old people can do things without people noticing them. We also get some self-aware gags: Helen Mirren’s character at one stage walks in and her husband says that she looks “just like the queen” – that is, Queen Elizabeth, who Mirren portrayed in The Queen. Yet when the plot has to accelerate to the point of pure daftness in its final act, the movie resembles not so much a Sunday night crime serial, but a weekday afternoon kids’ TV show. Nothing necessarily wrong with that of course. The keynote is fun.The Thursday Murder Club is in cinemas from 22 August, and is on Netflix from 28 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekCrime filmsFilm adaptationsRichard OsmanOlder peopleComedy filmsKaty BrandreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are car chases and shootouts with absurdly attractive people in the middle of them and recognisable “that guy from” faces surrounding. But even back then it would have been a gamble without an A-lister attached, the film probably going the way of the many non-Fast & Furious car flops like Driven, Speed Racer, Drive Angry and Need for Speed.Honey Don’t! review – Ethan Coen returns with another amusing, throwaway queer comedyRead moreNow, it’s a much more obvious, and far safer, fit for streaming, with Disney wisely nudging this one to a Hulu/Disney+ premiere. Eenie Meanie still has the feel of something that was once on a bigger screen, though, with a reported $50m budget edging it above many of the season’s multiplex offerings (more than say Weapons, Nobody 2, Materialists or Freakier Friday). Exactly how and why this particular package was deemed worthy of such an unusual spend (in this climate!) is a bit of a head-scratcher, as the film is a mildly diverting yet strangely dated caper, a watered-down Tarantino rip-off without a soul of its own.It’s the feature debut of writer-director Shawn Simmons, who created the one-and-done action series Wayne and co-created John Wick spin-off The Continental, both shows not really leaving that much of an impression. But the former was exec-produced by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, the duo who co-wrote the Deadpool series, and they have also shepherded this one, with the franchise’s almost $3bn gross granting them a certain amount of special treatment at Disney. The smug irreverence of those films is mercifully kept in check here (the humour is more misfiring than actively annoying) but there’s a similar balance of action and comedy that’s also come to typify their work elsewhere. The pair have also written the execrable streaming duds 6 Underground andGhosted(their finest work, by a considerable amount, is their smart, terrifying Alien riffLife).Simmons’s script is marginally better than their worst and he does have an uncanny ability to construct genuine surprises, especially in the first act, but his sharp left turns soon fade and the journey ahead becomes a little too obvious. The star in the vehicle is Samara Weaving, the Australian Home and Away actor turned model turned genre mainstay best known for films like Ready or Not, The Babysitter and Scream VI. She plays Edie, an unlikely getaway driver, trained from a young age, nicknamed Eenie Meanie, who has turned her back on a life of crime, choosing the straight and narrow. But she’s dragged back in by her troublesome ex-boyfriend (Karl Glusman) whose latest mistake reunites her with former boss (Andy Garcia) and a far-fetched heist with life-or-death consequences.It’s the old “one last job” tale, filled with an inevitable array of overly quirky characters (brief appearances from Randall Park, Marshawn Lynch, Steve Zahn and Jermaine Fowler) and dialogue that confuses swearing with actual jokes (the limp banter is almost entirely zinger-free). Formative shared history with Glusman’s handsome yet consistently awful ex (referred to as “the 9/11 of fucking human beings”) never quite explains why someone as smart and savvy as Edie/Eenie would continue to risk everything for him. Glusman plays dumb well, although Weaving, struggling with an awkward midwestern accent, is a little indistinctive as a lead despite the flashy chaos that engulfs her. Their low-investment back-and-forth relationship can’t propel us through the more serious stretches, the film more effective when nothing or no one really matters.When that is the case, when we’re fixed behind the wheel with $50m to spend, the film zips into action and Simmons is a dab hand at choreographing an involving and kinetic car chase. He also throws in another left-turn in the finale, one that’s initially daring yet ultimately unsatisfying as he doesn’t quite know where to take us next, leaving us with an endnote of unearned sentimentality. It’s a bumpy road for Eenie and an even bumpier one for us.Eenie Meanie is now available on Hulu in the US and on Disney+ elsewhereExplore more on these topicsThrillersAndy GarcíaAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He brings that weight to his directorial stage debut of a Shakespeare play – and a comedy at that. Not exactly known for his comic chops (there is the odd Wes Anderson film in his oeuvre), Fiennes brings a depth to this pastoral about tyrant brothers and exiles that dares to venture into sombreness. It gives the drama a fuller body without taking away from its mischief.Played in modern dress, the court of Duke Frederick (Patrick Robinson) is less a kingdom than a suited and booted corporation. Although his usurped brother, Duke Senior (also played by Robinson) bears vestiges of the boardroom in his demeanour, he and his band of self-exiled dukes seem to have built an alternative community in the forest of Arden, inclusive, kind and living alongside nature rather than seeking a Prospero-like dominion over it.The production feels modern, and not, in its stripped-down stateliness. It is slow at times but there is sureness in it: Fiennes does not want to rush through the text or its meanings. Emotion is drawn, delicately, from scenes that are often swallowed up in faster-paced productions such as Duke Senior’s kindness towards Orlando (Charlie Rowe) in the face of his initial aggression which is born out of hunger, and in Orlando’s tender relationship with ailing servant Adam (Paul Jesson, touchingly played) who follows him into exile. These passing moments draw surprising tears.View image in fullscreenExquisite stagecraft … the cast of As You Like It.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe philosophical depths of the play are mined too: the idea that you have to get lost in order to find yourself, and wisdoms on ageing and mortality, so ruefully spoken by Jacques (Harriet Walter) in the seven ages of man speech.“To liberty and not banishment,” says Celia (Amber James) to her cousin Rosalind (Gloria Obianyo), as they leave the court for exile in Arden. As this suggests, the forest is not merely a place of magical mayhem as in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. It is a charged space in which characters connect with nature, find release, and where tyrants such as Duke Frederick and Oliver (Jake Neads) recover their humanity. Those latter transformations remain unconvincing, but the idea offers an optimist fantasy and way out of our current state of real-world darkness.Part of a Fiennes season of productions, the actors bring their own star quality and a truthfulness to their performances, especially Obianyo and James. The central intimate relationship here is in fact between Celia and Rosalind, who have a sizzlingly sisterly chemistry. The latter’s romance with Orlando (Rowe is sweet and earnest) pales in comparison, the romance filling in for the comedy here, barely believed. This stalls the tone of the play somewhat, but not fatally. Dylan Moran’s Touchstone is another weak link, undercharged and perhaps eclipsed by the quality of actors around him.View image in fullscreenSweet and earnest … Charlie Rowe as Orlando.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe gender-bending does not always seem loaded enough either, although Rosalind carries on wearing the trousers – is it Ganymede that Orlando has fallen for by the end? – and the epilogue is an assertion of Shakespeare’s most female-led play.There is exquisite stagecraft in the production’s minimalism, generally. Bob Crowley’s set of diaphanous curtains runs the risk of looking bare but is filled by layers of light (by Peter Mumford) and projections of flora (by Roland Horvath) which mark the passing of time and changes of mood.Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in the programme, calls this “an early attempt at a musical” and music is certainly a highlight here: songs by Ilan Eshkeri and Tim Wheeler have a pure-voiced folksy sound, with characters singing over guitar solos, including Rosalind in an early scene.It does feel static at times, and the pace slows too much towards the end, but these are teething problems for a directorial hand that shows great thought and skill. I wonder what Fiennes could do with a Shakespearean tragedy on stage.AtTheatre Royal Bathuntil 6 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTheatre Royal BathWilliam ShakespeareAs You Like ItRalph FiennesHarriet WalterDylan MoranreviewsShareReuse this content"

You might do worse than Anna Clyne’s The Years, a subtle meditation on the mystery of time set to words by Stephanie Fleischmann. Composed during the pandemic, its approachable mood of calm isolation survives a series of angsty intrusions to convey a message of quiet hopefulness. Like the Beethoven, it reaches a triumphant conclusion, though in Clyne’s case the victory is an eminently peaceful one.The Danish National Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Fabio Luisi gave it a relaxed and sensitive reading, warm string tones cocooning vocal lines that rose and fell, rendered with impressive clarity by the Danish National Concert Choir. The musical language, faintly reminiscent of Tippett or Barber, was built on simple melodies that blossomed into tangy harmonic clusters. Oscillating voices, stalked by harsh orchestral interjections like wailing sirens, gave way to an expansive sunset glimpsed through a haze of strings and a tranquil, timeless conclusion.Less successful somehow was Bent Sørensen’s Evening Land, a 13-minute musical portrait that contrasted a pastoral childhood memory from the composer’s native Zealand in Denmark with the sensation 50 years later of standing on a balcony overlooking the bustle of Manhattan. The former was represented by wispy, folkish violin and oozy strings, the latter by restless syncopations and grating sand blocks, but the overall conceit was flimsy, and – a pensive oboe melody aside – there was little here that really stayed with you.There was plenty to admire in the Beethoven, not least the incisiveness of the 70 Danish singers who frequently sounded like a choir twice the size. The orchestra, too, was impressive, responding perceptively to the energetic Luisi who, conducting from memory, shaped the music with admirably clear intentions. The problem lay in the often hectic speeds, perhaps ill-considered for an auditorium as resonant as theRoyal Albert Hall.The opening movement was punchy and thoroughly organic, but instrumental details in the scherzo were sometimes smudgy and the adagio felt occasionally perfunctory. It was left to the choir and a fine lineup of soloists to stir the emotions and steer the work to its irrepressible rousing conclusion.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

His second album as Nourished By Time might be darker and more dystopian than hiscritically acclaimed debut, but at its core remains a bloody, beating heart. Absorbing and cinematic, The Passionate Ones expands Brown’s unique vision for post-R&B: his aching, tremulous, earthy vocals swim under rolling Baltimore club breakbeats, flickering synths, gated reverb and uncanny looping samples. And all the while, he makes a plea for big feelings in the face of a numbing world.View image in fullscreenNourished By Time: The Passionate OnesBlaring as if from a busted speaker, opening track Automatic Love transforms boyband-y platitudes – “my body won’t feel nothing until my skin touches you” – into lyrics with real jeopardy, sharpened by the threat of looming societal collapse.Max Potential, a big 80s synth-rock number, co-opts corporate language to marvel at the pain of heartbreak, treating it as a fluorescent sign of life. Often Brown sings with such wide-mouthed, full-hearted commitment that he could be laughing or crying, but singleBaby Babyis witty and aloof, with casual talk-singing and a surfy guitar line as he calls for a global strike to “make the gravy train stop”.A tongue-in-cheek interlude wonders aloud if The Passionate Ones could be a cult – one dedicated to intensity, drive, even optimism, over any ideology. To hook you in, it’s followed by9 2 5, a spirit-soaring song of the summer contender about artistic dreams v greasy day job monotony. Real passion is precious, Brown urges, shaking you by the shoulders, hoping you’ll see the light.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockR&Balbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

In the comet-trail of Stardew Valley, a genre is now fat with titles wherein a protagonist restarts their life and career in a bucolic, quasi-rural landscape and undertakes a blue-collar job. They get to know the local people, interfere in some lives, solve some community issues – maybe even a mystery or two. Maybe even get married. In a way, they are all Harvest Moon’s pixelated offspring – but Discounty, Crinkle Cut Games’ new offering to the genre, tackles the cozy shop life simulator a little differently.In Discounty, you are taken in by your tricky, cantankerous aunt and are put to work in her branch of a franchised supermarket. A fascinating approach, given that the road less taken through Stardew Valley involves prioritising the growth of a local supermarket rather than a community centre. Discounty is a game about business and injecting the economy of a small town. For a cozy game, there are elements of it that are very sharp indeed.View image in fullscreenSharp elements … Discounty.Photograph: Crinkle Cut GamesThe supermarket-building aspect of the game is satisfying. You purchase stock, lay it out on the shop floor, open up and let the customers buy their groceries. The till system initially operates like a tricky little basic maths puzzle, though this evolves in an interesting manner later on. Speed is paramount: don’t let the customers get grumpy, make sure the shelves are stocked, the floor is clean, things are ticking over. It’s very work-heavy, very intense – then the shop closes, you exhale, mop up the shop floor and trundle home to the funny little trailer you live in outside your aunt’s big, lush home. Aunt Tellar is a fascinating businesswoman, full of ambition – a rare, non-benevolent mentor figure. She has disagreements with the local people that you have to fix. She does, in fact, fire someone so you can come on board and take their job. This gradient of tone is really refreshing: the game isn’t clean and cutesy. It’s about operating a supermarket, not running away to a magical farm.The graphics are also a little deceptive: while you might be initially tricked into thinking the game is very pure and sweet by the pixel art, the town you move into is ragged. There is a bleak docklands. Many shop-fronts are shuttered, posters rot on the walls. These details are fantastic – reminiscent at times of Eastward. The music, too, is worth a note: ambient and pleasing. The details of this work aren’t skipped over in favour of curating a twee, relaxing vibe.Conferring with the local people does involve some solving of local issues, but also brokering supplier deals. Sometimes this requires a little massaging on your part, due to your aunt’s tricky nature. It’s high responsibility, high focus. Occasionally, the controls are a little fiddly: I found the touch-screen option on the Steam Deck a little unfocused. The initial stages of the game where you are setting up your stock and don’t have a huge amount of options are a little stressful, especially if you find the sight of basic sums on a calculator to be hard work. However, the resistance isn’t too high: I’m impressed by the way in which the challenge softens, while the intensity of each day at work notches up.Discounty is a valuable addition to the sorority of cozy, slice of life with a dream-job games. It goes a little against the grain, while still managing to hold your focus. While there is not a lot of romance in running away from your life to work in a supermarket, there is certainly a lot of good clean work to do, which still manages to feel like play.Discounty is out now onPC, PS5, Switch and Xbox, £14Explore more on these topicsGamesPCIndie gamesXbox series S/XNintendo SwitchPlayStation 5reviewsShareReuse this content"

Enjoy the view of Murrayfield with Edinburgh Zoo on the hill to the north. Soon you’ll see the Forth Bridge girders loom at Dalmeny before you fly over the Forth. Take in the stunning view east towards the Bass Rock, and look west past bridges towards Stirling and the Grampian mountains beyond. The ancient capital of Dunfermline is next, as you enter Fife. To the north of Cardenden you will see the peaks of theLomond Hills regional park. An alternative route is to change at Inverkeithing on return and take a train up the Fife coast to Kirkcaldy, from where it’s a 50-minute ride back to Edinburgh. An unforgettable railway foray and respite from touristy Edinburgh.Nigel ArchdaleTaking it slowly from Stockport to AndalucíaView image in fullscreen‘The best sunset and sunrise’ in Cádiz, Spain.Photograph: Dmytro Kosmenko/Getty ImagesWe travelled from our home station of Stockport to Cádiz in southern Spain, stopping at London, Paris, Lyon, Barcelona and Seville en route. Not only was this a climate-conscious decision, but also a way to see more of Europe and to help us to relax and slow down. We took a river cruise in Paris, then the next day enjoyed lunch in Lyon where the local market place gave us a taste of the city. We next sped off to Barcelona, staying in the trendy neighbourhood of El Poblenou. From there we took in a panoramic view of the city from the castle of Montjuïc, followed by the bustling beach. Back on the train, our pace slowed again as we set out for Seville with its sweltering beauty and incredible history. Our final stop was Cádiz, where we saw the best sunset and sunrise. We wouldn’t be able to afford first class on a plane, but we could by rail. For example, Barcelona to Seville was under £60! We sipped wine as the beautiful landscape passed by, in a comfortable seat, with wifi and charging facilities, knowing there would be no wait for luggage at the other end.RebeccaRome to Sicily via train and ferryView image in fullscreenLet the ferry take the strain … the train and its passengers are transported by boat to SicilyPhotograph: Francesco Bloisi/Tutto TrenoHop on the sleeper train in Rome, or perhaps Naples, and wake the next morning in Sicily.

Their income from growing and selling native Australian flora and proteas was not enough to support their growing family.

There are a handful of other farmers and business owners who run Highland cow encounters in Australia, including The Farm at nearby Clarendon.The animal-loving pair were drawn to Highlands for grazing because the breed isn’t used for milk or meat – though the cows’ endearing faces helped, too. “I wanted a cow breed that you didn’t have to kill,” Cearns says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Raised on his family’s sheep farm in Mount Compass, he says he “never liked the killing”. Highlands, the pair say, are more like giant pets. Their charismatic herd now numbers nine, each “with their own personalities”: Mabel, Millie, Matilda, Ruby, Mia, Max, Menzi and Banks, aged between seven months and four-and-a-half years.At the start of the tour, the females come galumphing out – some faster than others (easy does it for the old girls). Merritt throws out a fresh batch of hay, giving them a chance to settle before we approach. Their presence feels big, not only in size but in an intangible, humbling energy that surrounds us as we slowly build confidence in patting, brushing and even cuddling the warm-bodied beauties.View image in fullscreenTwo Highlands bound across a field.Photograph: Carrie Jones/The GuardianView image in fullscreen‘It’s satisfying getting their knots out, too,’ says Standing.Composite: Carrie Jones/The GuardianSmiles and laughter ripple through the group – and the cows bask in the attention. First-time participant Georgia Standing, 22, says pampering the cows made her feel “warm and fuzzy”. “They’re so cute,” she says. “It’s satisfying getting their knots out, too.”Brushing their coats feels grounding, wholesome. The surrounding gums, the fresh air and free-roaming chickens add to the tranquillity, as do the many rows of blooming flowers.The cows are a time waster, Merritt jokes. “In the evening, I’ll come out here and the cows are just laying, and I’ll lay with them,” he says. “You can’t hear any cars. It’s just peaceful.”Explore more on these topicsSouth Australia holidaysAustralian lifestyleAustralia holidaysAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a long drive, with little to look at along the M6/M5, and Phoebe’s trip sounded so charming that I thought perhaps the train would provide us with an alternative. A quick look on a tickets app advises me that for the bargain price of £450 the four of us could travel to Torquay in seven hours and six minutes with four changes (each way), which would probably be an adventure in itself, possibly with fewer charming spots and seafood snacks. I could read an entire Christie novel in that time, however, provided the kids’ electronics stayed charged for long enough.Briony MasonRowston, LincolnshireExplore more on these topicsRail faresDevon holidaysRail transportAgatha ChristieEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidayslettersShareReuse this content"

Fire transforms vegetables in a way that no conventional kitchen can, and that approach has followed me on my travels throughout India, where cooking over coals is embedded in everyday life, from roadside tandoors to beachside grills. The bold, spice-laden food of Goa and Kerala in particular have shaped my cooking, and today’s dishes, both inspired by fire and spice, are veg-forward barbecue dishes with roots in tradition and flavour, only turned way up.Aubergine recheado with Keralan curry and coconut-lime pickleI’ve spent a lot of time in Goa and Kerala, and this is a love letter to both.Recheado, which means “stuffed” in Portuguese, is a fiery Goan masala paste that’s traditionally rubbed into oily fish before frying or grilling, but it’s just as transformative on vegetables (I’ve toned down the chilli a bit, so just dial it up if you want more heat). The sauce borrows from the coconut-based curries of Kerala’s backwaters, all fragrant with curry leaves, sour with kokum and tinged red by Mexican guajillo chillies, which aren’t exactly traditional, but I seem to put them in almost everything these days. Kokum is a sour dried fruit from Goa’s Konkan coast that I always bring back in my suitcase. You can get it in south Asian food shops; failing that, tamarind will also do the job.Prep25 minCook1 hr+Serves412 baby aubergines, washed and split open lengthways (don’t cut all the way through)Olive oil, for drizzlingFlaky sea saltLime pickle(homemade or a good-quality jar), to serveA few toasted coconut flakes, or shards of roasted fresh coconut1 small bunch fresh curry leaves, picked, washed, dried, fried until crisp and drained, to serve (optional)For the spice paste10g dried kashmiri chillies(about 3-4)4 whole cloves3g black peppercorns(about ½ tsp)3g cumin seeds(about ½ tsp)1 small cinnamon stick30g piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped (about 2 tbsp)20g peeled garlic(about 4-5 cloves)20ml olive oil20ml merlot vinegar20g jaggery, or caster sugar12g dried kokumpieces(about 2½ tsp), soaked, or 2 tsp tamarind paste10g smoked paprika(about 2 tsp)4gflaky sea salt(about¾ tsp)2g ground turmeric(about½ tsp)For the curry sauce40g coconut oil4g yellow mustard seeds(about 1¼ tsp)1 small bunch curry leaves(about 10 leaves)2 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced (60g net)20g piece peeled ginger, sliced10g peeled garlic(about 2 cloves), chopped50g fresh green unripe mango, peeled and chopped50g grated fresh coconut, or frozen grated coconut12g dried guajillo chillies(1-2 chillies), rehydrated in cold water, drained and deseeded5g ground turmeric(about 1 tsp)5g kashmiri chilli powder(about 1 tsp)5g dried kokum pieces(about 1 tsp), soaked and not drained, or 1 tsp tamarind paste400mltinned coconut milkFlaky sea salt, to tasteFirst make the paste. Toast the dried chillies, cloves, peppercorns, cumin seeds and cinnamon in a small dry frying pan on a medium heat, turning often, until fragrant, then tip into a mortar or spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Tip into a blender, add all the remaining paste ingredients and blitz to make a thick masala.Now make the curry sauce. Melt the coconut oil in a wide pan, then fry the mustard seeds and curry leaves until they pop. Add the shallots, ginger and garlic, and saute, stirring often, until soft and lightly golden. Stir in the mango, grated coconut, chilli, turmeric, chilli powder and kokum, cook for a few minutes, then pour in the coconut milk and 200ml water, and simmer for 15–20 minutes. Blend until silky-smooth and the consistency of passata (if need be, add up to 100ml more water to loosen), then season with salt to taste and keep warm.Gently prise open each aubergine, stuff them all evenly with the masala paste, then coat the outsides, too. (If you like, you can do this ahead of time, and even the day before.)When you’re ready to cook, get the barbecue going, ready to cook over both direct and indirect heat (to cook indoors, turn on the grill to medium-high). Drizzle the aubergines with oil and season with a pinch of salt, then grill cut side up over direct heat for five to seven minutes, until lightly charred. Move the aubergines to indirect heat (or put them in a cast-iron pan and cover), close the lid of the barbecue and leave to cook for another 10-15 minutes, until soft and just starting to collapse.To serve, spoon the sauce on to a platter, arrange the aubergines on top and finish with a little lime pickle, crisp fried curry leaves and pieces of roasted coconut, if using.Aslam’s butter cornView image in fullscreenAndrew Clarke’s butter corn is inspired by the butter chicken at Aslam in Old Delhi.Many years ago, while exploring the narrow streets of Old Delhi, I was tipped off about a place calledAslam Chicken, a small, chaotic spot that serves a butter chicken unlike any I’d tasted before. There’s no tomato sauce, just skewers of grilled marinated chicken pulled off the fire and drowned in cream, yoghurt and an obscene amount of melted butter. I’ve reworked that recipe over the years, often swapping the chicken for corn or cauliflower, and it has since become one of our go-to vegetable dishes – indulgent, highly spiced and, if need be, easily adapted for plant-based cooking.Prep25 minMarinate4 hr+Cook20 minServes6 as a side6 corn on the cobs, steamed or boiled until just tender, then cut in half widthwaysMelted ghee, for brushing, plus 4 tbsp extra to finishFlaky sea salt, to taste1 generous pinchchaat masala2 tbsp thick greek yoghurt3 tbsp double cream2–3 fresh mint sprigs,leaves pickedPink onions, to serve (see below and method)1 fresh red chilli, finely sliced (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat), to serveFor the spice blend1 tsp coriander seeds1 tsp cumin seeds2 cloves4 green cardamom pods1 small piece mace1 small cinnamon stick2–4 dried kashmiri chillies, to taste½ tsp black peppercornsFor the marinade2½cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced4 garlic cloves, peeled2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves(AKA kasuri methi)1 tsp chaat masala2 tbsp thick greek yoghurt1–2 tsp salt, to taste1 tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp gheeFor the pink onions (optional)2 red onions, peeled and cut into ½cm-thickslices1 tsp dried hibiscus(optional, for colour)1 bay leaf50gred-wine vinegar, merlot, ideally25g sugarFirst pickle the onions, if making. Put the sliced onions in a heatproof bowl with the hibiscus and bay. Put 100ml water in a saucepan with the vinegar and sugar, bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then pour this over the onions. Leave to cool, then cover and refrigerate. They will now keep for up to a week.Next, make the spice blend. Put all the whole spices in a dry pan, turn on the heat to medium and toast, turning often, until fragrant. Tip into a mortar, food processor or spice grinder, then grind to a fine powder.Put all the marinade ingredients in a blender, add the spice powder and blitz to a smooth paste. Rub this mix all over the corn and leave to marinate for at least four hours, and preferably overnight.When you’re ready to cook, get the barbecue going, ready to cook over direct heat (if cooking indoors, turn on the grill to medium-high). Grill the corn, turning them regularly and brushing with ghee, for five to seven minutes, until lightly charred all over.Transfer the cooked corn to a large bowl, add a big pinch of chaat masala, the yoghurt, cream and melted ghee, toss to coat evenly, then serve topped with the torn mint, pink onions and fresh chilli.Andrew Clarke is chef/founder ofAcme Fire Cult, London E8Explore more on these topicsFoodVegetablesMain courseSide dishesBarbecueSummer food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Tapped twice daily by toddy tappers, who expertly scale the palm trees, fermentation occurs naturally in handmade ceramic pots, before the arrack is distilled and lightly aged in native wood. It can be enjoyed in a variety of classic cocktails, including in a spritz or an ice-cold martini, as well as today’s frozen mule, which, with its revitalising kick of ginger and lime, is a great pick-me-up for a hot day.Frozen arrack muleServes150ml arrack– we useCeylon Arrack20ml fresh lime juice25ml ginger beer syrup– mix 1:1 ginger beer to sugar and stir to dissolve (once made, it’ll keep in the fridge for up to a week)1 thumb-sized piecefresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped1 dashAngostura bitters1 star anise, to garnishPut everything bar the star anise in a high-speed blender, add a big handful of ice (crushed, ideally) and blitz smooth.

It’s a black coffee gently spiced with cinnamon and cloves, and sweetened with piloncillo (an unrefined sugar). Here, I’ve turned it into something refreshing for summer, using dark brown sugar instead, not least because it’s easier to find. I can never resist a post-dinner coffee, and this scratches both that caffeine and sugar itch.Spiced coffee granita with whipped creamPrep5 minCook15 min, plus coolingFreeze2 hr 30 min+Serves4500ml freshly brewed coffee, or espresso1 stick cinnamon3 cloves75g dark brown sugar120ml double creamPinch of flaky sea saltPour the coffee into a small pan, add the cinnamon, cloves and sugar and heat gently until it comes to a simmer. Leave to simmer for five minutes, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture starts smelling fragrant. Take off the heat, leave to cool completely, then strain into a shallow, freezer-friendly container.Freeze the mixture for an hour, then mix it with a fork and return to the freezer for 20-30 minutes. Mix again to break up the ice crystals, then repeat this process two to three times more, until you have lots of crystals.Lightly whip the double cream with a pinch of flaky salt. To serve, spoon the granita into small glasses and top each one with a dollop of cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotDessertCoffeeVegetarian food and drinkIce-cream and sorbetrecipesShareReuse this content"
