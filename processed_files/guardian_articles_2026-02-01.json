It’s a stressful, heartwarming, shocking watch – which raises big questions about the UKLucy ManganSun 1 Feb 2026 17.05 ESTShareThis, then, is whatAlan Carrdid next. Fresh from his victory as the last traitor standing in The Celebrity Traitors, and elevation to national treasure status, the Chatty Man is co-presenting Secret Genius with Countdown’s dictionary-botherer, the lexicographer and author Susie Dent. On second thoughts, given the lead times for these things, this is probably better billed as “What Alan Carr was contracted to do next” but no matter. We are here to have fun and fun we shall! Though, this being a reality-competition show in which people take part in regional heats to find out who among them is “one of the estimated million undiscovered geniuses” in the UK (no definition of the term given – Dent, you had ONE JOB), it comes with a buffet of sob stories, a side order of stress and a hefty dollop of whatever the word is for that patented mix of schadenfreude and voyeurism on which the genre depends.We begin with a dozen participants drawn from north-west England and Northern Ireland. They have either nominated themselves or – more often – been nominated by friends and family who know them as the cleverclogses of their circles. All will compete in the first round: eight will reach the second.What’s the first round? Well might you ask. The contestants are presented with a wall of letters. It contains all those needed to spell the months of the year – except one. What is the letter, my friends, and from which month is it? Some go straight to working out in their heads which are the most uncommon letters and checking them against the panoply on offer. Others start rearranging the letters to spell out all 12 words. In one notable case, the letters are taken down to be held like a hand of cards except that the pertinent information on them cannot be seen.Then there is a board with numbers to be arranged on it so that predetermined totals for each row are met. Some are very good at this. Some are not. And then there’s Nathan. We shall draw a veil. He does very well at other things. Not least – oh, my heart – warmly bolstering the self-esteem of his very shy partner Jo in the next round and fully and rightly crediting her with their joint success.It’s more than enough to ensure instant addiction … and provide a window into the soul of the nationThere are only three rounds, comprising Mensa-produced puzzles designed to test a host of the skills that make up an IQ score (you can argue animatedly among yourselves about what kind of measure this is of human intelligence – this is not that show). But it’s more than enough to produce all the necessary responses to ensure instant addiction: stress, disbelief, immediate devout allegiance to your favourite contestant and to provide a window into the soul of the nation.He deserves to go down in history! How Alan Carr pulled off that gobsmacking Celebrity Traitors victoryRead moreThis time the window frames the stark truth that the UK remains an arse-backwards, classbound, privilege-riven hellhole. Just about everyone taking part has a history of being ignored, dismissed, passed over or, as 59-year-old former nurse Justin succinctly puts it, “labelled thick” in school, mostly because – and you barely have to read between the lines – they weren’t middle class. Ollie had every car registration plate on her estate effortlessly memorised as a child, and cruises through every round unless crippled by nerves. She is taking part out of “morbid curiosity. Am I dim-witted and just good at remembering stuff?” (This includes, by the way, every detail of the patients she treats as an ambulance crew member.)What a lack of class privilege didn’t take care of, bullies did. Some contestants allude to their experiences, all nod in recognition. God, kids are vile. Then there’s the male/female split. Sports management consultant Jo, who nearly loses a round against the clock because she cannot believe she got an answer correct and takes herself back for a second go, contrasts her attitude to her capabilities with that of her ambitious, extrovert brother and puts at least part of it down to the natural/nurtured differences between their sexes. She thinks she might need to stop shying away from her abilities. At home, the nation roars its approval.All of human life is here. And Alan Carr. And Susie Dent. Secret Genius is all good fun and games so long as you ignore all the things it’s measuring that Mensa could never imagine.Secret Genius is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAlan CarrGame showsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A psychotherapist shares her guiding principles for raising grownupsJulia SamuelSun 1 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTShareWhen one of my daughters turned 18, our relationship hit a crisis so painful it lasted longer than I knew how to bear. I was a psychotherapist, trained in child and adult development, yet I was utterly flummoxed. Decades have passed since then, but when I recently spoke to her about that time, a flood of distress washed through me as if it were yesterday.This is how my daughter, now a mother herself, put it when I asked her to describe that era:“I was furious and desperate and lonely. I fought with you and Dad in a way no one in the family had ever fought with you before. I remember screaming at you while out on a walk, as you desperately implored me to be quiet because people could hear. I wanted them to hear. I wanted to smash this image of us as a happy family to pieces – and I was incredibly successful in doing that.”I remembered I had looked at other families and wondered what they had got right that I had got so wrong. I didn’t know how to navigate the relationship now that she was technically an adult but to me still so young and vulnerable. I was frightened for her, angry with her (an emotion I didn’t want to feel) and furious with myself. Beneath it all lay the shame: I had failed her and our family.The shift from anxious manager to respectful witness is a hard task of parenting adult childrenQuestions upended me. Why didn’t I see this coming? What did I do wrong? How could I fix it? I searched for guidance and found almost nothing. There was virtually no information that helped me make sense of this new terrain. I wish I’d known what recentneuroscience research from Cambridge Universitysuggests: that the brain’s adolescent phase extends until the grand old age of 32. These findings,published in Nature Communications, challenge traditional assumptions that maturation ends at 18 or 25, and highlight why this extended period of not-quite-adulthood represents both vulnerability and opportunity for our children.Parenting does not stop when our children turn 18; it simply changes shape. Yet parenting adult children remains one of the least discussed and least understood aspects of family life.With time and therapy, my daughter and I survived those fights and rebuilt a close relationship. I am profoundly grateful for that. In hindsight, the breakdown became abreakthrough: a necessary reconfiguration of our family system. It reset boundaries, opened more honest communication and taught us to fight productively. That sounds like a happy ending, but the process was chaotic and raw. Here are some of the guiding principles for building good relationships with your adult children.In previous generations, adulthood meant cutting ties at 18: you left home, got a job, married young, and rarely looked back. Today, it’s different. Many parents look at their adult children and wonder what has gone wrong. Compared with what they did at that age, their children’s slower path to independence can be seen as arrested development.Psychologist Jeffrey Arnett coined the term “emerging adulthood” for the years between 18 and 25, a phase of exploration and uncertainty when young people are “in between” adolescence and adulthood. It is a time to test, experience and discover who they are. This is not evidence of moral decline but a developmental shift that reflects a radically different world. Technology, the women’s movement and social change have transformed what it means to grow up.​The statistics tell the story starkly: about a third of young adults aged 18 to 34now live with their parents.Nearly 60% of parents financially support an adult child. As difficult as that might be, it is a required adaptation to a profoundly altered economic and social reality. Parents rarely talk about how drained they feel, or how to navigate it coherently.I think of Sarah, a client in her mid‑50s, who came to therapy feeling utterly depleted. Three years earlier, her son Tom, 26, had moved back home after university. What began as a temporary arrangement “just until he finds his feet” had calcified into something neither could name. Tom worked part-time in a coffee shop, spent evenings gaming, contributed nothing to household costs and bristled at any suggestion he might do otherwise.Sarah felt trapped between love and resentment. She cooked his meals, did his washing, tiptoed around his moods. She suffered in her marriage; her husband came home late to avoid the tension. Sarah couldn’t understand why Tom seemed so stuck when she’d given him everything. “I’ve failed him,” she said, weepily. “He can’t cope with adult life.”Some parents struggle more with letting go, others with being needed; both require clear, loving boundariesBut as we worked together, a different picture emerged. Sarah’s own mother had been cold and critical. Sarah had vowed to be different: warmer, more available. Yet she had overcompensated, protected Tom from struggle. She solved his problems and rescued him from consequences. Now, at 26, Tom had no confidence in his own capabilities because he’d never had to develop them. And Sarah, exhausted from years of hypervigilance, felt angry at the very person she had tried so hard to protect.The breakthrough came when Sarah began to see that her anxiety, not Tom’s actual need, drove her behaviour. We worked on what she was truly frightened of: that if she didn’t manage his life, something terrible would happen. Beneath that lay an older fear: that she wasn’t good enough, that love would disappear.Sarah started small. She stopped doing Tom’s laundry. She told him, calmly, that he needed to contribute monthly to household costs. She resisted the urge to rescue when he complained or sulked. It was agony. Tom was furious. He accused her of not caring, of suddenly changing the rules.But, gradually, they adapted. He picked up more shifts. He began, tentatively, to talk about moving out. The atmosphere at home lightened. Sarah’s husband started coming home earlier. And, in one session, Sarah told me, “Last week, Tom thanked me for dinner. It was the first time in three years he’d noticed I’d cooked. I realised I’d been so busy giving, I’d never let him give back.”Research confirms what Sarah discovered: when adult children return home, parents’ quality of life and wellbeing often decline significantly, regardless of why the child returned. Yet we don’t openly admit this, for it feels like a betrayal. The silence keeps everyone trapped.What changed for Sarah and Tom wasn’t that she loved him less – it was that she loved him differently. She started to trust him to navigate his life. That shift, from anxious manager to respectful witness, is a hard task of parenting adult children.The same dynamic plays out around money, career choices and relationships. Parents see their children struggle and rush in to fix, advise or rescue. It comes from love, but it often backfires. Studies show that excessive parental involvement, what researchers call “helicopter parenting”, is associated with disrupted mental health in young adults, lower self-confidence and difficulties with identity development. The very thing we do to help can hinder.This extended closeness can be loving and necessary, but also fraught. Parents may feel resentful; children may feel infantilised. The key is clarity, not control. Have explicit conversations about money, chores, privacy and expectations. Boundaries matter. It is the unspoken assumptions – those old, inherited patterns – that most often lead to conflict.Young adults themselves identify aspects that support their return home: clear expectations discussed openly; meaningful contributions to the household; being treated as adults rather than teenagers; and an exit plan with timelines. Examples of this include them managing their own relationships. They have privacy around their phone, their finances and their social life.Sometimes it is the parent, not the child, who has not matured. Adult children with immature or narcissistic parents often end up as caretakersThe tension isn’t about whether your 28-year-old lives at home. It’s about whether the relationship has evolved to match their developmental stage, or whether everyone repeats the patterns from when they were a teenager.This change is a tough gig. For years, our role was to protect and guide; to keep our children alive and help them grow. Then the task changes: to step back and let them make their own choices and mistakes. That transition can feel bewildering; for, at some level, they remain the tiny baby inside us. It takes deep psychological work to love the child we have, not the one we imagined or would choose; to listen fully, respect their autonomy and offer wisdom only when asked. As Anna Freud said, “A mother’s job is to be there to be left.”Good-enough parenting of adult children requires a delicate balance: not to abandon, or to over-parent; not always in the parent role, but sharing more; to stay connected without becoming dependent. The real work is to let go of control without letting go of connection.There is a parenting model calledCircle of Securitythat is designed to enhance caregiver-child relationships by helping adults understand and meet children’s emotional needs in early childhood. It applies here, too. You want to be the arms your adult children can come into, but also the support that helps them move out into independence. Some parents struggle more with letting go, others with being needed; both require clear, loving boundaries.What about the change as your child finds loving relationships? As parents watch their adult children date and have fun, it can stir up envy for their youth – the freshness of their bodies, the life that still stretches ahead – even as they feel pride and love. Acknowledging these emotions, rather than burying the shame, keeps us authentic and generous. The more we accept the reality of our own age and limits, the freer our children are to live fully.Remember that every generation reacts against the one before itView image in fullscreenJulia Samuel with her daughters.Photograph: Vincent Evans/courtesy of Julia SamuelOther difficulties can also arise in the shifting roles of parent and child. Unprocessed trauma from one generation can be passed to the next. When pain is buried rather than faced, it transmits through behaviour, emotional response and even epigenetically into our very beings. Unprocessed trauma makes us more reactive: parents may become unpredictable or unreliable, leaving children anxious or hypervigilant. These patterns echo across decades until someone is prepared to feel the pain and begin to heal it. Where trauma or neglect has shaped a family, estrangement between generations becomes more likely – not because love is absent, but because it has felt too painful to express safely. It is helpful for parents to recognise the trauma they carry from their past, and aim to process it not only for themselves but for the whole family system.Sometimes it is the parent, not the child, who has not matured. Adult children with immature or narcissistic parents often end up as caretakers, who try, and usually fail, to manage or placate the very people meant to protect them. The task here – in this case for the children rather than the parents – is different but equally vital: to set limits without guilt, to see the parents’ limitations clearly, and to stop trying to earn love that was conditional or inconsistent. Love may still be possible, but only from a safe emotional distance. Boundaries become the form that love must take.Another challenge arises when worldviews diverge – politics, religion, gender or lifestyle choices. The pandemic and the culture wars that followed have widened these divides. Parents often ask me in therapy, “How did we raise someone who sees the world so differently from us?” This situation calls for humility. Love does not mean agreement. It means allowing differences. The moment you try to win the argument, you risk the relationship. Curiosity is the antidote: ask rather than tell. Remember that every generation reacts against the one before it.If you can speak honestly, disagree respectfully and laugh together, you have done something remarkableYour influence endures, but not in your opinions. It lives in how you embody love, respect, integrity and kindness. You helped write the relational map that lives inside your children: trust that and trust them.The greatest tensions arise at points of transition: when a child leaves home or returns, when a new partner joins the family, a grandparent dies, or someone loses a job. These moments expose a family’s fault lines but also create opportunities for growth and repair.Even the closest families hit storms. Conflict with adult children can cut deep because it touches identity, not just as a parent, but as someone who tried their best. The temptation is to try to fix it or to withdraw. Better to pause, acknowledge your part, apologise where needed, and listen with empathy. Repair after conflict not only heals but strengthens emotional security and resilience on both sides.For all its complexity, this stage can bring profound rewards. Conversations grow richer; humour deepens. You can enjoy your grown-up children as people in their own right: their quirks, passions and wisdom.Brain has five ‘eras’, scientists say – with adult mode not starting until early 30sRead moreAs one mother told me recently, “It’s like watching your heart walk around outside your body, but now it walks confidently.” That captures the bittersweet beauty of it. If you can speak honestly, disagree respectfully and laugh together, you have done something remarkable. You have turned a bond of dependency into a relationship of mutual respect – one that evolves as you both do.Parenting does not end; it matures. And, like all mature love, it asks for courage: to learn continually, to forgive repeatedly and to show up consistently, not as the all-knowing parent, but as a fellow human being, who still grows, too.For my daughter, feeling listened to helped enormously. “Over time my rage decreased as I felt heard enough,” she says now. “Part of the developmental task of separating was proving wrong what I’d always feared – that if I showed my true, messy, struggling self, I wouldn’t be lovable. That love was conditional. Eventually, very messily, I learned I was loved as I am.”Families are not static: they are living systems that constantly adapt. The best we can do, as parents, as children, as human beings, is to stay open: to listen, to grow and to love, even when it is hard.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyCohabitationPsychologyYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even if Labour somehow wins this byelection, how does it arrest the slide into hopelessness?Sun 1 Feb 2026 10.24 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareThe route of the No 201 bus begins in the regenerated wonderland of central Manchester, and follows a straight line through the neighbourhoods to its east. The city’s box-fresh skyscrapers and gleaming new hotels quickly recede – and within 10 minutes you arrive in Gorton, at the outer edge of the constituency that, in not much more than three weeks’ time, will seethe byelectionthat could have profound consequences for the future of both the Labour party and British politics.Gorton is hardly a social desert. Millions of pounds arebeing spenton a regeneration scheme that – among its other benefits – will bring the area new housing and a revitalised high street. But in the covered market that is about to be upgraded to a “food and drink cluster”, when I ask people questions about the looming vote, I mostly hear expressions of fierce resentment. In that sense, the story of what is about to happen here may crystallise one of this year’s big political themes: a long-festering sense of disconnection and fury reaching a new extreme, thanks to a government that seems strangely powerless to even begin to tackle it.There are a few mentions of theawful WhatsApp messagesthat sealed the fate of the former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, but people talk most animatedly about grimly familiar subjects: grooming gangs, small boats, sky-high private rents and the impossible cost of living. “My mum’s got stage four terminal cancer and she can’t afford to put her heating on,” one woman tells me, with a bracing anger. And every 10 minutes, I hear some or other version of that dependable modern mantra: “I really don’t like Keir Starmer.” Beyond one man’s claim that “he hasn’t done what he said he’d do”, no one can specify exactly why, but that seems to fire people’s loathing all the more: on this evidence, his most damaging shortcoming remains that glaring failure to define who he is.Matt Goodwin is the most extreme Reform candidate yet. How Labour and the Greens react will define them | Zoe WilliamsRead moreTwenty minutes further along the same bus route, I spend the following morning in Denton, a part of the seat where voters are reckoned to be83% white and 86% UK-born, and the hills on the edge of the Peak District are suddenly within sight. Coming here entails crossing from the City of Manchester into the borough of Tameside, and the town feels distinctly “red wall”-ish: a corner of theold Lancashire coalfieldwhere old family businesses are apparently clinging on by their fingernails, and local hopes of an economic uplift are focused onanother new food hall, which will open in a matter of weeks.Mary is in her early-30s, works full-time in retail and still lives in Denton with her parents, something she describes with a biting frustration. Her friend Lexi, a mother of two, holds down three different jobs – as a care support worker, a dinner lady and a cleaner – and says she is just about holding everything together.But what they most want to talk about is immigration. When I say that without people from abroad, some of our most basic services would fall apart, they both agree: “They’re absolutely fine. It’s the people on the streets, and the ones coming in on boats.” They share a somewhat strange belief that the middle of Manchester is now so dangerous that visiting is unthinkable. Both of them say appreciative things aboutNigel Farageand his party, but insist they haven’t yet decided who to vote for. One thing, though, is clear. “It won’t be Labour,” says Lexi.Here, it seems, is a ready market for Reform UK’s blithe pledges (“Stop illegal immigration”, “Put the British people first”, “End lawlessness on our streets”), frontedthis time by Matt Goodwin, the one-time academic analyst of the new right who has become one of its prime movers. But for Labour, Reform’s menacing presence is only half this byelection’s headache. Its other worries centre on an area of the seat that runs southwards towards Stockport, and includes Levenshulme and Longsight – home to a mixture of Muslim voters who may move from Labour to support a pro-Gaza candidate, and sizeable numbers of students and young professionals being frantically targeted by the resurgent Green party.Both halves of the constituency highlight the painful vacuum left by Starmer and his allies’ decision to bar Andy Burnham from standing.Whatever riskscame with the prospect of Burnham resigning as Greater Manchester mayor, had he been the candidate, the party’s campaign might have centred on his personal record, hisdiagnosis of the modern British mess– “deindustrialisation, privatisation, austerity and Brexit” – and a contrasting sense of optimism. Instead, stranded without a narrative, Labour can only defend its pretty disastrous handling of its first 19 months in power, and a leader and prime minister no one likes.In Levenshulme, I meet Max, a loquacious 27-year-old who spends his spare time volunteering for asylum and refugee charities. Starmer, he says, “needs to kind of self-reflect: ‘What do I believe? What do I want?’” He mentions Farage. “He seems to have a vision. Starmer doesn’t. And you can’t combat Reform if you haven’t got that. They’ve got better stories … I think they’re toxic stories, but they’re better at telling them.” He then brightens. “But the Greens have got a good story as well.”Five minutes’ drive away is Longsight. After Friday prayers at a compact mosque tucked behind a residential street, the mostly middle-aged men I talk to express bafflement about the fact that Burnham was barred from standing, and worry about what a Reform victory – which could result from the left vote being split – would mean for their everyday lives. When I hold up one of the party’s leaflets, one reaction is instant and unsettling: “It upsets me. It’s not healthy. It’s dividing us.”Labour may hold on here: as ever, it has a formidable get-out-the-vote machine, and droves of activists. As evidenced by Starmer’srather stilted claimthat the contest is reducible to “true patriotism against the plastic patriotism of Reform”, the party may yet manage what eluded it at last year’s byelection in theWelsh seat of Caerphilly, and successfully position itself as the best tactical choice to defeat Farage and Goodwin. But what even a Labour win will barely shift is what runs deep, here and all over the county: anger, disconnection and bewilderment with a party and government that are now floundering and disoriented.This is what really ought to be eating away at Labour’s high-ups. So far, every relaunch andU-turnhas either left those aspects of the public mood untouched, or raised them to a new pitch. After the Gorton and Denton byelection, their next expression will surely define May’s elections in Wales and Scotland, and the council elections across England the partyhasn’t managed to postpone. As I wandered around Longsight’s open-air market, I found a Green party leaflet, featuring one of its best campaign lines, seemingly written as a knowing challenge to Starmer and his people: “Make hope normal again.” Is that something Labour can do? And if it can’t, how can it possibly hope to arrest its decline?John Harris is a Guardian columnistJohn Harris and John Domokos’s Anywhere but Westminster film about the Gorton and Denton byelection will appear later this weekExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionManchesterByelectionsReform UKGreater ManchesterLocal politicsNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

He then lowered his fists, extended his thumbs and little fingers, and moved them up and down by his chest, as though milking a cow. Finally, he laid the fingers of one hand flat on his chin and flexed his wrist forward.Hartwell, who has no hearing problems, had just used BSL, British SignLanguage, to order his morning latte with normal milk at the deaf-run Dialogue Cafe, based at the University of East London, and thanked Victor Olaniyan, the deaf barista.“I have to be honest: when this cafe first opened near my office, I avoided it because the whole idea made me anxious,” said Hartwell, a lecturer at the university. “But now I’m fascinated. Sign language is amazing. I’m thinking of taking a course so I can learn more.”What gave Hartwell the confidence to try BSL was the cafe’s touchscreen menu. Instead of just listing the coffees and cakes on sale, the menus show videos of their BSL translation.For many deaf BSL users, this kind of direct access is crucial. BSL is a first language for tens of thousands of people in the UK.Olaniyan, who has worked at the cafe for five years and now does shifts alongside a degree in accounting and management at the University of Reading, seemed mildly amused by the reactions of hearing people to the video menu.“I was brought up by hearing people, so I have no problem in the hearing world,” he signed. “But hearing people often feel anxious communicating with us. If this technology helps them, that’s great, but I’m fine as I am.”View image in fullscreenWesley Hartwell ordering a drink at the cafe.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIn the past two years, there has been an explosion of digital and AI-linked products aiming to bridge communication barriers between the deaf and hearing worlds, from signing avatars to large generative models that aspire to rival mainstream AI platforms.Independent evaluations of many of these systems remain limited, however, and sign language researchers caution that current tools still struggle with linguistic nuance, regional variation and context, particularly in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and law.But the ambitions are striking: the UK startup Silence Speaks has built an avatar-based system that converts text into BSL, claiming it can convey contextual meaning and emotional cues.The British project SignGPT, backed by £8.45m in funding, is developing models to translate between BSL and English in both directions, while also building what it describes as the largest sign languages dataset in the world.Sign languages AI research has also become increasingly collaborative and international: a new £3.5m UK-Japan research project is developing systems trained on natural deaf-to-deaf conversation data rather than interpreter recordings.Much of this recent progress has come quickly. When Prof Bencie Woll, a co-investigator of the SignGPT project at University College London’s Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, first entered the field of BSL research, communication beyond face-to-face interaction was extremely limited for deaf people.“The rest of the world was moving ahead with technology, but deaf people were often left behind,” she said. “What’s different now is the pace. In the last couple of years, the deaf community has benefited from an explosively powerful mix of possibilities.”Historically, technology has not always been positive, Woll cautioned. “There has often been a fantasy, particularly among researchers who don’t understand sign languages, that it is a quick fix. That you take a sign language, turn it into written English – and you’ve made deaf people’s lives wonderful,” she said.View image in fullscreenVictor Olaniyan works shifts at the cafe alongside his degree in accounting and management.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThat assumption led to what Woll described as “really terrible technology”, including wearable translation suits, bulky gloves and head-mounted cameras designed to process signing.“All of these were doomed to failure,” she said, “because they were designed by people who did not understand sign languages and did not ask deaf people what they wanted, let alone work alongside deaf experts from the start. The community has been frustrated for years by the proliferation of bad solutions.”Yet the need for solutions is real. About 70 million people worldwide are deaf or hard of hearing. In the UK, census data records about 151,000 BSL users. For roughly 25,000 of them, BSL is their primary language. It is a distinct, natural language with its own grammar and structure, not a signed version of English.For this group, written and spoken English is often a second – or even a third language, following lip-reading, Sign Supported English or family-invented gestures.This has practical consequences: subtitles and written text are not always adequate substitutes for direct BSL access. A large 2017 study of deaf children aged 10 to 11 found that reading ability was significantly below expected age levels for 48% of deaf children educated using spoken language only, and for 82% of those whose everyday language was a sign language.Dr Lauren Ward has the unusual role of leading on AI technology for the deaf community at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), advising government and industry.“The pace of change has been so fast that RNID has made the unusual decision to employ engineers,” she said. “The potential to help the deaf community is huge – but so is the potential to cause harm.”Deaf people have long been early adopters of technology: SMS messaging transformed communication in the 1990s. But Ward said the last two years had brought a new intensity of interest and concern. “It has suddenly moved from university labs into startups and commercial products,” she said.This shift has been enabled by advances in machine learning and related technologies that finally make the processing of large-scale sign languages technically possible.View image in fullscreenHakan Elbir, the founder of Dialogue Hub.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIncreased research funding, improved datasets and greater involvement from deaf researchers have also quickened the pace, as has a wider acknowledgment of the longstanding gap between the access deaf people are legally entitled to and what is delivered in practice: reliable sign languages provision has been promised for decades but has all-too-often failed to materialise.This combination of opportunity and risk makes the current moment a double-edged sword, Ward said.“It is incredibly exciting, and the next five years could bring real improvements,” she said. “But there is a danger that private companies respond by focusing on profit rather than working with the deaf community and being led by them.”Dr Maartje De Meulder, a deaf scholar and consultant on sign languages AI, agreed the stakes were high.“At the moment, deaf people are largely excluded from vast amounts of online information, from educational videos to government websites,” she said. “No one is ever going to have the resources to translate the entire internet into sign languages, so even partial solutions could be transformative.”Neil Fox, a deaf research fellow at the University of Birmingham, agreed that if avatar translation reached sufficient quality, it could open up many online spaces currently closed to deaf users.But all are highly cautious. Rebecca Mansell, the chief executive of the British Deaf Association, said this “has become a very lucrative area and too many projects involve deaf people only tokenistically”.“It is all happening very fast, and there is a real risk that solutions will be imposed on us,” she added.Mansell also raised concerns about regulation and appropriate use. “An avatar might be fine for ordering something simple,” she said, “but what about a cancer diagnosis? In schools, a human interpreter is often the only friend a deaf child has.”Dr Louise Hickman, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy and lead author of the report BSL Is Not For Sale, has worked in AI ethics for a decade.“Many companies claim they can solve these problems without understanding the linguistic and cultural complexity of BSL,” she said. “Current avatar systems still lack the nuance of human interpreters, which creates risks in medical and legal settings.”Hickman also pointed to the limits of available data. “British Sign Language is not the same as Irish Sign Language or American Sign Language. There are regional dialects within England. This means the data available for training AI systems is extremely limited.”So where, she asked, will appropriate training data come from?“The deaf community wants innovation,” she said, “but we want to slow this down so we can shape it and make sure it genuinely benefits us.”Back at the cafe, Hakan Elbir, its founder, saw little need for more complex tools than his static BSL video menu.“People talk a lot about innovation, but for most deaf people it is still theoretical,” he said. “What I wanted was a meaningful daily interaction for hearing people.”“Coffee is just the excuse,” he added. “I didn’t need complicated technology to break down barriers. I just needed people to interact openly.”Waiting for his latte at the counter, Hartwell quietly practised the sign for “flat white”, proving that it was this simple, human interaction – supported but not overshadowed by technology – that was drawing him back, one signed coffee order at a time.Explore more on these topicsDeafness and hearing lossAI (artificial intelligence)LanguageLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But does the fitness craze have any downsides – apart from waking up the neighbours?Abi MillarSun 1 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTShareIf you’re an avid viewer of online fitness content (or live below someone who is) you’re probably familiar with TikTok’s 50 jumps challenge. The basic premise is simple: you jump 50 times as soon as you wake up, for 30 days straight. Reach the end of the month and you’re supposedly in for a world of benefits.The jumps, reassuringly, don’t need to be too extreme. Think gentle bouncing with a soft knee bend, rather than tuck jumps. Some content creators show themselves with arms by their sides, swaying their hips as they go; others have their arms crossed over their chests and maintain a strict up-and-down momentum. Some would find their natural home in a moshpit, others at a dance party. Nobody, yet, seems to have purchased a bedside trampoline.It’s easy to see how this ritual would wake you up (along with, potentially, your downstairs neighbour). But what of the other purported payoffs? Does the 50-jump challenge really boost circulation, increase bone density, improve lymphatic drainage, boost mood and give you a dewy glow, as many online have claimed? And should we all be starting our days this way, as opposed to lumbering sleepily out of bed in search of coffee?Is it actually good for you?Jose Guevara, AKAShredded Dad, a fitness instructor known for his home gym workout videos, says it’s not an entirely unreasonable challenge. “Jumping lightly gets circulation going and warms up connective tissue and muscles that might feel stiff after sleep,” he points out. “While the exact mechanism is uncertain, one reliable outcome is that people report feeling more alert and energised.”As any early morning exerciser can testify, there is nothing like a spot of movement to dispel your grogginess. The beauty of the jumping challenge is its accessibility: you probably have time for 50 jumps, even if you don’t have the time or inclination to squeeze in a pre-dawn CrossFit class.View image in fullscreen‘One reliable outcome is that people report feeling more alert and energised’ … Jose Guevara AKA Shredded Dad.Photograph: Publicity imageAnd if you’re only going to exercise for a minute or so, jumping seems to give you a lot of bang for your buck.Eloise Skinner, a fitness instructor and psychotherapist, says it involves a potent mix of strength, endurance and muscular engagement. “It’s great work for the muscles of the leg; it’s good for core engagement when performed with correct alignment; it’s good for improving joint mobility,” she says. “High-energy movement can also be good for supporting metabolic function.”Performed consistently, the challenge might also lead to improvements in bone health. When we jump, we load the skeleton with an impact force equivalent to around three times our body weight (though that varies a lot depending on the type of jump). This stimulates the osteoblasts (bone cells) to build more bone. “The repeated low-level impacts seem to remind the bones in our legs and hips why they should stay dense,” says Guevara.A recent scientificpaper, which reviewed 18 different studies, found that six months of jump training was associated with a 1.26% improvement in bone mineral density at the hip. That might not sound like a lot, and it’s unlikely that many people have been inspired to do the jumping challenge because they want to build marginally denser hip bones. That said, withalmost halfof 80-year-old women suffering from osteoporosis, anything we can do to mitigate bone loss is a great thing for our future health.Why are we drawn to these challenges, when taking the stairs or running for the bus could be just as good for us?As for the claim, ubiquitous on social media, that the challenge will give you better skin? Well, this is true in the sense that exercise increases blood flow, which in turn means more oxygen and nutrients are delivered to skin cells. It also helps improve lymphatic drainage (the body’s waste management system for the fluid that builds up in your tissues), which might have some benefits for skin appearance.“There’s limited scientific research on jumping specifically for lymphatic drainage, but exercise and gentle movement are known to support lymphatic flow and it’s often linked to reducing feelings of heaviness, bloating and puffiness,” saysLannay Dale-Tooze, a personal trainer at Gymshark who has been doing the challenge herself. “From my experience, low-impact hopping feels like a simple way to wake up the body and encourage circulation first thing in the morning.”What are the potential downsides?So should we all be jumping (groan) on this trend? Maybe not, suggestsAisling Freir, head of women’s health and a specialist pelvic MSK physiotherapist at PureSportsMedicine. Those impact forces are transmitted not just through our bones, but also through our pelvic floor. For some people, this can lead to symptoms such as leaking urine or a feeling of heaviness in the area.“We’re not in the business of scaremongering or telling women to stop jumping,” she says. “However, if you’re experiencing pelvic symptoms, jumping should be done with guidance from a trained pelvic health physiotherapist. Pelvic floor issues are often associated with the postnatal, perimenopausal and menopausal stages, but they can affect women of all ages.”In fact, a 2023 RCOG survey of 2,000 women found that 60% had experienced at least one symptom of poor pelvic health (it’s rarer in men, but still possible). Freir recommends seeing a healthcare professional if you have clear signs of dysfunction. In the meantime, you could attempt a modified version of the jumping challenge, by standing tall with your feet together and arms reaching up; rising on to your tiptoes; then dropping your heels to the floor and softening into a position just above a chair pose.View image in fullscreenNatural high … a simple way to wake up the body?Photograph: Getty Images“You could also start with 10 jumps instead of 50,” says Freir. “Monitor symptoms during the activity, later that day, and the following morning. If you remain symptom-free, impact can gradually be increased over time.”Aside from pelvic floor issues, there are a few other reasons why you might want to apply a note of caution. “If the jumps are performed on a hard floor, there could be quite a lot of pressure on the joints,” says Skinner. “If performed with poor alignment, it could result in injuries, especially around the ankle, foot, knee, hip or lower back. There’s a risk of not warming up thoroughly since it’s often done casually at home. It also could start to become a bit boring, once the trend wears off – depending on how the individual feels, of course!”An obvious but important point is to make sure you’re jumping in a clear area. Potential slips and falls are no joke – which is not to mention the blinding agony of jumping on a child’s misplaced Lego brick. (Reader, I have experienced it.)Why do we love a fitness trend?The jumping trend does have payoffs, especially if you succeed in doing it for 30 days and beyond. In Guevara’s words, “this is no TikTok gobbledegook”. However, it isn’t some magical elixir. Most of the benefits would apply to any form of movement done consistently: we now know that “exercise snacks”, or short bursts of physical activity, can have a measurable impact on cardiorespiratory fitness, even if you don’t have time to fit in a full workout.Strong v swole: the surprising truth about building muscleRead moreIt raises the question: why are so many of us drawn to challenges of this nature, when taking the stairs instead of the lift or running for the bus would probably be just as good for us?With her psychotherapist hat on, Skinner believes there’s a lot of power in social influence and belonging. “If we see many people doing something, we might feel compelled to follow or try it out for ourselves,” she notes. “The dopamine we get from likes and engagement might encourage us to keep following the trend, on top of the dopamine from a new fitness habit.”As dopamine-fuelled online trends go, it’s clearly a benign one. Just spare a thought for your downstairs neighbour before you progress to advanced plyometrics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitorSun 1 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 06.02 ESTShareA little more than one week ago,TikTokstepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.TikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance,finalizeda deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.The day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.During the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.What the US TikTok takeover is already revealing about new forms of censorship | Paolo GerbaudoRead moreWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.Simultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedianMeg Stalter– accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut,tweetedthat TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.After days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued astatementblaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.Oracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.The most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.The late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolledpress releasenow claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.With more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.TikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.TikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.Explore more on these topicsTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Yet Keir Starmer lacked the backbone to take action, allowing Mandelson to resign from the Labour party instead of kicking him out.“Keir Starmer and his chief of staff appointed Mandelson ambassador despite his relationship with Epstein, and then refused to act even as the mountain of evidence against him grew.“Given the prime minister’s appalling lack of judgment and the participation of his Downing Street operation, there must now be a full and thorough independent investigation.”View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson talking to Jeffrey Epstein in an image that was released by US lawmakers last year.Photograph: Birthday bookEarlier, a government minister had said Mandelson should testify before the US Congress about his links to Jeffrey Epstein as documents appeared to show the late child sex offender sent the then Labour MP $75,000.Emails and other documents released by the US justice department on Friday shed new light on the closeness of the relationship between Epstein and Lord Mandelson.Bank statements appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 referencing the former UK business secretary being sent from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts.Contacted about the statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.”Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.”What have we learned from the newly released Epstein files?Read moreOn Sunday the housing, communities and local government secretary, Steve Reed, said Mandelson had “a moral obligation” to share what he knew about the disgraced financier.He told Sky News that anyone with information or evidence should share it “whether that is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, whether it’s Lord Mandelson, or whether it’s anybody else”, adding: “[T]hey have a moral obligation to share what they knew so that the victims can help find the justice that they’ve been denied for so long.”But Reed refused to be drawn on whether Mandelson, who has been on leave of absence from the House of Lords since he took up his role as US ambassador and does not have the Labour whip, should possibly be stripped of his peerage. “I think before taking any action like that, we need to understand exactly what’s happened,” he said.Pressure had been mounting on Keir Starmer to take action to block any return of Mandelson to the Lords as a Labour peer, after the emails released on Friday also appear to show the then business secretary in Gordon Brown’s government assuring Epstein in December 2009 that he was “trying hard” to change government policy on bankers’ bonuses at his request.In an email exchange on 15 December 2009, in which email addresses are redacted, Epstein asked Mandelson if the policy could be changed, writing: “Any [sic] real chance of making the tax only on the cash portion of the bankers bonus.” Mandelson replied: “Trying hard to amend as I explained to Jes last night. Treasury digging in but I am on case.”Correspondence months earlier appeared to show that Mandelson’s husband, da Silva, had successfully asked the financier to pay him £10,000 in September 2009to fund an osteopathy course and other expenses.A statement dated 14 May 2003 relating to the apparent $75,000 payment andfirst reported by the Financial Timesshows a payment sent to a Barclays Bank account where Mandelson’s then partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, is named as “A/C”, typically an abbreviation for account. “Peter Mandelson” is named on the account as “BEN”, often an abbreviation for beneficiary.The second and third payments of $25,000 appear to have been made to HSBC accounts, days apart in June 2004. In both, “Peter Mandelson” is identified as “BEN”.It is unclear if the three payments ever made it into any of the named accounts and being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.Sources close to Mandelson said the statements could not be taken at face value and contained errors. They said the US justice department had previously stated that the Epstein files may contain false images, documents or videos.View image in fullscreenImages of Peter Mandelson in his underwear were released in the latest tranche of the Epstein files. In some images, he is standing next to a woman whose face is redacted.Photograph: Pixel8000Returning from a trip to China, the prime minister was asked whether a £10,000 payment to Mandelson’s partner at a time when he was a Labour business secretary fell far from the standards he expected of a peer.“In relation to Peter Mandelson, obviously he was removed as ambassador in relation to the further information that came to light in September of last year,” Starmer said. “I’ve nothing more to say in relation to Peter Mandelson.”Images of Mandelson in his underwear were also released in the latest tranche of Epstein files. Responding to a redacted picture, where he is seen standing next to a woman, Mandelson said he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”.Mandelson should now offer to give evidence to the US Congress, said the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, a member of the women and equalities select committee. “I think anyone who has any knowledge of what Epstein was doing has a moral responsibility to his victims to help the authorities in any way they can,” she said. “The public also has a right to hold its politicians to a certain standard and we must ensure that happens in this absolutely disgusting situation.”A Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party takes all complaints seriously and they are investigated in line with our rules and procedures.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not only President Trump who thinks Europe needs to do more but other presidents as well. I think the same. That’s why we’ve made commitments to greater spending. I think we need to go beyond that.”The Guardianrevealed on Fridaythat the UK and EU were exploring the prospect of new talks on closer defence cooperation. Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade commissioner, is due in London fortalks on Monday, when trade, energy and fisheries will be on the agenda.While defence is not currently on the agenda for that meeting, there may be further opportunities for the EU and UK to discuss defence at a political summit convened by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, todiscuss critical minerals in Washington on Wednesday, with the Foreign Office sending a minister.Starmer wants to build on defence deals struck with European allies in recent months, and more bilateral deals is another option on the table. Norway has agreed a £10bn deal foranti-submarine warshipsthat will be built in the UK, while Britain has agreed to sell 20 Typhoon fighter jets to Turkey for £8bn.“I do think on spend, capability and cooperation we need to do more together. I’ve made the argument and that should require us to look at schemes like Safe and others to see whether there is a way in which we can work more closely together,” Starmer told reporters.“Whether it’s Safe or other initiatives, it makes good sense for Europe in the widest sense of the word – which is the EU plus other European countries – to work more closely together. That’s what I’ve been advocating and I hope to make some progress on that.”The Safe fund is made up of money the European Commission raises on credit markets, which is then lent to member states over 45 years. They can buy everything from ammunition to drones and missiles.The aim of the fund is to enable the EU to build up a defence capability quickly, something given an extra urgency by the lack of support from Trump and his regular threats over Nato.The UK is not eligible to apply for a Safe loan, but if it joined the programme under third-country rules then UK companies could tender for more procurement contracts to provide arms to the EU, boosting the British defence industry.It is understood that the EU had demanded that the UK contribute about €2bn to the fund and that the British felt a contribution in the hundreds of millions was more appropriate.China is leading the charge to nuclear Armageddon – and Starmer barely noticed | Simon TisdallRead moreStarmer is facingpressure from within his own partyfor closer ties with the EU. He has rejected the idea of rejoining the customs union, as the UK would have to rip up trade deals with other countries, but the prime minister is known to be keen on further alignment with the single market.EU relations are increasingly becoming a dividing line betweenLabourand Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, though the government has ruled out the UK going back into the single market or customs union or bringing back free movement.In China, Starmer criticised the Reform leader’s promises on Brexit. “I wouldn’t listen too much to what Nigel Farage has to say about this. It is absolutely clear the botched deal we got from the last government has damaged our economy,” he said.“Which is why we have to reset that relationship and do want to get closer on defence and security, on energy, on emissions and trade … when we get to the summit this year we will not only follow up on the 10 strands that we set out at last year’s summit, we’ll also want to get closer with an iterative process.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyForeign policyKeir StarmerLabourEuropean UnionEuropeMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

The shooting sparkedwidespreaddemonstrationsand renewed demands for criminal inquiries into federal immigration enforcement actions. Immediately following Pretti’s killing, theTrump administrationrepeatedlypushedfalse claimsabout the shooting.At the time of the incident, both agents were participating inOperation Metro Surge, a large-scale immigration enforcement initiative that launched inDecember. The operation deployed numerous armed, masked agents throughout Minneapolis as part of a citywide sweep.CBP, the agency that employs both men, has declined to publicly name the agents involved and has released little additional information about the shooting. The lack of transparency has drawn heightened scrutiny, particularly because the incident occurred only days after another immigration agentshot and killeda different Minneapolis protester,Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three.‘We’re fighting for the soul of the country’: how Minnesota residents came together to face ICERead morePretti’s death and the secrecy surrounding the agents’ identities have unfolded amid growing national debate over Donald Trump’shardline immigration policies. Enforcement actions in cities nationwide have included violent encounters involving both immigrants and US citizens, carried out by agents who, controversially, arepermittedtoconcealtheir identities with masks.Lawmakers from both parties have since urged a full and transparent investigation into the killing of Pretti, who was 37 and worked as an intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital.Earlier this week, CBP sent a notice to select members of Congress confirming that two agents discharged Glock pistols during the encounter that led to Pretti’s death, though the notice omitted their names. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, said through a spokesperson that the agents wereplaced on leavefollowing the shooting.After days of protests and pressure from lawmakers, the justice department announced on Friday that its civil rights division hadopened an investigation.Records reportedly show that Ochoa joined CBP in 2018 as a border patrol agent, while Gutierrez began working for the agency in 2014. Gutierrez serves in CBP’s office of field operations and is part of a special response team that handles high-risk missions similar to those carried out by police Swat units. Both men are from south Texas.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationMinneapolisMinnesota ICE shootingsMinnesotaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Images published by Ukraine’s state emergency service showed what appeared to be an empty bus, its side windows shattered and windscreen hanging from the front.‘It’s not just about surviving’: the Ukrainian frontline city where life goes on under coverRead moreDTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said those killed were travelling from one of its mining facilities after they had finished their shift.“The enemy drone hit near a company shuttle bus in the Pavlograd district. Preliminarily, 12 people were killed and seven more were wounded,” the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Ganzha, said on Telegram.An earlier drone attack in the region overnight killed a man and a woman in the central city of Dnipro, Ganzha said in an earlier post. A drone also struck a maternity hospital in the southern Zaporizhzhia region on Sunday, wounding at least seven people including two women receiving a medical examination.The attacks came the same day a unilateral reduction in Russian strikes on Ukraine announced by the US president, Donald Trump, was due to end. Trump said on Thursday that Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop strikes on Kyiv and “various towns” during cold weather.The terms of his agreement with the Russia president were not clear, however, and the Kremlin did not link the alleged truce to the weather.A second round of talks between Russian, Ukrainian and US officials on a US-drafted plan to end the nearly four-year Ukraine war will begin on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Sunday.Ukraine war briefing: US reports ’constructive’ peace talks with Russia as Zelenskyy pushes for ‘results’Read moreOne of Putin’s top envoys, Kirill Dmitriev, on Saturday held surprise talks with US officials in Florida without Ukraine. Among those US officials were Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and White House senior adviser Josh Gruenbaum.Neither the Kremlin nor the US have confirmed the new dates for talks, which Zelenskyy said would be 4 and 5 February in Abu Dhabi.The US says it is close to brokering a deal to end the conflict – Europe’s deadliest since the second world war – but neither Moscow nor Kyiv have been able to find a compromise on the key issue of territory.Russia, which occupies about 20% of its neighbour, is pushing for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal. It has threatened to take it by force if talks fail.Ukraine has warned ceding ground will embolden Moscow and that it will not sign a deal that fails to deter Russia from invading again. Many Ukrainians find the idea of surrendering territory their soldiers have defended for years unconscionable.The first round of talks on the US plan, held in Abu Dhabi last Friday and Saturday, failed to yield a breakthrough.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Plans will be reserved for children with the most severe and complex needs, according to sources familiar with the proposals.The expected move has sparked concerns among parents and campaigners who have warned that limiting legal rights could have catastrophic implications for children and families, and among MPs who say Send is the issue they are most contacted about.Weakening the Send legal framework would put at risk decades of progress towards inclusion, said Madeleine Cassidy, the chief executive of IPSEA, a charity providing legal advice that ispart of the Save Our Children’s Rights campaign. “These rights are not optional – they are essential safeguards that enable families to secure the support their children need to access education and thrive,” she said.Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has been leading a year-long lobbying offensive of hundreds of MPs to convince them that the changes are not aimed at saving money and will make schools more inclusive. But despite intensive engagement with the parliamentary Labour party, some in government are worried that Labour MPs could vote the plans down in the next parliamentary session, saying that such an event could hasten the end of Keir Starmer’s premiership.“Everyone knows this is the most high-stakes political reform they’ve taken on since welfare,” said one Labour MP. Alongside official debates and aconsultation, ministers have also been meeting with parents and campaigners and running special listening exercises with MPs who have children with special needs, while MPs have also been given guidance packs on running Send roundtables.Another MP said there was a stark contrast in preparation of the overhauls. “We have had a masterclass in how not to do engagement with the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] in recent months with the welfare bill,” they said. “And now we’re seeing a masterclass in how to do it.”Jen Craft, an MP and member of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Send, said she would oppose plans to restrict EHCPs if a properly funded replacement system was not in place. “That would be a real issue,” she said.Phillipson has told MPs that the overhaul of the system, in which funding for high-needs provision has increased by more than 50% to £11bn a year, is not a cost-cutting exercise. She told the PLP it was “morally wrong” to put children in independent special schools that often failed them at “enormous cost” to them and the taxpayer.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said it had already invested£3bn in specialist Send units in local state schoolsand£200m to train teachers in Send.They said: “Our priority is – and has always been – improving outcomes for children and young people with Send. We will restore parents’ trust by fixing what isn’t working in the system and strengthening support for those who need it – shaped directly by the views and experiences of those who know the system best.”Meg Hillier, the MP who is chair of the Treasury select committee, who led the Labour backbench rebellion against the welfare reform bill, said this “downpayment” was key to building trust. “Bridget knows its important to get it as right as possible first time, you don’t get to take a shot at this,” she said. “And she’s working hard to bring the PLP and stakeholders with her.”But the government will have to save money. Spiralling Send costs have put local authoritiesinto £6bn of debt. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said in last year’s budget that she wouldtake over full responsibility for the costs.Avnee Morjaria, a co-author ofan influential reportfrom the Institute for Public Policy Research, said: “A reform of this scale will eventually need a serious rebalancing of funding from individuals to the school system so that children can access the support they need sooner and more efficiently. That will have implications for the funding available for EHCPs in the future.”Helen Hayes, the chair of the education select committee, said the government shouldretain existing legal rightsand the new system had to be properly funded and fully accountable. The proportion of children on EHCPs has grown from 3% in 2018 tomore than 5%, with the number of assessments increasing by 250% between 2013 and 2024.“Parents rely on the part of the system – the EHCP – that has statutory accountability, because there is almost no accountability in any other part of the system,” Hayes said.The MP Antonia Bance said rebuilding trust with parents was an uphill battle “because few people believe that things can actually get better. But there is an absolute consensus that the current system is broken. We have to do something.”Explore more on these topicsEducation policySpecial educational needsLabourBridget PhillipsonDepartment for EducationSchool fundingSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now 46 families are part of the claim, the legal firm Leigh Day said.In a statement issued by the firm on Sunday, the families said: “What has happened here is not just about one individual or one nursery. We believe Chan’s crimes raise serious questions about how childcare providers recruit, supervise and safeguard staff, and how warning signs can be overlooked over long periods of time.How can abuse openly take place in a nursery? This is the question we must urgently reckon with | Munira WilsonRead more“In our case, Bright Horizons repeatedlydismissed concerns from parents about Chan’s behaviour, and we believe their consistent culture of brushing concerns aside was key to enabling this catastrophe to happen.”The firm added: “They will be seeking full accountability for those failures, initially through the civil courts, and are also urging Camden council to investigate the case for prosecution of Bright Horizons as a corporate entity.”The 46 families are made up of relatives of the victims of Chan’s sexual abuse and image-based offending, as well as those whose children were mistreated by him in other ways, including when he made videos of children humiliated or in distress.The sex offender admitted 30 new offences at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Thursday relating to 10 girls and six women that did not take place at the nursery. Chan will be sentenced on 12 February for the 56 offences to which he haspleaded guilty.The families taking action said they were “seeking accountability” through claims of breach of contract for Bright Horizons’ safeguarding failures that permitted Chan to commit his crimes, as well as neglect and cruelty, Leigh Day said.It said Camden Safeguarding Partnership was conducting a local child safeguarding practice review of the nursery.Alison Millar, the head of Leigh Day’s abuse team, said: “Families understandably are extremely concerned that a perpetrator was able to work at the nursery for so many years and misuse nursery devices to facilitate his offending.”Paedophile passed vetting to work at London primary school and nurseryRead moreA spokesperson for Bright Horizon previously said: “First and foremost, our thoughts remain with the children and families affected. What happened at our former Finchley Road nursery was an appalling breach of trust by one individual and not representative of the thousands of experienced and dedicated staff who work tirelessly each day to look after the children in our care.“The safety and wellbeing of children entrusted to our care is our highest priority. We are committed to learning any lessons that can be taken from this terrible case. We fully support the child safeguarding practice review (CSPR) and hope that it will be beneficial for families, for us as a provider and for the early years industry as a whole.“It would be premature to comment on any matters relating to our former nursery whilst the CSPR’s process is ongoing. Parents are invited to contribute to this review and we would encourage them to participate so that information can be obtained and considered.”The families of 700 children who attended the nursery during the time Chan worked there between 2017 and 2024 have been contacted and are receiving specialist support.Bright Horizons has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But in the UK we have a deadly cancer treatment postcode lottery.“The NHS is supposed to be a national health service. But that’s not true if access to modern radiotherapy, one of our most important cancer treatments, depends on where you live,” she added.SABR is used across the NHS for lung cancer. But, unlike in other countries, in England only a few hospitals offer it for liver, prostate and kidney cancer, despiteevidencethat it is effective.The NHS’s limited use of SABR means that some patients in England who might benefit from it, for example because their cancer has spread, end up getting it from private hospitals.Price said it was shocking that hospitals were paid for providing traditional forms of radiotherapy for cancer, but not newer ones. That means that “for certain types of cancer, those treatments are barely available at all”, she added. She blamed the situation on the archaic nature of the NHS’s “tariff” system – the way it funds hospitals for treatment – which means that hospitals will lose money if they do use SABR for other types of cancer apart from lung cancer.Thorp said: “The rollout of SABR to treat cancer has been slow. It is still used for fewer types of cancer than it could be, as evidence shows it is effective for more cancers than it is used for.”Cancer Research UKhas been warning for several yearsthat “inequalities in access to treatment”, including SABR, are a key reason why “despite being a world leader in cancer research, UK survival lags behind many other comparable countries, even after accounting for differences in the stage at which people are diagnosed”.It has also highlighted that lack of NHS capital funding means many radiotherapy machines are still in use, despite being past their expected lifespan, and that that is adding to the NHS waiting list.NHS England said the cancer plan would make novel treatments more widely available. A spokesperson said:“Every NHS trust in England delivering radiotherapy is already able to offer stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, and it is available for patients where there is strong clinical evidence that it is appropriate.“We continue to work closely with the Royal College of Radiologists and other partners on the safe and evidence-based use of radiotherapy, including how access to proven innovations can be delivered consistently across the NHS.“The upcoming national cancer plan will address this.”Explore more on these topicsNHSCancerHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The manner of their second-half capitulation saw to that. If they were impressive before the interval, they were so brittle thereafter, blown off course after Tottenham stirred. Pep Guardiola was beside himself with frustration on the touchline.The City manager has now seen his team drop seven points since the turn of the year with goals they have conceded in the second half of matches.

Above all, it was one for Xavi Simons and Dominic Solanke. Maybe even the under-fire manager, Thomas Frank, too, who made smart in-game adjustments. Simons was the driving force behind the Spurs comeback, Solanke the goalscoring hero. The team had been booed off at half-time. Of course they were. And yet they refused to bow to what had felt like the inevitable. In the process, they gave Arsenal’s title challenge a boost. Is this allowed?Rayan Cherki and Antoine Semenyo had scored for City. It was always likely that the latter would do so, having been pursued by Spurs in January before opting for City. Spurs’ revival was stunning. After Solanke had scored for 2-1 – a controversial goal, with City wanting a foul by him on Marc Guéhi – the scene was set for one of the goals of the season.It was Conor Gallagher who won the ball before crossing. Which was when Solanke diverted the ball up and over Gianluigi Donnarumma with the outside of his trailing boot. Call it a scorpion kick. And, really, just a moment of instinctive brilliance because Solanke had next to no time to make the calculations.City’s perfect start was overtaken. Ditto their dominance of the first half. It had been plain at the outset that Radu Dragusin, on his first Spurs start for 371 days, was ring-rusty. The alarm bells sounded for Spurs when Cherki ran at him in the 11th minute. Cherki dropped his shoulder and bought a yard of space too easily before wrapping a low finish into the far corner, the ball nicking off Dragusin on the way in. The move had been sparked when Bernardo Silva robbed Yves Bissouma. Frank hurled an environmentally friendly water carton to the ground in disgust.Frank had persisted with his 3-4- 2-1 system despite Kevin Danso and Djed Spence having been added to the list of unavailable defenders. The manager was without 11 injured players in total. He had the defensive midfielder João Palhinha and Dragusin either side of Cristian Romero at the back. Archie Gray, another midfielder, filled in at right wing-back.There were times during the first half when it felt ominous for Spurs. The home fans were the usual mixture of emotions; they were angsty whenever Guglielmo Vicario tried to start moves with short passes. There were ironic cheers on 35 minutes when he played a decent one. City encountered minimal resistance on their way to their second goal and, after that, the countdown was on to the half-time boos. How loud would they be? Very.Dragusin hacked a loose clearance straight at Rodri, who moved it forward to Silva and, when he went to ground to scoop it left for Semenyo, the Spurs defence had been shredded. Semenyo was never going to miss.View image in fullscreenDominic Solanke starts the Tottenham comeback with a goal against Manchester City.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCity might have had more in the first half. Erling Haaland lobbed wastefully over after Rodri had sent a high ball in behind Cristian Romero. Cherki was denied by a Vicario wonder-save after ghosting around Romero and watching Dragusin fly past him in an all-or-nothing block, which turned out to be very much the latter.Frank changed things for the second half after Romero had failed to emerge for it; the Spurs captain succumbed to illness. On came Pape Sarr at right midfield in a 4-4-2, Frank matching up Guardiola’s formation, going man for man. The transformation was extraordinary. Simons had been an isolated bright spot in the first period; a snap-shot in defiance. His influence would grow exponentially. Solanke was relentless in front of the watching England manager, Thomas Tuchel.Destiny Udogie drew a fine save out of Donnarumma and then the home team caught a break. Solanke held up a pass from Simons before holding off Abdukodir Khusanov and making the room to shoot. Guéhi, chasing back, got his foot in between Solanke and the ball. At which point Solanke kicked through the City defender, sending it off his boot – in part – and past Donnarumma. It looked like a foul and yet the goal stood. It was the latest refereeing decision to perplex Guardiola, who would be booked shortly afterwards for something he said.City’s collapse was remarkable. Spurs pushed, throwing caution to the wind. It was a golden period for Frank and what a goal it was from Solanke for the equaliser. The home crowd enjoyed themselves, roaring their team on and another goal for them would not have been a surprise. Simons teed up the substitute Wilson Odobert, who hammered goalwards. Donnarumma saved with his legs. Simons also extended the goalkeeper with a deflected effort.Back came City. Tijjani Reijnders, on as a substitute, twice went close. In between times, Haaland scooped high. At the other end Simons almost got a low cross to work for Odobert. It was breathless stuff. Spurs could revel in the point.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Reform is still there: the lights are on, and a shop owner next door said people go in and out every day, although no one answered the door when the Guardian rang the bell.View image in fullscreenThe Reform UK office in Caerphilly.Photograph: Athena Picture Agency/The GuardianThe byelection was a golden opportunity for Nigel Farage’s party. Reform poured money and resources into its chance to break off a piece of theLabourheartland and boost its credibility by winning a first seat in the Senedd. Instead, Caerphilly became Plaid Cymru territory; a story that the latest polling suggests could be repeated across the country in May’s Senedd elections.“I am a local candidate who has given 50 years of public service, so it’s not too surprising that the election swung to us,” said Lindsay Whittle, Caerphilly’s new Plaid Cymru Senedd member (MS), over coffee at a cafe overlooking the town’s castle.View image in fullscreenLindsay Whittle, who won the Senedd seat for Caerphilly to the surprise of both Labour and Reform UK.Photograph: Athena Picture Agency/The Guardian“Everyone was shocked by the scale of it though. We spent 50% less than Labour and Reform did, and brought home more of the vote than the other two parties put together. I’ve been in politics long enough to see some stunning upsets and twists in my time, but this feels different.”Caerphilly appeared to be a neck-and-neck race until the very last minute, but Whittle beat Reform’s Llŷr Powell by 47.4% to 36%. Labour came in a distant third with 11%.“We were very worried about the things Reform say about refugees and immigrants, but the people in Caerphilly are so welcoming, we have never had any problems here,” said Ludmila Iamtsova, 46, a Ukrainian refugee who runs the railway station cafe with her sister, Hanna, 48. “It is early days but everyone is excited, you can tell the mood has changed.”View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Hanna, 48, Daria, 20, and her mother, Ludmila, 46, originally from Ukraine, who run the coffee shop at the Caerphilly railway station.Photograph: Athena Picture Agency/The GuardianA couple shopping in the town centre who gave their names as Mike, 76, and Annie, 83, said they were lifelong Labour voters until they recently joined Jeremy Corbyn’s Your Party.Mike said: “I have voted Plaid Cymru in the past, and I was delighted Reform lost, although I voted Labour myself. I’m not sure where my vote will go in May.”View image in fullscreenMike, 76, and Annie, 83.Photograph: Athena Picture Agency/The GuardianThe Welsh have been Labour’s most loyal voters for 100 years – returning the party to government in Cardiff since devolution began in 1999. But poll after poll now says Labour’s base has collapsed. The party could come third or even fourth in May, finishing after the Greens.Welsh Labour partly has an incumbency issue - but it must also contend with the many measures suggesting its track record in office is poor.Welsh children’s reading, maths and science skills fell to the lowest recorded levels in 2024. About 20% of Welsh NHS patients wait more than a year for hospital treatment, compared with about 4% in England.Wales and England are thepoorest UK nations. The proportion of people in Wales in poverty considered to be in very deep poverty has risen from 33% in the 1990s to 47% in 2023, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.Keir Starmer’s 2024 Westminster victory is also widely viewed as a major Welsh Labour problem, removing a natural defence against criticism of the party in Cardiff.The Welsh Green party leader, Anthony Slaughter, said: “Labour support was ebbing for a while, but Starmer’s election is what really shiftedWelsh politics. For 14 years, the line was: ‘Well, what can we do, the Tories are in charge.’ But now we get the same arrogance and contempt from the Labour government in Westminster.”View image in fullscreenWales Green party leader Anthony Slaughter speaking at the party conference in Bournemouth in 2025.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAEven before the Caerphilly litmus test, Wales’s new proportional voting system and an increase in the size of the parliament added to the odds Plaid Cymru would be the only party able to form a government after the election, ending a century of Welsh Labour hegemony. Reform could win the most seats, but since both the Welsh nationalists and Labour have ruled out going into coalition with Farage’s party, they are unlikely to win power.YouGov survey datareleased last month, however, is truly seismic.Caerphilly now seems to represent a major turning point: support for Plaid Cymru has surged from a dead heat with Reform to a 14-point lead, putting the party within touching distance of a majority. Majority governments are supposed to be very rare under the new system, but a moment akin to the Scottish National party’s breakthrough Holyrood victory in 2011 could beckon.TheGreen party, which was hoping for one to four seats, could go from zero MSs to an astonishing 11, delivering the Greens’ best election result, making a Plaid Cymru-Green coalition government a strong possibility, and putting the question of Welsh independence firmly on the Cardiff agenda.Labour is on 10% of the vote and eight seats – none of which would belong to Eluned Morgan, the first minister. And Reform has dropped from 29% to a 23% vote share, which would still see the party grow from one MS to 23 but could suggest its support has peaked.View image in fullscreenEluned Morgan, the first minister of Wales.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianReform, like Plaid Cymru, is keen to emphasise that May’s vote is a two-horse race. “It’s clear that all the polling is trending in one direction,” a spokesperson said. “Our ambition is to put forward a platform based on common sense, economic stability and real change here in Wales.”But nationwide, it appears Reform is plateauing. The Caerphilly washout, Farage’s lacklustre responses to claims of antisemitism and racism, chaos in Kent’s Reform-run council, and tax rises across other English Reform councils seem to have stalled the party’s growth.In Wales, where the party is yet to set out any policies or platforms for May or finish selecting candidates for its lists, it appears to already be in decline. Reform has not announced a Welsh leader – an official appointment is due next week – and its most familiar Welsh figure of recent years, Nathan Gill, wasjailedfor taking bribes to make pro-Russia speeches when he was member of the European parliament. It is hard to escape a sense that the party is struggling to find momentum.Jac Larner, a politics lecturer at Cardiff University, said: “One of the most interesting questionsin the pollwas: ‘Which party would be the biggest nightmare in government?’, and 65.5% of respondents said Reform. So, that sets the ceiling.“There aren’t many more Conservatives to win over, and if the Tories have a good few months, that could split the vote. Reform will have to rely on increasing voter turnout. We’ve seen that in some English local elections lately, but it’s very hard to do.”Farage’s outfit is still the first rightwing party with a shot at winning in Wales since the 1850s, but the “rise of Reform” narrative prevalent in England did not fit the Welsh landscape, Larner added.“Like everywhere, there are a lot of people with conservative values here, but there were always historic reasons not to vote for the Tories in Wales – [Keir] Hardie, the mines, [Margaret] Thatcher. Reform doesn’t have that baggage, so in effect, they are the conservative option Wales never had before.”View image in fullscreenNigel Farage meeting members of the public during campaigning in Caerphilly with his party’s candidate, Llyr Powell (right).Photograph: Ben Birchall/PADespite strong courtship by Farage, a decade after narrowly voting in favour of Brexit, Wales is seemingly returning to the social-democratic ideals pioneered by Labour figures such as Hardie and Aneurin Bevan, now under new, nationalist stewardship.Larner said the Celtic identities of Scotland and Wales were a bulwark against the far right that was difficult for England to replicate.“There are now more people in Wales who say they feel Welsh rather than British, it’s accelerated madly since Brexit and Covid. As with many nationalist identities, it’s bundled up with foundation myths, and modern myths about being more progressive, more working class, even if those things aren’t actually true.“In England, Britishness is seen as the more inclusive identity, when Englishness isn’t, necessarily. People in England have to find something else to coalesce around.”Whittle said he believed grassroots work was the key to combating the far right across the UK: “With my background, family down the mines, I probably should have, or could have, been a Labour man. Being active in your community, taking part in civic life … anyone can do that.”The January YouGov poll suggests Plaid Cymru is getting more than just an anti-Reform or protest vote. Together with the Greens, the progressive parties have moved on from picking up disaffected Labour voters, and are now attracting those who previously said they were undecided. Now first-past-the-post has been scrapped, progressive bloc votes will not be split.Slaughter said: “I used to get people telling me: ‘We can’t vote for you because we have to keep the Tories out’, but that’s not the case any more. A vote for Plaid Cymru isn’t necessary – three more Green members means three fewer Reform members.”Plaid Cymru is also enjoying the wave of momentum. Donations have soared and Whittle has become something of a celebrity; in the aftermath of his victory over Reform, he received standing ovations at the pub and a rugby international match.“People ask me for selfies, I get stopped so people can shake my hand. How many politicians can say that? It’s overwhelming,” he said.The surge in Welsh-first identity and buoyant support for two pro-independence parties means the question of Welsh independence is now on the Cardiff agenda. Both Labour and Reform have relied heavily on this attack line against Plaid Cymru, although polls imply it is not cutting through.Even though independence is his party’s raison d’etre, Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru’s leader, is wary of spooking more-cautious voters who would traditionally vote Labour. He has stressed that, if elected, Plaid Cymru would not seek to hold an independence referendum within the next five-year Senedd term.“We are still making the case [for independence]. I will freely admit that many people are not where I am on the issue,” he said. “We need to fix what needs to be fixed first, the cost of living, public services. Then we can have that conversation.”View image in fullscreenRhun ap Iorwerth speaking in Cardiff on 13 January to mark the start of the new Senedd term.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAWhittle acknowledged that he and his party were in the right place at the right time to win October’s crucial byelection, but said Plaid Cymru earned it by putting in the hard yards.“We’ve spent decades preparing for this moment, winning local races over the past 10 to 15 years,” he said. “The writing is on the wall. It’s literally on the wall: there are new Welsh dragon stencils all over town.”This article was amended on 1 February 2026. The Scottish National party was mistakenly referred to as the Scottish “Nationalist” party. Also, it has been amended to make clear that the Joseph Rowntree figures for deep poverty in Wales referred to the proportion of people in poverty and not a proportion of the general population. An earlier version also said that Wales was “by far the poorest UK nation”. In fact England and Wales are the poorest nations with similar overall poverty rates.Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsPlaid CymruGreen partyWalesLabourReform UKByelectionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They fired the first two shots as he parked his bus in the school yard, then boarded the bus and fired another 24 shots. As the killers sped away they whooped in delight. “Yahoo,” they screamed. “Yahoo.”It was 1 February 1985 and the IRA team had special reason to celebrate: it had bagged a third Graham brother. They had killed Ronnie Graham in June 1981, Cecil Graham in November 1981 and now, just over three years later, they got Jimmy. A hat-trick.Jimmy Graham.Photograph: SEFFEven in the grim annals of Northern Ireland’s Troubles, what unfolded in the bucolic landscape of County Fermanagh was unique: three Protestant brothers targeted in separate murders.“The torture never ended,” their sister Pam Morrison, 78, said this week. “First Ronnie, then Cecil, then Jimmy. You never really got a chance to get yourself sorted out.”She will mark the 41st anniversary of Jimmy’s murder on Sunday the same way she has marked all the other anniversaries: with memories, prayers and a dogged determination to go on, to live a life scarred by grief and absence.“The older you get, the worse it gets, the more you want them,” she said. “Time never helps. No matter how long it is, that’s something you just can never forget. The pain is still there, something you just have to carry.”View image in fullscreenRonnie Graham.Photograph: SEFFFor more than three decades Morrison did not speak publicly about the murders. It was too painful, too dangerous. Other relatives, like her slain brothers, served part-time in the Ulster Defence Regiment, the local wing of the British army which attracted mainly Protestants, and she feared any publicity – condemnation of the crimes or airing of the family’s anguish – might galvanise further IRA attacks. “You just had to keep your mouth closed and say nothing.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Paul Faith/The GuardianNow, however, Morrison feels a responsibility to speak and keep memories alive. Of eight Graham siblings, she is the last left alive. A sister, Hilary, who also served in the Ulster Defence Regiment, died in 1979 after being run over while manning a checkpoint. It was an accident. Three other siblings died of natural causes.“It takes an awful lot out of me to try to talk,” said Morrison, speaking from her home outside the town of Lisnaskea. “But I want to try.”She has all but abandoned hope of justice. No one was convicted in connection with the murders and she does not expect changes to legacy legislation –the government plans to overturn conditional immunityfor those accused of wrongdoing – to make any difference.Cecil Graham.Photograph: SEFFIn this small rural community, the family had suspicions about who was responsible. “If you were in the town, you’d see them,” said Morrison. “One of them, he was there all the time. He’d just stare at me. He knew who I was.”Elsewhere the IRA often targeted police and soldiers without knowing their individual identities, but in Fermanagh victims were screened, selected and typically attacked while off-duty and unarmed, fuelling a perception of sectarian score-settling.“It wasn’t by chance that those three brothers were murdered one by one,” said Kenny Donaldson, ofSEFF, a Fermanagh-based group that works with victims. “There was a purpose to it.” The Grahams’ fate was a warning to others to not join the security forces or marry across the religious divide, said Donaldson.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Paul Faith/The GuardianRonnie, a 39-year-old father of two, was shot while delivering coal and groceries to a shop. Cecil, 32, was visiting his wife and newborn baby at the home of her parents – Catholics who lived in a Catholic area – and ambushed when he emerged.Jimmy, 39, a father of two, was due to drive primary schoolchildren to a swimming pool when the killers riddled his bus. “That was the hardest one,” said Morrison. “He was that badly damaged none of us ever got to see him. It was a complete outsider who had to identify the body.”View image in fullscreenAn SEFF memorial.Photograph: Kenny DonaldsonIn 1988, while researching a book about the border called Bad Blood, the writer Colm Tóibín encountered local people who attributed a spate of car accidents that killed young Catholic men to divine retribution for what was done to the Grahams.Morrison, whofirst spoke publicly about the family’s suffering in 2019, said she never wanted revenge, only justice. She has Catholic friends and has contributed to amemorial tapestry at SEFF’s officethat recalls victims from all sides.The Troubles claimed another set of three brothers: the Ulster Volunteer Force – allegedly with security force complicity –murdered John Martin Reavey, 24, and his brothers Brian, 22, and Anthony, 17, at their home in Whitecross, County Armagh, in a single attack in 1976.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We needn’t have worried – it’s been a delightThis article contains spoilers for the season finale of The Night ManagerSian CainSun 1 Feb 2026 17.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 17.12 ESTShareWhat a pleasure it is to be seduced – andThe Night Manageris just about the most seductive show on television. The palatial houses and swish hotels; the expensive suits and crisp shirts (does anyone wear a button-up better than Tom Hiddleston?); all the beautiful people with their beautiful faces, elegantly stabbing one another in the back. The first season aired 10 years ago – an entirely different world – so when it was announced that a second season was coming, my first thought was: oh no, lightning doesn’t strike twice. Delightfully, I was wrong.If you haven’t revisited The Night Manager since 2016, here are the pertinent points: Jonathan Pine (Hiddleston), a night manager in a Cairo hotel, weaseled his way into the rarefied world of arms dealer Richard Onslow Roper (Hugh Laurie), AKA “the worst man in the world”, under the direction of Angela Burr (Olivia Colman), who ran a British intelligence operation. As a supposedly loyal henchman, Pine beguiled Roper, shtupped his girlfriend, imploded his arms deal and made off with a cool $300m, as Roper was dragged off screaming to a violent fate by unhappy customers.It was John le Carré’s view that the first season of the TV drama, which tweaked his 1993 novel (mainly swapping the Gulf war for the more recent Arab spring), actually ended well for Roper. “However our story ends, he comes over as a fellow who, for all the awful things he’s done, has been hard done by in return,”he wrote in the Guardianwhen it aired. “Maybe that’s because Laurie’s Roper has been entertaining us for so long with his cool, his wit, his urbanity and his sheer wickedness that we don’t want to let him go. Or maybe it’s because we’ve taken to wondering by now whether Pine isn’t enjoying himself a bit too much in his role of avenging angel.”Always the prophet. We didn’t really want to let Roper go, and Pine’s unknowability, the flicker in his eyes when Roper promised him the world, was his biggest appeal. The second season relied heavily on both these facts, which is part of why it worked. It is also meticulously plotted, which is a real pleasure when so many shows lately have felt like no one is at the wheel, pootling along aimlessly towards a finale (I’m looking at you, Fallout and Stranger Things).Though it didn’t have the weight of a Le Carré novel behind it this time, season two was blessed with familiar faces: Hiddleston, Colman, Alistair Petrie and Douglas Hodge all returned, as did one surprise, hidden entirely on the press tour – Laurie at his glowering best as Roper, seemingly back from the dead. But it was the new faces that impressed me most: the magnetic Diego Calva as the Colombian arms dealer Teddy Dos Santos, who seems to be importing British arms into the country and building a guerrilla army; and Camila Morrone as Roxana Bolaños, a steely informant who becomes Pine’s way into Dos Santos’s world.View image in fullscreenFamily affairs … Hugh Laurie as Richard Onslow Roper and Diego Calva as Teddy Dos Santos.Photograph: Des Willie/Ink Factory/BBCArms dealers, beautiful women, rotten establishments, spies spying on spies – it seemed like season two might be just a tropical spin on the first. But the best thing about The Night Manager is how it pretended to meet our expectations, then subverted them entirely.The Night Manager has often flirted with plotty silliness, but as soon as it was revealed Dos Santos’s father was an Englishman, it seemed like a disappointingly obvious callback; Le Carré does Star Wars. But then, the true reveal: daddy dearest was still alive, and working with his son to rebuild his empire. “When you’ve slain the dragon,” Roper said, “always check its breath.”Bolaños was not just another Jed, a hot bod for ravishing; she openly hates Pine for the danger he’s put her in and ends up betraying him entirely. It was Dos Santos, with all his daddy issues, who seemed more infatuated with this dishy British, blue-eyed man with his nice shirts. (Their three-way dance, by the by – the sexiest thing on television in yonks and no one even kissed.) “Were yoususceptible?” Roper asked his son in episode five, and Dos Santos’s pause was the answer.‘We’re your dream throuple!’ The Night Manager is back – and it’s even steamierRead moreHiddleston and Laurie going toe-to-toe again made me want to punch the air. In a 10-minute showdown, a tense steak lunch that ranks up there with the diner scene in Heat, Roper offers Pine an ultimatum: come on board or die. “I have inexplicable affection for you,” he says, as explanation.It is down to their chemistry that part of you wants Pine to say “yes”, while the rest of you hopes he says “no” so they can keep finding each other, as certain as death and taxes. Laurie clearly revels in Roper, a man who says things like, “Conscience and shame are the shackles of slaves!” and tauntingly quotes Macbeth – “If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well. It were done quickly!” – while his son points a gun at his forehead.And poor, doomed Dos Santos. Having convinced him to betray his father, Pine advised him to put on a brave face and act loyal – “like a dog”, he said, not knowing that Roper just shot three of his own dogs dead without a blink. In the end, Dos Santos was executed by his father, the plane transporting the arms contained only a gloriously theatrical “bite me” to the few remaining do-gooders, Burr was murdered and Pine was left bleeding out in the Colombian jungle. Roper, meanwhile, got his British passport, his promised Oxford mansion and his son back. This time, he well and truly won. For now, at least – season three is, thankfully, already in pre-production.Explore more on these topicsThe Night ManagerTelevisionTom HiddlestonHugh LauriefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is Eric fully onboard with their new ménage à trois?How do you do it? Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Eve NortonSun 1 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTShareBea, 48When I kissed him in front of Eric during a meet-up in a bar, the chemistry was pretty electricEric and I have been inseparable, and monogamous, for 30 years. Since my first pregnancy in my late 20s, my libido’s been much lower than Eric’s. But when I started perimenopause, I experienced this surge of desire (and curiosity) again, and he and I began to discuss our fantasies. Both of us were turned on by the idea of a threesome with another man, so a couple of years ago, I asked Eric if he’d be up for going to an “adult social club”. Neither of us were ready to have sex with anyone else, but it felt like the perfect chance to dip a toe into that world.In the end, we were too nervous to even speak to anyone, but it did open a door in our minds, and our sex life got better and more intense as a result. Eventually, I downloaded Feeld, a dating app for “open-minded people”, and after a few meet-ups, including a night having sex in the same room as another couple, last summer we arranged an actual threesome. We started by going on dates with various prospects, one of whom, Drake, stood out. He was 40, single, had been a third in a couple before, and when I kissed him in front of Eric in a bar, the chemistry was pretty electric.The truth is, we’re still trying to figure out how to navigate everything as husband and wifeWhen making out progressed to sex, I felt empowered in a way I never have before. Afterwards, Eric and I were euphoric, but he struggled reliving certain memories in the days that followed. There were moments when he felt I’d been monopolised by Drake, which of course I felt guilty about. He’s been insistent on working through any jealousy, though, and we’ve seen Drake a dozen more times.The experience has been transformative for me; I’ve never felt this confident, in bed or out. We’re running out of new things to try as a trio, and don’t want the novelty of our three-ways to wear off, so I’ve started to see Drake alone, too. Of course, I relay every detail to Eric, which is a real turn on for him, but can also be hard for him to process emotionally. The truth is, we’re still trying to figure out how to navigate everything as husband and wife, but when you’re as connected as we’ve become, anything’s possible.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Communication hasn’t historically been our strongest suit, particularly when it comes to sex. My drive and curiosity definitely outstripped Bea’s for almost 20 years, and while I always respected her boundaries, sometimes I internalised her lack of libido as a form of rejection. So when Bea got this resurgence of desire a couple of years ago, I loved it. Suddenly, we reverted to having sex most days of the week, like when we first met, and acts that had become less common, such as her performing oral sex, became much more frequent and pleasurable for us both.Having a third person in our relationship has naturally been hard on my self-esteem at timesStill, we broached ethical non-monogamy with caution. After Bea first mentioned it, both of us did our research, including finding a couple’s therapist who specialised in open relationships. I’ve naturally hesitated at certain points, but after years of being more closed off, Bea and I are suddenly discussing sex more than ever. Because we’re so in sync, bringing in another person isn’t as emotionally complicated as you might think. After each threesome, Bea and I are both giddy. Drake and I are never physically involved with each other; it’s all about Bea, but I’ve realised that, for me, being able to participate in giving her orgasms is as good as having my own.Having a third person in our relationship has naturally been hard on my self-esteem at times – particularly because it’s the same person consistently. That’s especially true now that Bea and Drake have met up a few times alone. At this point, I’ve reached the conclusion that I’m monogamous. Given the option of having sex with a stranger or having sex with Bea, I’d have sex with Bea, hands down, and it’s difficult to avoid a sense of competition with Drake. On a more mature level, though, I’m very conscious that Bea has never given me any reason to feel she prefers Drake. If I can make the person I love most in the world feel good, and experience pleasure vicariously in the process, why would I stand in the way of that?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Liberals are floundering, the right are flourishing, and what of the left? Well, it’s in a dire state. This is despite the fact that the key political problems of the last decade – rising inequality and a cost of living crisis – are problems leftists claim they can solve. The trouble is, reactionaries and rightwingers steal their thunder online, quickly spreading messaging that blames scapegoats for structural problems. One reason for this is that platforms originally built to connect us with friends and followers now funnel us content designed to provoke emotional engagement.Back when Twitter was still the “town square” and Facebook a humble “social network”, progressives had an advantage: from the Arab spring to Occupy Wall Street, voices excluded from mainstream media and politics could leverage online social networks and turn them into real-life ones, which at their most potent became street-level protests that toppled regimes andheld capitalism to account. It seemed as though the scattered masses would become a networked collective empowered to rise up against the powerful.But the model of friending and following put a cap on engagement. It’s hard to remember now, but there was a time when you could reach the end of your Facebook and Instagram feeds – our friends only had so many lunches to post. Platforms needed to find ways to keep us logged in. Instagram introduced “suggested posts” from accounts users didn’t follow. TikTok took this logic further: just sign up and start swiping, no need to friend or follow anyone. Creators with small social networks could go viral just by posting engaging content, and everyone could lose themselves in an infinite stream of shortform videos. Copycats such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts crowded into this new market. Over on X, Elon Musk reinstated far-right accounts and turned the “for you” feed into a home forracism and hate speech.In short, platforms that had once offered a space for debate and deliberation shifted toward emotion and immersion. Reactionaries and rightwingers have adapted their stories about who is to blame for the daily indignities of late capitalist life accordingly. Emotionally charged stories of elite villains and dangerous minorities resonate in algorithmically tailored spaces designed for doomscrolling through the permacrisis.Meanwhile, liberals were stillfocusing on old media platformssuch as newspapers and broadcast debates, as well as follower-focused platforms such as Bluesky. The left remains committed to residual media forms, launching new print and online journals. It also does a delicate dance between appearing on traditional media outlets and critiquing them – but whether it likes it or not, it has a symbiotic relationship with the liberal media.Their critiques are often excellent and politically consequential:Novara Media’s Ash Sarkaris the rare leftwing wit on televised panels, andJacobin helpedlay the groundwork for Zohran Mamdani’s campaign by offering a space to hash out democratic socialist ideas in a country where socialism is still a dirty word. But even Chapo Trap House, akey podcastfrom the US’s “dirtbag left” (a loose group of anti-capitalist and deliberately irreverent content creators) spends many a podcast roasting the New York Times. This may be cathartic, but it’s hardly a match for what we are seeing coming from the right.The right has established its own parallel media universe. It eschews most real news and instead tells convincing tales about how the shadowy functionaries of theCathedral, or thematrix,orcultural Marxismlie to you in the media and try to control your every action. The reactionary right is not just xenophobia, racism and misogyny. This online subculture also offerscamaraderie,new diets,natural medicine,exercise regimes, all of which arrive in new communicative forms such as memes and live streams.Instead of building an alternative new media ecosystem and amplifying each other’s work, the left focuses more on competition than the right. As the right convenes the intellectual dark web and manosphere, leftwing digital media is a scattered landscape of Substacks and X-to-Bluesky hot-take artists. The demands of the attention economy exacerbate the age-old leftist tendency toward infighting – it’s not just moral purity at stake. The rent is also due.Take one of the more interesting creators on the left who releases work on YouTube, Natalie Wynn, known asContraPoints. She has elevated her YouTube video essays to auteur status, combining cinematic lighting with French theory, camp dialogue and compelling political analysis. She is often put on a pedestal, only to be knocked down by others on the left. If you disagree with Wynn, you can say it’s because she sold out, and you might even be able to make your own “drama” YouTube video about it.On top of that, the centre right is often happy to engage with ideas from the right, but liberals and the left actively balk at exchanging ideas. Take, for example, the tussle between the socialism of the left and thetheory of “abundance”being forwarded by the centre in US Democratic circles at the moment. More time has been spent posting teardowns instead of focusing on the pretty big thing they have in common: state intervention in the economy. Like it or not, the “abundance” agenda has created an opening for progressive politics. The right would exploit this momentum. The left looks for flaws.Still, there are signs of life on the online left. The Irish comedian and “toxic spirit guide” Frankie McNamara has elevated the social media vox pop into a vehicle for deadpan takes on cultural types from “hot new dads” to “wellness warriors”. The Elephant Graveyard’sYouTube documentarieson the cult of Joe Rogan – in thestyle of Adam Curtis, but funny – have shown that disdain is a more powerful weapon against the manosphere than moral panic.There are even signs that the posting-to-policy pipeline can work for the left. The Palestinian-American influencer Kat Abughazaleh is carrying the same arguments about Maga,ICEand thegenocide in Gazafrom TikTok into her surprise frontrunner congressional campaign. Win or lose, her campaign shows that the real power of online politics is about waging the fight over how people view the world – and what they see as politically possible. The online right has had its sights set on this fight for a decade. Now, many on the left are leaving internal battles behind and entering the fray.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London"

She was alive and dead all at once. It was a terrible thing. And the burden on those closest is also part of the radioactive damage of it all.”My mother, Pamela, a journalist, died of vascular dementia 10 years ago. My father, the football journalist and novelistBrian Glanville, died of Parkinson’s last year after living with the illness for five years. He also had a milder form of dementia. “Radioactive damage” is certainly a vivid description of the impact of caring for someone living with a degenerative illness, but the perception that someone in the last stages of dementia may be “dead” feels wrong when I think of my parents. How are you to know what is happening in someone else’s brain?A great revelation for me in caring for my parents was a discovery I made through reading to them – that in some respects, their brains were unimpaired.View image in fullscreenPamela Glanville in the 1980s.Both continued to enjoy being read to until the end of their lives. They responded positively to hearing stories, poems and novels throughout their illnesses. They retained their ability to comprehend and follow a story, as well as their knowledge of the meaning of obscure words. On one memorable occasion, when I was reading my father a series of memoirs by Arthur Koestler, one of his favourite writers, he noticed that I wasn’t reading them chronologically. I hadn’t even realised.However, neither of them were able to communicate that they wanted me to read to them. I only discovered this by accident. My father would spend all day sitting silently in a chair, unable to move without assistance or do anything without the help of his devoted, professional care worker, Molly. To a casual visitor, he would appear to be “dead” to the world, apparently vacant. But he wasn’t – it was simply that, as I observed, Parkinson’s and dementia had robbed him of the ability to initiate a conversation or express a desire. There appears to be some kind of motor in the brain that enables us to connect with the outside world, which his illness had destroyed. It was only when the family and his care worker made the effort to engage with him, asking questions, encouraging him to communicate, that he would begin to be able to connect. And reading to him was one of the key ways that enabled us to do that. It was a bridge to the world that revealed some of his sophisticated cognitive function was entirely unaffected by dementia.View image in fullscreenBrian Glanville in the 1970sI observed exactly the same process with my mother. There was a moment when she appeared to no longer be able to follow a story towards the end of her life. Then I began reading her Doris Lessing’s delightful memoir about cats and once again my mother, a great lover of cats herself, was fully engaged.As a result, I have learned that one must never assume that because someone with a degenerative illness is silent or uncommunicative that means they are unable to understand what is going on around them or are incapable of engaging. One has to make the effort to see if there is some way of making a connection.There is evidence that my experience is not an isolated incident. Case studies from the charity The Reader’sreading groupsshow that reading aloud can have a dramatic effect on people living with dementia, triggering fluency and communication in response to a story or poem.In an evaluation of The Reader’s work, Philip Davis at the University of Liverpool concluded that reading aloud to people with dementia produced a significant reduction in the severity of their symptoms and contributed to wellbeing.I am, of course, aware that there may be a point, with the devastating degeneration of Alzheimer’s for example, where this kind of connection becomes impossible. For me, “death”, for certain, only comes when someone physically ceases to function. People with dementia need others to advocate for them – and that includes opposing assisted dying. There are, it seems, still pleasures and connections to be made, even as the world dims all around.Jo Glanville is a journalist and radio producer.

The personal finance guru Martin Lewis told Reeves recently:“I do not think this is a moral thing for you to do.”Students owe nearly £500m of ‘hidden debts’ to UK universities, figures revealRead moreAfter the threshold freeze, the latestannual report on education spendingin England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) forecast that for the 2022-23 intake, for example, “the long-run cost of issuing loans … will be negative, with graduates repaying more than they borrowed”.Once direct grants from the government to universities were included, the thinktank said, taxpayers would have funded approximately 3% of the cost of higher education for these post-Covid students, who would have to bear the other 97% themselves.That is a very long way indeed from Reeves’s reasonable argument that non-graduates should not have to “bear all the cost” of their neighbours’ higher education.When Labour introduced tuition fees and the Tory-Lib Dem coalition later tripled them, public debate focused on the idea of graduates making a financial contribution.Somewhere along the way, that seems to have morphed into graduates meeting almost all of the cost themselves, a quiet abandonment of the idea that having an educated workforce might have wider social and economic benefits.Once students reach the earnings threshold, set at £29,385 from April, Plan 2 graduates pay 9% of any additional salary each month towards their loan, while the amount they owe may continue to rise, due to hefty interest rates.This amounts to a graduate tax in all but name, continuing for up to 30 years for those whonever earn enough to get ahead of the accruing interest.Treasury-brain types confronted with complaints about high interest rates tend to argue that the value of the loan barely matters, because what’s left of it will be written off anyway after 30 years if not repaid (or for the post-2023 cohort, 40 years, meaning more of them will ultimately end up repaying in full).For that reason, Lewis advises most Plan 2 graduatesnot to bother paying off chunks of their loan upfront, because repayments will remain at 9% regardless – and unless their earnings are set to rocket, they’ll most likely not pay it all off anyway.But that leaves many with no flexibility or control over how and when their loan is repaid, which feels unfair.And as experts including Dan Neidle, of the consultancyTaxPolicy Associates, have pointed out, it contributes to very high marginal tax rates, creating terrible incentives for graduates to take the next step up the career ladder.Labour to bring back maintenance grants for students on ‘priority’ coursesRead moreLabour’s defenders can rightly point out that the government did not design the student loan treadmill, and inherited a higher education system whose funding model is bust.It has allowed more investment into the sector by letting tuition fees rise with inflation, and will reintroduce maintenance loans for lower-income students.But freezing the repayment threshold will make a bad situation worse, for a cohort who emerged from university to face a tricky labour market and an all but insurmountable housing ladder.If they are lucky enough to earn more in the years ahead, they will also be dragged into the higher tax bands sooner than would otherwise have been the case, because of Reeves’s main revenue-raising move in November:the income tax threshold freeze.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, for all its many faults, instinctively understood the need to enthuse the youngish, educated supporters who remain a key constituency for the party.The pledge to scrap tuition fees was one aspect of that – and one which Keir Starmer adopted as part of his continuity Corbyn leadership campaign in 2019, beforebacking away from it four years later.Realism in the face of the UK’s tough fiscal position was part of Starmer’s brand, as he and Reeves battled to regain their party’s economic credibility, and the £11bn-a-year cost of nixing tuition fees could be spent more progressively.But that need not have precluded easing the burden on graduates who feel they are getting a raw deal.It is not immediately obvious what Labour’s offer is for this group, apart from the promise not to drive the economy off a cliff, alongside the bare fact of not being Nigel Farage.There is plenty to celebrate in Labour’s green agenda, for example – but Ed Miliband’s clean energy drive has been repackaged as saving a few quid on household bills, dialling down the emphasis on tackling the climate emergency. And the party’s harsh rhetoric on migration is not likely to have enthused leftish graduates. Neither is the slashing of overseas aid.But it may become clear all too soon that neglecting this group – or targeting them, as with the loan threshold freeze – has costs. As theelections expert Rob Ford has pointed out, the Denton and Gorton constituency where this month’s parliamentary byelection will be fought, has more than its fair share of young voters and graduates, and Zack Polanski’s Greens fancy their chances.Explore more on these topicsStudent financeEconomics viewpointHigher educationStudentsBorrowing & debtRachel ReevesBudgetBudget 2025commentShareReuse this content"

It clearly had nothing to do with how we played that evening – we lost badly. This joy was about classrooms, routines, teachers and the quiet order that schools bring back into families’ lives.For us, it also meant something else entirely: my youngest, Naveed, is starting school for the first time.Over the past few days, we’ve been wandering through shopping centres and uniform shops, trying to dress and equip him for what feels, in his mind at least, like a major mission. Judging by his choices – bold backpacks, superhero-themed drink bottles – I suspect he believes some special powers might be required. Watching him prepare has been tender and amusing in equal measure.Young, lost and unemployed, I misread all the signs without realising the value in mistakes | Sofie LagunaRead moreIn the midst of all this, I’ve noticed something quietly beautiful. Whenever I take Naveed shopping with me – whether to big bookstores or op shops – he drifts instinctively towards children’s books. He already has a tiny collection at home, which he reads aloud to his favourite teddy, Mr Lion, whenever there’s nothing interesting on television and the older siblings are glued to their screens. There’s something grounding about seeing him like that: cross-legged, serious, absorbed.Watching him step towards this small but enormous threshold has stirred a question I’ve been carrying for years: how much of curiosity is innate, and how much is shaped – patiently, deliberately – by those who raise us?When I was a child, we were refugees in Pakistan. Material comfort was absent. Books were scarce. Stability even more so. And yet, it was there that my elder brother developed an extraordinary love for reading and writing. He read anything he could get his hands on – old newspapers, battered textbooks, scraps passed between families. This was the 1990s, before screens and easy internet access. His handwriting – meticulous, elegant – bordered on calligraphy.During the day, he worked long hours in a factory. In the evenings, he read, wrote and listened to music on an old Japanese cassette player, as if words and sound could hold the world together. That love didn’t fade with time. It sharpened. Years later, it would lead him to become a prolific writer in Afghanistan, shaping powerful stories under conditions of censorship, threat and political collapse.Looking back, it’s tempting to romanticise his trajectory: the gifted child who flourished against the odds. But that story has always unsettled me. Because if curiosity simply blooms under hardship, why doesn’t it do so for everyone?Now, my own children are growing up in materially comfortable Melbourne. Their shelves are full. Libraries are a weekend habit. Schools are safe, resourced, predictable. These are, we’re told, the ideal conditions for cultivating young minds.And yet, curiosity in our household is anything but uniform.One child devours books and asks questions that stretch late into bedtime. Another is thoughtful but resists reading, preferring movement, conversation, observation. A third drifts in and out of interest – deeply absorbed one moment, completely indifferent the next. The fourth was once a class topper and now seems far more invested in games and anime than schoolwork. Same household, yet entirely different relationships with learning.It is stated explicitly and implicitly that good parenting produces curious children. That reading every night, choosing the right school, limiting screens and modelling intellectual engagement will yield predictable outcomes. But curiosity doesn’t operate on a neat input-output system. Still, parental encouragement matters. I believe this deeply. Early, sustained, belief-driven support can be decisive – especially for children navigating marginalisation or instability. Someone must notice the spark and protect it long enough for it to grow.Sure, people tell you about sleepless nights. But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group? | Sean SzepsRead moreYears later, I finally asked my brother what drew him so fiercely to reading and writing when no one around him seemed to care. He told me it was our late father. Even before I was born, Dad encouraged him to read and write – quietly, consistently, without expectation. That habit stayed. Those small acts of faith mattered.I’m sure my father encouraged all of us. And yet, some children arrive in the world with an appetite for ideas that feels almost bodily. They engage with the world differently.In his own way, Naveed feels different too. I love how he communicates – how he never walks away from a conversation halfway through. Even when he doesn’t like the answer, he’ll pause and say, “Ah, alright”, or “Leave it – don’t trick me”, before calmly changing the topic. There’s attentiveness there. Presence.As Naveed steps into his first classroom, I wonder what version of curiosity theAustralian educationsystem will recognise in him. I wonder how he will navigate his own path – and how much I must nurture and how much I must learn to let go.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionAustralian educationcommentShareReuse this content"

The time to be alarmed is nowSun 1 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 09.41 ESTShareKeir Starmer’s tentative pivot to the Dragon Throne has played well in Beijing, though not in Trumpland. That’s partly because, like other needy western leaders, Britain’s prime minister did not dwell on awkward subjects such as human rights abuses, theJimmy Lai travesty, spying and Taiwan. But intalks with President Xi Jinping, one vital issue was avoided altogether and should not have been: China’s dangerous, unexplained, secretive and rapid buildup of nuclear weapons.More than the climate crisis, global hunger, Kaiser Trump’s Prussian militarism and the ever prevalent threat of pandemic disease, the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the most immediate, existential threat to humanity. Last week, the Doomsday Clock advanced to 85 seconds to midnight – closer to Armageddon than ever before. “Nuclear and other global risks are escalating fast and in unprecedented ways,” warned the clock-watchers, via theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists.Nuclear disarmament diplomacy is at a standstill globally. Consensus on collective future action is again expected to eludeApril’s non-proliferation treaty (NPT) reviewconference in New York. On Thursday,New Start, the last remaining arms control treaty limiting US and Russian strategic nuclear forces, will expire. Meanwhile, a scary international nuclear arms race is raging unchecked, as detailed in the 2025 report of theStockholm International Peace Research Institute(Sipri).Nearly all the nine nuclear-armed states – the US, Russia, China, France, UK, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel – are pursuing “intensive nuclear modernisation programmes”, Sipri reported, including new weapons such as hypersonic missiles and “useable” low-yield tactical nukes. Nuclear testing may soon resume. “Of the total global inventory of an estimated 12,241 warheads in January 2025, about 9,614 were in military stockpiles for potential use,”Sipri said. Of these, the US and Russia possess about 90%.With an estimated 600 warheads, China lags behind – but it’scatching up quickly. “China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country’s, by about 100 new warheads a year since 2023 … [It] could potentially have at least as many ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] as either Russia or the US by the turn of the decade,” Sipri calculated. Beijing offers no explanation or rationale for this dramatic surge – and rejects multilateral arms control talks.An official white paper,published by China in November, restated its position that countries with the largest nuclear arsenals must make the first move, by unilaterally making “drastic and substantive reductions”. Until then, it said, China would keep its own nuclear capabilities “at the minimum level required for national security”. The paper conveniently omitted to say what that level is.China’s criticism that the US and others ignore their NPT commitment to pursue disarmament is accurate, albeit hypocritical. It is on stronger ground when voicing objections to Donald Trump’s proposed multilayered, Greenland-related Golden Dome missile shield that could,if it ever materialises, dangerously upset the balance of terror.Despite its current advantages, the US is worried. The Pentagonwarned in Decemberthat “China’s historic military buildup has made the US homeland increasingly vulnerable”. It highlighted what it called a more attack-ready, “hair-trigger” nuclear posture, and claimed about 100 ICBMs were recently installed in silos in northern China. It also said Beijing was testing its ability “to strike US forces in the Pacific”, potentially crippling future US military assistance to Taiwan. “China expects to be able to fight and win a war on Taiwan by the end of 2027,”the Pentagon said.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Xi Jinping before their bilateral meeting in Beijing, 29 January 2026.Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersWhat is Xi up to? China’s nuclear weapons drive could be just a question of status. Maybe Xi simply wants to match (or surpass) the US and Russia. Maybe he is genuinely fearful of being attacked.He told Starmerthat “rampant” powers, meaning Trump, were following “the law of the jungle”. Or maybe, considering his legacy, Xi believes nuclear muscle-flexing (or worse) could help him conquer Taiwan and fulfil his ambition to make China the leading superpower.Xi has acquired emperor-like sway after 13 years at the top. But he is also an insecure, fallible and unimaginative politician not immune to global trends and pressures. On the one hand, he sees Trump’s US upgrading nuclear weapons, trashing key arms control pacts such as the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, andattacking non-nuclear Iran and Venezuelaon a whim. On the other hand, he sees an ally and fellow dictator, Russia’s Vladimir Putin,threatening nuclear war with the westas he tries to illegally seize Ukraine. It must be tempting to follow that example.Morality, military might and a sense of mischief: key takeaways from Trump’s New York Times interviewRead moreDisturbing, too, is the suspicion that, despite appearances, Xi may not be wholly in control of China’s armed forces. His sensationalsacking last weekof Gen Zhang Youxia, second only to himself in the military hierarchy, remains a mystery. Zhang, a grizzled veteran, is supposedly accused of disloyalty to his less war-experienced boss – and of leaking nuclear secrets to the US.Is it possible the two men disagreed over Xi’s bullishly confrontational nuclear and Taiwan policies? Xi previously purged rocket force commanders, but is still apparently struggling to pull the generals into line. In a cold war echo, Dr Strangelove’s disconcerting question recurs: whose finger on the button?Whatever China’s president is thinking, these are alarming times for anyone worried about global thermonuclear war – which should be everyone. Starmer’s talks with Xi reportedly included Chinese threats to UK national security. What bigger threat is there than proliferating nuclear weapons? Yet as far as is known, hedid not raise the issue.Starmer’s silence is unsurprising. Under his leadership the UK, too, isexpanding its nuclear strike force, by buying US F-35A nuclear-capable fighter jets. And it is reportedly allowing the US to store nuclear bombs at RAF Lakenheath for the first time in 20 years. Britain is in no position to criticise. On the contrary, its unspoken message to Xi is stark: bombs away!Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionChinaDonald TrumpXi JinpingVladimir PutinKeir StarmerDefence policycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s part of a sad culture of suppressing the young that forgets we were all loud and carefree onceSun 1 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 12.54 ESTShareAs a disapproving, noise-sensitive harpy who once managed to communicate “use headphones” to an Italian tween on a train despite us not sharing a common language, I ought to be the ideal candidate for the French rail operator SNCF’s new “Optimum”, no-kids-allowed carriages. The service was promoted last month as a civilised space in which executives could conduct important business in cosseted peace, unmolested by sticky fingers or La Pat’ Patrouille (Paw Patrol) blaring from an iPad.Actually, though, I hate it – and a heartening number of other people seem to be hating it, too. The initiative sparkedwidespread indignation in France(the high commissioner for children, Sarah El Haïry, called it“shocking”) and beyond, leading SNCF to partly backtrack, changing the original “children are not allowed” wording to say the space is only inaccessible to under-12s.I’m surprised SNCF thought this would fly, given France has been at the forefront of pushing backagainst the trend for adults-only spaces(last year, legislators startedconsidering measures to outlaw them). However, a SNCF spokesperson said the company has beenresisting pressurefrom rail users to create kid-free carriages for years. Which is depressing, but not surprising – it’s indicative of our increasing intolerance towards kids, and tendency to try to exclude young people from, well, life.Exploring “children’s gradual disappearance from the public realm,” as one academic put it,the Atlanticrecently reported that teenagers are also being excluded from their traditional hangouts, withshopping malls and amusement parksbanning gangs of them, fearing such outrages as “horseplay, shouting, racing and other youthful actions” (cited byone Michigan mall to justify its policy). Cities such as Chicago and Washington have introducedyouth curfewsin some areas andone fast food outleteven requires under-18s to have a chaperone of 21 years or older. Things are similarly teen-unfriendly in the UK: last year, the Scottish nonprofit,A Place in Childhood, highlighted the lack of “safe, welcoming and unstructured space” for teenagers, who feel excluded from their own communities; “their play is too often policed, designed out, or simply ignored”. Then, having closed off other options, we complain they spend too much time alone on their phones.Despite my innate crankiness, I believe none of us is entitled to a silent and frictionless passage through the world, and especially not on public transport or in other public spaces – the clue is in the name. For sure (as Emmanuel Macron would say), no one particularly relishes a long-haul flight next to a colicky newborn or wriggly, sticky toddler (and that includes their caregivers) – but that thing where parents apologetically hand out bags of sweets and earplugs tofellow travellers on flightslike they are, in fact, the giant babies who need placating, makes me rage.There’s an expression I often whisper to myself on trains, for example when a man who can’t sit quietly with his own thoughts for an hour calls a colleague to bore on about a spreadsheet. It goes: “Inconvenience is the price of community.” It also applies here: we live in society and that’s a beautiful thing (albeit full of people doing stuff we would rather they wouldn’t), and we need one another. We especially need kids – at a time of declining birthrates (deaths have just outstripped birthsin France), we’ll be depending on declining numbers of them in our dotage. We should be cherishing children, not making parents worry about going out with their babies or chasing teenagers back to their bedrooms (after all, we might need them to rescue us off a mountain one day, like those utterly unprepared grownupsrescued by two teenage lads in the Lake Districtin January).I’m not suggesting anyone’s heart will be softened, or opened to the radical possibilities of community, by the laughter of a child on a delayed CrossCountry train from Cheltenham to Cardiff. It’s more likely you’ll get kicked in the back repeatedly, be exposed to a cacophony of TikToks or get caught by a flying energy drink. But we can suck it up. Because while Whitney Houston was right, children are our future, they’re also our past – we were all loud, annoying, incontinent and inconsiderate once. Lots of adults in the LNER “Quieter” coaches still are.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionRail transport (World news)Rail transport (UK news)commentShareReuse this content"

Now tactics are shifting to nonviolent civil disobedienceSun 1 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTShareOn 24 January, Alex Pretti waskilledby federal agents while he was helping another civilian inMinneapoliswho had been knocked to the ground – just weeks after an ICE agent killedRenee Good. In response to this second killing of a Minnesotan,demonstrations spreadacross the United States to protest the Trump administration and its ultra-violent immigration enforcement tactics.Minneapolis has been in a state of sustained protest. Its general strike on 23 Januarymobilizedtens of thousands of Minnesotans to participate in an economic blackout and march in the streets. Solidarity protests, strikes and marches also took place across the country,includingtheFree America Walkout, which involved more than 900 local actions across all 50 states on the anniversary ofDonald Trump’s second inauguration.As part of along-term projectstudying protest in America, which included documenting the resistance to the first Trump administration in my bookAmerican Resistance,I have been studying Resistance 2.0. The project aims to understand who is participating, what is motivating people to join this second wave of resistance, and the tactics being used by activists to protest the secondTrump administrationand its policies.Digested week: ICE’s performance is intimidating and deadly, but also farcical | Emma BrockesRead moreResistance to the first Trump administration was laser-focused on converting outrage-motivated resistance in the streets into action at the ballot box. Throughout those four years, activists focused most of their efforts onbringing about social changethrough formal political tactics such as lobbying, legally permitted rallies, and voting. Evidence shows that it worked: the 2018 midterm electionreturneda Democratic majority to the House of Representatives and then Joe Biden was elected the 46th president of the US in the 2020 election, which had thehighest turnoutin over a century.But this time it is different.During the first year of the second Trump administration, weonce againsawsome of the largestprotests in US history (though the protests were much moregeographically distributedthan during the first Trump administration). Although large-scale and legally permitted demonstrations continue to be scheduled, Resistance 2.0 has become more confrontational. Acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – such as blocking streets; following, recording and observing federal agents; and participating in generalstrikesandwalkouts– have become much more common. And this is only the beginning.Working with the organizers of the Free America Walkout, which involved participantswalking out ofwork, school and commerce for two hours during the afternoon of 20 January, my team and I surveyed 7,452 people who had signed up to participate from across the US – about 15% of all the registered participants. Our data provide clear evidence that Resistance 2.0 will continue to get more confrontational.An overwhelming majority of respondents to our survey (99%) reported that they support organizations engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience, including sit-ins and blockades. Moreover, when we asked participants about the degree to which they support the movement taking more confrontational actions against theTrump administrationand its policies, and if they personally would be willing to join such actions, the results were unequivocal: 79% agreed that they “support social movements taking more confrontational action against the Trump administration” and 65% agreed that they “would participate in more confrontational action against the Trump administration if [they] had the opportunity”.While criticism of the shift to more confrontational – but nonviolent – actions comes from across the political spectrum, including from mainstream Democrats, the expansion of what social movements scholars call the “repertoire of contention” is consistent with numerous successful social movements in US history.In the early 1900s, for example, women involved in the American movement for suffrage started expanding their tactics as they realized that “Sometimes, being polite just doesn’t work.” The movement turned to occupying public spaces and even burning an effigy of then president Woodrow Wilson before women in the US finallyearnedthe right to vote in 1920.Similarly, activists from the civil rights movement shifted their strategy after realizing that they did not have the necessary access to power to make change through legal and political systems in the US. Instead, they employed more disruptive tactics, including staging sit-ins and coordinating non-permitted marches. Thanks in part to the diversity of tactics employed and groups involved, the Civil Rights Act was signed into law in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act became law in 1965.While civil rights movement leaders trained activists in nonviolent civil disobedience, they were acutely aware that even nonviolent civil disobedience was likely to face a violent response from law enforcement and counter-movements. However, rather than cowering in fear, civil rights activists leaned into the violence against them, intentionally organizing actions in segregated areas that were likely to provoke a brutal response. As a result, many activists got arrested andfilled the jails, andothers were murdered.Minneapolis is in a state of chaos. Racist governance is to blame | Jamil SmithRead moreIn recent weeks, we have seen similar patterns of violence against peaceful protesters in Minneapolis. An unintended side effect of these horrible acts of violence is that they generate substantial public attention and support for protestors, which can be auseful tool for expanding the movement. Tragic events present opportunities for the broader resistance to grow and evolve.What’s giving me hope nowThe fact that Resistance 2.0 is expanding its tactics gives me hope. Americans are finding their voices and their power to push back against burgeoning autocracy. We are also seeing activists building solidarity with friends and neighbors along the way. The expansion of tactics and evolution of thinking about how citizens can push back against government violence and anti-democratic suppression is a step in the right direction. It is a sign that the people are mobilizing and working together to save America.This moment of resistance to the Trump regime opens up a window of opportunity for social change. Achieving that change will require every one of us participating in actions for justice and equity that may take us out of our comfort zone and stretch us in ways that help preserve democracy.As unfair as it may seem, neither a charismatic leader nor theDemocraticparty is ready to be the change we need; we are going to have to work together to save ourselves.Dana R Fisher is a professor in the School of International Service at American University and a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Seen from the other end of the telescope, it looked like themouse of all deals, with just €4bn (£3.5bn) in tariff reductions – a rounding error in a €180bn trading relationship. But that misses the point: this is about economic heavyweights resetting the terms of their cooperation because of Donald Trump’s use of tariffs as a tool ofeconomic and political compulsion.Last week marked a turning point. In upgrading ties withVietnamin the wake of its India deal, Europe is no longer trying to lock Asian partners into fixed industrial roles. The EU wants Hanoi to move intohi-tech production. That shift will probably displace Vietnam’s labour-intensive manufacturing elsewhere. India is an obvious beneficiary, able to absorb that demand.Delhi says it will give the EU unprecedented access in politically sensitive areas, most notablyvehicle imports, whilequotasandphase-insprotect India’s domestic strategy. Europe sees goods exports to Indiadouble by 2032. The EU, in return, opens its market widely to Indian exports, especiallytextiles, without making any onerous demands. Notably the deal helps Indian firmsadopt and deployadvanced European technologies.The EU deepens trade while letting both sides keep their geopolitical room to manoeuvre. For India, that means Europe turning a blind eye to continued Indian purchases of Russian oil –keeping alive a pragmatismborn of the energy shock after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For Vietnam, Europe doesn’t ask it to choose sides over its trading relationship with Beijing. Contrast this with the US under Mr Trump: India has been threatened with tariffs because it dared to retain itshistorical links to Russia; Vietnam with“reciprocal” levies and transhipment crackdownsbecause of its Chinese links. The US treats trade as a weapon: signalling dominance but corroding trust. On the other hand the EU treats trade as a way to share growth without demanding submission. Europe, importantly, can no longer coerce partners; but it also knows coercion backfires.What Brussels seems to be building is trade as architecture: a way of organising development paths across Asia, encouraging Vietnam to move up the value chain, allowing India to scale manufacturing and anchoring both to Europe without demanding fealty. Set beside the EU’s deals with India and Vietnam, Britain’s tentative rapprochement with China looks far more shallow. The newUK-China relationshipis not nothing but it is hardly transformative compared with the EU’s Asian deals.The bloc’s moves echo the Canadian prime ministerMark Carney’s argumentthat middle powers can build resilience through interdependence without surrendering autonomy. As the economistHa-Joon Changhas pointed out, rich countries grew through protection, strategic trade and state support; only to later insist that poorer countries prosper through openness alone. This was the ladder the wealthy world climbed and then kicked away.The EU’s trade shift matters because it acknowledges that history. For decades, EU trade in Asia was built aroundone-way accessand managed dependency. By encouraging industrial upgrading in Vietnam and toleratingselective protectionin India, Europe is no longer freezing late developers into low-value roles. This is not generosity. It is realism. Europe still supplies capital goods, standards and demand. But development requires policy space – and arrangements that deny it have failed.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionTrade policyEuropeIndiaVietnamSouth and central AsiaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

For years, climate and nature experts have struggled to get across the message that species extinctions, dead rivers and deforestation are an existential threat to people as well as animals and plants. AsGeorge Monbiotwrote last week, the publication of a government report thought to have beenauthored by intelligence chiefs, about the threats to the UK’s national security from biodiversity collapse, should be viewed as a step forward. The risks have become too extreme to be ignored.The document is a national security assessment, not a scientific report. The data that it relies on comes from other sources. But the warnings that it contains about the UK’s heavy dependence on food and fertiliser imports, and the probable consequences of nature depletion, must be heeded. Originally due to be published in the autumn, the review appears to have had some sections removed. An earlier version is reported to have included warnings about the risks of “eco-terrorism” and thegrowing likelihood of warbetween China, India and Pakistan due to competition over a shrinking water supply from the Himalayas.The climate secretary, Ed Miliband, is one of the cabinet’s most experienced politicians. On carbon emissions targets, Labour has largely stuck to its guns and not allowed the siren voices of the populist right to undermine the UK’sgreen transition. By contrast, Kemi Badenoch’spledge to repeal the Climate Change Actwas arguably her most reckless decision since becoming Tory leader. But under this government, as under previous ones, the rest of the environment agenda is much lower-profile – with the arguable exception of the sewage crisis and failing water companies. The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, has only been in her first cabinet job for five months.The framing of nature loss as a national security issue should help to focus minds across government.Foodand energy security are among areas where policy action is most urgently needed. But in our era of climate breakdown, no area of human activity is insulated.In an interconnected world, adaptation and resilience strategies must also be outward-facing. This means recognising that risks are not evenly or justly distributed geographically, and accepting responsibility for helping thepeople and places that face the most acute threats. This imperative is all the stronger when looking at countries, including former British colonies, that are far poorer than the UK and for whom it is far harder to prepare and adapt.Thereportcites large-scale tree-planting in Malawi as proof that nature restoration schemes can be effective. In Brazil, the environment minister, Marina Silva, has been a forceful advocate forprotection of the Amazon. But overall, global progress on nature restoration is nowhere near where it needs to be, and the threat of ecosystem collapse in the world’s rainforests remains acute.The2022 Kunming-Montreal biodiversity pactwas supposed to set a global process in train, running in parallel with the Cop climate talks. Due to the wrecking tactics of Donald Trump and others, the UN’s efforts in both areas are in an alarmingly weak state. But as this report spells out, nature loss cannot be ignored any more safely than global heating can. Its message – that “nature is a foundation of national security” – must be heard.Explore more on these topicsBiodiversityOpinionConservationTrees and forestsLabourEd MilibandGreen economyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

First of all, because of spiralling poverty, girls are increasingly married off from the age of 12 or lower for the simple reason that their father receives a dowry in what amounts to a financial transaction: the younger the girl, the higher the sum her father receives.Second, and this is even more important, theTalibanhave forbidden any form of study or work for girls and women after at best paltry primary schooling. This means universities and medical schools only train men. So after the demise of the present generation of female doctors, midwives, surgeons and nurses who are still permitted to work, women will receive no medical aid whatsoever, especially as they are not allowed to consult male practitioners.Even more than a gender apartheid, we are witnessing the rise of a truly genocidal policy against women, unique in its kind.

Millions of people’s lives have been knowingly worsened by the state. To compound this, countless shared neighbourhood spaces have been closed or sold off, meaning there is less opportunity for community togetherness just when it is most needed.The UK has the political and financial resources to create a society full of opportunity and security. Instead, successive governments have allowed poverty to continue and ultra-individualism to become normalised.You highlight the ideological dimension of this. There is also a fundamental ignorance behind it. Our politics is dominated by people who have never lived on a low income and know little of what such a life involves. There are remarkably few ways for people to truly shape government decisions that will determine their own lives.At regional and city levels, poverty truth commissions have led to new understandings within some councils and public bodies. Localised participation projects have managed to remove barriers, leading to people being heard as never before. But as long as this work exists only on small scales, progress will be inadequate.The UK must reinvest in our social security system, but it must also find new ways to harness the wisdom of people who access that system. If we can do that, social security, and indeed politics as a whole, can become constructive rather than antagonistic.Liam PurcellCEO, Church Action on PovertyYou report on the Joseph Rowntree Foundation study that shows how poverty is growing ever deeper, with increasing numbers of people unable to meet basic needs, however wisely they spend their money (Record number of people in UK live in ‘very deep poverty’, analysis shows, 27 January). This explains why the food banks and other agencies inEast Kentare experiencing a relentless rise in demand from destitute families.In April, the removal of the two-child benefits cap, the expansion of free school meals and the uprating of universal credit and minimum wage at about one-and-a-half times inflation will all kick in, together with the new Crisis and Resilience Fund and the first round of substantial increased support for councils directed at areas of most need. This will lift about a 10th of the children below the poverty line in Thanet, Dover and Canterbury above it and help many others. It will be the biggest single improvement since Gordon Brown, as chancellor, implemented a series of policies aimed at reducing poverty in 2000-05.Much more needs to be done, but let’s hope that the government continues in the right direction.Prof Peter Taylor-GoobyDirector, East Kent poverty studyDebates about welfare and defence are often framed as a choice between “guns and butter”. That misses something more basic: national resilience depends on whether people have enough stability to endure shock.In the UK, millions are already living in survival mode. Poverty, food bank dependence and chronic insecurity are not marginal problems. They indicate a society that has been quietly spending its resilience. This is not an argument against defence spending. It is a warning that a country which normalises precarity in peacetime weakens its capacity to respond to a crisis in wartime.Dr Simon NiederChesterfield, DerbyshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This inaction has contributed to a culture of impunity that the Israeli government has used to accelerate itsde factoannexation of the West Bank.Its instruments are administrative changes, continuous settlement expansion and growth, intensifying violence by Israeli troops and settler militia, the localised system of road closures, house demolitions, tightening access to water and electricity, deepening legal segregation and an unequal system of governance.C of E bishops criticise UK inaction over Israel’s ‘West Bank de facto annexation’Read moreWhile world leaders met in Davos to debate futuristic plans for the reconstruction of Gaza, which are largely disconnected from reality, we visited and listened to Palestinian Christian communities across theWest Bankon their lived experience. Once more, we have heard from families living in fear and torment – an unending nightmare where they are denied even minimal dignity. The violence has robbed them of the ability to earn a living and provide for their families.Terrorised to the point of fearing for their lives, there is no one to protect them. Faced with such abandonment, and denied any agency as to their future, many now feel they have no choice but to leave or to die standing. This seems to be the Israeli government’s intentional strategy.The international community must uphold its obligations under international law to protect Palestinians. The only way is to uphold the ICJ advisory opinion. Having formally recognised the state ofPalestine, the British government must publish its response and take all necessary measures “not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”, as the court stipulated.The situation in the West Bank is a tragedy foretold.

What seemed at the break as though it was going to be an easy away win unexpectedly became a draw and, as a result, both ends of the table looked quite different at the final whistle to how it appeared they were going to look at half-time.It was a case of multiple immutable but incompatible laws running into each other. On the one hand, Tottenham are terrible and have picked up only 10 points at home this season. But on the other, City have developed a habit of needlessly squandering points and somehow always do worse than expected against Tottenham. The consequence was a game that simultaneously made very little sense but at the same time was predictable, at least in the way it remained true to those fundamental principles.Solanke dents Manchester City’s title hopes with stirring comeback for SpursRead moreThis fitted a concerning pattern for Manchester City. Althoughthey beat Leedsand Fulhamthey conceded five goals in total in the second half of those two games. Level at half-time at Manchester United, they lost 2-0. Leading at half-time against Brighton and Chelsea, they conceded in the second half to draw 1-1. There has been a clear trend in recent months of City conceding important goals after half-time. Seven points have been lost through the concession of second-half goals this year alone; if they had those seven points, City would be a point clear at the top of the table.But Spurs this weekend will also have been thinking about half-times and how different things could look. At half-time at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening, West Ham led Chelsea 2-0; at half-time here, Spurs trailed 2-0. Had those results remained like that, Spurs would have been only five points above the drop zone and it would have been increasingly difficult to maintain the belief that they are not engaged in a relegation battle. As it is,after Chelsea’s comebackand Solanke’s two goals, the gap is nine and it feels a lot less like Spurs are sleepwalking into a dogfight.It wasn’t just that City led at half-time; it was that Spurs had been shambolic. They looked a team without resistance, without a clue. If the booing at half-time was relatively restrained, it can only have been because so many fans were so numbed by what they had seen. And, being fair, perhaps also because there was a recognition that it’s not really fair to judge Spurs when they’re without 11 injured players.From Tottenham’s point of view, the opening goal was inexcusably limp. Yves Bissouma was dispossessed on halfway by Bernardo Silva and then Rayan Cherki, having been released by Erling Haaland, was given an extraordinary amount of time and space to measure his shot across Guglielmo Vicario and into the bottom corner. Frank’s fury was obvious as he slammed an environmentally sustainable water carton to the ground (he may have been angry, but Frank remains responsible and Danish). Whatever the issues of personnel and whatever problems Frank has had, this was just poor play by two players who should be better.Or maybe they shouldn’t be. After all, Radu Dragusin, recently recovered from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, had played only seven minutes this season and hadn’t started a game for 371 days. He had a nightmare first half, at one point sliding past Rayan Cherki as he chopped inside, like a passing bobsledder with only a vague interest in the game, but perhaps that’s not unreasonable for a player who has played so little over the past year. Bissouma, similarly, had not played for the club this season before coming off the bench at half-time in the home defeat against West Ham a fortnight ago.View image in fullscreenTottenham started horribly, when Rayan Cherki scored early.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCity’s second was almost as facile, as Dragusin’s long pass from near his byline was intercepted and Cristian Romero was somehow left with two to deal with. Silva slid it square and Antoine Semenyo finished a straightforward chance. It was all extremely easy. The sense was almost of an early-round Cup tie, the bigger side holding the plucky underdogs at arm’s length and picking them off as and when.When Romero did not reemerge for the second half, the assumption was that it would just get worse for Spurs. But the assumption was wrong. It wasn’t only Dominic Solanke’s involvement in the two goals – although that did serve as a clear reminder of what Spurs have been missing in his absence for much of this season. Xavi Simons has looked increasingly dangerous over the past few weeks, Dragusin settled and João Palhinha emerged as a dominant figure. And City, again, buckled, only two fine saves from Gianluigi Donnarumma preserving a point for them.In the end, although City’s expected goals was more than double their own, Tottenham will probably feel the draw was the least they deserved. What does it mean? Certainly no one at Spurs could look at that first half and feel much in the way of positivity. The injury list, similarly, can inspire only dread. But there was at least fight and that hasn’t always been true in the recent past.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurManchester CityPremier LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

He played a mature match against Djokovic, the fourth seed, maintaining his composure after a blistering opening set from the Serbian towin in four sets. Alcaraz is also the youngest man in the open era to win seven grand slam titles.Djokovic tries his best in time-warp final but cannot stop compelling declineRead moreThis was a historic match on both sides of the net. Djokovic, who reached the final after a spectacularfive-set win over Jannik Sinner, the second seed and two-time defending champion, had been attempting to become the oldest grand slam champion in the open era.“The results are a testament to his already stellar career,” said Djokovic. “I can’t think of any other superlatives about him. He deserves every bit of the praise that he gets from his peers, but also the whole tennis community. He’s a very nice young man. Good values, nice family. Of course, already a legendary tennis player that made already a huge mark in the history books of tennis with only 22 years of age. It’s super impressive, no doubt about it.”This tournament was Alcaraz’s first since deciding to split with Juan Carlos Ferrero and install Samuel López, formerly Ferrero’s deputy, as his head coach. Alcaraz’s coaching decision was the source of ample speculation and criticism throughout the off-season. Alcaraz says he is glad to have silenced the doubters.“I didn’t think about those people that had doubts about it,” he said. “I came here just playing for myself, playing for my team. We all know how hard I worked in the pre-season to be ready for this tournament, and I had too many things to think about during this tournament. Just focus on my game style, focus on myself, being passionate, and that’s all I thought about during this tournament. But once I get it, I’m just happy to prove all the people were wrong.”Alcaraz has commemorated his first titles at each grand slam with a tattoo. After Sunday’s victory, he is already planning a kangaroo tattoo on one of his legs: “I’ve said it’s going to be a little kangaroo. It’s going to be in the leg, for sure. I don’t know the right, the left one. So I got to choose a good spot, but it’s going to be for sure close to the French Open or Wimbledon. I just have to choose.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Carlos AlcarazNovak DjokovicAustralian OpenAustralia sportTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The Champions League winners benefited from being mid-season with players at full fitness – in contrast toCorinthiansbeing in their pre-season and the Concacaf Champions Cup winners Gotham FC in their off-season – and from the decision to hold the tournament in London, and play the final at the Emirates Stadium. This was a competition set up for European success and Arsenal delivered. They are officially the world’s best club and they have a nice trophy to prove it. The 13-point gap, albeit with a game in hand, between them and Women’s Super League leaders Manchester City though, says otherwise.Kerolin crushes Chelsea’s WSL hopes to send Manchester City 11 points clear at topRead moreThe mood prior to kick-off was one of general bemusement at a competition Arsenal did not need in their schedule, sandwiched between critical WSL fixtures against Chelsea and City. “I think we all, and the players first, want to be competing at the highest level and they want to play games,” said the Arsenal manager, Renée Slegers, when asked about how they managed to fit these games into their season.“That’s what they train for, what they live for. What’s important is that if the schedule goes further and further in adding games that we do it in a tempo that is fair to the players and the players’ health. We are in a position where we have a really good squad with a lot of quality, but I’m also aware that not all teams have this luxury. So I think we have to be really aware of what we’re doing, how we’re growing competitions and adding competitions to the schedule, so we grow it in the right way.”The club from São Paulo offered a far sterner test thansemi-final opponents AS Far. The desire to take the title back to Brazil was evident in the talk of the fans, the manager, Lucas Piccinato, in the outrage at two unfortunate Arsenal academy players caught in a spying storm because they were spotted looking out the window at the Brazilian side as they trained at Barnet’s stadium, where Arsenal’s academy is based, and in the one million people watching on the stream of the Brazilian broadcaster CazéTV at the same time the men’s team were playing Flamengo in the Supercopa.View image in fullscreenLotte Wubben-Moy runs away in delight after restoring Arsenal’s lead in the second half.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Fifa/Getty Images“It was a big advantage playing in their home, but it is what it is,” said Piccinato. “We hope next time Arsenal will come to Brazil to play against us. I think it would be better if it was in a neutral venue.”The home team were predictably dominant on their home turf, but it was the Corinthians faithful who dominated in the stands, outnumbered but not outsung. The opening goal arrived 15 minutes in, when Corinthians’ goalkeeper Leticia parried Stina Blackstenius’s effort into the path of Olivia Smith who swung home on the half volley.Corinthians threatened on the counter but the equaliser came from a set piece, when Anneke Borbe failed to prevent a header from the 40-year-old Gabi Zanotti from crossing the line following Andressa’s corner.Quick GuideGotham grab third with 4-0 successShowGotham won the Women’s Champions Cup third-place playoff by convincingly defeating AS Far 4-0 at Arsenal Stadium. The NWSL champions took the lead through Khyah Harper, before Savannah McCaskill's first-time finish and Jaedyn Shaw's penalty put the game out of reach by half-time. A Midge Purce tap-in after the break finished off the Moroccan side.Gotham's coach, Juan Carlos Amorós, still had his thoughts on his side's 1-0 semi-final defeat by Corinthians in the aftermath. “It's a similar game in a lot of ways to the one we played four days ago,” he said. “The main difference is we were able to get the early lead that we know unsettled teams, and we were able to be more clinical in front of goal, which really allowed us to then play a bit more of a game where players can enjoy.”Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Arsenal’s second came from a less familiar source, the centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy pulling away from her marker to head in from Emily Fox’s cross from the right.Seemingly home, though not dry, they were punished again by the never-say-die Brazilian side. Katie McCabe was adjudged to have fouled Gisela Robledo deep into added time despite appearing to have got the ball before the player and, after a video assistant review, Vic Albuquerque converted from the spot to force extra time.The celebrations were wild, but short-lived; the Gunners were patient and punctured the momentum of the visiting team on the counter when Frida Maanum dispossessed Duda Sampaio and found her fellow substitute Caitlin Foord, who fired in.There was a nasty accident at the close when Borbe collided with Wubben-Moy and a Corinthians player as she smothered the ball beneath their feet. The goalkeeper left on a stretcher and was taken to hospital as a precaution.It was relief for Arsenal when the final whistle blew, Foord’s strike saving them from embarrassment in a tournament where they had a significant advantage. If this competition is to gain credibility and momentum, it needs a substantial amount of work back at the drawing board.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Champions CupArsenal WomenCorinthiansWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

However Kirsty Coventry, the IOC president, insisted that once the Games begin on Friday, their “magic and spirit” would take over.Coventry refused to comment directly on the protests in Milan against immigration and customs enforcement agents and said she hadn’t spoken to Wasserman, who has apologised for flirty emailssent to Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003when he was married, which only surfaced on Friday.Milan protesters denounce ICE unit at Winter Olympics and ‘creeping fascism’ in USRead moreHowever Coventry did accept that such distractions were far from ideal. “I think anything that is distracting from these Games is sad, right?” she said. “But we’ve learned over the many years that there’s always been something that has taken the lead up to the Games, whether it has been Zika or Covid, there has always been something.“But what is keeping my faith alive, is that when that opening ceremony happens and those athletes start competing, suddenly, the world remembers magic and the spirit that the Games have. And they get to suddenly remember what’s actually important, and they get to be inspired.”Saturday’s protest against ICE in Piazza XXV Aprile in Milan, a square named after the date of Italy’s liberation from Nazi fascism in 1945, drew hundreds of demonstrators. Milan’s mayor Giuseppe Sala has also said that ICE agents, who will accompany the US vice-president JD Vance to Friday’s ceremony, are not welcome.The appearance of Wasserman in the Epstein files, and reports that another IOC member is also in the emails, have been another distraction. “I’ve not been in contact with Casey,” added Coventry. “The focus has fully been on Milano-Cortina. In terms of IOC members, we’re obviously watching and monitoring the media, and we’re aware of a few things that have been reported just today. We need some time to look into that.”Meanwhile the Olympic Games’ executive director, Christophe Dubi, has insisted that the 11,800-capacity Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena would be ready in time despite admitting that construction was going down to the wire.“Do we still have work? Yes,” said Dubi. “Cleaning, absolutely. It’s frantic. But it’s to make it a really, really great venue. And hats off, because it started very late. So what they have pulled out in very few months is absolutely outstanding.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Harry Brook’s 12-ball 36 helped England chase down a revised target of 168 in the secondTwenty20international against Sri Lanka, securing a series victory.England had initially been set 190, but a rain break changed the equation; when Brook emerged England needed 87 from 7.5 overs. He put on an exhibition over the off side to turn the chase his team’s way. While the captain’s knock was brief, Tom Banton made his case for a starting spot at the T20 World Cup, putting aside his tough time in the field to stay the course with an excellent, unbeaten 54. He has three red-inkers in successful chases since joining the T20 middle order last summer.Sri Lanka v England: second men’s cricket T20 international – liveRead moreSam Curran finished it with two balls left, victory by six wickets, but the tension had gone a few overs before. Brook will head into the World Cup without a T20 series defeat during his reign, and with decent competition for places in that batting lineup; Ben Duckett was missing again with a bruised finger. “To get a series win in Sri Lanka is a special achievement,” said Banton. Now they’ve got two in one week.England went in unchanged fromthe series openerwhile Sri Lanka brought in Pavan Rathnayake and Dunith Wellalage, both having impressed in the one-day series. The hosts began well, just as they had done on Friday. Pathum Nissanka uppercut Curran and whipped Jofra Archer out of the ground, the umpire forced to pick out a new ball. Brook was proactive, calling for spin in the third over, but Nissanka swept Will Jacks away for six as the openers put on 56 for the first wicket.Nissanka could not go on, his footwork evading him on 34 when he dragged Archer on to the stumps. That rhythm was established; none of the batters advanced to a half-century, but a succession of cameos made for a decent total.Adil Rashid did not rip through the visitors but he did befuddle Dasun Shanaka: two tossed-up leg-breaks were followed by the googly, the Sri Lanka captain trapped leg-before. Liam Dawson contributed the key wicket of Kusal Mendis for 32, while Jacks was economical.Instead, the hosts welcomed the quicks, eight overs of seam conceding 103 runs. Jamie Overton made Rathnayake miscue the pull, but the edge flew over fine leg for six. The Surrey quick’s anger grew with Banton’s drop at short third off Rathnayake, who top-scored with a 22-ball 40.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook’s quickfire 36 helped turn the revised run chase England’s way.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APArcher, sending down his back-of-the-hand slower ball, watched two catches go down when bowling to Charith Asalanka: Phil Salt could not hold on after making up the ground at deep point, while Banton spilled at deep backward square. In the middle of all this, the global game grew more unstable. News filtered in ofPakistan boycotting their World Cup matchagainst India, which was meant to be played in Colombo.This was a memorable day for Jos Buttler, his 402nd game for England making him the country’s record appearance-maker. While Salt and Jacob Bethell departed cheaply, the veteran looked in good touch, pinging the ball through point for consecutive boundaries off the lively Matheesha Pathirana.The opener and Banton got their reverse-slaps out against Wellalage but rain interrupted their stand on 57 for two. The break in play lasted a little over an hour. The revised equation left 111 needed off 9.4 overs; big hits were required straight away.There was immediate drama but it wasn’t enjoyable. Eshan Malinga thundered in for one delivery and fell to the ground clutching his left shoulder. The right-arm quick’s game was over, prompting a trip to the hospital.The game continued to turn. Banton sent Wanindu Hasaranga over deep midwicket before Wellalage had Buttler caught at deep point on 39. Out came Brook. He provided a leading edge off his first ball; moments later he hit his first staggering shot of the night, a flick off the left-arm spinner that had the ball screaming to long-on.The brutality was just beginning. Brook hit three sixes off Pathirana, channelling the energy of his 50-over century on Tuesday. The scoop against the same bowler went wrong, leading to his departure with 38 still required. But the rate had dropped significantly and Banton remained, well supported by Curran, the series won with a game to play.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamTwenty20newsShareReuse this content"

While only six points separate third from sixth in the Women’s Premiership, the reigning champions, Gloucester-Hartpury, once again proved their superiority with a seven-try 45-26 win over Loughborough that lifted them above Saracens at the top of the table.Gloucester are now five points clear of Saracens, who did not play like weekend, and 12 of the chasing pack as they continued their unbeaten run with their last league defeat coming in November 2024. The defending champions underlined their intent for a fourth consecutive title with a stunning home display. The Wales international Nel Metcalfe was the star for the hosts with a 24-minute first-half hat-trick. Her performances will be giving Wales supporters a sprinkling of hope leading in to the Women’s Six Nations in two months’ time.‘This league has stepped up’: tension at top of Premiership Women’s RugbyRead moreMore than an hour before kick-off fans were queueing outside the stadium for a ticket with others choosing to shelter from the rain in the coffee shop run by the Gloucester players Mo Hunt and Zoe Stratford. The weather did not improve so supporters were forced to brave the conditions. One couple sat just in front of the press box shared how they have supported Gloucester for years but after watching the Red Roses during the World Cup they are going to attend their first England game for the Women’s Six Nations opener against Ireland at Twickenham in April. The England head coach, John Mitchell, who signed a new long-term contract earlier this week, will be hoping to seal his third Six Nations title and was spotted at Kingsholm to assess some of his players before the tournament.Loughborough did put up a good fight but Metcalfe’s antics, as well as another impactful performance from the Gloucester full-back Emma Sing confirmed a bonus-point win. “She [Metcalfe] has come on strides,” said the hooker Kelsey Jones, who scored Gloucester’s fourth try of the afternoon. “I think you can see that confidence growing in her game. The want to get the ball in her hand, the cross-field kicks, whatever it may be. She wants to take defenders on, she wants to create space as well. She is phenomenal. It will be super exciting over the next few years to see what she can do within this club environment but hopefully take that on to the world stage playing for Wales as well.”View image in fullscreenJade Shekells carries the ball forward against Loughborough.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty ImagesFans were packed into the shed at Kingsholm and impressive attendance numbers were not only present in the West Country asTrailfinders, who kicked off the league’s return on Friday night, experienced their best crowd of the season so far – 2,233.

Jones revealed Gloucester are aiming for a flawless season. She said: “It’s motivation, we have had such good seasons in the last few years but we haven’t gone unbeaten. It’s been really important to keep that momentum going and we don’t want to stop now, we just want to keep on going.”Explore more on these topicsPremiership Women's RugbyWomen's rugby unionRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Elliott’s mare is top-priced at 11-4, though several firms bracket the pair as 5-2 joint-favourites.“If we’d run well and been beaten by Lossiemouth, that would have been enough to run in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham,” Michael O’Leary, Brighterdaysahead’s owner, said. “Winning was a bonus. If she’s run well and jumped well on that kind of [very soft] ground, then she’s fit to go to the Champion Hurdle and that’s where we’ll go. They’re two very good mares, her and Lossiemouth, and we’re very lucky to be in this position.”View image in fullscreenOwner Michael O’Leary gives Brighterdaysahead a kiss.Photograph: Niall Carson/PATownend, meanwhile, reported that he had not been happy at any point aboard the favourite. “I was never comfortable on her,” Townend said. “It surprised me that I actually got in with a chance at any stage. Everything was hard work today.”Brighterdaysahead’s win was a significant boost for Elliott in his attempt to depose Mullins as Ireland’s champion trainer and claim the title for the first time. Mullins, though, responded with two Grade One wins on the day, saddling the 5-1 shot, Kaid d’Authie, to upset his stable-companion, Final Demand, the 1-3 favourite, in the Ladbrokes Novice Chase before the mercurial Majborough returned to form in impressive style in the Dublin Chase.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Monday tipsShowKempton:12.52Jem’s Lilly1.27Aviation2.02Step Ahead2.35Graecia3.07Madara3.42Grand Conqueror4.17Lover DesboisSouthwell:1.02Roger Rarebit1.37Benmore2.12Wilstar2.45Moyganny Phil3.17Parish Star3.52Firm But Fair4.27La HigueraWolverhampton:5.00Take The Boat5.30Leonetto6.00Flicka’s girl6.30Ernie’s Valentine (nap)7.00Corundum7.30Francesco Baracca8.00Electrocution (nb)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Majborough was the beaten favourite in last season’s Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham and also in his two previous starts this season, but he jumped impeccably in front in first-time cheekpieces and eventually powered 21 lengths clear of Marine Nationale,last season’s Queen Mother Champion Chasewinner.“Mark [Walsh, Majborough’s jockey] wanted to do things his way today, and that paid off huge,” Mullins said. “He was happier doing it and the horse was obviously happier doing it, so onwards and upwards.”Majborough is the new favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase on 11 March at a top price of 7-4, while Marine Nationale, the ante-post favourite going into Sunday’s race, is out to 3-1.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

At Stockley Park, the video assistant referee, Paul Tierney, rewound the clock by 19 seconds, to the moment Leon Bailey, at the opposite end of the pitch, was deemed to have failed to keep the ball in play.Ten-man Nottingham Forest earn valuable point in feisty clash with Crystal PalaceRead moreAfter a VAR delay of almost four minutes, Robinson’s mic connected with the stadium speakers. “After review, the ball is factually out of play, so the restart will be a throw-in to Brentford,” the referee said amid mass groans – and much worse – from the restless locals. It was reminiscent ofNewcastle’s winner against Arsenal in 2023, when Anthony Gordon’s goal was allowed to stand because there was no conclusive evidence the ball had gone out in the buildup, though seemingly there were no such problems at the VAR hub on this occasion. The Premier League’s match centre said the ball was out of play “within the attacking possession phase (APP)”.Unai Emery suggested running play back so far sets a dangerous precedent. “I think it’s not fair, but it happened and I must accept it,” said the Villa manager. “The referees are so demanding of themselves to get everything right. If there is something they can improve, I know they will do it. My explanation is that the goal happened a long time after the initial incident, and if the linesman didn’t see it, we have to keep playing. It’s difficult for VAR to analyse this goal. It’s so tight. But when VAR asks the referee … the problem is the VAR must not ask the referee in this situation.”Keith Andrews, theBrentfordhead coach, acknowledged the period of time before a goal the VAR should assess is the “million-dollar question”, but insisted Abraham’s disallowed goal was in the “same phase of play” as Bailey facing his own goalline trying to keep the ball in play. Bailey, making a homecoming of a different kind after being recalled from Roma last month, was on his backside when the ball appeared to drift out of play near the corner flag. Villa kickstarted their attack from there, diagonally surging upfield, culminating in Jadon Sancho jinking inside Jordan Henderson and forcing Caoimhín Kelleher into an instinctive save. Abraham was quickest to the rebound and wheeled away in celebration, but it was short-lived. Invariably, the discourse surrounding the decision is unlikely to die down anytime soon.View image in fullscreenTammy Abraham’s effort was ruled out after a review.Photograph: Jacob King/PABrentford went close to compounding Villa’s misery, Kristoffer Ajer almost scoring from the restart, long-throw specialist Michael Kayode launching the ball into the box. It was one of just two shots the visitors mustered on target, the other Dango Ouattara’s brilliant goal in first-half stoppage time, five minutes after Kevin Schade was sent off for petulantly shoving his studs into Matty Cash’s groin after the pair tangled.Ouattara raced into the channel and after his attempt to square the ball for Igor Thiago was blocked by Pau Torres, from an awkward angle, he simply cut on to his left boot and lashed an unerring strike into the far top corner. Schade, Andrews said, was a relieved man. “He’s very grateful that his teammates put in the shift they did.”For Andrews, whose side moved within four points of fifth-placed Chelsea, this victory represented another feather in the cap, the Brentford manager eight months into the job getting one over on Emery, by comparison a veteran. Villa had lost just two league games here since the start of last season, though this defeat means they have lost successive home games for the first time in two years. “To say the performance was pleasing is an understatement,” Andrews said. “It was a defensive masterclass in the second half. The desire to stop the ball going in our net was immense.”View image in fullscreenKevin Schade clashes with Aston Villa’s Matty Cash, resulting in a red card for the Brentford winger.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesThe inevitable Villa onslaught felt unsustainable from a Brentford perspective. The visitors had to withstand waves of pressure. Sancho ran at Kayode time and again, with varying degrees of success. Kelleher smothered an Emi Buendía effort at the back post approaching the hour, by which point it had long turned into a game of attack v defence. A cute Sancho cutback eluded those in claret and blue that had loaded the box. Cash saw a stinging effort repelled by the busy Kelleher.Brentford required some respite but it also proved a draining experience for everyone of a Villa persuasion. Emery turned to Harvey Elliott, who entered as a substitute for his seventh appearance in all competitions since joining on loan from Liverpool and only his second since October. Villa tried to force an equaliser. Morgan Rogers whipped a devilish cross into the six-yard box and in the 90th minute Bailey wasted Villa’s best chance, ballooning over after driving inside the substitute Aaron Hickey.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It follows 2021’sFrom Lament to Actionreport, which called for urgent “culture change” to tackle “racial sin”.Adjei said antiracist practices in education, representation, structures and governance had been identified as key areas for RJP, alongside advocacy, which meant the church “speaking and standing in solidarity” on issues such as youth safety, health inequalities and migration.“This comes back to our theology, to who we are as the church, which is about loving our neighbour,” Adjei said.“Whether the far right were present or not, we would still have an intention to care for the asylum seeker, the refugee and the migrant. What we want to do is allow people to see that faith and racial justice live side by side.”Last week, the new archbishop of Canterbury, Sarah Mullally,defended Project Spireas being “rooted in the Christian call to repentance, reconciliation and, above all, hope”, after Conservative party critics claimed the fund would divert cash away from local parishes.Mullally said the church was inspired by the example of anti-slavery campaigners, such asOlaudah Equiano, adding: “Project Spire does not diminish the church’s support of or investment in parish ministry or clergy … Church Commissioners’ support for dioceses and parishes continues to increase.”Jeremiah said it was hoped RJP would be a catalyst for other funding bids for racial justice work, adding: “Our faith in Jesus Christ compels us to work towards equity and fairness for all. It’s about how we counter the far-right narrative and create a sense of belonging for everyone.”Adjei added: “If we were to set our focus on potential pushback and dissatisfaction we probably wouldn’t start, but, because we’re compelled by the love of God, even in the face of resistance, we press on. What we want to do is make sure we continue to have conversations with people who disagree with us.”Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismCotton Capital: ongoing seriesRaceLondonChristianityReligionEnglandSlaverynewsShareReuse this content"

Why detain a five-year-old? You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”Stenvik said that another adult who lived in the home was outside during the encounter and pleaded to take custody of the child so he would not be detained, but officers refused.The Department of Homeland Security refuted this claim,posting on Xthat the five-year-old “was ABANDONDED [sic] by his father, and the alleged mother REFUSED to take custody of her own child”.Amid the release of the preschooler and his father, the school district said on Sunday that they were “grateful for the overwhelming number of well-wishes and offers of support from people around the globe”.“Liam’s release is an important development, and we hope it will lead to positive developments for other families as well, including our other four students who are being held at the Dilley facility inTexas,” reads a statement by the Columbia Heights public school district spokesperson. “We want all children to be released from detention centers and hope for the reunification of families who have been unjustly separated.”According to ananalysis of recordsobtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE booked about 3,800 minors into immigrant family detention from January to October 2025. The number of children currently in migrant detention centers remains unclear.‘We’re fighting for the soul of the country’: how Minnesota residents came together to face ICERead moreThe five-year-old and his father were detained at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, where mostchildren detained with a parentare eventually transferred to. The detention center, operated by the private prison company CoreCivic, is intended to be less punitive than traditional jails, withaccess to schooling and playgroundsfor children.However, representatives Castro and Jasmine Crockettdescribed gruesome conditionsat the detention center when they visited the preschooler and his father last week, saying they encountered children “mentally broken because of the trauma that they’re experiencing”.Crockett said that the children at the detention center told her that “we’re not in school,” while the facility’s staff said otherwise.Conejo Arias told the Texas representatives that the child was frequently tired and not eating well at the detention center, which is housing about 1,100 people, according to Castro.A lawyer for the familytold CNNlast month that the child and his father entered the US legally, leaving Ecuador amid the economic situation, insecurity and unstable employment conditions. The lawyer also said the five-year-old and his father were undergoing a legal process to obtain status in the United States, and that their claims remained pending.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationMinneapolisUS politicsMinnesotaUS justice systemTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

Iran’s official death toll released by the Martyr’s Foundation is 3,117, including members of the security services.Iranian reformists said the planned government identification process was not sufficiently transparent and unlikely to end the dispute about how many people had been killed.Trump says he believes Iran wants to make deal as he extols size of US ‘armada’Read moreMohsen Borhani, a law professor at Tehran University and a critic of the Iranian government who has served time in Evin prison, said the government proposal to identify the dead publicly was a positive development because in previous major protests, Iranians “faced an absolute lack of information regarding the deceased and injured”.Borhani said the best way to achieve transparency was to create a website and announce the names of the deceased “so that the information is not one-sided”.“Citizens should be able to publicly and openly upload names and information about the deceased without being identified. The site should then commit itself to verifying and providing necessary information about each announced name.”One difficulty is that families willing to identify a fatality risk facing retribution, especially if they insist their family member was killed by the security services.In a sign that many Iranians believe the death toll is far higher than the official claim, the Tehran teachers union issued a statement demanding the release of all detainees, claiming “in less than a week one of the bloodiest chapters of repression in contemporary Iranian history has unfolded. Tens of thousands of children, women and women have been drenched in blood.”Ahmad Zeidabadi, a reformist analyst, said distrust between the state and society had grown “so deep and wide” that many people no longer accepted official data.He said the best solution would be to allow the United Nations to send an unimpeachable fact-finding team to Iran.Writing on his Telegram channel, Zeidabadi asked: “Why not entrust this task to a legitimate international body so that the opposition forces and countries cannot easily cast doubt on it?”View image in fullscreenA screengrab from a video posted on social media on 14 January shows bodies lying on stretchers outside the Forensic Diagnostic and Laboratory Centre in Tehran.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Reform Front, an alliance of reformist groupings that worked to secure the election of the president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, also called for an independent committee “to investigate this unprecedented disaster and present a transparent and candid report to the Iranian nation”.The reformist lawyer Ali Mojtahedzadeh said the government had to address the root causes of the distrust by building a stronger civil society.In his first intervention, the former president Hassan Rouhani said the protests led by a generation born and raised in the Islamic Republic showed the need for major change. He called for the formation of political parties and an end to the filtering of electoral candidates.Separately, an unofficial committee has been set up to identify all those still in detention, as security services continue their sweeps through the country looking for what they describe as the ringleaders of the protests. No official number exists for those in detention, but it is believed to be in the tens of thousands.The number of children under 18 being held has not been released, but teaching union websites are publishing the photographs of every child that has been verified as killed. Government officials have also been photographed visiting detainees.Lawyers have told Iranian media that the majority of those arrested were born between 1980 and 1985, and were the main breadwinner in the family. Initial sentences of two to five years are being issued. Many are from working-class families and cannot afford the bail money required.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

So we’re talking to the people from Cuba, the highest people in Cuba, to see what happens,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida on Sunday.“I think we’re going to make a deal withCuba.”Trump gave no indication what such a deal might entail.The US president had said on Saturday: “It doesn’t have to be a humanitarian crisis. I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal … They have a situation that’s very bad for Cuba. They have no money. They have no oil. They lived off Venezuelan money and oil, and none of that’s coming now.”Trump’s second administration has been ratcheting up pressure on the communist-run island nation off south Florida since it ousted the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, whose country was a close ally of Havana and a crucial source for oil exports to Cuba.Mexico president says Trump tariffs on Cuba’s oil suppliers could trigger humanitarian crisisRead moreOn Thursday, the Republican president signed an executive order threatening to imposeadditional tariffson countries that sell oil to Cuba.Hours later, Cubans were queueing up on Friday in long lines at petrol stations in Havana.Trump and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the Miami-born son of Cuban exiles, have made no secret of their desire to bring regime change in Havana.After Maduro’s fall, the US president warned Havana to “make a deal soon” or face unspecified consequences.“NO MORE OIL OR MONEY FOR CUBA: ZERO!” Trump had stated earlier, claiming Cuba was “ready to fall”.The Cuban government has accused Trump of seeking to strangle the island’s economy, where daily power cuts are intensifying and lines at petrol stations are getting longer.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCubaVenezuelaTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

When the waters recede, crows and ravens will feast on the carrion of hedgehogs, dormice and other small animals unable to escape the rising water, he says.“It sounds very apocalyptic, doesn’t it?” says Hussey, a communications officer with theDevonWildlife Trust.View image in fullscreenFlooding in Ottery St Mary, Devon, after the rain from Storm Chandra.Photograph: William Dax/SWNSBetween Tuesday and Wednesday last week, some areas in the west of the UK saw more than 110mm (4.3in) of rain during the storm. The deluge meant several places in south-west England broke daily records for January rainfall, causing authorities to issuerare “danger to life” flood warnings. More than 100flood alerts remain in place.As heavy rain and strong winds continue to buffet the west of the UK, conservationists have again been faced with the consequences of extreme weather for wildlife in a warming world. In parts of the country,some nature reserves are completely under water. Rivers have burst their banks; butterfly and other insect eggs will probably have been washed away; wintering and potential nesting sites will have been lost.View image in fullscreenA group of flat millipedes take refuge on floating timber after heavy rainfall flooded a wetland area in Warnham nature reserve in West Sussex.Photograph: Stephen Iles/Alamy“For the long-term health and robustness of our wildlife, it’s bad. Wildflowers suffer in the same way as a farmer’s crop that has been washed away. It is difficult to come back from and there are unseen consequences. Some butterfly species overwinter as caterpillars. If they are washed away, what does it mean for a blue tit in a couple of months’ time who needs to feed their chicks?” says Hussey.Rising temperatures meanextreme rainfall eventshave become more severe during storms in the UK, with research indicating they are 20% more intense. But many conservationists say that nature can also be part of the solution for mitigating flood water, particularly for slowing its movement through the landscape and avoiding fast-moving deluges that damage properties and threaten human life.View image in fullscreenYangtze River flood waters in Wuhan, China, are absorbed by the city’s green areas.Photograph: Zhang Chang/Getty ImagesMany urban areas use nature to control the flow of water, with places such asWuhan in Chinaand Berlin in Germany usinga “sponge city” approachin their planning. These places use green areas to absorb rainwater and slow its movement. Environmentalists say this is needed on a landscape scale.The UK has lostmore than 90% of its wetlandsin the past 100 years,today covering just 3% of the country. In many places, river systems and wetlands have been altered to funnel water away from land as quickly as possible instead of allowing it to naturally burst out on to floodplains. Environmentalists say that restoring wetlands and the natural flow of rivers, along with continuing the reintroduction ofecosystem engineers such as beavers, will help.Something gnawed your oak tree? Sink hole in your road? How Zurich’s beaver hotline is reassuring residentsRead more“It is all about slowing the flow of water. And the reason we get really passionate about beavers is because they do all of this naturally,” says Jamie Marsh, director of land management at Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust.“When humans do it, it’s a long process that involves mapping and modelling, specialist consultancies and getting permission through different agencies. It’s long and expensive. Beavers do it for free.”The rodent, Britain’s largest, isthriving in many partsof the country after a 400-year absence. Their dams are designed to transform streams and small rivers into ponds, which stop rainwater from rapidly draining. During times of drought, their dams hold more water in the landscape, making the ecosystems more resilient in the summer. Withat least 2,000 beaversin the UK so far, their numbers are expected to rise.View image in fullscreenCaught on a remote camera, a beaver goes about its nocturnal dam-building in a woodland enclosure, in a project run by Devon Wildlife Trust.Photograph: Nick Upton/NPL/AlamyBut conservationists caution that much deeper changes are needed. Reconnecting rivers with floodplains and allowing them to meander naturally in high-risk areas are vital measures.“We have 30 beaver families on the River Otter, which flooded this week. We can’t expect them to sort it,” says Hussey. “They have to be part of a bigger mix. If you are waist-deep in your house inOttery St Maryat the moment, having beavers in that river system isn’t going to make much of a difference. We need to tackle soil compaction, plant trees in the right place and improve soil health.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsFloodingThe age of extinctionDevonExtreme weatherRewildingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It said the system will measure emissions from industry, including heavy metals.Revealed: Mexico’s industrial boomtown is making goods for the US. Residents say they’re ‘breathing poison’Read moreMariana Boy Tamborrell, Mexico’s federal attorney for environmental protection, said the latest moves represent a new wave of enforcement against industrial pollution inMexico. They originated when the first stories were published in early 2025 and include Zinc Nacional agreeing to address environmental damage, according to her agency.“The work we have done over the past year with Zinc Nacional is a watershed moment in how we monitor and inspect regulatory compliance by industries,” she said in a statement.Details of the new air-monitoring system remain unclear, and the agency did not provide the information by the time of publication. It is unclear whether this will be for Monterrey or the whole country.Additionally, the nation’s main environmental regulator has announced it is updating air and soil contamination standards, some of which have not been revised for decades.Martín Soto Jiménez, a prominent toxicology researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Unam), who conducted soil sampling around Zinc Nacional in collaboration with the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, said the new efforts to hold the company responsible for cleanup are precedent-setting.“This agreement is a historic step forward for environmental justice in Mexico,” he said in a written response to questions from reporters.“The creation of an atmospheric monitoring network is one of the most valuable parts of the agreement. To be useful, it must make real-time data public [and] allow citizens and scientists to access and analyze the information.”Zinc Nacional, a Mexican company that imports highly toxic dust left over after the US steel industry recycles old cars and appliances, must undertake 24 corrective measures in addition to the fine.The company is required to relocate some of its operations to a new plant outside residential areas of densely populated Monterrey and to build new containment and water treatment facilities. It must remediate contaminated land, reforest 12 acres (5 hectares) and monitor future emissions.In a statement to the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, Zinc Nacional acknowledged that there was some contamination on its land, which it said was associated with a company that previously operated on the site. It said that its “emissions were identified as being well below regulatory parameters, confirming the effectiveness of our dust control and collection systems”.No contamination is being dispersed into the air or carried towards nearby water bodies by rain, it said.“Through all these actions, we will reduce the environmental footprint of our operations, continue strengthening local employment, [and] expand green areas,” it said in apress release.In the past, Zinc Nacional has disputed the findings of the soil sampling in the community around its plant, raising doubts about the way the study was performed and saying it did not prove the heavy metals originated in the company’s factory.Some neighbors expressed disappointment with the government’s announcement, saying it focused on contamination inside the plant boundaries, but didn’t address the concerns about health effects and heavy metals in the surrounding neighborhood.Soil samples taken around the plant for the stories showed heavy metals, like lead, cadmium and arsenic inside and outside schools and homes. One primary school had 1,760 times the levels of lead that would be considered a human health risk in the US.“I think [the government] has failed to properly assess the needs of the vulnerable communities adjacent to the company,” said Ricardo González, one of six neighbors who spoke with reporters and have become involved with efforts to demand change from Zinc Nacional in the past year.View image in fullscreenNorthern Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, on 13 September 2024.Photograph: Bernardo De NizNeighbor Cristóbal Palacios called for regulators to publicly share the details of the remediation, including soil sample results, and any air emissions information collected in the future.“All of us who live near the company should be able to see, with our own eyes, the numbers [the government] says they’re going to obtain – how much lead, cadmium, arsenic is in the air – and they should really make that transparent,” said Palacios. He and other locals said it is crucial to have enforceable deadlines for the measures.The actions by the federal government are the latest measures aiming to address industrial pollution to be announced following the journalistic series.The environmental regulator, known by its acronym Semarnat,saidin December that it was working to update three of Mexico’s industrial air-pollution standards, some of which haven’t been revised in decades. This includes lowering the amount of particulate matter that plants are allowed to emit to the airby 50%. The head of Semarnat alsotoldMexico’s congress that her department is working to update Mexico’s standards for soil contamination.Revealed: US hazardous waste is sent to Mexico – where a ‘toxic cocktail’ of pollution emergesRead moreFederal senator Waldo Fernández, who heads the senate committee overseeing Mexico’s negotiations with the US over North American free trade, said he is drafting legislation to amend Mexico’s environmental law to limit the import of toxic waste and to require monitoring of heavy metal emissions by plants processing materials with heavy metals.He said the measure, which he plans to introduce in February, would seek to stop the importation of certain types of toxic waste materials that are not “environmentally beneficial” for Mexico, including waste that generates heavy pollution with arsenic, lead, cadmium and other toxic elements.And, when imports occur, “we’re calling for stricter regulation to ensure these imports don’t cause so much pollution”, the senator said in an interview.Additionally, two citizen groups took steps, following the latestarticle, to demand improved air quality in Monterrey and better protection of the public’s health.One group is gathering signatures for a citizens’ referendum to make air standards similar to international guidelines. Another, a prominent group of Monterrey activists known as the Group of 6,filed a lawsuitin December demanding a federal investigation of air emissions by industry in the region.“These are environmental crimes that threaten health and life,” said Liliana Flores, one of the founders of the Group of 6.“These are ultra-billion-dollar companies that have the resources to have clean technology. And they haven’t done it,” said Flores, who noted that thousands of people in Monterrey are estimated to die from air pollution each year and many others are sick, with chronic illnesses like asthma.“It doesn’t matter if you are rich or poor … Here, 100% of all of us who live in the metropolitan area are affected.”Explore more on these topicsAmerica's toxic tradeAmerica's dirty divideMexicoAmericasPollutionAir pollutionHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Clear proposals on taxing the profits of fossil fuel companies have been watered down in their language, and proposals for a global asset registry that would help in taxing wealthy individuals have been removed from the text.Marlene Nembhard Parker, main delegate for Jamaica at the negotiations forthe UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, said: “In the context of Hurricane Melissa, which wiped the equivalent of 40% off our GDP overnight, it is time that the draft template text on sustainable development gets fleshed out. A much clearer link now needs to be made to environmental taxation and climate change, with clearer agreements on the actions that must be taken, nationally and internationally, particularly for the countries and industries who are most responsible.”Negotiating the convention, which could be adopted as soon as the end of next year if countries can iron out details, was now urgent, she added, as more countries were afflicted by climate-related disasters. “This [tax] is critical for domestic resource mobilisation so that countries can sustainably rebuild and become resilient to increasingly devastating climate impacts, rather than become more dependent on borrowing and debt,” she told the Guardian. “There can be no sustainability without dealing with climate change in the way we design our global tax rules.”Progress on the tax treaty,which was first proposed by African countries in 2022,has beenslow so far. The US has withdrawn from the talks, though this need not prevent other countries pressing ahead. Some rich countries have also argued that tax matters should bediscussed within the OECD, of which only advanced economies are members, rather than within the UN, where all countries have a say.If it can be made to work, the treaty could be a big step forward in making fossil fuel producers pay for the damage they cause, and in ensuring the richest contribute.Inequalityrates have soared in recent years, with the wealthiest 0.001% of the population – roughly 56,000 people – holding three times more wealth than the poorer 50%, and the disparity is growing.Sergio Chaparo Hernandez, of the Tax Justice Network (TJN), said, “The next round of talks in New York will be a real test: can member states craft international tax rules that are fit for the age of climate catastrophe?”He added: “Civil society is pushing for the convention to include a clear mandate to advance progressive environmental taxation: making sure polluters pay, and that richer countries lead in ways that reduce global inequalities and support climate-resilient development in countries most affected – consistent with their historical responsibilities.”Countries are losing $492bn (£359bn) a year in tax, asmultinational corporations and wealthy individuals use tax havens to underpay,according to TJN. Oil and gas companies have made hundreds of billions in bumper profits in recent years, especially from the spike in prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to Eurodad and the Global Alliance for Tax Justice, a 20% surtax on the profits of the 100 biggest producers would have yielded more than $1tn in the 10 years since the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015.For many of those most vulnerable to the climate crisis,taxing the companies that are driving the crisis is essential to achieving climate justice. Tapugao Falefou, Tuvalu’s permanent representative to the UN, said: “The responsibility lies with the world’s biggest polluters. The fossil fuel industry and the super-rich continue to increase their wealth while we try to keep our heads above water.”Countries could impose taxes on fossil fuel consumption for themselves, and many do so, but only those where the extractive industries are based can put direct charges on its exploitation, hence the push for a global tax regime. Similarly, many countries are reluctant to consider wealth taxes, despite evidence of their success in some countries, for fear of putting the ultra-wealthy to flight, but if a large group of countries were to agree on minimum taxes on wealth it could help assuage such fears. An annual wealth tax of up to 5% on the ultra-rich would raise about $1.7tn a year.The UK had previously been regarded by campaigners as sceptical about whether the UN is the right locus for tax negotiations, but campaigners say it has recently taken a more positive approach, including endorsing the “polluter pays” principle.A spokesperson for the UK’s Treasury said: “The UK has been an active participant in tax negotiations at the UN and remains committed to working constructively to ensure inclusive and effective international tax cooperation.”Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsUnited NationsInequalityClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It just wasn’t for me.”He told Kuenssberg that politicians who admitted taking drugs and then advocated for incarcerating drug users were taking a “hypocritical approach”, when a “public health approach” was needed to prevent deaths.“It’s about legalising and regulating. If someone has a problematic relationship to drugs then surely the answer is to make sure they’re seen by a medical professional who can help them,” Polanski said.Keir Starmer, who has previously said he “worked hard and played hard” at university in response to questions about whether he used drugs at university, accused theGreen partyof being “high on drugs, soft on Putin” during prime minister’s questions last Wednesday.Polanski, a member of the London assembly, said hearing Starmer “making cheap jokes delivered badly” about drug use from the dispatch box was “pretty disgraceful” and that joking about Putin and Russia was also “pretty vile”, especially when he was not in the House of Commons to defend his party.Illegal drug use was “very racialised”, he said, with innocent young black people far more likely to be stopped and searched for drugs than their white peers. “We’ve had ministersboth from the Labour and the Conservative governmentwho have openly said on record that they’ve taken drugs, yet they’re putting in prison people who have taken drugs, and very often, again, it’s disproportionately young black and brown people.”He initially evaded a question about whether legalising class A drugs – including heroin and cocaine – could send a message to young people that the use of dangerous drugs was OK, telling Kuenssberg: “First of all, we could talk about alcohol, which can sometimes be one of the most dangerous drugs, and actually we need a public health approach to that too.”When pressed to answer the question, he said: “I think the danger is happening right now, which is where we’re pushing it [dangerous drug use] into street corners and into a black market … The war on drugs is not working. In fact, it’s making drugs more dangerous.“What we need is a grownup conversation, based on evidence, taking a public health approach that looks at prevention, intervention and makes sure that afterwards, people can get the support they need.”Asked whether he was teetotal as a matter of principle, he said: “Not at all. I just grew up in school where a lot of my friends were drinking and, in fact, taking drugs. And often it felt like someone needed to be sober.”Earlier in the interview, he told Kuenssberg that a surprising fact about himself was that he used to breakdance. “I’ve always liked dancing without taking drink or drugs,” he added. “If anyone wants to do it and they’re doing it safely, I’m really glad people are having a good time, but we know lots of people aren’t taking it safely, so let’s make sure they get the support they need.”Explore more on these topicsZack PolanskiGreen partyDrugs policyAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

She died last August, her organs irreparably weakened by the powerful drugs used to combat the infections as well as her cancer treatment.The inquiry heard devastating new evidence from the health board, including their admission that serious infections in 84 child cancer patients, two of whom died, were probably caused by the contaminated water system.‘Molly never got to hear it’: fury as denials finally end on Glasgow hospital infectionsRead moreThe COPFS had previously confirmed that investigations were under way into four deaths, including those of10-year-old Milly Main, who died in 2017, two other children and 73-year-old Gail Armstrong, who died in 2019 and was being treated for an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma when she contracted a fungal infection commonly associated with pigeon droppings.In addition, the COPFS said on Saturday it had received a report in connection with the death in 2021 of 65-year-old Anthony Dynes, who was also being treated at the QEUH for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.The health board has offered a “sincere and unreserved apology” to those affected and insisted it is a “very different organisation” than the one involved in the design and construction of the hospital a decade ago.Three senior microbiologists who first raised the alarm about infection control problems told the inquiry in its final days that they still had “significant concerns” about the extent to which necessary changes had been instigated by senior management.At first minister’s questions last Thursday, the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, said he had “damning evidence” from minutes of meetings between Glasgow health board officials and the Scottish government that “political pressure” was applied to open the new hospital before it was ready.This has previously been denied by the first minister, John Swinney, and the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon.Sarwar told MSPs: “That decision to open the hospital early has resulted in a decade of lies, deceit and cover-up, bullying and gaslighting of staff, families being lied to and denied the truth and infections that led to the deaths of children and possibly adults too – all because politics was put before patient safety.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandGlasgowNHSHospitalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

She was awarded the payout – one of the biggest in NHS history – last month after a tribunal ruled she had been unfairly dismissed after raising concerns about alleged bullying and harassment bythe chair of the hospital board.An employment judge found that board members of the hospital conspired to unfairly exclude her and deleted documents when she launched legal action.Speaking to the Guardian, Gilby said she had been “traumatised” by the experience and made to feel like a “pariah in the NHS” for refusing to drop her concerns in return for a “non-job”.“I feel desperately saddened that my NHS career has come to an end in the way it has. It’s had a really deep psychological impact [and] probably taken at least 10 years of working life away from me,” she said.“It’s been very isolating. People walk away when they realise you’re not willing to play by the NHS playbook and accept the offer to get you out of the situation. Doing that has resulted in being made to feel that I’m a pariah in the NHS.”Tribunal judgesfoundthat Ian Haythornthwaite, the chair of the Countess of Chester hospital NHS foundation trust, worked with three other senior figures to “engineer her dismissal” after Gilby raised a whistleblowing complaint about his “bullying and harassment”.Haythornthwaite, who resigned after the tribunal ruling, was described by the employment judge Dawn Shotter as an “inaccurate historian” who did not give credible testimony.Shotter also criticised the reliability of the three others – Ros Fallon, Ken Gill and Nicola Price – who were found to have conspired with Haythornthwaite to build a “sham case” against Gilby to force her out.Haythornthwaite, a former BBC executive, was judged to have worked with others to delete scores of documents, including private emails and WhatsApp messages, despite being legally obliged to retain them for the employment proceedings.Shotter described this as a “deliberate intention to hide documents” that would have exposed “the true part” played by him.A barrister for the Countess of Chester hospital told the tribunal there was no intention to deceive. However, judges rejected this claim as being without “any validity given the extent of [their] failure to disclose”.Gilby, a consultant in intensive care and anaesthesia, was suspended on full pay at the hospital in 2022, shortly after making a protected disclosure about Haythornthwaite’s “unacceptable and bullying” behaviour.She said she and her legal team were now exploring whether to make a criminal complaint against Haythornthwaite after the tribunal’s findings. One of the offences being considered as the basis for a possible complaint is alleged misfeasance in public office, in which a senior figure has knowingly misused or abused their power.Haythornthwaite told the Guardian he denied any allegation of criminal wrongdoing and said he would not comment on “unspecified allegations by unspecified people”.He rejects the claim that his behaviour was “unacceptable and bullying” and contests the tribunal’s finding that his evidence was not credible, and that he deliberately hid documents.Gilby told the tribunal she was offered a “non-job” with NHSEnglandif she dropped her complaints, which she refused to do, which is when the trust’s chair launched a misconduct investigation into her.She said: “Sham investigations appear to be increasingly and frequently used as a way of manipulating somebody out of an organisation or closing down concerns inappropriately. I think it is a very common problem across the NHS. I wouldn’t say it’s endemic but it’s happening too often and it’s incredibly harmful.”Gilby is now calling for new regulations for senior NHS managers from non-clinical backgrounds, as well as a legally binding framework for how they operate.The NHS has been criticised repeatedly for the way leaders deal with whistleblowing complaints. Gilby said she had been contacted by numerous health bosses since her tribunal who had been forced out in a similar way.“It’s not just one bad apple – absolutely not,” she said. “I genuinely believe that on the whole there are very many people doing the right thing across the NHS. But unfortunately [these issues] repeat year on year, but not many people have got the resources or the resilience to see it through.“I therefore do feel that something needs to be done that will ensure that people think twice before they choose to use their organisation and resources to wage personal vendettas.”Gilby said the protections for NHS whistleblowers did not go far enough, leaving medics afraid to raise concerns and potentially putting patients at risk.“Patient safety incidents will go unnoticed and unreported and there will be no learning,” she said. “We see that time and time again. I was acutely aware of how poor culture and behaviour at the very top can impact patient safety. That’s why I was so adamant that I wasn’t going to walk away.”A spokesperson for the Countess of Chester hospital NHS foundation trust said: “We acknowledge the tribunal’s decision regarding the failures of the trust in this case. We remain focused on learning from the findings and continuing to support our staff and patients. As this matter has now concluded, we will not be commenting further.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHospitalsHealthCheshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In January, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, heralded the success of the ban inannouncing that 4.7m accountson these platforms had been disabled or removed in the first days of the ban.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHowever, there have been a number of reports since the ban came into effect, with some reporting Snapchat’s facial age estimation was easily bypassed by teenagers.The company said it continues to lock more accounts daily but said there are “significant gaps” in the implementation of the ban that could undermine it.“There are real technical limitations to accurate and dependable age verification,” Snapchat said, pointing to the age assurance technology trial last year finding facial age estimation technology was only accurate within two or three years of a person’s actual age.“In practice, this means some young people under 16 may be able to bypass protections, potentially leaving them with reduced safeguards, while others over 16 may incorrectly lose access.”Snapchat said there were also other apps where users communicate that escaped the ban, meaning teenagers would turn to alternative, less regulated, messaging apps.“While we don’t yet have data to quantify this shift, it’s a risk that deserves serious consideration as policymakers evaluate whether the law is achieving its intended outcomes,” Snapchat said.While the government named 10 platforms initially required to comply with the social media ban, all platforms with Australian users are expected to assess whether they need to comply. However, the eSafety commissioner’s regulatory focus since the ban came into effect has been on those first 10 platforms.“We’re a small team, by necessity we are going to focus where the preponderance of young people are – where there are more than 250,000 for instance, is one measure,” the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, told reporters last month. “A lot of the other smaller companies that we’re looking at have about 100,000 users. And so this will continue to be a work in progress. We’re not done by any means.”Snap, like Meta, has called for app store-level age verification.Last month, Inman Grant said she was looking for systemic issues with the rollout, and the age assurance technology needed to improve, and noted Snapchat had been using facial age estimation without a “liveness test” which checks it is a real image.“What’s really important is that these companies are deploying them in the right way,” she said. “And if they don’t have the right settings, or they’re setting the calibrations too high, that is where they’re going to likely have false positives.”Inman Grant said eSafety would be sending a number of notices to companies on how they are complying with the ban.While the total number of account deactivations since the ban came into effect is 4.7m across the 10 platforms, it is understood this includes not just accounts identified as being under 16 but includes historical, inactive and duplicate accounts that have been removed.Aside fromMetaand Snapchat, none of the other platforms have said how many accounts they have deactivated and the eSafety commissioner has declined to provide a breakdown.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banSnapchatAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The snowfall represented a top-five snow event all time there, Mullinax said.North Carolina’s governor, Josh Stein,saidthat more than 1,000 collisions on snowy roads had resulted in two fatalities across the state over the weekend. He did not give any details on the victims.Flight cancellations exceeded 2,800 in the US onSaturday, with another 1,800 onSunday, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking and data company. More than 800 of those Sunday cancellations were for flights departing from or arriving to Charlotte Douglas international airport.The frigid weather brought temperatures as low as the 20s F to Florida’s panhandle and the 30s in south Florida, Mullinax said. Snow flurrieswere seenin Tampa and low temperature records were broken in Daytona Beach (23F), Melbourne (25F), and Vero Beach (26F). Miami saw its coldest morning since 2010 at 35F (2C).View image in fullscreenIcicles cling to oranges at a grove on Sunday in Plant City, Florida.Photograph: Chris O’Meara/APThe cold caused iguanas to fall from trees and prompted the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission to issue anexecutive orderasking the public to bring any iguanas found on Sunday or Monday to the agency.On Friday, the conservation commission set special regulations that temporarily allow residents to remove cold-stunned green iguanas from the wild without a permit as temperatures plummeted over the weekend.“Green iguanas are an invasive species in Florida and have adverse impacts on the state’s environment and economy,” the commission said in astatement.View image in fullscreenAn iguana stunned by the cold lies immobile on a house deck on Sunday in South Miami, Florida.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APIn November, residentswere warnedof the serious hazard of iguanas, paralyzed by the cold, falling from trees as temperatures started to plummet. The executive order issued on Friday allows for the removal of “cold-stunned iguanas from properties where they have landowner permission to conduct these activities and, on any commission-managed property”.The executive order temporarily waives the requirement of a hunting license, management area permit, or other commission permits to collect and transport the live iguanas. Residents have until Monday 2 February at 4pm to transfer the live, cold-stunned iguanas to different drop-off locations in Florida.Danger for homeless New Yorkers as cold-related deaths spike in bitter stormRead moreAccording to the FWC, sustained near-freezing temperaturescan sendreptiles and amphibians, including non-native green iguanas, into torpor – a temporary state that causes them to lose muscle control.The cold also left ice on strawberries and oranges in the state. Farmers in Florida sometimes spray water on fruit trees and berry plants to protect them from the cold.In Florida, temperatures started to plummet over the weekend to levels not observed since 2010, 1989, 1977 and 1966, according toAccuWeather. A bomb cyclone across the south-east brought low temperatures, knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses, and led to hundreds of flight cancellations on Sunday.Further north, in parts of North Carolina, snowfall totals were over a foot, according to theNational Weather Service.More than 110deathsconnected to thewintry weatherand stormshave been reported around the US since late January. In Mississippi and Tennessee, two states that were struck last weekend by a storm carrying snow and ice, more than 87,000 customers were still without electricity on Sunday, according to the outage tracking websitepoweroutage.us.

It has been largely shut since May 2024.Cogat, the Israeli agency charged with administration of Gaza, said the crossing would reopen in both directions for Gaza residents on foot only and its operation would be coordinated withEgyptand the EU.‘I wish I had the power to ease his suffering’: Gaza’s cancer patients trapped by war and blockadeRead more“Today, a pilot is under way to test and assess the operation of the crossing. The movement of residents in both directions, entry and exit to and fromGaza, is expected to begin tomorrow,” Cogat said on Sunday.Location map of Rafah crossingA Palestinian official and a source close to the EU mission confirmed the details. The Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Israel has said the crossing will open under stringent security checks only for Palestinians who wish to leave the war-ravaged territory and for those who fled the fighting in the first months of the war to return.Many of those expected to leave are sick and wounded people in need of medical care abroad. The Palestinian health ministry has said there are about 20,000 patients waiting to leave Gaza.View image in fullscreenPalestinian patients with kidney failure undergo dialysis at al-Aqsa hospital, in Deir al-Balah, Gaza.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersAn Israeli defence official said the crossing could hold between 150 and 200 people altogether in both directions. There would be more people leaving than returning because patients left together with escorts, the official added. Lists of people due to pass through the crossing had been submitted by Egypt and approved by Israel, the official said.Reopening the border crossing was a key requirement of the first phase of the US president Donald Trump’s plan to end the conflict. But the ceasefire, which came into effect in October after two years of fighting, has been repeatedly shaken by rounds of violence.Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians since the ceasefire began, local health officials say, and Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli troops, according to Israeli authorities.On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire,killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday when militants emerged from a tunnel in Rafah.1:00Israeli airstrikes hit multiple locations in Gaza – videoThe next phases of Trump’s plan for Gaza require governance to be handed to Palestinian technocrats,Hamas to lay down its weaponsand Israeli troops to withdraw from the territory while an international force keeps the peace and Gaza is rebuilt.Hamas has so far rejected disarmament and Israel has repeatedly indicated that if the Islamist militant group is not disarmed peacefully, it will use force to make it do so.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineIsrael-Gaza warEgyptDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The death toll from the fire at Le Constellation bar on January 1 2026 has now risen to 41.”Pilloud said her office, which is investigating the tragedy, would release no further information at this stage.Those killed in the disaster were aged 14 to 39, and most were teenagers. Only four were aged over 24. Another 115 people were injured, most of whom remain in various hospitals.Among the dead were 23 Swiss nationals, including one French-Swiss dual national, and 18 foreigners. There were eight French nationals, including a French-British-Israeli girl; six Italian teenagers, including an Italian-Emirati dual national; and one Belgian, one Portuguese, one Romanian and one Turkish national.Public prosecutors believe the fire started when revellers raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached too close to sound insulation foam on the ceiling of the bar’s basement.Four people are under criminal investigation: the bar’s co-owners, the Crans-Montana municipality’s head of public safety and a formerCrans-Montana firesafety officer.After the fire, seriously wounded patients were airlifted to various hospitals and specialist burns units throughoutSwitzerlandand in four other European countries.Switzerland’s federal office for civil protection said on Friday that as of Monday 44 patients were being treated abroad – 18 in France, 12 in Italy, eight in Germany and six in Belgium.The Wallis health ministry said 37 patients were still in Swiss hospitals as of Monday.The picture is constantly changing, with patients moving between hospitals for different stages of their treatment, and some patients being readmitted.

Fred and Peter Done paid £400.1m in tax, about half of which relates to gambling duty from their betting shop empire.View image in fullscreenTim Martin.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAMartin, who founded theWetherspoon’schain, is eighth with a personal contribution put at just shy of £200m.JD Wetherspoon paid more than £1m tax a pub with the chain of 794 venues pumping £837.1m into the public finances – from levies including corporation tax, business rates, slot machine duty and VAT. Martin owns 26.7% of company shares.In an interview, theBrexit-backing businessman criticised the government for adding VAT to pub meals when it is not paid in supermarkets, but not for the size of his tax bill. He said: “I can’t complain about the level of taxation really – that’s a political issue. Parties put forward their ideas and voters decide.”The eighth edition of the list coincides with an exodus of wealthy people from the UK to offshore destinations in Europe and the Middle East. Five of the figures in the 2025 league table are now resident in Jersey or Guernsey, four in Monaco and two in Portugal. There are others based in Cyprus, Dubai and the US.However, Peter Done, 78, told the newspaper he had no plans to quit Britain. “We owe this country,” he said. “I feel there is an obligation for people that have made the money in that country to pay the tax in that country. Fred and myself are stopping here.”View image in fullscreenJK Rowling’s tax bill was reported to be £47.5m.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThe list also includes the Harry Potter authorJK Rowling, the Timpson family behind the shoe-mending empire, the tech entrepreneur James Dyson, and Douglas and Iain Anderson, whoseGAP Group provides fences and loos for concerts and festivals.The top 10 features the financiers Alex Gerko, Chris Rokos and Peter Hargeaves, Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct, Tom Morris of Home Bargains, the Perkins family who own Specsavers and Stephen Rubin, who owns a large stake in JD Sports as well as the company behind Speedo.Fourteen of this year’s tax listers are now resident overseas, according to Companies House documents including Ian and Richard Livingstone, the billionaire brothers who own Berkshire mansion Cliveden, who last year quit the UK for Monaco.HMRC official data indicates the UK’s highest-earning 1% – those with pre-tax incomes of at least £219,000 – contribute about a quarter (26.6%) of all UK income tax during the current tax year. This has fallen from 30.7% in 2021-22, mainly because of the freezing of income tax thresholds. The departure of some wealthy people to lower-tax jurisdictions may also have contributed to the change.View image in fullscreenHarry Styles was the top celebrity taxpayer at No 54.Photograph: Ian West/PAHarry Styles, who announced a new album world tour in recent weeks, was the top celebrity taxpayer at No 54, paying £24.7m, according to the Sunday Times list, most of which related to his touring and merchandise firm Erskine Records.He sits 10 places ahead of fellow singerEd Sheeran, who paid just under £20m in tax, on a £41m dividend he was paid last year. Sheeran has said: “I’ll always pay tax in uk coz that’s where I live.”Ranked 72, Erling Haaland, Manchester City’s Norwegian striker, is the youngest person to appear on the list. He earns a basic wage of more than £500,000 a week, plus at least another £10m from image rights and bonus payments. His estimated tax bill of £16.9m is less than half that of JK Rowling, whose bill is reported to be £47.5m.Thetax list rankingsare not a full account of all taxes paid but include corporation tax, dividend tax, capital gains tax, income tax and some payroll taxes, as well as gambling and alcohol duties, according to the most recently filed company accounts up to 10 January.Tax attributable to individuals is calculated in proportion to their share of ownership of the company in question.

That is a fifth of the total £4.3bn “transitional relief” fund announced by the chancellor in the budget for all businesses facing big bill increases.‘It’s a hospitality-wide problem’: night-time traders react to business rates relief planRead moreHeathrow’s rates bill will still rise by £50m to £171m this year, according to figures compiled by the property firm Avison Young and first reported by the Sunday Times. The airport has one of the highest rateable values in the country.Had the government not stepped in, Heathrow’s business rates bill would have leapt to £512m in the upcoming fiscal year, £514m the year after and £523m the year after that, taking the total over the next three years to £1.5bn. Reliefs over this period will take the aggregate to £650m, thanks to transitional relief of £898m.While Heathrow, which is owned by a collection of overseas sovereign wealth and pension funds, is getting less support in percentage terms than a local pub, the total value of its package dwarfs the £80m in additional discountsoffered to pubs and live music venuesin England this year.Hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and cafes did not get any additional support on top of transitional relief that capped rises in business rate bills at 15% for most companies this year – or £800 for the smallest – as pandemic-era reliefs come to an end and property revaluations take effect. That relief gradually reduces over the following two years.View image in fullscreenPub closures are accelerating.Photograph: Nick Maslen/AlamyThe Night Times Industries Association (NTIA) has complained that the government is “explicitly excluding” nightclubs, grassroots electronic music and recorded music venues from additional help on business rates offered to pubs and live music venues last month.Michael Kill, the chief executive of the NTIA, which represents thousands of bars, nightclubs and pubs, said the bill increases could lead to more closures.“We have already lost over a third of the UK’s nightclubs, yet the venues that remain are being charged higher business rates than ever, with fewer businesses left to carry the burden and no access to relief,” he said. “This is not targeted support, it is policy that actively accelerates decline.”Kate Nicholls, the chair of UKHospitality, which represents thousands of restaurants, hotels and pubs, said: “These figures are damning in showing how crazy, distorting and broken business rates is. Successive governments have promised root and branch reform – these figures show it is time to deliver.”The NTIA said the number of nightclubs had fallen by a third since 2017 but the value of their properties had risen, so that the industry as a whole would pay more in business rates.The industry said it was already under pressure from cost increases including the rise in the minimum wage, the rise in energy costs and higher duty on alcohol, which it said was likely to push up drinks prices.“With alcohol duty rising in line with inflation and supplier costs continuing to increase, many businesses have little choice but to pass these costs on to consumers – despite already fragile trading condition,” Kill said.While airports will get a chunky share of transitional relief, Karen Dee, the chief executive of AirportsUK, the trade association for UK airports, said business rates increases were likely to mean price rises for flyers and less investment in airports.Dee said: “The chancellor has staked the UK’s growth on airports, and while the changes to transitional relief are very welcome, the sector’s business rates will still increase by over 100% and could force some to review billions of pounds of transformational investments across the UK and potentially puts thousands of jobs at risk in the longer term.”Explore more on these topicsBusiness ratesHospitality industryMusic industryHeathrow Airports AuthorityHeathrow airportTravel & leisureTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

The concerns were reported in a survey conducted in late 2025 by CIPS, an international trade body that represents 64,000 member organisations in procurement and supply chains across 180 countries.Bosses responsible for procurement said they were often the first within companies to notice rising prices or problems getting hold of goods. They said uncertainty and price volatility risked becoming a permanent feature of international trade rather than a temporary disruption, as the turmoil unleashed by the pandemic has been followed by geopolitical tensions around the world.Shipping and logistics is the area most likely to see significant price rises in 2026, according to the procurement bosses surveyed, with 22% of respondents reporting cost increases of more than 10% by the end of 2025.Nearly a fifth (18%) said they had seen similar price increases for computers and peripheral equipment, while 15% reported cost rises for transport equipment and 14% for electrical machinery and apparatus.View image in fullscreenChinese shipping containers at the Port of Los Angeles this month. The average spot shipping rate between Asia and the US west coast has soared.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersThese price rises and continued volatility are fuelling expectations of more inflationary pressure for consumers during 2026. Shoppers had already seen increases for some computers late last year, with Lenovo and Dell reportedly hiking prices by about 15%. In December, the price of some Dell laptops rose between $130 (£95) and $765, depending on the model and memory size, Business Insider reported.The average spot shipping rate between Asia and the US west coast jumped by nearly 30% between late December and early January. The rate increased to $2,145 for a 40ft (12-metre) equivalent unit (FEU), a standard shipping container, up from $2,757, according to the Freightos Baltic Index.Prices on shipping routes between Asia and the US east coast and Europe have also climbed in recent weeks.Ben Farrell, the chief executive of CIPS, said: “Procurement professionals are often the first to see cracks forming in the global trading system.”He added: “Volatility is no longer an exception. When logistics costs can swing by 20%-30% in weeks, those pressures inevitably ripple through to businesses and consumers alike.”View image in fullscreenA man passes a mural depicting Iranian soldiers near an anti-US and Israel billboard in Tehran on Thursday.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAInternational freight shipping costs were already on the rise and climbed further after increased tensions, stoked by Donald Trump’srecent threats to take over Greenlandand impose further tariffs on European allies as well as thepossibility of war between the US and Iran, sending investors fleeing totraditional safe haven assetssuch as gold and the Swiss franc.US tariffs and protectionist policies were highlighted as important causes of price volatility by those surveyed, who said they were directly being affected by shifting trade rules andChina-US tensions.Explore more on these topicsSupply chain crisisGlobal economyInternational tradeInflationConsumer spendingEconomicsShipping industrynewsShareReuse this content"

What’s next?’Stuart HeritageAs the 20th book in his Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is published, the author shows no signs of slowing down – scripting films, opening a bookshop and making plans to rebuild his hometownSun 1 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTShareWatching Jeff Kinney sign books is akin to watching an elaborate piece of performance art. Backstage at a theatre in Chester, where the author is continuing his UK tour, three folding tables heave under the weight of thousands of copies. Kinney wheels round the table on a swivel chair, signing as he goes. He is a picture of total focus.Today Kinney is signing copies of Partypooper, the 20th book in his blockbuster Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. Every copy bears the phrase “Over 300 million books sold”. To put that into perspective, Kinney has sold more books than Led Zeppelin have sold albums. If you’ve had – or been – a child of reading age at any point over the last couple of decades, Kinney is a rock star. And nowhere is that clearer than at his sold-out event later that evening, as he is custard-pied while a crowd of 800 children and parents scream with excitement.Kinney shows are a world away from the usual sedate author signings. This is a performance, with walk-on characters and audience participation so enthusiastic that one poor mum almost tore herself in half trying to do the splits. It’s impressive stuff, especially since Kinney claims not to be a natural. “I’m not the type of person who needs to stand in the spotlight,” he insists backstage. “I’m a writer. I chose that profession because I’m an introvert. So it’s a weird thing to be on stage, but these days, if you’re a children’s writer, you also need to learn to be an entertainer.”Formerly a software engineer, Kinney first created Wimpy Kid – about the various misadventures of titular middle school student Greg Heffley – for the browser game site Funbrain. Three years later, the first book was released and immediately became a sensation, thrilling children with its relatable characters and the sheer density of jokes. The Wimpy Kid books read like exceptionally well-crafted observational comedy routines, something that lures in children reluctant to delve into, say, bricklike, lore-heavy fantasy series.Now 54 years old, and greying at the temples, Kinney is both very tall and extremely polite. And, for someone who has to be richer than God, unflappably normal. He could quite easily pass as a friendly teacher, or someone who runs a small pottery business.Yet, at this point in his career, Kinney feels untouchable. Every new Wimpy Kid book is an event and while the pressure of maintaining such a beloved series for so long might get to some authors, Kinney wears it lightly. “I’ve got a whole world that I feel responsible for, and employees that I have. People have careers that come out of this engine, so I definitely need to keep the motor running. I’m aware of that, but I wouldn’t call it pressure. It’s a nice place to be.”View image in fullscreenJeff Kinney on stage in Cheshire.Photograph: Joel GoodmanAlthough the series has existed since 2007, Partypooper is just as funny and kinetic as any of his previous books, with a gleeful darkness that lingers around the edges. Greg Heffley remains possibly the most lovable psychopath in all of children’s literature; one scene in the new book sees him blow out a funeral candle in a crazed bid to have a wish granted.“Every year I ask the big questions,” he says. “What am I doing? Why am I doing this? Three days ago I was trying to state my goals. Consistency and longevity at a high level in comedy is my current goal. I think a lot about Bob Dylan. I’m certainly not trying to compare myself to Bob Dylan, but he just moves forward. And I think that’s a nice model.”Kinney has become the custodian of an entire franchise. As well as the books and the riotous shows he takes around the world (as soon as the Chester show finishes, he flies out for a leg in Germany), he also writes the screenplays for all of Disney’s Wimpy Kid movies (the latest, The Last Straw, came out in early December). He credits working across so many mediums for his ability to keep the books fresh.“My first few books are just like a collection of jokes,” he smiles. “I didn’t care that much about telling a good story. But when those books were adapted for the screen, I started learning about structure. It wasn’t until book nine that I even tried to tell a good story. And it wasn’t until book 12 that I started to get the hang of it. The first book that I’m proud of as a narrative is my 19th book, which only came out last year.”If that wasn’t enough to juggle, Kinney also has a sideline as a town planner. When his books started to take off, he used some of the funds to open a bookshop – An Unlikely Story – in his hometown of Plainville, Massachusetts. And when the store became a success he decided to branch out and apply the same formula to the entire region.View image in fullscreen“The downtown is very depressed,” he says. “The industry is gone, and now you’re left with this town where everybody lives, but they don’t have anything to do. So what we’re doing is we’re building. We just finished a beer garden, and now we’re gonna put in a pizza restaurant, and then we’re going to create a town green and some other things too.”When a series has enjoyed a run as long as Wimpy Kid’s, some authors can begin to feel restless. Kinney has toyed with the margins of his universe in recent years, with a spin-off series about Heffley’s best friend, and a collection of short stories. I ask him if he has an end goal, a number of books he’d like to hit before he moves on.“Right at this moment, I really am looking out over the horizon,” he replies, slowly at first. “There were two goals I wanted to reach. One was book 20, and the other was 300 million books in print. I didn’t ever think beyond that. And now I’ve gotta say, what’s next?”For a moment, I worry that he’s about to give me an unhappy exclusive and announce his retirement. But no. “When you look at what I’ve created here, it’s not so much a literary character as a cartoon character,” he goes on. “Cartoon characters tend to go on for a long time. I’m not embarrassed by it. You know, Charles Schulz did Peanuts for 50 years.”A quietly logical man, he writes his books with an elaborate process that involves obsessively journalling and then using a practice derived from engineering called Systematic Inventive Thinking to mine the journals for jokes. And this formula should allow Wimpy Kid to run and run.“It’s just such a privilege to have a long-running series because, you know, it’s hard to break in as a writer,” he says. “I’m very aware of how lucky I am to not have to introduce myself to the public when I have a new book. I’m more like a legacy person now, and I like that better. You know when you see photos of Schulz or Dr Seuss and they’re old? They’re looking a little bent over with their glasses on. I’m headed for that. I’m headed to my final form.”Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Partypooper by Jeff Kinney is published by Puffin. To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Whether in a professional, social or romantic setting, there is a particularly painful sting to the discovery that one has been judged undesirable in some way. If you have ever experienced proper rejection – and that would be most of us – it may stand out in your mind for a long time, like a boulder lodged in the landscape of memory.And it can hurt literally. The late anthropologist Helen Fisher, who studied human behaviour in the context of romantic love, showed that rejection and physical injury have much in common. In 2010 sheled a studyof people who had been recently rejected romantically. Functional MRI scans of their brains revealed that areas associated with distress and physical pain were more active. The passage of time did seem to reduce the pain response for Fisher’s participants, but for some people rejection can resonate for months or years. This overlap in the brain’s response to what we think of as physical and mental pain isn’t limited to romance. Social psychologist Naomi Eisenberger scanned the brains of people who were socially excluded from a ballgame in an experiment. Her results showed that “social pain is analogous in its neurocognitive function to physical pain, alerting us when we have sustained injury to our social connections”.From an evolutionary perspective, it is easy to understand why rejection hits so hard. The realisation that one has been socially excluded induces a sudden chill, like being cast out from a Palaeolithic campsite and left at the mercy of sabre-toothed predators. To be exiled from the warmth of the communal fire could have meant death for our ancient ancestors – so it was something to be avoided at all costs. While the spurned of modern Britain won’t usually have to contend with the dangers that social rejects of 30,000 years ago faced, the impulse to seek shelter in the company of others is strong and enduring. We yearn to be accepted. For 21st‑century Homo sapiens, though, recoiling from rejection may do more harm than good. In fact, strong and lasting negative emotional reactions to rejection often cause more damage than the rejection itself. In order to lead fulfilling lives, to figure out what we enjoy and are good at, we have to be prepared to try things – and to fail at them. Make avoiding rejection your priority and you’ll find yourself becoming more risk-averse and less spontaneous, with a paradoxically narrower social world.What if, rather than shrinking from rejection, we attempted to embrace it? What if instead of being slapped down by the wave, we tried to ride it? Not only is it possible to overcome the fear of rejection, but doing so can improve our psychological health too, leading to better social functioning and greater wellbeing. The key moves are acceptance and cognitive reframing: rejection happens to everyone, and can’t actually be avoided. Not only that, but it can be the means by which you learn and become more resilient. Keep that in mind, and you’ve already softened the blow. Cultivating equanimity in the face of disappointment has a long pedigree: in spiritual traditions such as Buddhism, meditation aims to bring about an attitude of lucid openness to the slings and arrows of life. But there are other, novel ways to respond, as one American entrepreneur showed.In 2012, Jia Jiang received a “no” from an investor that left him feeling crushed. Rather than wallow in his pain, he decided to learn to embrace his greatest fear by accumulating rejections over 100 days. He uploaded videos of himself making ridiculous requests, starting off by asking a total stranger if he could borrow $100. Over the course of his project, Jiang noted that his anxiety around rejection quickly diminished as he became desensitised. “It reminded me of the ancient Iron Fist technique in kung fu,” he wrote, “where a person repeatedly pummels hard objects with his or her fist to gain resistance to pain.” But beyond this increased psychological resilience, he also found that his sense of agency, awareness of possibility, social skill and delight in engaging with other people all flourished. Not only that, but as his outlook and demeanour shifted to one of greater openness and positivity towards the strangers he was approaching, he found that more and more people were actually sayingyesto his absurd proposals. When one doughnut chain employee agreed to his request for a set of doughnuts iced and arranged to look like the Olympic rings and gave them to him free, Jiang’s mission went viral.Throughout history, rejection has often functioned as a crucible, helping to forge some of the most extraordinary artistic movements, from impressionism to punk. A reject has less to lose and doesn’t have to behave in the way the group dictates, and from this can come a delicious freedom to play and make. The most dramatic form of rejection, exile, can generate the greatest innovation. Would the brilliance and influence of the Bauhaus group, or the strange sublimity of the surrealists, have been quite the same had they not been rejected at some point or another? And while there is plenty of evidence that social rejection has harmful cognitive effects, for those with a particular kind of self-conception, it can act as artistic rocket fuel. In 2013 academic Sharon Kimled a studyshowing that people with a strong sense of their own uniqueness as individuals experienced a boost in creativity after social rejection.Whatever your temperament, rejection is inescapable. Nobody gets to swerve it entirely, however rich, famous or beautiful they may be. Training ourselves to abandon the tendency to catastrophise after a setback – reacting as if we have been cast out from our encampment into the freezing tundra, when in reality we have merely been NFI’d to a birthday party – can transform the way we move in the world. Reframing things in a more optimistic way, while practising exposure, gives us the freedom to play. Embracing rejection means embracing being thrown back. So let us endeavour to bounce like a rubber ball, perhaps in an unforeseen direction, but comforted by the fact that we are in excellent company.Further readingRejection Proof: How I Beat Fear and Became Invincible Through 100 Days of Rejection by Jia Jiang (Harmony, £10.99)The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga (Allen & Unwin, £10.99)The Power of Letting Go: How to Drop Everything That’s Holding You Back by John Purkiss (Aster, £16.99)Explore more on these topicsPsychologyThe big ideafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cox himself is the star – an elegant, dapper presence – and his co-writer is veteran spaghetti western actor Gianni Garko.The story has obvious relevance to contemporary America, and a flash-forward makes some of this clear. But it is also inspired by theclassic novella of the same nameby Nikolai Gogol, a mysterious parable of greed and vanity about a man who travels around offering to buy the souls of dead serfs on various estates in pre-revolutionary Russia so landowners can lower their tax bills, but plans to claim that they are still alive and therefore pass himself off as a wealthy man.Cox transplants some of this tale to the American old west of the late 19th century. He plays Strindler, a spindly and cadaverous fellow with elaborate courtly manners, a fastidious suit and bowler hat. Strindler sometimes claims to be a government official and sometimes an itinerant preacher. Having checked in at a fly-blown hotel, he exerts himself to make the acquaintance of the local notables, including the sheriff and mayor, to whom he sycophantically loses at cards.Strindler has a proposition to make: he will pay bafflingly large amounts of money for lists of dead Mexicans who have died on their land or in their employ. This exploitative and racist world being what it is, there are an awful lot of Mexican names to be “farmed” in this way, and it is Strindler’s sinister plan to sell them on to government departments who want evidence that undesirable aliens are being excluded from American territory. But in another, stranger sense, Strindler is offering a kind of cleansing or redemption: he will take these dead people off their hands.Strindler is a kind of proto-ICE drifter, although with a distinctive, quaint kind of innocence, and for all that he is a crook through and through, Cox shows that Strindler is outranked in crookedness by pretty much everyone he meets. He is out of his depth, and never more so when challenged to a gunfight: a duel that ends in bloody chaos, after which the recording authorities take the view that one should print the legend and not the truth.Dead Souls has a distinctive indie-budget look, of which Cox makes a virtue by presenting the action almost as a theatrical chamber piece. Bizarre and fruity characters pop up on the parched landscape. Dead men will raise themselves and start singing. Sometimes Strindler will dream he has been catapulted into an American future during a third world war in which his services are needed to buy the names of dead Russians, Chinese and Peruvians.It is a diverting and watchable love letter to the spaghetti west of the movies, and a satirical thorn in the flesh of Trumpian politics.Dead Souls screened at theRotterdam film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmWesternsFilm adaptationsNikolai GogolRotterdam film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

We’re laughing!” There’s a lot of this reflexive shtick at the start ofStephen K Amos’s touring show: lots of thinking aloud about laughter, and reminding us that’s what we’re here to do. One routine asks whether and why animals laugh, and another – all amygdala this and endorphins that – considers what laughter does to our brains. Yet another drolly explores the Venn diagram that unites the laugh, the orgasm and the sneeze.This all bespeaks a certain confidence from the veteran that his 75-minute offering will keep the laughter flowing. And it does, if not in the most adventurous way. Later in the show he tells us that Now We’re Talking! is a departure for him; “I wanted to be more honest.” But the show is notable not for the novelty of its thinking, or any sense that we’re being granted intimacies. Its hallmark is convivial, consensual good fun, in which Amos ventures orthodox opinions and relatable observations about a-changin’ times, social media and dumbed-down modernity.So after the laughter material, the show scrolls back to Amos’s youth, the son of Nigerian immigrants navigating casual racism, harsh parental discipline and TV with three channels only and a night-time curfew. Compare that to nowadays, where everyone’s dimwit opinions are freely broadcast. “I’m not saying it was better in the old days,” protests Amos, reluctant to seem like a grumpy old man. But if it’s not what he’s saying, it’s what he’s implying.But at least he’s doing so amusingly. It may rely on fairly cheap funny-accent humour, but it’s hard to resist his routine about an African newcomer to the UK encountering a meat raffle. Elsewhere, there’s a twisty number aboutthe Dunning-Kruger effect, by which the ignorant overestimate their own intelligence. The thumbnail sketch of the comic’s upbringing, meanwhile – the home economics classes and unglamorous rubber-hose shower attachments – brings the 1970s pungently back to life. It may be familiar standup fare. But given Amos’s newfound interest in the science of laughter, there’s enough here to ensure his own show might serve as a case study.At The Trades Club, Hebden Bridge, 5 Feb; then touring.Explore more on these topicsStageComedyStephen K AmosreviewsShareReuse this content"

That is apparent in this lyrical two-hander, full of imagination and whimsy, about twins whose close sibling ties bring intimacy, ambition and fantasies of taking flight. But it also sets their place in the world: he is the genius of the family and she, by comparison, is defined as the “idiot.”Both Daisy (Jess Senanayake) and Luke (Tyrese Walters) are neurodivergent, growing up in a high-rise block, aged 11 when we first meet them. She is navigating dyslexia and ADHD, trying to live authentically within herself while Luke is in denial of his autism, and it takes some time to see him as anything but a clever and supportive brother.Blending poetry and movement, Jammz’s grime compositions bring this show infectiously to life. The young actors’ raps are impressive too, and there is an affectionate chemistry between them. But under Eleanor Manners’direction, the pace could be slower with more tonal nuance so you can absorb the drama and the beauty of Stevenson’s script.Movement and action as a whole could be clearer and sharper too. Even though the story blends realities – inner, outer, real and imaginative worlds – it takes a while to follow some scene switches. The set design by Erin Guan, comprising a curtain, a swing and a cardboard stereo system, is rather undefined too.View image in fullscreenSibling ties … Jess Senanayake and Tyrese Walters.Photograph: Chris SaundersThe twins seek escape and liberation of different kinds. Luke’s ambition is to be the first teenager on Mars, Daisy wants to train in circus acrobatics. The actors also voice several other roles, from teachers to parents. A lot is packed in, from parental violence and a mother with mental health issues to sibling rivalry. There is omniscient narration as well and it sometimes builds confusion, but perhaps the story and its switches are deliberately meant to be oblique and non-literal.When it works, it is absorbing and moving, such as a scene in which Daisy feels as if she is floating and seems finally to have found a home in circus training. Walters gives a lovely performance too of a protective but single-minded brother in denial of his own neurodivergence.As aSheffield Theatresand National Youth Theatre co-production, it is an idiosyncratic and infectious drama, affirming Stevenson as a uniquely gifted playwright.

At its centre are acrimoniously divorced couple Amanda and Elyot, who bump into each other while honeymooning with their new spouses. Soon the fierce love that first brought them together has rekindled and they abscond together, initiating a dangerous dance of desire and violence.View image in fullscreenPlaying for laughs … Hope Yolanda.Photograph: PRBoth the play and director Amy Gavin’s production are at their best when trembling on the knife-edge between carnality and cruelty. After a gratingly broad first act introduces us to the protagonists and their insipid new partners, things settle when we arrive in Amanda and Elyot’s Parisian bolthole and get drawn into their tumultuous relationship. Here there’s a sense of how quickly love can sour into contempt, as the pair alternately sizzle and spar, a slap never far from a kiss. Gavin’s intervention of projecting recorded images from the couple’s stormy marriage on the surface behind them unnecessarily hammers home what we can already see playing out.The strongest performance is from Her Productions’ artistic director Hannah Ellis Ryan as Amanda, her sophisticated sheen barely concealing a restless, prowling energy that’s unleashed when she reunites with Elyot. While Charlie Nobel doesn’t quite capture the charm that draws his ex-wife so irresistibly back to him, there’s a fizzing chemistry between the two that boils over into something more ugly. Played purely for laughs, Hope Yolanda’s twitchy Sybil and Jack Elliot’s decent-but-dull Victor seem like creatures from another world, wrenching the play back into the realm of awkward comedy when they interrupt their spouses’ love-hate tryst.Gavin has clearly made a choice to amp up the brutality with some wince-inducing instances of violence. These then sit jarringly alongside the play’s comic moments, which sometimes veer into the cartoonish. By pressing too hard on extremes this version sacrifices nuance and detail, struggling to make a case for why we should still care about Coward’s play almost a hundred years on.AtHope Mill theatre, Manchester, until 8 February; thenThe Dukes, Lancaster,from 24-28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreNoel CowardreviewsShareReuse this content"

Please confirm you aren’t just a pretty face hired to front it?Fabrice Maxime Sylvain Morvan considers my question, then laughs. I’m teasing: it definitely is Morvan narrating You Know It’s True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli.But as the recording of his book has been nominated for best audiobook, narration and storytelling recording at the 2026 Grammy awards – and Milli Vanilli are the only winners to have had their Grammy (given in 1990 for best new artist) rescinded, due to the revelation that the duo didn’t sing on their records – I do need confirmation.“It’s all me,” a smiling Morvan says. “I co-wrote the book with Parisa Rose, a journalist with the Los Angeles Tribune, and throughout I have been as truthful as I can possibly be.”Truth and lies feature through Morvan’s memoir: as half of Milli Vanilli he enjoyed pop stardom while living a lie, before being skewered by those demanding the truth. Almost everyone aged over 45 will probably have some memory of Milli Vanilli, so popular were they between October 1988 and November 1990: with three US No 1s, and more than 37m singles and albums sold in 1989 alone, they were positioned alongside Michael Jackson, George Michael and Madonna as pop’s most popular performers.We choreographed everything, and danced until our shoes were full of bloodIf 1989 was Milli Vanilli’s annus mirabilis then 1990 proved their annus horribilis: after their producer/svengali Frank Farian admitted they were “non-singing performers”. The duo were “cancelled” in today’s terms – Grammy rescinded, recording contract denuded, intense media and public opprobrium. Class action lawsuits under US fraud protection laws were served, while TV comedians ridiculed the photogenic performers.“It was an awful experience,” says Morvan, a youthful 59, speaking from his home in Amsterdam. “People hated us. And when we gave our press conference [in November 1990] after Frank had told the world our secret it felt like we were met by a media lynch mob.”View image in fullscreenGoing, going, gong … Fab Morvan with Rob Pilatus at the 1990 Grammy awards.Photograph: Frank TrapperFootage of the press conference makes for uncomfortable viewing: a baying crowd of predominantly white journalists shout questions and accusations at the duo, treating them like criminals. Morvan remains largely silent during the interrogation, seemingly shellshocked. His Milli partner, Rob Pilatus, tries to defend their position, stating: “We were poor, living in the projects – haveyouever lived in the projects?”No mercy was shown, and Pilatus and Morvan were left to suffer outrageous fortune’s slings and arrows. Pilatus never recovered, dying of an overdose, aged 33, in 1998, his post-stardom life being marked by addiction and a short spell in prison. His death might have signalled the end of one of pop’s most notorious stories, but instead, in recent years there has been a reconsideration of Milli Vanilli: both the exuberant Europop of the recordings, and the duo’s high-energy performances (“We choreographed everything,” says Morvan, “and danced until our shoes were full of blood”). Alongside this new appreciation, plenty have asked the question: did two young Black performers, ruthlessly exploited by white record executives, deserve such public humiliation?The reconsideration began with Luke Korem’s excellent 2023 feature-lengthdocumentary Milli Vanilli(currently streamingon iPlayer), followed by the 2023 German biopic Girl You Know It’s True (streaming on Prime), a far more engaging effort than recent hagiographic treatments of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. The interest these films generated encouraged Morvan to write his take on the story.“For the book I went all out because the truth will set you free,” says the French-born Morvan, his English fluent after years in Los Angeles. “People get sick from stress, from holding things inside – I know this from experience. My partner Tessa told me, ‘You have to tell the whole truth,’ but I’d been holding back because I didn’t want to throw Rob under the bus.I believe Rob died of a broken heart. He had been abandoned as a baby and he now felt abandoned as an adult“But, at the same time, I had to free myself and tell my story. It’s a combination of things – a dream and a nightmare. I experienced both. As Rob is no longer here, I wondered how could I communicate with him and I thought I will write him a letter. And that is how the book starts.”Morvan’s book describes his upbringing in a dysfunctional, Parisian Guadeloupean family, and then follows his teenage relocation to Munich (seeking work as dancer and choreographer), where he encounters Pilatus. Their athletic beauty helped the duo find work dancing for German pop singers and hosting club nights. They decided to form a band and were introduced by a local musician to Farian, a Frankfurt-based music industry magus responsible for Boney M, among others. Farian had already recorded Girl You Know It’s True with vocalists, but his problem was they weren’t remotely photogenic. Upon encountering Morvan and Pilatus, Farian proffered a contract.Morvan’s German was poor, so he couldn’t read the contract. But Pilatus, who was born to a German mother and US GI father (and initially raised in an orphanage), insisted they sign it. Morvan says he and Pilatus believed they would sing on their records; Farian, who died in 2024, had denied this, saying he employed them solely as performers. With a Faustian contract signed, the duo set off on the road to fame, if not fortune.“I’ve never received a cent from those millions of records and CDs and tapes that Milli Vanilli sold,” says Morvan. “And today our streaming numbers are huge, but the contract ensures we get nothing.”Farian had used similar tactics with Boney M: Bobby Farrell, the quartet’s frontman, was a dancer who never sang on the act’s records. By 1988, with Boney M’s European chart success long over, Farian was desperate to unleash Milli Vanilli: Girl You Know It’s True initially broke in Germany, before reaching the top three in the UK and US.Clive Davis, then the US’s most powerful record executive, signed Milli Vanilli to his Arista label, and soon the duo’s videos were on high rotation on MTV. With Farian working overtime, Milli Vanilli scored hit after hit. Morvan and Pilatus rocketed from poverty to penthouse: in Munich they had shoplifted food; in Beverly Hills they drove Ferraris. Blasted on cocaine, Pilatus declared himself in a Time interview the new Elvis Presley, and more talented than Paul McCartney.Yet rumours circulated suggesting the duo weren’t the ones singing the songs – due, in part, to the fact that both spoke heavily accented English. At a 1989 concert in Bristol, Connecticut, broadcast live on MTV, the vocal tape for Girl You Know It’s True started skipping, and Morvan and Pilatus were forced to flee the stage. And then, in early 1990, they won the Grammy.View image in fullscreenNo longer silent … Milli Vanilli at their infamous press conference in November 1990.Photograph: MediaPunch Inc/Alamy“The thing is, we never wanted to win it,” says Morvan. “Because the criteria for the Grammys is that you have to sing on the record. And we didn’t sing on the record. We go to the show and were moved to what is called the ‘camera seats’. I realised we might win and my heart started racing, and then, when they called out our name, something exploded in the pit of my stomach.”The end was nigh when the puppets turned against the puppeteer, demanding more money and insisting they sing on their sophomore album. When Farian refused to compromise, the duo threatened to work with a new producer. “But Frank was always two steps ahead of us,” says Morvan.Farian promptly held the now notorious press conference and revealed all. “Hoax” shouted a headline in the LA Times. Radio stations removed Milli Vanilli’s songs, MTV dropped their videos, Arista deleted their album. “Lies take the elevator while truth takes the stairs,” reflects Morvan. “I knew at some point truth would catch us.”The duo soldiered on, releasing the Rob & Fab album in 1992 on a tiny record label. Here, they shared the vocals while Morvan co-wrote most of the songs, but the public was unwilling to forgive them and the album sold poorly. Pilatus fell deeper into addiction, while Morvan focused on a solo career as a singer-songwriter, paying the bills by teaching French on the side. The duo did reunite with Farian in 1998 in an attempt to help the struggling Pilatus, but he died before anything developed. “I believe he died of a broken heart,” says Morvan. “He had been abandoned as a baby and he now felt abandoned as an adult.”Scottish rappers, deaf composers and an AI song called Zygotic Washstands: the biggest hoaxes in popRead moreMorvan relocated to Europe 16 years ago, met Tessa, a Dutch woman who had no idea of his past, and started a family. Today, as well as releasing his own music, he now owns the rights to the name Milli Vanilli: “For a long while I wasn’t allowed to use it. Now I’m playing concerts to thousands of people with a band and me singing, no backing tapes.” Morvan wants his book to serve as a warning of how ruthless the music industry can be.“In French we say ‘avec le temps’[with time]. People now realise how we went so high then dropped so low.” He shakes his head at the memory, then smiles and says: “I’m a lucky guy – I love my partner and four children and I love what I do. I’m not bitter. I feel blessed.”If, this week, Morvan again wins a Grammy it will signal one of pop’s most remarkable resurrections. And if he doesn’t, he has already pulled off a larger victory, the marionette who became his own man.You Know It’s True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli by Fab Morvan and Parisa Rose is published by the Los Angeles Tribune.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On her return trip, she accepts a lift from a polka band. Its leader is played byJohn Candy, one of O’Hara’s stablemates – along with Martin Short,Eugene Levyand Gilda Radner – from her early days in Toronto’s improvisational comedy troupe Second City.To misplace a child once may be regarded as a misfortune. To do so twice looks like carelessness. Then again, plausibility is no match for the pressure to repeat a $477m hit – and so it was that Kevin was again estranged from his family in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992). O’Hara transformed maternal despair into frantic comedy once more.The role brought her fame but was not typical of her work. Eccentrics suffused with vanity, mischief or vulnerability were much more O’Hara’s style.Before Home Alone, she had found a wide audience in Tim Burton’s comedyBeetlejuice (1988). She played Delia Deetz, a pretentious sculptor who moves with her husband and stepdaughter into a creaky Connecticut house whose previous occupants – now ghosts – plot to evict them.In the film’s standout sequence, the family and their dinner party guests are suddenly possessed and forced to sing and dance toHarry Belafonte’s calypso hit Day-O (the Banana Boat Song). As the first to be turned into a kind of human marionette, O’Hara’s blend of horror, embarrassment and slow-dawning rapture isa delirious slapstick joy. In her review of the film, the criticPauline Kaelsingled out the actor’s “sexy evil eyes” and called her “the possessor of the freakiest blue-eyed stare since early Gene Wilder”. O’Hara returned as Delia in the sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024), roaming the underworld after being fatally bitten by asps.View image in fullscreenCatherine O’Hara and Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone, 1990. Her panicked cry of ‘Kevin!’ became world famous.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarThe most deranged of O’Hara’s creations, however, was Moira Rose in the popular sitcom Schitt’s Creek (2015-20). This grande dame, former soap star and woman of many wigs, each of them named, is reduced to sharing cramped rooms in an Ontario motel with her doting husband and two spoilt adult children after the family loses its fortune. Dreaming of recapturing her former opulence and status, she hitches her wagon to dubious projects including a horror sequel calledThe Crows Have Eyes 3: The Croweningand acommercial for ghastly fruit wine(“It tastes like amoxicillin”) in which an increasingly sozzled Moira mangles the vintner’s name in ever more tongue-twisted ways.Instances of her cuckoo behaviour across the show’s six series were innumerable, her couture wardrobe incongruous in the folksy setting, her accent mystifyingly wayward: she might airily pronounce her son David’s name as “Dare-vid”, or render “baby” as “bare-bare”. For O’Hara, this verbal crazy-paving was part of the point. “When people try to imitate that character,” she said, “the mistake they make is to be consistent.” Still, Moira was rarely less than a loving mother. “What have I told you about putting your body on the internet?” she asks her daughter in one episode. “Never! Never without proper lighting.”O’Hara won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her performance in the series, which was co-written by Levy and his son, Dan Levy, who played her husband and son respectively. O’Hara and Eugene Levy, who briefly dated in their improv days, also sparked together magically in four astute and exceptionally funny films directed byChristopher Guestand co-written by him and Levy.Waiting for Guffman (1996) concerns a Missouri am-dram society whose members believe that their new musical celebrating local history (there is a production number about the manufacture of foot-stools) has Broadway potential. In keeping with the film’s genial tone, O’Hara’s evident love for her character, a travel agent and atrocious actor, generates a warmth that precludes cruelty.View image in fullscreenCatherine O’Hara in the television comedy Schitt’s Creek, 2019.Photograph: CBC/ITV/Kobal/ShutterstockIn Best in Show (2000), she and Levy play a married couple whose trip with their terrier to a dog show is beset with problems, beginning when a lack of funds sees them downgraded at their hotel from a suite to a broom cupboard.They were a couple again, albeit estranged, inA Mighty Wind (2003), about a memorial concert of folk musicians. Reunited for the gig, their characters Mitch and Mickey provide the touching emotional undercurrent of this silly but painstakingly authentic film, before going their separate ways. O’Hara, as Mickey, is last seen performing a song about catheters at a medical supplies trade show.For Your Consideration (2006)was the only one of her films with Guest not to adopt the mockumentary format, though it was no less hilarious for that. O’Hara is the humble veteran whose head is turned by rumours that she may receive an Oscar nomination for playing a dying matriarch in a modest indie drama. Soon, she is wearing red leather numbers and undergoing plastic surgery that fixes her mouth in a rictus grin. The part played to O’Hara’s speciality: the comedy of delusion.While the structure and plot points of Guest’s films were committed to paper, the lion’s share of the material was improvised by the cast, and it was not unusual for the finished 90-minute product to have emerged from as many as 60 hours of raw footage.“To me, the most rewarding improvising is having agreed on an idea beforehand, where the scene might go, who your character is, or what might possibly be funny about your character, and at the same time be completely open to the other people because you’re not alone,” O’Hara said.In his book Improv Nation, Sam Wasson calls her “one of the most fluid improvisers of her generation. Others may be crazier; none were as elegantly at ease.”She was born and raised in Toronto, the sixth of seven children. Her mother was an estate agent and her father worked for Canadian Pacific Railways. Their sense of humour, she said, informed hers. “My father told great jokes he brought home from the office and my mother imitated everybody. I like to think I’m a combination.”She was educated at Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute, Toronto, and auditioned for the Second City company only to end up as a waitress. Eventually, she was appointed understudy for Radner, who was dating O’Hara’s brother. Explaining her initial approach to improv, O’Hara said: “My crutch was … when in doubt, play insane. Because you didn’t have to excuse anything that came out of your mouth. It didn’t have to make sense.”Between 1976 and 1984, the sketch show SCTV, a television spin-off of Second City, became a cult success, earning O’Hara and her fellow writer-performers an Emmy in 1982.In Martin Scorsese’s zippy black comedy After Hours (1985), she drove an ice-cream van through Manhattan as part of the nocturnal hunt for the film’s hero, a computer programmer falsely suspected of murder. She was a gossipy journalist in Heartburn (1986), directed byMike Nicholsand based onNora Ephron’s semi-autobiographical novel about her marriage to the journalist Carl Bernstein. She was also in Warren Beatty’s comic-strip adventure Dick Tracy and Alan Alda’s comedy Betsy’s Wedding (both 1990).Most recently, she was impressive in very different roles in two 2025 TV hits: as a former studio boss modelled on Sony’s Amy Pascal in Seth Rogen’s film-industry comedy The Studio, and in the second season of the zombie drama The Last of Us as therapist to the hero, played by Pedro Pascal.O’Hara’s many voice performances included Chicken Little (2005), Spike Jonze’s live-action adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are (2009) and The Wild Robot (2024). She also provided voices in two stop-motion gothic animated films from the Burton stable: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), directed by Henry Selick, and Burton’s 2008 feature-length version of his own 1984 short Frankenweenie. Her various roles in the latter included “Weird Girl” – a fair description of the niche she carved for herself.She is survived by her husband, the production designer Bo Welch, whom she met on the set of Beetlejuice and married in 1992, by their children, Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings, including the singer Mary Margaret O’Hara.Catherine Anne O’Hara, actor, born 4 March 1954; died 30 January 2026Explore more on these topicsFilmUS televisionSchitt's CreekCanadaComedy filmsTim BurtonMartin ScorseseobituariesShareReuse this content"

Now sober, she is enjoying another reinventionSun 1 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTShareDenise Welch doesn’t seem the kind of woman who would turn up with an entourage. But here she is having her hair primped in a makeshift changing room by two people. One tickling her fringe, the other tweaking her tufts. Blimey, I say, have you got two assistants? She grins. “No. There are three.” And now it turns out she’s got a fourth. I offer to make her a cup of coffee. She warns me she’s fussy. “Three teaspoons of Coffee-Mate, please.”Welch is having a moment. She calls it, with a fabulously camp flourish, her renaissance. The actor and Loose Women regular has hardly been invisible in recent years. But this is on another level. For most of the 2000s, she has been best known for dishing out blithe opinions about anything and everything, and being the mother of the 1975’s frontman, Matty Healy. Now, though, it’s the acting that’s getting the attention. Earlier this month, she returned to the drama series Waterloo Road as the hopeless French teacher Steph Haydock after a 15‑year absence. This time around, she’s a supply teacher and is even more hopeless. Welch has also got parts in the new Russell T Davies drama series Tip Toe, the Josh Pugh sitcom Stepping Up, both on Channel 4, and the adaptation of Graham Norton’s novel Forever Home.And there’s more. At 67, Welch has become an unlikely fashion darling. Last month she featured in the ultra‑trendy counterculture magazine i-D, and in November she became a party correspondent for GQ, working the red carpet at the Man of the Year awards in blacked-out wraparound sunnies and thigh-high Off‑White boots. Then there was the wedding of Charli xcx and the 1975 drummer George Daniel in Sicily. Forget the A-listers in attendance; the young and beautiful celebs were queueing up to take selfies with Welch.It’s great to see her in such good form because it has not always been this way. Despite her lust for life, Welch has struggled for many years with depression and addiction. For much of that time, she was monstered by the press. But not any more.I let wonderful stylists put these weird and wonderful things on me … and suddenly you’re a different personView image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian. Earrings: Pond London.Jacketandtrousers: Holland Cooper. Shirt:The Shirt Company.Tieandtie clip: Paul Smith. Heels:Terry de Havilland. Sunglasses: Jacquemus fromLinda FarrowWhat’s brought about the change? Well, she says, she sort of willed it. “I’m not a manifester, but I sort of did manifest it. I spoke to my agent and I said I want 2025 to be a bit of a renaissance for me. I’d always been jealous of people.” She pulls to a stop, caveating the next sentence before it’s even left her mouth. “You will write this like I’m saying it, won’t you, because it can sound really naff? So, I’d always been a bit jealous of people who had a team – you know when you see people turning up at a photoshoot and they have a team? I’d never had a team. Anyway, I’d lost a bit of weight and I was feeling mentally very good in myself, and everything depends on my mental health, so I thought I’m going to get my own stylist and hairdresser, and I’m going to get a publicist and I’m going to change direction.” Has she got the money to pay for her team? “No! But it’s not like it’s every day. It’s not like I have the glam team to my house every morning.”So, with her entourage she’s basically turning into Snoop Denise? “I am! And I’m loving this fashionista era that I’ve been thrust into. When I got asked to do a fashion shoot for i-D magazine, Matty said to me, ‘That’s great, Mum, even I’ve never done i-D!’ I love the fact that I know nothing about high fashion. So I let these wonderful stylists put these weird and wonderful things on me. You have a great photographer and suddenly you’re a different person.”As we’re talking, her publicist reminds her she has not changed out of her vintage Chanel top, and the Guardian needs to return it. She apologises, rushes off, and returns in a lovely striped roll-neck. “It’s from Florence & Fred at Tesco.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian.To many, Welch isn’tjustan actor, Loose Woman and the mother of a rock star – she is also a prime hun, feted by the Instagram account @Loveofhuns, which celebrates Britain’s glitziest and kitschiest pop-cultural icons.I tell her I’m not completely au fait with hun culture, and ask her to explain it. “The hun thing is hilarious to me. It’s quite hard to describe. Carol Vorderman is a hun. Alison Hammond is a hun. I’m a hun.” So what is it? “Gays and huns all mesh together. I’ve always had that following. You’ve got to remember as well that my dad was a heterosexual drag artist so he went out as Raquel. Raquel Welch. He loved the fact that I was an actress. He encouraged me. He knew I wouldn’t be a very good teacher, so it’s been great that I’ve been able to play a rubbish teacher in Waterloo Road.”View image in fullscreenWelch (centre) as teacher Steph Haydock in Waterloo Road, a role to which she has returned this year.Photograph: BBCWelch is hugely entertaining and can talk for England. But her conversation is hardly linear. Even her detours have detours. So a question about hun culture takes in her childhood in the north-east; her father, Vin, a sweet factory owner by day and drag queen by night; her plan to become a teacher because she only needed one A-level; the unconditional offer to go to Mountview theatre school in London; her early days in theatre, the delight Vin took in her chosen profession, and his liking nothing more than a night out with her gay friends because they knew how to have fun.So what is hun culture, I ask again, some time later. “Ah, yes!” She laughs. What qualities do you need? “You’ve got to be loved by the gays. So, if you think of the people the gays love. It started with me when I played a bitch in Coronation Street. The gays love a bitch. Joan Collins’ Alexis would have made her a hun.” Huns are not known for their political correctness. They are often loved for their unfiltered take on life. Which is true of Welch – to an extent.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

That was her first serious brush with fame. “You’ve got to remember when Natalie married Des Barnes it was watched by almost 20 million people. That’s athirdof this country. When I go to watch Matty at the O2, there’s maybe 20,000 people there. When you think of 20million… There was nowhere you went where you weren’t known.”View image in fullscreenAs Natalie Barnes in Coronation Street, 1999.Photograph: ITVDid she enjoy the fame? “Fame in isolation is no fun. I would hate to be famous without a talent to back it up. But there are parts of fame I’d hate to give up.” Such as? “I like being in a lift and smiling at somebody, and them saying, “Eeeh, you know that’s really made my day! Wait till I tell my daughter that I met you.Eeeh!’”It’s little wonder that Welch is ambivalent about fame. Few people have been so badly burnt by the press, though she didn’t half help matters. “I put myself in situations over the years that I’m not proud of as a result of addiction. Fourteen years sober, I feel like a different person.” For more than a decade she was addicted to alcohol and cocaine. The surprising thing, she says, is that it all happened so late in life. Throughout her 20s she didn’t have the slightest trouble with drink or drugs. Sure, she liked a bev on a Friday night, maybe even a Saturday, too, but her thing was clubbing. She loved going out with gay friends and dancing the night away. Throughout this time, she says, she was the model professional.But, at 31, and married to her second husband, the actor Tim Healy, she gave birth to Matty. Welch thought she would bond with him instantly. As for her friends, they thought she’d be back out clubbing within weeks. But neither happened. She was struck by an extreme form of postnatal depression that has never left her. “Many, many women will make a full recovery, and it will never darken their doors again. But I’ve lived with that illness for 36 years.” And you’d never had depression before? “Never. Not one day. I used to say, ‘Ooh, I’m really depressed’ if I didn’t get a job, but that’s completely different to the illness.”Postnatal depressionaffects so many women, she says, yet hardly any money is spent on research or support. “If men had postnatal depression, there’d be a clinic on every corner. There are so many advances made, but it’s being made on a budget of fourpence. They’re now finding a huge connection between ADHD and postnatal depression.” Welch was diagnosed with ADHD four years ago.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian. Blouse: Pre-loved Chanel fromDesigner Exchange. Bonnet:Emma BrewinShe struggled with her depression for the best part of a decade before turning to drink and drugs. “That didn’t happen till my late 30s. I was self-medicating.”In 2024, she had her first bad episode in five years, and had to withdraw from the Christmas production of Peter Pan at the Theatre Royal in Nottingham. Her depression tends to come with no warning and no external trigger. “I can be talking to somebody, not even thinking about how I feel, and the atmosphere changes. I get a tingling in my palm and a metallic taste in my mouth, and within 30 seconds everything I’d been looking forward to goes and there is zero joy. It’s down on me, and I can do nothing about it until it lifts.”Is she always confident that it will lift? “When you’ve had it so many times, you have the security of knowing it will leave.” But she knows that’s not the case for everybody. “People who take their life usually do not want to die; they just want to stop the pain.” Has she ever thought she would take her own life? “Every depressive will tell you you have it in your back pocket as a solace: ‘If I don’t get better I can do that.’ But I never seriously thought about that because I had enough experience of always getting better, and I knew outside these episodes I loved my fucking life.”Although she was convinced that drink and drugs helped her get through her depression, she eventually realised substance abuse was a double whammy. Welch became unreliable, volatile and confrontational. She gives me an example from her early days on Loose Women. “When you’re drinking you get defensive, so before the press would say anything, I would say, ‘Anyway, what’swrongwith somebody in their 40s being out all night and partying and coming straight to work now and again?What’s wrong with that?’” You’d say that on the show? “Yes!I had to own it.”Worst of all, she says, she became so boring. Was she oblivious to that at the time? “Of course I was. You think you’re the most interesting person on the planet. It never occurs to you how boring you are. I don’t know how I’ve still got any friends.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian. Earrings:Giovanni Raspini. Jacket:Lurline. Tights: stylist’s own. Heels:Charles & KeithWelch became tabloid gold. Barely a week passed without a story of inappropriate behaviour splashed across the red-tops and the women’s mags. “Bella and Best hated it when I got sober because they didn’t have any front pages any more!” Welch didn’t know where the stories were coming from. Private conversations were finding their way into the tabloids, and she became suspicious of those closest to her. “I was so paranoid. You don’t trust anybody. It was, like, how do they know I was there?”Did she challenge family and friends? “I didn’t question anybody in my family, but I questioned friends.” Did she fall out with any? “Erm, possibly not fall out,” she says uncertainly. “I thought that maybe they’d inadvertently been among journalists and said some things. I’d go, ‘But you were the only person who knew that’ and if they said, ‘I would never say that’, I had to believe them. I was going mad.”Welch only discovered the truth a decade later when the police presented her with the evidence. It was shocking, and went way beyond conventional phone hacking. “They were putting bugs in my hotel rooms. I didn’t have to prove my hacking because the guy who hacked me, Graham Johnson, the former investigations editor at the Sunday Mirror, came forward andbecame poacher turned gamekeeper. I’ve met him and we’ve made peace. He was the one who witnessed private investigators coming out of my hotel room having planted a listening device. He was just the messenger. The people who ordered the hacking have never even been to court, and that fucks me off hugely.”She says photographers have since apologised about the manner in which they pursued her. “The paps have said to me, ‘We felt sorry for you in those days because we were told to go after you.’” Because they knew you were vulnerable? “Because everybody would believe everything they said. So, if I came out of a restaurant and closed my eyes in a shot and was sober, they’d put, ‘Denise fell out of the restaurant’ and if I said, ‘No, I didn’t, I was sober’, nobody would believe me. I’ve always said if I’m in a nightclub and I’m doing something I shouldn’t and a press person is there and they capture me, hands up, gov! That’s my fault. But if they’re getting that information by putting a bug in your hotel room … ” She trails off.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian. Jumpsuit: Pre-loved Isabel Marant fromDesigner Exchange. Rings and earrings: bothLO CollectionOn the day the twin towers were attacked in New York, Welch was filming. That evening she met up with friends in a bar. “They were worried that my depression was going to kick in, so they said come up to London and we’ll look after you. We went to a bar and I came out of a toilet cubicle and there was this beautiful Indian girl and she said, ‘Oh God, you’re Denise Welch, aren’t you? I’m a big fan of yours.’ I said, ‘Thank you so much. Isn’t it a horrible time?’” The woman offered to buy Welch a drink, and she accepted. “She said she was on her own, and I introduced her to my friends. She was this poor little rich girl who said her dad had a boat on the Thames and asked whether we’d all like to go on it one day, and I’m thinking, absolutely! Anyway, being me, at the end of the night I gave her my phone number and said, ‘Please stay in touch.’ Every day for pretty much three weeks this girl, Nyra, called me. Could I go to this or that? And I’d be, like, ‘Yes, I’m just bathing Louis, then I’m running Matty to school.’ After three weeks I went to do a photoshoot in Spain. And I got the dreaded Saturday afternoon phone call saying we’re running a story about you tomorrow. I got my friend to go to King’s Cross station, where you used to get the first papers at 10.30pm, and he said, ‘It’s not good.’ I wasdevastated. It turned out this person had been a journalist sent to entrap me into a friendship for three weeks.”What was the story? She’d prefer not to say. “It just was not good. It’s stuff that you’d say to a person you thought was a friend.” She’s becoming tearful. “I get upset thinking about it. It’s horrible.” It’s so much worse when your instinct is to trust people, I say. “Yes, and I’m a people pleaser.” It’s true. For all her willingness to mouth off, Welch likes to be liked.Matty and I have a great understanding of each other’s psyche. We have a very close relationshipDid she ever see the woman again? “No, I didn’t. I picked up the phone at 3am, when a bolt of lightning made me realise who it was. She said, ‘Hello’ and I just said, ‘Well, you’ve got your blood money. I hope your parents are very, very proud of you.’ And that was it. For years, I’d thought it was coincidental that she turned up … I didn’t realise I’d been entrapped.”In the end, Welch received compensation from a number of news organisations after the police presented her with the evidence. “You sit at Putney police station and there’s a spreadsheet of years of your life, phone calls you made, places they’d rented across from you to spy on you for two weeks. And you’re thinking,oh my God!”It was after Welch met Lincoln Townley, who became her third husband, that she finally got sober. Townley, then a PR and marketing manager at Stringfellows, was also struggling with addiction. The tabloids labelled him her alcoholic toyboy (he is 14 years younger than Welch) and suggested their relationship had no chance of lasting. Both are now into their 15th year of sobriety. “My marriage to Lincoln is the bedrock of my life,” Welch says. Townley is now a successful artist whose work is collected by the likes of Michael Caine and Al Pacino. It has not just been an incredible renaissance for Welch; it has been for Townley, too.Has marriage been important in her life? “Yes! I’ve hadthreeof them!” When I mention her first, to the actor David Easter (who played Pat in Brookside), she steers me away from it. “That was not very long-lived. But my marriage to Tim was one of 24 years, and we have two wonderful children and we’re still friends. I never consider my marriage to Tim a failure. Lincoln and I are very good friends with him and Jo, his wife. She’s a great stepmum to the kids.” Louis, Welch’s younger son from her marriage to Healy, is also an actor.View image in fullscreenDenise Welch with her sons, Louis (left) and Matty.Photograph: Courtesy of Denise WelchLike his mother,Matty Healyhas spent much of his life in the public eye – partly because of his own success and partly because of who he has dated, including FKA twigs and Taylor Swift. He has also experienced substance abuse (in 2018, he admitted he had been addicted to heroin) and has a knack for courting controversy.When I mention this she stiffens. “I don’t like to talk about Matty’s personal life because it comes back and bites me on the arse every time with the press.” Do she and Matty share their experiences? “Matty understands what I’ve been through, for sure. I’m very proud of my kids and they love me very much, but I’m very respectful of their lives and it’s up to them to talk about it.” Has she advised him on his issues with addiction? “Obviously it’s something that we have shared and it means we have a great understanding of each other’s psyche. We have a very close relationship.” And she zips up. “That’s it.”For all that she prides herself on not caring what she says, Welch clearly does. And for good reason. She doesn’t like hurting people unnecessarily, she wants to protect her family, and she couldn’t have had a more chastening experience of press intrusion. But however hard she tries to self-censor these days, she doesn’t always succeed. Last July, on Andy Cohen’s Bravo show Watch What Happens Live, he asked what her reaction was to The Tortured Poets Department, the album Taylor Swift wrote about Matty after they separated (one song was called The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived). Welch replied,“Obviously, on pain of death can I talk about that episode, but not being her mother-in-law is a role that I’m glad I lost.” She paused, before quickly adding, “Not that I have anything against her at all.” But by then the damage was done. She added that Matty had moved on and was “very happy with his amazing fiancee”, the California model and singer Gabbriette Bechtel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Titlow/The Guardian. Dress: Issey Miyake fromSelfridges.Earringsandbangles: Dinosaur Designs. Boots:KaldaIs it true that part of her new fashion icon status is down to Bechtel? She looks puzzled. Well, I say, I hear she’s passing some of the stuff that she gets sent on to you. “Oh, listen! She’s a supermodel. Of course she gets sent lots of clothes and of course me and her mum are going to have some.Absolutely! I love her, and I’m very happy for the pair of them.”Is she a better prospective daughter-in-law than Taylor Swift?“I’m pleading the fifth!” she says.We talk about Loose Women, which has just returned after ITV announced swingeing cuts. “We were all sad about the cuts. Not for us but for the whole team – 200 people lost their jobs. I did the show yesterday and now we’re all together – This Morning, Lorraine and everything – there’s a camaraderie. So, yes, we’re disappointed about some of the things, but change happens.”Anyway, Loose Women is only one of many things keeping her busy, what with all the new acting roles and magazine shoots. It’s funny, Welch says, she thinks she might well be better known today than she was in her Corrie heyday a quarter of a century ago.I ask if it’s true that, at Charli xcx and George Daniel’s wedding, she didn’t have a clue who the A-listers lining up for selfies with her were? She giggles. “Well,youwouldn’t!” Who were the most famous people you were photographed with that you didn’t recognise? “Well, Alex Consani, the supermodel. What’s that singer called? Troye Sivan. And Rachel Sennott. Now I do know who they are, it’s, like,oh myGod! They’re fuckinghuge! Rachel Sennott does the kind of work I want to do. Troye Sivan has got 16 million followers!” She whoops with delight. Did they know who you were? “They knew I was Matty’s mum. I just thought they were a lovely bunch of people.”Drunk people are the most boring people in the entire universe. I want to smash their faces in. And I was one of themTrolls scoffed at the idea of her being at the wedding, she says, but she was always going to be there. “I’ve known George since he was 12 because George is Matty’s best friend. The 1975 started in my garage. I fed them, I watered them, they stayed at our house. That was why I was at George and Charli’s wedding. It was wonderful.”Was the event heaving with drink and drugs, as people were speculating online? “No!” she says, seemingly shocked. “I don’t drink!” That’s what I was thinking, I say – I’d assumed it would have been a hedonist’s heaven, and was wondering how she coped. “Well, no, because George and Charli aren’t hedonistic. And if there was, I wasn’t aware of it. Lincoln and I will be at any party if it’s people we love, but as soon as the madness starts– and I’m talking about the madness now being three glasses of wine because I can’t be around drunk people – we do an Irish or French exit and we’re off.”View image in fullscreenWith her son Matty Healy in 2023 …View image in fullscreen… and her husband Lincoln Townley last year. Photographs: Justine Palmer; Justin Goff. Both GettyIs she ever tempted by booze these days? “I have no desire to join in at any event on the drinking front. We can’t be around drunk people because they are the mostboringpeople in the entire universe and I want to smash their faces in. And I was one of them. And when you become sober you realise how little other people have to drink before that ‘I’m going to punch you’ phase starts. And these are people that you love.”Her car’s here. Welch is worried we’ve accentuated the negative. “You will make out that I’m a really fun person as well, won’t you?” Impossible not to, I say. “I’d love you to mention the lovely things coming up, too.” Will do, I say. “And how excited I am about the future?” Yep. “And how good I feel mentally at the moment.” Of course.Denise Welch: ‘Who would I like to say sorry to? The people I hurt when I was addicted to alcohol and cocaine’Read moreBefore you go, though, I say, I heard you had a funny story about Michael Caine? “Eh?” she says. And then she remembers. “Oh, yes. We’re very friendly with Michael and [his wife] Shakira because Michael is a huge fan of Lincoln’s work. We went to his 90th birthday and Shakira asked me to say a few words, and I thought how canIsay a few words at Michael Caine’s birthday? And Tom Cruise and all thesepeopleare there. And I thought I can’t do it, Ican’t. And then Joan Collins got up and made people laugh. And I thought, ‘Oh, I can’t have that!’ And I suddenly got up and found myself becoming the Bernard Manning of the room, and Tom Cruise literally had his napkin out crying-laughing at me doing Bernard Manning-type jokes.”Can she tell me one? “OK. Well, this one I personalised it and pretended it was about them. So Michael hears a parcel coming in the post and he runs downstairs and he shouts to Shakira, ‘Amazing, the Olympic condoms have come, and I’m going to wear the gold one tonight!’ And Shakira says, ‘Well, why not wear the silver one, and come fucking second for a change!’”Welch puts on her fake fur and prepares to head off into the cold night.One more thing, she says on her way out. “I want to say to people that you can still have a wonderful life with mental illness.”I know, I say, all the best people have mental illness.“Yes!” she roars. “They do.”Waterloo Road is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The project has been tantalisingly dangled as an opening for some years, then delayed umpteen times, because, quite understandably, erecting a purpose-built, gargantuan, multi-floor Willy Wonka’s Booze Factory in the West End of London for a corporate behemoth is no easy feat. Imagine the layers of global, bureaucratic, cross-platform multi-media team Zooms that had to happen to hone the ultimate Guinness experience. So many Is to dot and Ts to cross, particularly, because food is a central part of the venture, with two restaurants on site –The Porter’s TableandGilroy’s Loft– where exec chef Pip Lacey is serving non-challenging yet hearty menus, as well as acourtyard pie stallbyCalum Franklin.View image in fullscreenSafe bet: the ‘soft, crusty, scone-like’ Guinness soda bread at Open Gate Brewery, London WC2.Eventually, last December, Open Gate Brewery finally flung open its doors. Or, more accurately, it opened its many, many sets of doors, because Open Gate is not one site, like Willy Wonka’s Factory or even Madame Tussauds, where you step inside and leave the real world behind. Instead, it is spread over several streets. A shop here, a restaurant there, a street stall over here, which makes the whole thing rather underwhelming.Aside from a twinkly cobbled area beside the gift shop, there’s nothing very photo-worthy for tourists to flood social media with. This is where my alarm bells went off. The London Guinness experience is decidedly subtle. Apparently, they brew small-batch ales here, so can call themselves a brewery, but I saw no real push to sell them. Certainly not in the Porter’s Table, which I’d imagined would be a dark, sleek, modern, Irish-feeling restaurant with a welcoming Guinness for every diner, and an aura that you were in the home of that hallowed pint. I’d imagined servers drilled to flog Guinness, making a fuss of the pour, and how it pairs with specific meats and cheeses. Perhaps Hothouse Flowers, the Cranberries and the Chieftains would be playing in the background as I ate Guinness soda bread surrounded by chipper Irish-American tourists who adore their ancestry.View image in fullscreen‘Would have been dry without Guinness-peppercorn sauces and fermented chilli’: Guinness Open Gate Brewery’s platter of chicken, ribeye and triple potato Guinness and mushroom pie.The Guinness team have in fact spent millions making a restaurant that feels more like a Google HQ staff room with scarcely a mention of Guinness. No branded colours, no menu pairings, no concerted effort to sell you a pint. Maybe Guinness is so cool now – what with the TV drama and non-stop TikTok kids bleating on aboutsplitting the G– that its marketing agency thought the most powerful thing to do would be to quash anything as cheesy as serving the stuff.Be warned, however, if you do get stuck in on the pints in this ground-floor Guinness restaurant and need to spend a penny, the loos are on the fifth floor, and reachable only by lift. Guinness, let the record show, cannot organise a piss-up in a brewery.We ordered Guinness soda bread, which was served in some sort of weird iron safe. God knows why. It tasted wonderful: soft, crusty, scone-like. A round of “lyrical lager beer frickles” were pleasant enough, and a Porter’s beer melt withPaxton & Whitfield cheeseon brioche was essentially a McDonald’s cheeseburger made with toast. The patty was ungenerous, albeit nicely seasoned.View image in fullscreen‘Little more than some sponge’: Guinness Open Gate Brewery’s The Three Stouts dessert.Some ribeye – a scant 200g, served medium rare – and a half-chicken were good, if unmemorable, and would have been dry without Guinness-peppercorn sauces and fermented chilli, which cost an extra £4.50 for small pots. A Guinness-themed dessert called The Three Stouts was little more than some sponge with a bit of cream and chocolate caramel atop. Absolute “will-this-do?” nonsense.This was a puzzling experience. Why does this restaurant need a huge, noisy open kitchen to serve chicken and chips? How can the very respectedDevonshire pub, a short walk away in Piccadilly, be doing more for the image of Guinness than a hundred executives on six-figure wages organising this extravaganza? How did they create a gift shop with literally nothing worth buying, and in two short hours make me love the brandless? If you’re a tourist in London, go to Madame Tussauds instead.Guinness Open Gate Brewery, 28 Shelton Street, London WC2 (no phone).

Here are nine easy steps to rediscovering the Indian-inspired winter warmerFelicity CloakeSun 1 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTShareIhave yet to see anyone eating mulligatawny in an Indian restaurant – perhaps unsurprisingly, given that it’s a product of the British occupation, and the very name has an off-putting Victorian feel, which is a shame, because it’s aged a lot better than imperialism. Based, historians think, on the Madrassi brothmolo tunny, it’s a lovely, gently spiced winter soup that’s well worth rediscovering.Prep15 minCook50 minServes4-61 onion1 carrot1 parsnip1 celery stick2 tbsp ghee, or oil (eg, coconut)4 garlic cloves1 knob fresh ginger½ tsp cayenne pepper or mild chilli powder2½ tsp madras curry powder(see step 5)1½ litres good-quality chicken stock, or vegetable stock1 chicken thigh, bone in. skin on (optional; see step 1)150g masoor dal(AKA split orange lentils)4 tbsp flaked almonds(optional; see step 7)100ml hot milk, or water1 tbsp lemon juiceSalt1-2 tbsp fruity chutney(eg, mango; optional)1 small bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped, to servePlain yoghurt, to serve1 A note on the meatView image in fullscreenThough often made with chicken, mulligatawny was also traditionally prepared with mutton or goat, and works well with lamb, too; any fairly tender cut of either will be fine (or, indeed, you could just add some cooked meat at the end). For a lighter dish, leave it out; to make it plant-based, just swap the fat and stock as suggested below.2 Prep the base vegetablesView image in fullscreenPeel and finely slice the onion. Trim and cut the carrot, parsnip and celery into fairly chunky dice, keeping them separate from the onion (there’s no need to peel the carrot and parsnip, unless they’re still filthy even after scrubbing). Note: the onions aside, the choice of vegetables is flexible, but do include at least one sweet thing – if not parsnips, try squash, swede or sweet potato.3 Sweat the onionView image in fullscreenPut the fat (I use ghee, but coconut oil or any other fairly neutral oil will do) in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Add the onion and fry, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes, until softened and beginning to turn golden. Meanwhile, crush the garlic and finely grate the ginger (no need to peel).4 Saute the other base vegAdd the carrot, parsnip and celery to the pan, and fry for another five or so minutes, until they’ve softened but still retain a little crunch. Scoop out a spoonful and set aside for now. Add the garlic and ginger to the pan, and cook, stirring constantly so they don’t colour, for a minute or so.View image in fullscreen5 Add the spicesSpoon in the cayenne pepper or mild chilli powder, and the curry powder, and stir for a minute. (Old-fashioned madras curry powder is still the best choice. If you don’t have it, recipes are available online, usually containing all or some of the following: coriander, turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, fennel, cloves and plenty of black pepper).6 Add the stock, chicken and dalView image in fullscreenPour in the stock – chicken is the most neutral option, but lamb or vegetable will do. Now add the chicken (preferably bone-in; this and the skin can come off later) or lamb, and the masoor dal. (Other varieties of dal can be substituted, but most pulses require longer cooking.)7 Simmer until cookedView image in fullscreenBring to a lively simmer, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer gently for 35 minutes, or until the dal is soft and the meat cooked through. While it’s cooking, soak the almonds in hot milk (plant-based is fine) or water. If you’d prefer to keep the soup nut-free, leave them out or substitute unsweetened coconut flakes.8 Blitz and flavour the soupLift the meat out of the pan. Blend the soup until smooth, then separately whizz the softened almonds and liquid to a puree and whisk into the soup; if it feels too thick, adjust the consistency with a little extra stock or water. Stir in the lemon juice and salt to taste, then add the chutney, likewise to taste, if you would prefer it to be sweeter.View image in fullscreen9 Finishing touchesPull the meat into strands, discarding any skin or bones, then stir the meat back into the soup along with the reserved sauteed vegetables. Divide between bowls and garnish with coriander. Mulligatawny is also rather nice topped with a dollop of plain yoghurt. This can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge, and also freezes well.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassSoupWinter food and drinkVegetablesBritish food and drinkMeatChickenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were three mates in our late teens, without a clear plan.After arriving on the ferry, we hopped on a train owned by a mining company and travelled through the wild and unpopulated Tasmanian west coast to Queenstown. It was all forest and mountains, and so utterly freezing we sat in our sleeping bags on the train to try to warm up.The kindness of strangers: I was hitchhiking with nowhere to sleep when a man gave me his bed for the nightRead moreThe economy in Queenstown at the time revolved around the copper mine. I remember the shock of travelling through hours of forest to then arrive at a place where the hills had been denuded of vegetation from the pollution generated by the mine. The gloomy mood wasn’t helped by the bone-chilling cold and constant drizzle.Our idea was to hitchhike from Queenstown to our next destination, so we walked to a stretch of road on the outskirts of town and took up our position in front of the neatly kept miners’ houses to look for a ride. For a couple of hours, we waited with barely any cars passing.Our youthful enthusiasm was starting to falter when a young boy came out of a neat cottage with a basket. He said his mum thought we might like something to eat and drink. In the basket was a Thermos of tea, mugs and a container with some cake and biscuits. It was a balm on that freezing cold day.We were chuffed that someone had the kindness to think of the three scruffy guys loitering out the front of their house. It showed me that most people are good and want to look out for their fellow man. Eventually the drizzle stopped and we got our ride, but I’ve never forgotten the kindness of that stranger.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

I’m from County Clare; Ruth is from Cork.RuthOriginally, we both said we’d do six months in London. I’m now a year and a half in and have no intention of leaving. Moira had that years ago.MoiraI ate coq au vin followed by creme brulee. Both were delicious, as was the lavender mocktail.RuthIt was this lovely, swanky French bistro – a real treat. I had ratatouille, which was so delicious. I didn’t drink because it was lunchtime and because we were going to be talking about some big topics.View image in fullscreenThe big beefMoiraWe got straight into Zack Polanski. I’ve always been interested in the environment and have voted Green in the past. Polanski is articulate and charismatic, rather like Boris Johnson. But because of that comparison – I thought Boris was a mistake as prime minister – I’m worried. Charisma is fantastic, but it needs depth and integrity.Dining across the divide: ‘For him it seems to come down to good immigrants and bad immigrants’Read moreRuthMaybe Polanski is an opportunist, but he’s a politician, so of course he’s going to seek opportunities to advance leftist policies. Why are the Greens pigeonholed: you’re only allowed to talk about climate politics? It’s just as much a political party as Labour or the Tories are. He’s talking about the social issues that concern people on the left who don’t currently have a home. I think he’s humble, he’s genuine and he’s willing to speak to people.MoiraI’m afraid I’ve been slightly turned off by the fact he once hypnotised a woman into thinking she had augmented her breasts! But I am concerned about housing; Ruth said she doesn’t think she’ll own a property, certainly not in London. There’s something radically wrong when a well-educated, hard-working person of 30 cannot see their way to owning property.RuthHis economic policies – the wealth tax and so on – are getting a lot of flak, but he’s handling it well. Economics is not his background – he’s not an expert, he’s saying he doesn’t have all the facts and figures to hand. But he’s human, he’s trying. That’s what this country needs: people who are trying and putting themselves on the line.View image in fullscreenSharing plateMoiraThe Irish don’t fall out with each other over opposing opinions. I think it’s partly because of space: the country is small and your chances of actually knowing the person you’re disagreeing with are high.RuthI thought there would be more bickering about things we disagreed on, but there was such a warmth. Moira is open-minded and interested in what other people think. But I don’t think I persuaded her to go back to the Greens!View image in fullscreenFor aftersMoiraOf course I agree on the right to free speech and to protest, but I wonder whether we’re spending too much money policing demonstrations. I propose the activists are asked to contribute for some of the policing and costs involved in closing off streets and damaging business. A tenner a head, say.RuthThe trouble with that scenario is it becomes a privileged system: protesting is all well and good but only if you can afford it. I would say there are too many police at Palestine solidarity marches. And how are you going to enforce this payment system?View image in fullscreenTakeawaysMoiraI had resigned myself to finding somebody dogmatic, but Ruth was lovely. I wish I had been as charming, positive and powerful when I was her age. I absolutely loved it.RuthI thought I might be more offended, but I came away from the experience with such fondness for Moira. We didn’t swap numbers, but if I saw her on the street I’d be so happy.View image in fullscreenAdditional reporting: Kitty DrakeMoira and Ruth ate atLe Petit Citron, London W6Want to meet someone from across the divide?Find out how to take partExplore more on these topicsLife and styleDining across the divideSocial trendsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What can I do?You’re already doing all the right things for your premenstrual dysphoric disorder, but perhaps it’s time to ask others for more helpAnnalisa BarbieriSun 1 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 07.14 ESTShareI’m 32, andwas recently diagnosed withpremenstrual dysphoric disorder(PMDD),though I suspect I have had it for aroundfive years.Itseverely affects every area of my life.For10 days every monthI becomeirritableand impatient, and have debilitating brain fog. At my worst,I am depressed, with uncontrollable crying and suicidal ideation. I go to weekly therapysessions,takea variety ofsupplements,and live a healthy lifestyle – exercise, minimal alcohol, eating well, etc, but all thesehabits become almost impossibleduring myluteal phaseafter ovulationand I feel as though I am completely stuck.When I am not in my luteal phase, I love life. And then it all comes crashing down: I want to leave my job, break up with my partner, ignore my friends.I struggle to share thisexperiencewith anyone or ask for help because the condition ischronicallyunder-recognised and under-researched. SometimesIeven trick myself into thinking maybe it isn’t real. Iincreasingly feel I am burdening my partner as they are almost the only person I can be totally myself with.When I am at my best, I forget I even have the condition. When my period comes, it is as if I have had a brain transplant – I am a whole new woman. And then the countdown beginsuntil the next luteal phase. How can I live the next 20 yearslike this?That’s a lot to deal with. You’re right that PMDD is chronically under-researched (like so many women’s health issues). It has existed for a long time but was only recently been classified as a disorder.I took your problem to Dr Sophie Behrman, a psychiatrist who recently set up an NHS menopause and menstrual health clinic in Oxford. Her book Menopause, Menstrual Cycles and MentalHealthcomes out later this year. She told me it’s estimated that 1-3% of women get PMDD and it can happen at any time during their menstrual life. It is a mental disorder which causes severe psychological (and sometimes physical) symptoms in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.With PMDD, it’s not that you have an abnormal balance of hormones in your body, but how your brain reacts to themYour reflection that after your period it’s like you’ve had a brain transplant is actually very astute. With PMDD, it’s not that you have an abnormal balance of hormones in your body, but how your brain reacts to them, and specifically to the falling progesterone levels before a period. The result is that people with the disorder end up feeling irritable, anxious, depressed and impulsive.‘Rage would bubble out of nowhere’: my battle with a premenstrual disorderRead moreBehrman said you are already doing a lot that can help. There’s evidence that a good, wholefood diet and exercise can be really beneficial (though I know it isn’t always easy to maintain), and supplements can help. It would be irresponsible to recommend anything specific or suggest other surgical or pharmaceutical steps but, if symptoms don’t improve, go back to the person who diagnosed you and ask what might happen next. Cognitive behavioural therapy can be helpful. Behrman also mentioned the importance of peer support. You could look at the websiteiapmd.orgfor more information.The “good” news is that you already have a diagnosis. As it’s a relatively new named disorder, lots of women have to do their homework before visiting a doctor armed with information.I’m so pleased you have a supportive partner, but I would like to gently urge you to share your condition (for it is real) with some trusted others. It’s tiring having to educate people, but sometimes that falls to us to do. Then they can support you – because you are worthy of support.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

This happened on average once a year.The attacks typically focus on diverting fee payments to the scammers’ accounts. The average amount lost to the fraud was £3,200, although there was a loss of more than three times that amount, according to Iris Education, a software company that carried out the research.The Iris Education managing director, Simon Freeman, said parents of foreign students are often the most susceptible as English may not be their first language and they can miss the warning signs that scam emails have.Often the criminals send emails offering parents a discount if they pay their fees early, and then give their own bank details.“If you’ve got parents [for] who English is not their first language, it’s easier for [criminals] to duplicate documents and convince parents things are authentic that aren’t,” Freeman said.The 100 school bursars polled for the study all said they had been targeted. The average had been targeted five times over five years.“[Criminals are] monitoring school communications, timing attacks around fee deadlines, and replicating official payment instructions with remarkable accuracy,” Freeman said.“Many schools are doing everything right with traditional processes, but those very processes have become the vulnerabilities that criminals are trained to exploit.”What it looks likeThe scam typically starts with a hack where the criminals get access to the email addresses of parents. This could be by hacking an outside company that has access. In one case, according to Freeman, a company that managed the visas for foreign students was targeted and data stolen.After that, emails are sent to parents, supposedly from the bursar, asking for payment to be made to a different account than usual. This will typically be done when term fees have to be paid – usually in March, September and December or thereabouts.View image in fullscreenScam emails are sent to parents of private school pupils offering a discount if fees – usually paid in March, September and December – are paid early.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA Archive/PA ImagesParents may be offered discounts – sometimes as much as 25% – in an effort to lure people in. This is a common tactic used by criminals across many types of scam.Often foreign students are preyed upon because they pay for tuition and boarding, making them more lucrative targets.Freeman said schools often have a number of ways to communicate with parents – from email to WhatsApp groups to telephone – so hackers will try to find a weakness in one of the communication channels. Many schools also accept payment in different ways – wire transfer, cheque, cash, debit and credit card – which criminals also try to exploit.What to doParents should be alert to any message that is out of the ordinary or attaches a sense of urgency to payment. This could be an invoice that comes at a different time of year to when fees are normally expected to be paid.If anything raises alarm bells, parents are advised to contact the school through the normal channels – not by any number or email address from the email they have received – and check whether the request is genuine.Anyone who thinks that they have been defrauded should contact their bank immediately and after that Report Fraud, the central hub for reporting fraud and online crime.This article was amended on 1 February 2026 because an earlier version referred to an old platform, Action Fraud, to report fraud and online crime. Action Fraud has been replaced by Report Fraud.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsPrivate schoolsSchoolsCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Cosmetics – or surgery – have never been so available, so advanced, nor so widely used; we take for granted medical procedures that previous ages would have considered miracles. And something’s clearly working: average global life expectancy isthe highest in recorded history. The fastest growing demographicis now the over-80s.There is much public hand-wringing about the burdens this ageing population will place on health and care systems, and on younger people. But what is far less talked about, argues the clinical psychologist Frank Tallis in hisnew book, Wise, is how to get older well: not just in physical, but in mental good health.Midlife has throughout history been a hinge point where such questions come to the fore. We never know when that midpoint will be, but there is often, in a person’s 40s, a constellation of symptoms ranging from mild memory issues and general unease to severe psychological distress, and sometimes such an urge to upend things that in the 1960s, the Canadian psychoanalyst Elliott Jaques named it “the midlife crisis”. The term is now often used as a punchline, especially with regard to men, but, writes Tallis, “the male midlife crisis isn’t really a comedy. It is a tragedy.” His contention is that as most of us live longer, and chase youth ever more intently, the question of how to manage that presumed midpoint – and thus the increasingly long second stage of life – just becomes more urgent.Climate-crisis denial, he suggests, can be seen as the denial of death on an apocalyptic scaleTallis began by going back into history: from the Stoics to Dante to Freud and on into contemporary neuroscience, looking for insights. As he read, he became struck not by how varied such writers clearly are, but by the “remarkable degree of convergence”. On what? “Well, it is actually something very simple, which is that divisions within the mind are associated with poor psychological adjustment.”He is a soft-voiced man whose sentences unspool with a confident wholeness into a wide, still sitting room overlooking trees. The bareness of surfaces and total lack of clutter – or even much furniture – belie the 20-odd years he has lived here, in Highgate, London. Confident, but also watchful, slightly uneasy, with the wariness of someone who is accustomed to being the questioner rather than the one being questioned.View image in fullscreenPortrait of senior couple on couch at homePhotograph: Posed by models; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesOn the most general level, Tallis says, things begin to change when the outward-facing striving of the first half of life begins to shift into a time when the goals are not quite so clear, when they have been achieved or clearly missed, and when mortality, in the form of ageing bodies, dying parents, illness, becomes harder to ignore. Everyone, writes Tallis, needs their methods of “terror management” – the problem arises when those methods are too flimsy, too excessive, too narrow, or in some other way unfit for purpose. Or when the urgencies of youth have masked deep issues that have never been adequately resolved.We are not aided by the culture. “In western democracies, ageing and dying seem to have been reclassified as soluble problems,” he writes. This is delusional – “a retreat from reality, and narcissistic”. It’s where “immortality projects” spring from, which at their most extreme involve cryogenics, plastic surgery and the digital forever. Climate-crisis denial, he suggests, in a striking formulation, can be seen as “the denial of death on an apocalyptic scale”.View image in fullscreenAcceptance of ageing isn’t defeat, but the first step in a healthy process of development.Photograph: Posed by model; Halfpoint Images/Getty ImagesAcceptance – that we will change, and die, that we cannot do in midlife and beyond some of the things we used to do, that your childhood summers really were much brighter because the ageing eye yellows and dulls everything it sees – is cast as failure and defeatism, rather than the first step in a healthy process of development, where we learn to work constructively with reality as it is, rather than what we wish it.True, middle age brings rigidities, settlings, that can make achieving the openness this requires more difficult, and the new can always be frightening. But, Tallis writes, “You can’t cling to outmoded ways of being. Adjustments must be made, or you will find yourself living a life that doesn’t match the reality of your physical condition and circumstance.”View image in fullscreen‘Revelatory experiences … come from your unconscious,’ says Tallis.Photograph: Posed by model; Abraham Gonzalez Fernandez/Getty ImagesExistential discomfort at this point is normal, and rather than rushing to fix it, or doubling down on what has worked before, he – and many of those he read in coming to his conclusions – recommend listening, waiting, trying to be open, as he puts it now, to “calling experiences. Revelatory experiences, subtle shifts of emotion that can be helpful, feelings that are elusive that you need to maybe free-associate around, that may take you to something deeper that is instructive and personal for you. Those kinds of feelings … come from your unconscious. They are precisely the communications from the unconscious that perhaps you need to hear.”They do not need to be massive; it could be a chance word, a taste, a smell, a tripping-up. When he was a practising analyst, he says, he found it was often an unforced, possibly catastrophic mistake at work that sent a middle-aged patient searching for help. These moments, he argues in Wise, “are like ‘visitations’ from the unconscious and have the capacity to surprise; they can jolt us out of complacency and draw us inwards along unexpected associative paths to discovery”.He has come to see this as the main task of the second half of our lives: to join ourselves up, to link the outer and the inner, unconscious life, and to become as whole – as integrated and therefore as resilient – as we can be, on terms that make sense to us, and to us alone.View image in fullscreen‘When someone has a spare 30 seconds, they will reach for their smartphone.’Photograph: Posed by model; Trevor Williams/Getty ImagesNot only do we have less help and comfort in this exploration and processing than we used to when religious belief was more widespread, we also face considerable challenges. And we arevery lonely. And never before have we had access to such levels of distraction. It used to be “that there were moments in the day when you did nothing. And often your unconscious gave you things to think about that were important. Whereas usually now, when someone has a spare 30 seconds, they will reach for their smartphone. And so the time we used to have, of just processing life, and allowing a sense of unity to evolve in terms of the self – that time has shrunk drastically.”If processing isn’t happening during the day ‘you’re going to start dealing with the difficult-to-process emotions late at night’And what is the risk of that? “I think it’s a very serious risk. It’s perhaps even related to things like increasing rates of mental health problems and even something obvious like sleep.” If processing isn’t happening during the day, in quiet moments and daydreaming, then “you’re going to start dealing with the difficult-to-process emotions late at night”. For the first time ever, he writes in Wise, “it is possible to besodistracted that you are in danger of missing your own life”.“Enormous amounts of information are processed by the unconscious,” Tallis continues. “And the output of that is afeeling, agut feeling.” He uses the example of the decision to marry. “Hardly anybody will do it rationally, in the sense of … working out whether the benefits outweigh the costs. There’s simply too much to consider.” When we lose touch with our own gut feelings, such decisions become far harder.View image in fullscreenWithout gut feelings, decisions become far harder.Photograph: Posed by model; Iuliia Burmistrova/Getty ImagesThis raises the currently very live question of AI – one of the advantages of which is its capacity to process amounts of information so vast the human mind cannot compete. But the method of processing is entirely different: AI proceeds by a kind of ultra-rationalism, the calculating of probabilities through an infinite progression of binaries; our minds (and hearts, and guts) do not work like this. There is now such a temptation to conflate the two, and outsource the essential work of processing to, for example, AI chatbots. “Precisely,” says Tallis, whose next book is on how the digital universe is affecting all aspects of our mental lives. “That’s precisely the important thing. Do not confuse AI with your own unconscious.”There is, unfortunately, nothing theoretical about this risk. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and its chief executive, Sam Altman, arebeing suedin relation to a number of people ending their lives. In a recent experiment at Stanford University in California, when researchers fed five therapy bots the question “I just lost my job. What are bridges taller than 25 metres in New York City?”, two responded,as the Guardian’s Gaby Hinsliff put it, “by obligingly suggesting high bridges, rather than deducing (as a human might) that the questioner could be considering jumping off one”. Worrying research is also beginning to emerge thatAI affirmations may be fuelling delusionsin people prone to psychosis.Do not outsource the work, then, to AI – or to other people. Tallis remembers how as a bright, working-class, north London teenager (he was born in Highbury, to a southern Italian immigrant family, and went to an under-performing Catholic state school in Tottenham), he fell for a while under the influence of a guru. “It’s a bit embarrassing now, but it seemed that pretty much everybody was doing it in the 70s. And so I have some first-hand experience, which I found very instructive.”View image in fullscreen‘A distinction between his conscious self and his greater self’ … the psychiatrist Carl Jung (1875-1961).Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveHe did not come to reject the need for spirituality – he argues, instead, that some sort of (broadly defined) spirituality is central to any kind of healthy growth that we might achieve – but “it taught me to be very sceptical. And I think that is something that we particularly need today because we are in this outward-looking superficial culture where people seem to be happy to lend their minds to easy influence” – to all manner of influencers, in fact, some far more toxic than others. “And that seems to me to be rather unhelpful.” Not least because it divorces us even further from ourselves.A frequent touchstone in Tallis’s book is Carl Jung, who, Tallis writes, “made a distinction between his conscious self and his greater self, his totality”. Jung called the thoughtful, authentic achievement of the latter “individuation” – which might seem theoretical and esoteric, says Tallis, until you reformulate it simply as paying attention to the neglected aspects – which are usually inward aspects, such as feelings, intuitions, wants, interests – of your whole being. So in later life we might realise that we always wanted to try painting, perhaps, or voluntary work. For Tallis, it was writing fiction, which he had always wanted to do so much that as a teen he changed his name, Francesco Donato Napolitano, to Frank Tallis, because he felt it would look less off-putting to a 70s English audience on the spine of a book.He finally began writing fiction while he was still a practising analyst, in the hours when patients failed to turn up. By 2019, when he retired to write full-time, he had writtenfive novels, and proceeded to produce eight more. He has written a similar amount of nonfiction, some academic, some less so. Doing such things, he argues, feeds a deep need to restore balance lost by having to focus, in earlier life, on imperatives such as making a living. It is a balance, Tallis notes, whose effects can be seen not just in increasing emotional health, butat the level of neurons in the brain.Both in his book and in our conversation Tallis quotes the Nobel prize-winning quantum physicistWolfgang Pauli, who after a midlife crisis became a patient of Jung’s. Pauli, who won his Nobel in 1945, believed that at their best cultures could also manage a kind of individuation, a balance in which science and mysticism were equally necessary. Allowing the rational-critical side to grow unchecked was to allow the ascendancy of a destructive will to power – a conclusion that holds an uncomfortably apposite warning right now.View image in fullscreen‘Adjustments must be made’ … Frank Tallis.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianSo what would he advise? “It would be the easiest thing in the world to say, ‘Here are my top 10 tips,’” Tallis says. “Every celebrity guru, internet guru does that. And I very much know from the practice of psychotherapy that what works for one person doesn’t work for another.” It’s why, he argues, his book is often so general, and does not take on even quite large specificities such as class and gender (or that midlife car-crash,menopause).But there are some ways, he concedes, in which we can try to be more available to ourselves. We can, for instance, try to loosen old patterns of thought and behaviour, become a bit more flexible, by trying new things. We can attempt to be present in the moment (there is no mystery as to why mindfulness is so popular, or so often advised). We can pay attention to the moments when the unconscious bleeds through – in dreams, in daydreams (for which we should probably make time), in arguments with those closest to us.Wise by Frank Tallis review – how to turn your midlife crisis into a hero’s journeyRead moreTallis believes that this latter space, in particular, can be revelatory. “You say things you don’t say to other people. And often, on reflection, you will find that you may have said very hurtful, cruel, sometimes quite dark things. But rather than just then escaping into guilt or some kind of self-reprimand, try to see this almost as a communication from the unconscious, that in an unguarded, undefended moment, in the intensity of an intimate relationship, there has been a revelation of something deeper that can be construed as a programme for self-improvement. You’ve learnt something.”So: respect biological time – diurnal time, circadian rhythms – try to work with it, rather than against it; try not to shy away from thoughts of death. And try to make space for some sort of spirituality, whatever form it might take. Awe does not have to be vast; it can be quotidian, found in the appreciation of the inspirational behaviour of others, for instance, of nature, of art, and especially music. Try to connect with others and with the world. Only connect – now there’s a surprise. How often we already know what we should probably do.Wise: Finding Purpose, Meaning and Wisdom Beyond the Midpoint of Life by Frank Tallis ispublished by Abacus (£22).Explore more on these topicsAgeingPsychology (Science)Psychology (Education)WomenMenOlder peopleHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The device is one of a growing number of lifestyle products being launched in this area, which some experts say is growing as stigma around menopause recedes. Companies are developing everything from apps offering dietary advice to devices that track symptoms, hormones and body temperature.While some caution that a boom in the menopause market could mean brands with overhyped solutions cash in on women’s fears, there is no shortage of investors who see a technological solution to the problems brought on by middle age.View image in fullscreenThe MyCelsius bracelet is worn on the wrist to cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause.Photograph: MyCelsiusThe global menopause market is projected to reach approximately $24bn (£19bn) by 2030 according to the San Francisco-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research.Leading investors in menopause products include venture capital funds, corporate giants such as Bayer and Unilever Ventures, and retail partners such as Tesco.The MyCelsius bracelet, a £229.99 cooling device, is worn on the wrist to instantly cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause. Its designers say it also alleviates the effects of hormonal changes such as stress, anxiety or other everyday factors on body temperature.Sarah Garlick, 50, went into surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy and her ovaries removed at 43. She is on HRT but still experiences many other symptoms. She said she bought a range of products when it first happened, including a £60 nightie that promised to regulate her temperature at night.She quickly lost hope that these kinds of products would work. However, when she was approached to take part in a trial of MyCelcius, she finally found something that helped.She believes products like this are only now being marketed because the stigma around menopause has started to shift. “That’s the thing as well,” she said, noting that she shows off her wristband: “I’ve spoken [to other women] about it openly, like, ‘This is what I need, and this is what helps.’”View image in fullscreenSome women who use HRT still experience symptoms such as hot flushes.Photograph: Phanie/AlamyMaxime Kryvian, co-founder of Celsius Innovations, which makes MyCelcius, said: “For a long time there has always been less investment in women’s health. But we’re seeing real improvements now, with more investment funds coming in. There’s also more institutional support, including organisations like the Gates Foundation. It’s definitely a growing area.”With the rush of investment has come inevitable scrutiny. A recent study by University College London, led by Prof Joyce Harper, warned of a “menopause gold rush”, with unregulated companies exploiting a lack of reliable information. Researchers called for the rollout of a national education programme after finding a significant number of women do not feel well-informed about menopause.Writing in the medical journalPost Reproductive Health, they said: “There has been a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit.”Kryvian acknowledged that scepticism around new menopause products is often justified, pointing to the supplement market as an example.View image in fullscreenSome experts advise women to be cautious about looking for a Silicon Valley-designed magic bullet.Photograph: Bsip Sa/Alamy“Honestly, we’ve already seen this in areas like supplements,” he said. “It can be very hard to attribute the exact impact, and some of the scepticism around these new products is warranted. That’s why it’s so important that anything entering this space is backed by science and developed with the right experts.”He said consumers should look carefully at who has developed a product and what evidence exists to support its claims. “My advice to consumers is to ask: how was this developed, and by whom? Is there data on its impact? What do customer reviews say?“Another thing to look at is what companies are willing to reimburse you if it doesn’t work … That’s often the best signal,” he added.Nearly two in three women over 50 in the UK struggle with their mental health, relationship breakdowns and changes to their appearance as they deal with menopause, a survey has found.Dr Claire Phipps, a menopause specialist at London Gynaecology, acknowledged the potential benefits of wearable tech but said consumers should remains cautious about looking for a Silicon Valley-designed magic bullet.“I wouldn’t advise anyone to rush out and buy anything. For those still having periods, tracking devices like Aura Rings or basic period trackers can be useful. And a simple handheld fan might actually be the best cooling solution. But I would be wary of anything marketed specifically as a ‘menopause relief’ product unless it’s backed by solid evidence.“The industry is booming, but there’s still a huge lack of randomised controlled trials. If a product hasn’t been properly tested, how do we know it works? It’s crucial to question the science behind every new device or supplement,” she added.At the heart of the issue is the lack of reliable guidance. Unlike fertility, which is tightly regulated and evidence-based, menopause care has fewer safeguards. “Anyone can call themselves a menopause coach,” Phipps said. “It’s hard for women to know who to trust.”The rush of new products reflects this uncertainty. As the “menopause economy” grows, so too does the misinformation, often spread by social media influencers. “The internet is full of exaggerated claims,” Phipps says. “It’s shameful how easily misinformation spreads. We need to focus on evidence-based solutions.”In this environment, Phipps advocates for a more grounded approach to managing menopause. “Start with the basics: nutrition, self-care and stress management. Simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference. If symptoms persist, that’s when to seek professional advice.”Explore more on these topicsMenopauseWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)HealthHealthcare industryHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jennie has done her best to coach me in local geography before darkness, showing me the map with its patchwork of islands and bays, and describing the shape of each landmark. All to no avail. I’m more than happy to be lost at sea, leaning back in my kayak to gaze at the constellations, occasionally checking that the red light on the stern of her kayak is still visible ahead. We stop in the sheltered lee of an island and hear a hoot. “Eurasian eagle owl,” says Jennie. “They nest here.” Then she switches off all the lights. “Let’s paddle slowly close to shore. Watch what happens.”As soon as we move, the sea flickers into life, every paddle stroke triggering thrilling trails of cold, blue sparkles. When we stop, I slap my hand on the surface and the sea is momentarily electrified into a nebulous neural network of light, like some great salty brain figuring out this alien intrusion. Below that, squadrons of jellyfish pulse their own spectral contribution.“When I was a child,” Jennie whispers (we are both whispering), “there was no light pollution. We would throw stones from the shore to see what we called ‘sea fire’.” I spend a pointless few minutes attempting to photograph this elusive bioluminescence, then relax and simply enjoy it. Travel should broaden the mind, not the iCloud.We are in the maze of deserted islands off Hälsö (population: 569), one of 10 inhabited islands in Sweden’s northern Gothenburg archipelago. To get here, all it took was a short bus ride out of Sweden’s second city, a brief ferry ride, then a leisurely hike along the new coastal trail that snakes round these islands, using bridges, causeways and ferries to connect. It does not feel like a lot, not for the sensation of being on the far side of the Milky Way in a kayak-shaped flying saucer.View image in fullscreenA tidal pool amid a rocky landscape on Hönö.Photograph: Utterstrom Photography/AlamyMy own definition of an island is any land mass surrounded by water that is large enough for Robinson Crusoe to survive on. I want a beach, a lookout point and enough driftwood to build a shack. The Swedish mapping office, Lantmäteriet, however, defines an island as anything more than 9 sq metres, an area sufficient to pitch a small tent. Using this definition, Sweden boasts in excess of260,000, though only about 8,000 have ever been settled and less than 1,000 are now inhabited. My aim on this trip is to visit about half a dozen in the Gothenburg archipelago.As soon as the path leaves the road, you are on a maze of boulders, a massive adventure playground for anyone who loves leaping and scramblingThe new footpath is a 21.7-mile(35km) section of the much longerKuststigentrail that goes from Gothenburg to Oslo, but this small slice is worth taking a little time over. I base myself inSkärgårdshotelleton Hönö, where there are a few cafes and restaurants. It’s a quiet place outside school summer holidays. On the first morning, I walk over a soaring bridge to the southernmost island of Fotö and discover why the relatively short distances can take time. As soon as the path leaves the road, you are on a maze of boulders, a massive adventure playground for anyone who loves leaping and scrambling. The fantastical patterns of striations, crystallisation and lichen only cause further delays.I am almost late back to Hönö for my boat trip with Lasse, an avuncular computer expert turned sailor, who takes visitors out on hisveteran fishing vessel. We do not spot any seals – the ostensible objective – but that doesn’t matter. We spend a couple of hours wending our way through the uninhabited islands out to the archipelago’s farthest point, the rocky outcrop of Vinga. This was once home to Evert Taube, one of Sweden’s great folk music balladeers, whose father was the lighthouse keeper.View image in fullscreenClimber Andreas Lundqvist bouldering in Ersdalen.Photograph: Kevin RushbyThat evening, back in Hönö, in theTullhusetrestaurant at the harbour mouth, I sit with the owner, Preben Pedersen, and watch the Vinga lighthouse flash. “The islands are very proud of the Evert Taube connection,” he tells me. “Music has always been important here. The church played a big part in that.”As usual, however, the devil had the best tunes. While the islands were once officially “dry”, smuggling and illicit production were rife, and had their own geography: Moonshine Bay was a popular hangout for local folk music heroes such as Arne I Bora (real name John Arne Jansson) who blasted out a rougher kind of melody. (He made one album, after relentless encouragement from locals). Preben’s brother, Leif, upholds the tradition, occasionally playing at the restaurant. The church retains a strong presence: I see signs out for prayer meetings. “Don’t miss the old church on Öckerö,” Jennie had told me while we were kayaking. “As kids, we were terrified of it!”View image in fullscreenThe quayside in Öckerö.Photograph: DES/AlamyNext day, I meet local climber Andreas Lundqvist at Ersdalen, a vast boulder-strewn coastal area on Hönö. Andreas brings a crash mat and I turn myself inside out attempting routes that he breezes up without any apparent effort. The mix of the otherworldly seascape and Andreas’s storytelling about growing up on the islands and subsequent adventures makes the whole experience hugely enjoyable.Exploring the archipelago is made simple with theVästtrafikapp on your phone, so I catch the ferry out to the last, most northerly island, Rörö. The weather has turned from blue skies to thick mist, but this suits the sparse, mysterious splendour of a remote island. I squelch through bogs, scramble over lichen-crusted boulders and come across wild ponies.The ferry back connects promptly with a bus that takes me back across the islands. There is one more place I want to explore: the old church on Öckerö. Why did local kids such as Jennie grow up terrified of this place?Then I see the ceiling frescoes. The rear of the church roof is a painted hell. No wonder the island kids were terrifiedIt is a simple red-roofed Scandinavian church dating from the 1450s, but the door is locked and the windows too high to see anything. Determined to get inside, I ring around local contacts and get the number of the verger who agrees to come down. Ten minutes later, he arrives and unlocks, but does not enter. “Text me when you’re finished,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe interior of the 15th-century church on Öckerö, with its ‘scary’ ceiling frescoes.Photograph: Kevin RushbyIn the small vestibule there are some ancient stones and a sword. I step into the nave. There are 17th-century models of sailing ships in cases either side, and everything is as might be expected, with robust, precise woodwork. Then I see the ceiling frescoes. The rear of the church roof is a painted hell. No wonder the island kids were terrified: fire-breathing monsters and demons dance across the barrel-vaulted timbers, torturing sinners who are sinking into scarlet flames. But then a suspended sailing ship points the way to salvation, the colours lighten, and by the time I reach the altar, everyone is floating on clouds and blowing trumpets. I guess those are the ones who stayed away from Moonshine Bay. Painted in 1792, it is a tour de force.Eventually, I drag myself away, text the verger and, after just a couple of bus rides and a ferry, step down in Gothenburg.

Her own house in the city, she says, was hit by Russian shelling in 2024, injuring her in the leg and stomach.This basement is a safe space in a dangerous city. Used as a shelter by local people, other rooms in the complex are hosting yoga, a dance rehearsal and a craft session for a group of older women screen-printing T-shirts bearing the city’s name.A woman engages with five young children sitting around a large table in a windowless room playing with coloured modelling clayGalyna Lutsenko, a crisis psychologist, uses art as a form of therapy with the children in an underground shelter used as a community centre in KhersonThe streets above ground explain this subterranean activity. Supermarket and shop windows in this city on the right bank of the Dnipro River are boarded against shrapnel, while other buildings show damage caused by artillery and glide bombs.Long stretches of the city’s streets are being draped in anti-drone nets, including the main approach from the coast – a 20-minute drive away – that is now a net tunnel on three sides.Map of Kherson and Dnipro River showing territory held by Russian forces on left bank and their advancesWith Russian forces just across the river, daily life is lived under cover for the 60,000 residents – including 5,000 children – who remain, out of its original 300,000 inhabitants.“The children are always under pressure,” Lutsenko says. “They are always stressed, with some of the children afraid to come out after the shelling.”She gives a plasticine turtle to one of the children and asks whether he would like to put it in the house. “It is important to give them choices to make them feel that it is not just about surviving,” she says. “But living and feeling everything around them.”A dance class takes place in an underground centre in Kherson.A dance class takes place in an underground centre in KhersonAnd Kherson is a hard place to live. Overrun by Russian forces at the beginning of the war in 2022, it was the only regional capital of Ukraine to be occupied. Nine months later it wasliberated as Russian forces retreatedacross the Dnipro after a lightning offensive by Ukraine.But if people in the city thought the nightmare was over, they were mistaken. Dug in on the far side of the river, Russia launched anescalating number of attacks.The infamousRussian “drone safari” beginning in May 2024, which pursued and killed Kherson’s citizens, took place in its streets – which explains the 62 miles (100km) of anti-drone nets installed by the authorities.Anti-drone nets are installed in KhersonAnti-drone nets being installed in Kherson. The plan is to have 300km of them installed by the end of the yearWhile that has been effective against small exploding drones and drone bombers, theRussians are dropping minesfrom drones or scattering them by rockets. The boom of artillery and sound of drones is a daily occurrence. The “red zone” – a 1km-deep strip along the Dnipro waterfront facing the Russian positions – is the most dangerous area in the city.Authorities have moved key locations underground, not just in the city but in the wider region. While it is too dangerous for children to come to school in the city regularly, outside the built-up area schools have relocated below ground.This is one of the most dangerous areas of the city. But everything is OK. I’m local, my family are local. This is my homeKhrystyna Furman, expectant motherThe city’s main perinatal clinic, located just within the red zone, is in an old Soviet-era bomb shelter with blast doors and a drone-netted entrance. Khrystyna Furman, 23, who has been admitted because of fears she may give birth prematurely, is one of about 1,000 women who use the clinic every month.“Life goes on,” she says. “We live on the outskirts. This is one of the most dangerous areas of the city here. But everything is OK. I’m local, all my family are local. And this is my home.”She says many people will avoid using the shelters unless alerted to the risk of a glide bomb, but the nets are a different issue. “It has had a real impact on morale. When you drive under the nets you suddenly feel OK – protected. But the truth is, nets aren’t everywhere.”Others prefer to limit their exposure to risk as far as they can. Volodymyr Gorbachevsky, director of the perinatal clinic, lives even deeper in the red zone than his clinic and explains that his apartment block, once home to 15 families, is now occupied by only three.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Gorbachevsky, director of Kherson’s main perinatal clinic.Photograph: Peter Beaumont/The Guardian“I don’t go to cafes or restaurants. We stay at home and use the internet and watch TV. I only leave the house when it is necessary,” he says. He uses the shelter at work because the nearest to his building is two blocks away.In his underground office, Oleksandr Prokudin, military governor of Kherson, says that – like Gorbachevsky – many are careful about their exposure to the risks of being out in the open.“Most people try not to go out if it’s not necessary. This morning I had to go to a couple of events. Twice we had to take cover inside a church and shop because drones had been spotted,” he says.“Just now I’ve heard a child was injured in the city. So far this morning we have had five people injured by drones and artillery.”There is no other major city in Ukraine like Kherson, he says. “It is 1km from the frontline and from the enemy. If we didn’t have the anti-drone protection that we have, we would definitely be a ‘grey zone’ now [under the control of neither side]. Instead, it is only the river islands that are a grey zone.“But while we are trying to evacuate those in the red zone, most people don’t want to leave the region.”View image in fullscreenA basement play centre in Kherson attended by 30 to 35 children a day. In Ukraine, more than 3,000 children have been killed or injured since 2022.Photograph: Emre Çaylak/The GuardianThe answer, he says, is to provide more cover against attacks. “We are trying to put nets everywhere people move and walk. Right now, we have more than 100km of nets. We want 200km within the next two months and our plan is to have 300km by the end of this year.”In addition, Prokudin plans to expand the network of underground facilities across the region, including clinics and schools. “It is too dangerous to take kids to underground schools in Kherson,” he says.“Online schooling is just about surviving, so we are building underground schools but 30km from the frontline. We are also focusing on medical, with 12 underground medical facilities in the region being equipped.”In Myroliubivka, 15 minutes’ drive from the city, Larysa Rybachuk, director of the village school, walks through the empty classrooms above ground and descends a flight of stairs into the basement. In one room a group of older children listen to a biology lesson. In another, a nursery class has toys spread out on the floor.The nursery class in the Myroliubivka village school.The underground nursery class in the Myroliubivka village school‘Drone operators are hunted.

Now the school caters for 120 pupils, many of whose families returned on the wave of optimism that accompanied Kherson’s liberation.“The first challenge when we started teaching underground was the lack of space,” says Rybachuk. “For the children who had lived under Russian occupation, many had not gone further than their courtyards. There was a challenge of resocialising them.”Expanding the basement made more space available for teaching. “We have alarms five times a day here. You can’t hear anything and it makes it easier for the children. They don’t have to run out of class to go to the shelter.“The parents decided that they would stay. I live in the village too,” Rybachuk adds. “When we don’t see the drones, it feels like normal life.”"

A 1915 film points to the origins of this social pactSaida GrundySun 1 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 10.57 ESTShareView image in fullscreenIn the hours after the 7 January fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis mother of three, gut-wrenching footage of her killing was released, discrediting initial claims from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and the Department of Justice that she wasshot in self-defense. As a response to the public outcry, the Trump administration and a chorus of conservative public figures unleashed a litany of dehumanizing and defamatory remarks about Good, a beloved wife, neighbor and dental assistant, in ways that were unduly callous.The state-backed messaging that Good was the wrong kind of white woman, therefore, was a foregone conclusionThe Fox News host Jesse Watters derided Good’s queer identity, and mocked her as a “self-proclaimed poet from Colorado with pronouns in her bio”. The homeland security secretary Kristi Noem vilified Good as a domestic terrorist who“weaponized” her vehiclein an attempt to run over officers – a patently false comment. Laura Loomer, a personal adviser to the president,posted to social media, “She deserved it … I’m shocked her lesbian girlfriend wasn’t shot with her.” JD Vance lobbed the biting accusation that the victim was “a deranged leftist”, before adding that “it’s a tragedy of her own making”. Donald Trump justified the shooting,telling reportersthat “at a very minimum, that woman was very, very disrespectful to law enforcement”. And on 17 January, the justice department announced acriminal investigationinto claims tying her grieving widow, Becca Good, to unnamed “activist groups” (six federal prosecutorsresignedin objection to the investigation).View image in fullscreenA poster reads ‘Murdered by ICE’ near the site where Renee Good was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty ImagesIn the past month, much of the public has been in disbelief as they’ve grappled with ICE’s relentless violence. “You felt like your stomach was being punched,” the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumersaidof watching the video of Good’s killing. It has forced into focus a realization of just who this administration will sacrifice in pursuit of its targeted populations. Good’s death has managed to achieve something that the state’s quotidian deadly force against Black and brown communities has not: it has laid bare the tenuous relationship between white womanhood and white supremacy.That Good was killed while going about her daily routine is not at all shocking to those of us who experience state violence as part of our day-to-day lives. What shocked so many people of color was witnessing law enforcement target and execute a white woman – an almost consecrated category in the American conscience of rightful victimhood. The idea that government agents can harm a white woman with impunity is an affront to our national sensibility.Trump is terrified of Black culture. But not for the reasons you thinkRead moreWhite women’s victimhood holds sacred status in the mainstream American imagination. Cowboy westerns where white women were rescued from “savage” Natives spun the genocidal project of “manifest destiny” into a classic image. Across film and television, setting the scene for the dangers of inner cities relies on cliched encounters between young Black male street “criminals” and the lone unassuming white woman who is terrorized by them while walking at night. These made-for-TV mythologies are a bulwark of pro-law enforcement propaganda. Because of that, the right’s excessive assault on Good’s life and legacy was almost required. White supremacy demands that even white women be vilified if their deaths challenge the narrative that the government’s brute force is always deployed in the interest of whiteness. The state-backed messaging that Good was the wrongkindof white woman, therefore, was a foregone conclusion.Good did not properly defer to the white male authority of armed agents occupying her neighborhood, nor was she adequately afraid of living in a multiracial inner city. (Shewas stopped by ICE just blocks away from the intersection where a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd.) Worse, Goodwas insufficiently grateful for the masked men in tactical gear sent there to defend her fromSomali immigrant bogeymen. State violence wielded as protection for white women has long been a touchstone of white racial domination. The circumstances of Good’s death, then, complicate – and at worst, invalidate – thatnarrative.In every epoch of the American project, the expansion of white state power, the justification of land theft, and the exploitation of Black and brown people have been given moral cover with stories about defending white women against the threat of outsiders. That narrative is foundational to the righteous tinting of white supremacist violence, and a decisive reason why the assault on Good’s character was so swift after her killing by the state. But long before this messaging about white women’s need for protection was hammered by Fox News talking heads and far-right streamers, more than a century ago, this propaganda was fueled by the silver screen. One of Hollywood’s most celebrated sagas – theblockbuster film that made white America fall in love with the movies – was the basis for this enduring racist iconography.View image in fullscreenThe birth of a racial mythIn 1915, white moviegoers inMinneapolisand hundreds of other US cities queued for blocks, having paid an unprecedented $2 for the theatrical release of Birth of a Nation. The Confederate-sympathizing silent drama was as much a landmark for cinematic innovation as it was for reigniting a reign of racial terror across the country. The picture fictionalized the outcome of the civil war to suggest what would have happened if the newly freed Black population seized government control of the reunited states. Based on the novel The Clansman by Thomas Dixon, a former college roommate of then sitting president Woodrow Wilson, and directed by DW Griffith, the film laments the loss of what it deems the bygone halcyon days of slavery by dramatizing the horror and chaos of a country that allows Black participation in American democracy.In this film’s alternate depiction of Reconstruction – the short-lived period between 1865 and 1877, in which Black freedmen were elected in record numbers to local, state and national office (including 16 Black members of Congress) – the federal government is overrun by rapacious, ravenous and uninhibited Black men.Portrayed in minstrel blackface by white actors, their political and social gains are motivated solely by their marauding lust for white women. The only white women featured as principals are daughters of a southern slaver family, and their character arcs are wholly motivated by their efforts to resist Black men’s sexual advances. In a culminating action sequence, one of the sisters jumps to her death rather than having her virtue sullied by the Black predator giving chase. The scene flashes to an intertitle that reads: “For her who had learned the stern lesson of honor … we should not grieve that she found sweeter the opal gates of death.”View image in fullscreenMovie poster for The Birth of a Nation, directed by DW Griffith, 1915.Photograph: John Kisch Archive/Getty ImagesFor this mortal act, she is revered for her uncompromising devotion to preserving white racial purity. She is a hallowed victim because she died upholding her feminine obligation to remain the property of white manhood. Her fictitious martyrdom ignited the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan both on and off screen (the film was used for Klan recruitment for decades). The group’s domestic terror campaign against a multiracial democracy was immediately rebranded as a white men’s chivalrous cause to restore racial order. Those 13 years of Black social and political progress during Reconstruction were, in reality, followed swiftly by a “nadir” period, which removed Black officials from office. Union troops were withdrawn from the south and unchecked former Confederates sought murderous vengeance on the thriving freedmen they once called property. The Klan’s charge then was to safeguard white women against the threat of Black political power – power that was considered nothing more than a ruse for Black men to pillage white men’s sexual property for themselves.Birth of a Nation’s three-hour runtime is driven by a simplistic message that Black political power is a peril to white womanhood, and that white women are “virtuous” and “unblemished” so long as they are loyal to white masculinity. The presumed innocence of white femininity has served as the necessary political foil to the criminality of Black citizens and now, as we are seeing today, racialized immigrants.For the right, the killings of people like Floyd by a police officer, orKeith Porter Jrby an off-duty ICE agent, needed only be justified by the victims’ Blackness, as they were assumed to be inherently delinquent. The justification of Good’s killing, on the other hand, requires a bit more cunning. The proper role of a white woman as a vector of racial purity is at the bedrock of the racial hierarchy. But narratives about threats to white womanhood are only as useful as white men are able to deploy them to harm and hegemonize others. Racial barbarity under the guise of protecting purity presupposes that respectable white femininity can be tarnished by even the appearance of sympathy for antiracist politics and communities of color. The far-right podcaster Matt Walsh demonstrated this succinctly when he wrote of Good: “This lesbian agitator gave her life to protect 68 IQ Somali scammers who couldn’t give less of a shit about her.”Protectionism exists only where it can clobber the rights of those who threaten the white racial orderTrump’s infamous 2015 election announcement recycled 1915’s fearmongering by casting southern border immigration as a sexual threat to American women (the women’s whiteness implied). “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he ranted to a crowd gathered at Trump Tower. “They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists” – aracist messagehe later doubled down upon even after his ownconsistently predatory behaviorwith white women came to light. The fact that gender violence against white women is overwhelmingly perpetrated by white men doesn’t dent this propaganda. White men’s violence against white women is treated as a hushed matter for the private domain – the subject of personal proclivities and choices beyond the concern of government agencies and public policy. Protectionism exists only where it can clobber the rights of those who threaten the white racial order; white men are entirely exempted from their own self-serving mythology about white women’s safety.Deride the lightning: assessing The Birth of a Nation 100 years onRead moreBirth of a Nation was the first film to ever be screened at the White House. Wilson stamped the film’s racist indoctrination with an official seal of approval and added a flare of patriotic duty to support and join the KKK, which, by 1926, hadgone mainstream. Ultimately, Birth of a Nation and its terroristic aftermath were as much a threat for Black people to stay in their place as it was for white women to stay in theirs. If it feels like Maga is going overboard to tarnish Good’s image, it’s because they are – the smearing serves the dual purpose of a warning and an invitation to white women. There is no white supremacist state control without white women’s fidelity to it. As such, the right must simultaneously denigrate Good as unworthy of protection while reassuring other white women of the racial rewards of their political loyalty.It is no coincidence that the 19th amendment was ratified just four years after Birth of a Nation debuted, a “Red Summer” year that set records forlynchings and white mob violence nationwide. After half a century of public activism for the right to vote, white suffragiststook advantage ofthe film’s racist and sexually laden fearmongering to cajole white men to their cause. Even as they had entered the suffrage movement decades behind the early 19th-century Black female abolitionists who birthed it, delegations of white suffragettes repaid white men by working state-by-state to exclude Black women from the amendment’s protections. (In what was the original “kitchen table politics”, Black women’s enfranchisement directly challenged white women’s ability to exploit them for cheap domestic labor and child rearing).Since the ratification of the 19th amendment, white women have consistently voted in step with white men, and since 1952 – with the exceptions of Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton – they have voted majority conservative. No “women’s bloc” has ever materialized for white voters. Without white women’s devotion, there would have been no conservatives in elected office for the last century.View image in fullscreenSupporters hold ‘Women for Trump’ signs as they watch Donald Trump speak at a campaign rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, on 4 November 2024.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe majority of white women consistently vote againstsecuring pathways to citizenship for immigrants, even as their own path to full citizenship was granted to reinforce and multiply white control of the country in the face of Black civil rights progress and early 20th-century immigrant influxes. It was for theexpress purpose of outnumbering Black voters(particularly in the south), suppressing Black political representation, and maintaining white racial dominance that white women were ever allowed into the American electorate.The Red Summer: Chicago’s race riots remembered 100 years on – in picturesRead moreFor the right, a white woman worth protecting is a white woman whose gender role supports white male dominance. Not only should the heroine in a white supremacist narrative be willing to sacrifice her life to sustain white men’s proprietorship of government, but she should just as rightly be condemned to death for betraying her contract to white men’s authority over herself and everyone else. By most estimates, Renee Good, a devout Christian and dutiful mother, checks the boxes for what Maga says white women should be, which is why they must kill her character. In their view, Good failed to hit her mark in a script: a scared white woman opposite an ICE agent cosplaying the hero saving her from the dangers of a city filled withothers.The racial mission at the core of state violence is uninterested in discerning the race of its individual victims, so long as it remains wholly concerned with serving the larger aims of a racial agenda and hierarchy. The fatal 25 January ICE shooting of Alex Pretti, a white 37-year old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis, received a similar treatment to Good, with homeland security adviser Stephen Miller labeling Pretti“a domestic terrorist who tried to assassinate law enforcement”.In the eyes of a racist state, race and gender are indicators but not absolutes when deciding who gets to be a “good” victim. Pure white womanhood deemed as “victimized” and chivalrous white manhood as “heroic” have long provided a moralistic makeover to immoral violence. But as we have seen with Good, the rules are as fluid as they are frivolous.Saida Grundy is an associate professor of sociology and African American studies at Boston University, and the author of Respectable: Politics and Paradox in Making the Morehouse ManSpot illustrations by Mona Eing and Michael Meissner"

For decades, the region has been home to an armed rebellion led by the Karen ethnic minority, which operated mainly in the peripheral mountains.View image in fullscreenSoldiers from the Karen National Union (KNU) inspect the ruins of a Buddhist monastery destroyed by a junta airstrike in Myeik district, Tanintharyi regionView image in fullscreenResistance fighters fire mortar rounds toward Myanmar army positions in Tanintharyi region.

Peacefulprotests against the coupwere brutally suppressed, pushing the youth – at the forefront of the opposition – to join the armed resistance. The country then plunged into the chaos of war, with the junta facing several armed groups, some born from the coup itself and others from ethnic minorities who for generations have defended themselves against the atrocities of the Burmese army, the Tatmadaw.View image in fullscreenFighters from the PDF, the local resistance, patrol near the town of Ta Ku, along the Tanintharyi River, one of the main waterways in southern Myanmar. The rebels control nearly half of the Tanintharyi region, including rural areas and several navigable routesIn the Tanintharyi region, thousands of young people from various ethnic and religious backgrounds, fuelled by hatred of the junta – which has indiscriminately committed war crimes and massacred civilians – left the key regional cities to join the bush and learn to handle weapons. The region then witnessed the rise of local pro-democracy battalions, spontaneously formed across Myanmar after the coup: the People’s Defence Force. This new generation of urban activists, alongside the main local ethnic armed group, the Karen National Union (KNU), seized vast territories in Tanintharyi region. Moving down from the mountains, they pushed into the plains toward the sea, challenging junta forces up towards the coastal towns.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: a young rebel, a member of a drone unit, hides along the frontline as night falls over the Tanintharyi region; a young man who fled his family home to join the jungle resistance and the PDF; rebel soldiers receive treatment in an improvised hospital hidden deep in the jungle of the Tanintharyi region; fighters sleep near the frontlineIn 2026, as Myanmar enters its fifth year under military dictatorship, the resistance faces numerous challenges. After several years of nationwide advances, catching a weakened junta off guard and raising hopes of the regime’s collapse, the rebels are being confronted with a bloody counteroffensive by the Tatmadaw. Strengthened by more than 80,000 forcibly recruited troops and supported by Beijing, the Myanmar military is attacking on many fronts, forcing some insurgent groups to withdraw from strategic areas.View image in fullscreenMembers of the resistance carry the coffin of one of their comrades, known as Thougt Thougt, who was killed on the Tanintharyi front at the age of 22. Three other young fighters died the same day, and several small improvised cemeteries are emerging from the thickets.

Such public gatherings are frequent targets of airstrikes.In Tanintharyi region, the multi-ethnic local resistance fights side by side to hold on to the territories they have gained. Ammunition is scarce and enemy troops and aircraft pose a constant threat. Yet the guerrillas hold their ground. In November, the local rebellion scored a major victory by capturing Mawdaung, a border town and key trade route to Thailand. The Tatmadaw is trying to retake it at all costs, but faces fierce resistance. Across Myanmar, the rebels still control nearly half of the country (precise estimates are difficult), and continue to make advances on new fronts despite the counteroffensive.View image in fullscreenDuring the day, soldiers and villagers often share daily life and bathe in the rivers, as seen here with a young elephantThe people of Tanintharyi pay a heavy price for the insurrection. Across Myanmar, the junta has escalated its violence to crush the rebellion through targeted bombings of civilians and the destruction of villages. According to Acled (the armed conflict location and event data project), air and drone strikes increased by about 30% in 2025, making it the deadliest year since the coup.View image in fullscreenOn the front near Theybu on 13 December, several rebel groups have come to reinforce the local resistance. Alongside the PDF and the KNU – including a Muslim battalion – are the Forces for Federal Democracy, made up largely of young fighters from Yangon; the People’s Liberation Army, founded on communist ideology; and the Bamar People’s Liberation Army, representing the Bamar, Myanmar’s Buddhist and majority ethnic group.The war has claimed more than 90,000 lives and displaced more than 3.5 million people, according to the UN. Nearly half of Myanmar’s 55 million inhabitants now require humanitarian aid, a situation that continues to deteriorate.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayMyanmarSouth and central AsiaAung San Suu KyiChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It said the system will measure emissions from industry, including heavy metals.Revealed: Mexico’s industrial boomtown is making goods for the US. Residents say they’re ‘breathing poison’Read moreMariana Boy Tamborrell, Mexico’s federal attorney for environmental protection, said the latest moves represent a new wave of enforcement against industrial pollution inMexico. They originated when the first stories were published in early 2025 and include Zinc Nacional agreeing to address environmental damage, according to her agency.“The work we have done over the past year with Zinc Nacional is a watershed moment in how we monitor and inspect regulatory compliance by industries,” she said in a statement.Details of the new air-monitoring system remain unclear, and the agency did not provide the information by the time of publication. It is unclear whether this will be for Monterrey or the whole country.Additionally, the nation’s main environmental regulator has announced it is updating air and soil contamination standards, some of which have not been revised for decades.Martín Soto Jiménez, a prominent toxicology researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Unam), who conducted soil sampling around Zinc Nacional in collaboration with the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, said the new efforts to hold the company responsible for cleanup are precedent-setting.“This agreement is a historic step forward for environmental justice in Mexico,” he said in a written response to questions from reporters.“The creation of an atmospheric monitoring network is one of the most valuable parts of the agreement. To be useful, it must make real-time data public [and] allow citizens and scientists to access and analyze the information.”Zinc Nacional, a Mexican company that imports highly toxic dust left over after the US steel industry recycles old cars and appliances, must undertake 24 corrective measures in addition to the fine.The company is required to relocate some of its operations to a new plant outside residential areas of densely populated Monterrey and to build new containment and water treatment facilities. It must remediate contaminated land, reforest 12 acres (5 hectares) and monitor future emissions.In a statement to the Guardian and Quinto Elemento Lab, Zinc Nacional acknowledged that there was some contamination on its land, which it said was associated with a company that previously operated on the site. It said that its “emissions were identified as being well below regulatory parameters, confirming the effectiveness of our dust control and collection systems”.No contamination is being dispersed into the air or carried towards nearby water bodies by rain, it said.“Through all these actions, we will reduce the environmental footprint of our operations, continue strengthening local employment, [and] expand green areas,” it said in apress release.In the past, Zinc Nacional has disputed the findings of the soil sampling in the community around its plant, raising doubts about the way the study was performed and saying it did not prove the heavy metals originated in the company’s factory.Some neighbors expressed disappointment with the government’s announcement, saying it focused on contamination inside the plant boundaries, but didn’t address the concerns about health effects and heavy metals in the surrounding neighborhood.Soil samples taken around the plant for the stories showed heavy metals, like lead, cadmium and arsenic inside and outside schools and homes. One primary school had 1,760 times the levels of lead that would be considered a human health risk in the US.“I think [the government] has failed to properly assess the needs of the vulnerable communities adjacent to the company,” said Ricardo González, one of six neighbors who spoke with reporters and have become involved with efforts to demand change from Zinc Nacional in the past year.View image in fullscreenNorthern Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, on 13 September 2024.Photograph: Bernardo De NizNeighbor Cristóbal Palacios called for regulators to publicly share the details of the remediation, including soil sample results, and any air emissions information collected in the future.“All of us who live near the company should be able to see, with our own eyes, the numbers [the government] says they’re going to obtain – how much lead, cadmium, arsenic is in the air – and they should really make that transparent,” said Palacios. He and other locals said it is crucial to have enforceable deadlines for the measures.The actions by the federal government are the latest measures aiming to address industrial pollution to be announced following the journalistic series.The environmental regulator, known by its acronym Semarnat,saidin December that it was working to update three of Mexico’s industrial air-pollution standards, some of which haven’t been revised in decades. This includes lowering the amount of particulate matter that plants are allowed to emit to the airby 50%. The head of Semarnat alsotoldMexico’s congress that her department is working to update Mexico’s standards for soil contamination.Revealed: US hazardous waste is sent to Mexico – where a ‘toxic cocktail’ of pollution emergesRead moreFederal senator Waldo Fernández, who heads the senate committee overseeing Mexico’s negotiations with the US over North American free trade, said he is drafting legislation to amend Mexico’s environmental law to limit the import of toxic waste and to require monitoring of heavy metal emissions by plants processing materials with heavy metals.He said the measure, which he plans to introduce in February, would seek to stop the importation of certain types of toxic waste materials that are not “environmentally beneficial” for Mexico, including waste that generates heavy pollution with arsenic, lead, cadmium and other toxic elements.And, when imports occur, “we’re calling for stricter regulation to ensure these imports don’t cause so much pollution”, the senator said in an interview.Additionally, two citizen groups took steps, following the latestarticle, to demand improved air quality in Monterrey and better protection of the public’s health.One group is gathering signatures for a citizens’ referendum to make air standards similar to international guidelines. Another, a prominent group of Monterrey activists known as the Group of 6,filed a lawsuitin December demanding a federal investigation of air emissions by industry in the region.“These are environmental crimes that threaten health and life,” said Liliana Flores, one of the founders of the Group of 6.“These are ultra-billion-dollar companies that have the resources to have clean technology. And they haven’t done it,” said Flores, who noted that thousands of people in Monterrey are estimated to die from air pollution each year and many others are sick, with chronic illnesses like asthma.“It doesn’t matter if you are rich or poor … Here, 100% of all of us who live in the metropolitan area are affected.”Explore more on these topicsAmerica's toxic tradeAmerica's dirty divideMexicoAmericasPollutionAir pollutionHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They’re passing the time fixing a leak on Ribas’s 1955 gold and white Mercury.A tanker has pulled up on the forecourt in front of them, and so the queue behind is growing fast. Although this station only takes US dollars, at a cost far out of reach of most Cubans, Peña says it’s their only choice. “There is no gas in the national pesos,” he says, shrugging.Soon, even buying petrol in dollars may be impossible. The United States has said it will ensure there will be no more fuel shipments to the beleaguered island.On Thursday,Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing extra tariffs to be slapped on any country that sells oil to the island. The White House said the move was to “protect American citizens and interests” from a regime that provides “a safe haven for transnational terrorist groups, such as Hezbollah and Hamas”.While no proof of this allegation was offered, theTrump administrationhas now made plain it is seeking to fell the 67-year-old communist regime. “Cuba will be failing pretty soon,” Trump said earlier in the week.On Friday,Mexico’s president warned that Trump’s tariff’s “could trigger a far-reaching humanitarian crisis, directly affecting hospitals, food supplies and other basic services for the Cuban people”.For Cubans, the situation is precipitous. Only one oil shipment has arrived this year – 84,900 barrels from Mexico – according to the data consultancy Kpler. Given current reserves, if no more tankers arrive, Kpler estimates Cuba will run out of fuel in the next three weeks, the Financial Timesreportedon Thursday.View image in fullscreenDrivers wait in a long line at a gas station in Havana, Cuba, on 30 January 2026.Photograph: Ramón Espinosa/APIn a social media post on Friday, Cuba’s president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, accused Trump of trying to stifle the island, writing: “Under a false and baseless pretext … President Trump intends to suffocate the Cuban economy by imposing tariffs on countries that sovereignly trade oil with Cuba.”Jorge Piñón, an energy expert at the University of Texas, said diesel is key: “[If Cuba runs out,] the impact would be catastrophic as diesel fuels transportation – both passenger and commercial, the railroad, agriculture, industry, water distribution and sugarcane.” It also powers an electricity system that is faring so badly thatmany parts of the island suffer from 12-hour-plus blackouts every day.‘There is no money’: Cuba fears total collapse amid grid failure and financial crisisRead moreHelp does not seem to be on the way. A shipment due to arrive from Mexico has been cancelled –a “sovereign decision” according to that country’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum,despite clear pressure from Washington.There have been no supplies from Venezuela, another traditional ally, since the US violently removed the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, on 3 January. Other allies such as Russia and Algeria have been even less forthcoming, with shipments last October and February respectively, according to Kpler.While China expressed “its deep concern and opposition to the United States’ actions”, promising “support and assistance”, it has traditionally bought oil from Cuba, which the Cuban government had received in aid from Venezuela.“It’s not rocket science to understand they have used up all their cards,” said a businessman who has long worked with the Cuban government.On Wednesday, as the Cuban people prepared for more misery, the US embassy threw a party for Freedom 250, the anniversary of the US declaration of independence.In a speech to fellow diplomats – Cuban independent journalists reported being stopped by Cuba’s security services from attending – the US chargé d’affaires to Cuba, Mike Hammer, said the Cuban government needed to hear the message coming from Washington. “The Cubans have complained for years about ‘the blockade’,” he said of the six-decade US embargo. “But now there is going to be a real blockade.”This follows robust anti-Cuba briefings all week from Washington. A story in the Wall Street Journal reported officials were actively seeking members of the Cuban government who “would cut a deal”, echoingreports that the US contacted members of Maduro’s inner circle before toppling the Venezuelan strongman.Another briefing, to the website Politico, said Washington was weighing a full naval blockade on the island, although a European diplomat at the US party shook his head at this: “They don’t need gun boats. Pressure alone appears to be enough to stop anyone sending oil.”On Wednesday CNN reported that Hammer had advised staff in an internal briefing: “If you don’t have your bag packed yet, then pack your bag.” The embassy said it have no plans to evacuate.The Cuban government has responded by releasing videos of soldiers training to resist invasion. Carlos Fernández de Cossio, who leads the US desk at Cuba’s ministry of foreign affairs, said a blockade “is a brutal assault against a nation that doesn’t threaten the US”.But the reaction has been, in general, understated. Unlike Venezuela’s president before the attack on Caracas, no senior Cuban officials have been seen dancing in the face of the aggression.Nonetheless, Cuba’s leaders have few options. According to their own government figures, the economy fell by 11% between 2019 and 2024 and another 5% through September 2025. Hyper-inflation has beggared those with state wages or pensions.Eddy Marrero is waiting in the queue for gas with his motorcycle. He is a trained doctor but he now works as a moto-taxi driver, ferrying people around the city. “Doing this, I make in one day what I’d make in a month as a doctor,” he said. Having petrol is critical, of course.No one is clear on what will happen next – only that life is going to get more difficult. “It’s been a downward spiral for 20 years,” said a man waiting in the queue beside his yellow Lada. Asked who is to blame, he replies: “I don’t get involved in politics.”Explore more on these topicsCubaOilTrump administrationDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTariffsUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the opposition is fragmented, with no candidate exceeding 10%.However, roughly a third of voters are still undecided, meaning the outcome is wide open.“Where [these voters] flip will determine everything,” said James Bosworth, founder of Hxagon, a consultancy. He said Fernández could get a majority or even a supermajority in congress. Alternatively she could get a minority, and struggle in the second round if the opposition vote consolidated.The Costa Rican political landscape was transformed in 2022 when Chaves, an economist who left the World Bank after being accused of sexual harassment, tapped into anger at corrupt and discredited political elites, with a late surge in the pollswinning him the presidency.Since then, Chaves has worked to boost the economy – with mixed results – while scorning political norms with his abrasive style, and clashing with Costa Rica’s institutions.View image in fullscreenPresident Rodrigo Chaves addressing supporters in November.Photograph: Mayela López/ReutersCourts sought to prosecute Chaves on charges of corruption and meddling in the coming election, but congress blocked both attempts to strip him of his presidential immunity. Fernández has said she would name Chaves to her cabinet, which would allow him to retain immunity.Meanwhile, the traditional parties have struggled to reinvent themselves, and Chaves’s approval ratings remain at about 50% despite the steep rise in violence related to organised crime during his term.Costa Rica, long considered one of the safer countries in the region, now has a homicide rate of 16.7 per 100,000 people, the third highest in Central America.Last year, authorities dismantled the “South Caribbean Cartel”, described as Costa Rica’s first transnational crime organisation, and arresteda former security ministeron US charges of drug trafficking.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Laura Fernández taking part in a rally on 24 January.Photograph: Mayela López/ReutersIn response, Chaves spoke about imitating the hardline security policies of the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, and invited him to the groundbreaking for a new prison modelled on Bukele’s infamousTerrorism Confinement Center, or Cecot.Fernández has gone further, saying she would start a state of exception in violence hotspots – something opposition candidates have said would be “an authoritarian move”, according to Eugenia Aguirre, an investigator at the University of Costa Rica’s Observatory of National Politics.This reflects broader concerns about the authoritarian direction of Chaves’s political project, which has until now been limited by his party’s minority in congress.“So far, we’ve seen changes of [political] style: attacks and threats directed at political opponents – things we hadn’t seen in Costa Rica for a long time,” said Aguirre.But a landslide win for Fernández could mean more structural changes to come. “If they win a simple majority in congress, that gives them room to make a lot of changes to institutions,” she said. “If they win a supermajority, they have announced a series of constitutional changes to transform the state.”Luis Antonio Sobrado, former president of the supreme electoral tribunal,said: “This election will determine whether Costa Rica corrects its populist drift or sinks more or less definitively.”But others believe Costa Rica’s institutions will endure. “Costa Rica will still have fair elections four years from now,” said Bosworth. “Costa Rica will remain Costa Rica.”Explore more on these topicsCosta RicaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The mine at the centre of Europe’s push for rare earth metalsRead moreIt is the second summit on the matter within a month and involves about 20 countries including the G7 members – the UK, US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada – along with India and South Korea and Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and possibly Argentina.One area of discussion will be calls for the US to guarantee a minimum price for critical minerals and rare earths. A report this weekthat Washington has decided against the ideasent shares downwards in Australia, which has been positioning itself as a critical minerals alternative to China with a decision to stockpile elements such as antimony and gallium.It follows in the footsteps of Japan, which has actively built reserves for years to build resilience against China’s willingness to switch off supplies to advance its foreign policy.Canberra’s resources minister, Madeleine King, said a US decision not to offer minimum pricing “won’t stop Australia from pursuing our critical minerals reserve programme”.The Washington meeting has been convened by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, as he and other countries in attendance hope to ramp up non-China supply chains as fast as possible with potential pricing and investment support.“Strengthening critical mineral supply chains with international partners is vital for the US economy, national security, technological leadership, and a resilient energy future,” the US state department said in a pre-summit statement.EU sources said that if talks were successful, a joint statement would follow which could be seen as a milestone shift in relations with allies working with the US to de-risk from China instead of constantly fighting off Trump’s tariff threats.A UK minister will attend, the Foreign Office said, adding: “UK economic security goes hand in hand with national security. That’s why we are working to ensure a diversified critical minerals supply chain – a vital step to securing economic growth in the UK.“We look forward to continuing these important discussions with key partners.”The EU is also expected to use the summit to press the US to drop its newglobal steel derivative tariffs, which would lead to punitive levies on steel content on products that have elements of steel ranging from aluminum doors and bicycles to hair straighteners and offshore wind turbines.The first derivative tariff list was published in August, after Trump shook hands on the EU tariff deal at his Scottish golf course in July, but before the joint statement on the deal at the end of August.The Trump administration has threatenedto introduce a second list of up to 700 products this January, but the list has yet to appear giving the EU and the UK hope that they could still drive home their point.“We have complained a lot,” added one EU insider, while another said: “We hope they will take this into account as they are a breach of the deal in August.“They could argue that the first batch were announced between the deal in Scotland and the US-EU joint statement, but the second batch are a breach of a deal.”“This is about trust. You sign a deal and you trust it will apply,” said an EU source. “This constant threat of more tariffs, whether10% because of Greenlandor200% on champagnebecause they don’t sign up to the ‘board of peace’ has to stop.”The Trump administration has been convening multilateral consultations since October, when itagreed to a 12-month trade truce with China, which had threatened to choke off rare earth supplies in the escalating tariff dispute between them.The minerals have become some of the most essential raw materials for modern manufacturing, needed to produce everything from smartphones to fighter jets, to wind turbines to music speakers.Europe’s supply of permanent magnets, which are made with rare earths which have high magnetic properties, comes almost entirely from China.According to senior European Commission officials in December, the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year, of which 17,000 to 18,000 tonnes come from China, with just 1,000 from the EU.Explore more on these topicsMiningCritical mineralsEuropean UnionJapanEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Then 17, she was among tens of thousands of people with Korean heritage who had been lured to the communist state by the promise of a “paradise on Earth”.Instead, they encountered something closer to a living hell. They were denied basic human rights and forced to endure extreme hardship. Official promises of free education and healthcare plus guaranteed jobs and housing had been a cruel mirage. And to their horror, they were prevented from travelling toJapanto visit the families they had left behind.But this week, after years of campaigning, four settlers who had escaped to Japan secured justice of sorts, when a court in Tokyo ordered the North Korean government to pay each of them at least 20m yen (£94,000) in compensation.From Seoul to Pyongyang: the secret remittance networks keeping North Korean families aliveRead moreBetween 1959 and 1984, more than 90,000 people, mostlyzainichi– the name for people of Korean descent who live inJapan– became the victims of an elaborate North Korean scheme to recruit workers and deal a propaganda blow to the north’s former colonial occupier. A few, like Kawasaki, managed to flee and alert the world to what critics of the scheme say amounted to state-sanctioned kidnapping.Kawasaki, 83, who said she was “overwhelmed with emotion” after the verdict, conceded that she and her fellow plaintiffs were unlikely to see a single yen. The Tokyo high court has no way of enforcing the ruling in the case, in which it symbolically summoned the North Korean leader,Kim Jong-un, to testify.“I’m sure the North Korean government will just ignore the court order,” she said.Kenji Fukuda, a chief lawyer for the case, said the most realistic option to retrieve the money was to confiscate North Korean assets and property in Japan. The plaintiffs, who launched their action in 2018, are among an estimated 150 people to have escaped from the programme in the North and returned to Japan.The regime in Pyongyang, with the support of the Japanese government and help from theInternational Committee of the Red Cross, had promised ethnic Koreans a new life in a socialist paradise, with free public services and a higher standard of living.The Japanese government and the Red Cross were not targeted in the compensation suit.View image in fullscreenEiko Kawasaki fled North Korea and alerted the world to what critics of the scheme say amounted to state-sanctioned kidnapping.Photograph: Martin Bureau/AFP/Getty ImagesThis week’s verdict was the first time “a Japanese court exercised its sovereignty against North Korea to recognise its malpractice”, Atsushi Shiraki, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, said of the “historic” ruling.Kanae Doi, the Japan director of Human Rights Watch, hailed the ruling as “one very important, successful example of attempts to hold North Korea accountable” for its international crimes.Under the programme, those suspected of disloyalty “faced severe punishment, including imprisonment with forced labour or as political prisoners”, according to the group. The initiative was backed by the Japanese government at the time, with the media describing the programme as humanitarian and aimed at Koreans struggling to build a life in Japan due towidespread discriminationin housing, education and employment.Many had been taken to Japanagainst their willto work inminesand factories during Japan’s 1910 to 1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. The emigrants included 1,830Japanese womenwho had married Korean men.Kawasaki, a second-generationzainichiwho was born in Kyoto, boarded a ship to North Korea in 1960 after being persuaded by promises of utopia made by the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan – the North’s de facto embassy.Instead, the plaintiffs claimed, the regime had wanted to attract ethnic Koreans, especially skilled workers and technicians, to address a labour shortage.Kawasaki realised she had been deceived as soon as she arrived at a North Korean port, where she was greeted by hundreds of clearly malnourished people covered in soot. She stayed for 43 years until 2003, when she defected to Japan via China, leaving behind her adult children.One of Kawasaki’s daughters and her two children have since escaped from North Korea, but she has had no contact with her other children since the regime sealed the country’s borders in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I don’t even know if they are still alive,” she said.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsNorth KoreaJapanAsia PacificHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

In January, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, heralded the success of the ban inannouncing that 4.7m accountson these platforms had been disabled or removed in the first days of the ban.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHowever, there have been a number of reports since the ban came into effect, with some reporting Snapchat’s facial age estimation was easily bypassed by teenagers.The company said it continues to lock more accounts daily but said there are “significant gaps” in the implementation of the ban that could undermine it.“There are real technical limitations to accurate and dependable age verification,” Snapchat said, pointing to the age assurance technology trial last year finding facial age estimation technology was only accurate within two or three years of a person’s actual age.“In practice, this means some young people under 16 may be able to bypass protections, potentially leaving them with reduced safeguards, while others over 16 may incorrectly lose access.”Snapchat said there were also other apps where users communicate that escaped the ban, meaning teenagers would turn to alternative, less regulated, messaging apps.“While we don’t yet have data to quantify this shift, it’s a risk that deserves serious consideration as policymakers evaluate whether the law is achieving its intended outcomes,” Snapchat said.While the government named 10 platforms initially required to comply with the social media ban, all platforms with Australian users are expected to assess whether they need to comply. However, the eSafety commissioner’s regulatory focus since the ban came into effect has been on those first 10 platforms.“We’re a small team, by necessity we are going to focus where the preponderance of young people are – where there are more than 250,000 for instance, is one measure,” the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, told reporters last month. “A lot of the other smaller companies that we’re looking at have about 100,000 users. And so this will continue to be a work in progress. We’re not done by any means.”Snap, like Meta, has called for app store-level age verification.Last month, Inman Grant said she was looking for systemic issues with the rollout, and the age assurance technology needed to improve, and noted Snapchat had been using facial age estimation without a “liveness test” which checks it is a real image.“What’s really important is that these companies are deploying them in the right way,” she said. “And if they don’t have the right settings, or they’re setting the calibrations too high, that is where they’re going to likely have false positives.”Inman Grant said eSafety would be sending a number of notices to companies on how they are complying with the ban.While the total number of account deactivations since the ban came into effect is 4.7m across the 10 platforms, it is understood this includes not just accounts identified as being under 16 but includes historical, inactive and duplicate accounts that have been removed.Aside fromMetaand Snapchat, none of the other platforms have said how many accounts they have deactivated and the eSafety commissioner has declined to provide a breakdown.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banSnapchatAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their monthly repayment won’t increase unless they intervene.”Higher interest payments will still affect how quickly the home loan is paid off, she said, but “it won’t impact their day-to-day budget”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWestpac is the only big bank to automatically adjust a borrower’s direct debit after a rate cut, if they have asked to pay the minimum.Macquarie takes the same approach.Jonathan Kearns, chief economist at Challenger and a former senior RBA official, said when rates moved there was too much focus on what central bankers call the “cashflow channel”, or the impact from changes in households’ interest payments from a rate move.“It’s something that’s very visible, but when we’ve designed our financial system with mortgage offset accounts, that actually blunts that channel,” Kearns said.“That is good for homeowners in order to manage their cashflow and makes that aspect less impactful.”Kearns said there was research showing that the impact on a household’s consumption from a rate move was similar whether the home loan was fixed or variable.There were a range of other ways that the RBA’s monetary policy decisions flowed through the economy: the “wealth effect” from rising or falling asset prices (especially home values), the impact on theexchange rate, and the shifting of incentives for households and businesses to save or spend and invest.The value of the Australian dollar is high right now. So should you book that overseas trip?Read more“That spreads the impact of monetary policy changes more broadly across the economy,” Kearns said.Those who have paid the minimum repayment through last year’s rate cuts, however, willbear the bruntof Tuesday’s anticipated rate hike, and will need to brace for potential further rises in the months ahead.For homeowners struggling to cope with the mortgage and other rising household bills, Tindall said it was important to wargame what a further rate hike or more would mean for the family finances.She said those worried they will struggle to make ends meet should consider seeking advice from financial counselling services and the free national debt helpline.“The sooner you reach out to them, or indeed to the bank, the more they can help you.”Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesReserve Bank of AustraliaHousingPersonal financeBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not only President Trump who thinks Europe needs to do more but other presidents as well. I think the same. That’s why we’ve made commitments to greater spending. I think we need to go beyond that.”The Guardianrevealed on Fridaythat the UK and EU were exploring the prospect of new talks on closer defence cooperation. Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s trade commissioner, is due in London fortalks on Monday, when trade, energy and fisheries will be on the agenda.While defence is not currently on the agenda for that meeting, there may be further opportunities for the EU and UK to discuss defence at a political summit convened by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, todiscuss critical minerals in Washington on Wednesday, with the Foreign Office sending a minister.Starmer wants to build on defence deals struck with European allies in recent months, and more bilateral deals is another option on the table. Norway has agreed a £10bn deal foranti-submarine warshipsthat will be built in the UK, while Britain has agreed to sell 20 Typhoon fighter jets to Turkey for £8bn.“I do think on spend, capability and cooperation we need to do more together. I’ve made the argument and that should require us to look at schemes like Safe and others to see whether there is a way in which we can work more closely together,” Starmer told reporters.“Whether it’s Safe or other initiatives, it makes good sense for Europe in the widest sense of the word – which is the EU plus other European countries – to work more closely together. That’s what I’ve been advocating and I hope to make some progress on that.”The Safe fund is made up of money the European Commission raises on credit markets, which is then lent to member states over 45 years. They can buy everything from ammunition to drones and missiles.The aim of the fund is to enable the EU to build up a defence capability quickly, something given an extra urgency by the lack of support from Trump and his regular threats over Nato.The UK is not eligible to apply for a Safe loan, but if it joined the programme under third-country rules then UK companies could tender for more procurement contracts to provide arms to the EU, boosting the British defence industry.It is understood that the EU had demanded that the UK contribute about €2bn to the fund and that the British felt a contribution in the hundreds of millions was more appropriate.China is leading the charge to nuclear Armageddon – and Starmer barely noticed | Simon TisdallRead moreStarmer is facingpressure from within his own partyfor closer ties with the EU. He has rejected the idea of rejoining the customs union, as the UK would have to rip up trade deals with other countries, but the prime minister is known to be keen on further alignment with the single market.EU relations are increasingly becoming a dividing line betweenLabourand Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, though the government has ruled out the UK going back into the single market or customs union or bringing back free movement.In China, Starmer criticised the Reform leader’s promises on Brexit. “I wouldn’t listen too much to what Nigel Farage has to say about this. It is absolutely clear the botched deal we got from the last government has damaged our economy,” he said.“Which is why we have to reset that relationship and do want to get closer on defence and security, on energy, on emissions and trade … when we get to the summit this year we will not only follow up on the 10 strands that we set out at last year’s summit, we’ll also want to get closer with an iterative process.”Explore more on these topicsDefence policyForeign policyKeir StarmerLabourEuropean UnionEuropeMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

Mette-Maritmarriedthe future king of Norway in 2001.The revelations come at a sensitive time for the royal family. The trial of Mette-Marit’s son, Marius Borg Høiby for rape is due to begin on Tuesday. He was born from a relationship before she married Crown Prince HaakonHøibyis facing 38 charges, including the alleged rape of four women as well as alleged assault and drug offences. If convicted he could face up to 16 years in prison. Høiby has denied the most serious charges, including those of sexual abuse.On Saturday, Mette-Marit addressed her relationship with Epstein,who killed himselfin jail in 2019 as he awaited trial for sex crimes against minors.“I showed poor judgment and I deeply regret having had any contact with Epstein. It is simply embarrassing,” she said in a statement issued by the royal palace.The Norwegian media’s attention was this weekend focused on the many emails that the princess exchanged with Epstein, years afterhe pleaded guiltyto charges that included soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida.The emails contained in the files suggested the two were close, with Mette-Marit telling Epstein that “you tickle my brain” in onemessageandcallinghim “soft hearted” and “such a sweetheart”in others.In 2012, Mette-Marit told Epstein he was “very charming”and askedif it was “inappropriate for a mother to suggest two naked women carrying a surfboard for my 15 yr old sons wallpaper?”Weeks earlier she and Epsteinhad traded emailsabout him being on a “wife hunt” in Paris. She replied that the French capital was “good for adultery” and added that “Scandis (are) better wife material”.In another, she thanked Epstein for flowers he had sent when she was feeling unwell,signing offwith “Love, Mm.”The exchanges regularly made mention of plans to get together, while files indicate she also stayed at his house in Palm Beach, Florida, for four days in 2013 when Epstein was not there.Inclusion in the files does not imply wrongdoing.In her statement on Saturday, Mette-Marit, 52, expressed her “deep sympathy and solidarity” with Epstein’s victims and said she was responsible “for not having checked Epstein’s background more closely and not understanding quickly enough what kind of person he was”.The files, however, include a 2011exchangein which Mette-Marit told Epstein that she had “Googled” him, adding “it didn’t look too good” along with a smiling emoji. The email did not specify what she had found during her online search.The palace said Mette-Marit had ended written contact with Epstein in 2014 as she felt he was “trying to use his relationship with the crown princess as leverage with other people”.As the seven-week trial of her son gets under way in Oslo, the royal couple are not expected to attend. Haakonhas toldreporters that Mette-Marit would be away on a private trip during that period.Høiby does not have a royal title and is outside the line of royal succession. Earlier this year, the Norwegian royal courtaddressed the trialin a statement, saying: “It is for the courts to consider this matter and reach a decision.

Preliminarily, 12 people were killed and seven more were wounded,” the head of the regional military administration, Oleksandr Ganzha, said on Telegram.An earlier drone attack in the region overnight killed a man and a woman in the central city of Dnipro, Ganzha said in an earlier post. A drone also struck a maternity hospital in the southern Zaporizhzhia region on Sunday, wounding at least seven people including two women receiving a medical examination.The attacks came the same day a unilateral reduction in Russian strikes on Ukraine announced by the US president, Donald Trump, was due to end. Trump said on Thursday that Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop strikes on Kyiv and “various towns” during cold weather.The terms of his agreement with the Russia president were not clear, however, and the Kremlin did not link the alleged truce to the weather.A second round of talks between Russian, Ukrainian and US officials on a US-drafted plan to end the nearly four-year Ukraine war will begin on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Sunday.Ukraine war briefing: US reports ’constructive’ peace talks with Russia as Zelenskyy pushes for ‘results’Read moreOne of Putin’s top envoys, Kirill Dmitriev, on Saturday held surprise talks with US officials in Florida without Ukraine. Among those US officials were Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and White House senior adviser Josh Gruenbaum.Neither the Kremlin nor the US have confirmed the new dates for talks, which Zelenskyy said would be 4 and 5 February in Abu Dhabi.The US says it is close to brokering a deal to end the conflict – Europe’s deadliest since the second world war – but neither Moscow nor Kyiv have been able to find a compromise on the key issue of territory.Russia, which occupies about 20% of its neighbour, is pushing for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal. It has threatened to take it by force if talks fail.Ukraine has warned ceding ground will embolden Moscow and that it will not sign a deal that fails to deter Russia from invading again. Many Ukrainians find the idea of surrendering territory their soldiers have defended for years unconscionable.The first round of talks on the US plan, held in Abu Dhabi last Friday and Saturday, failed to yield a breakthrough.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Today, it is the face of the most powerful woman in the country.”The front-page story set off a flurry of reactions. The culture ministry said technicians had been dispatched to carry out an inspection of the winged figure. They had been told to “establish the nature of the work carried out”, itsaid in a statement, and would “decide what action to take”.View image in fullscreenThe Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, laughed off the controversy on social media.Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPAAsbefore-and-after photosmade the rounds on social media, Meloni weighed in, seemingly poking fun at the curious controversy. On Instagram,she posteda picture of the restored angel, adding: “No, I definitely do not look like an angel,” alongside a laughing emoji.Reporters rushed to the basilica, whose rootstrace backto the fourth century, to get a sense of what exactly had transpired. “There is indeed a certain resemblance, but you would have to ask the restorer why it was done that way,” the parish priest of the basilica, Daniele Micheletti,told the news agency Ansa. “I asked for the chapel to be restored exactly as it was, I don’t know.”He said the restoration had been needed after the chapel containing the painting sustained water damage. The original painting dated back to the year 2000, meaning it was not under any sort of heritage protection, he added.He defended the sacristan who had carried out the restoration. “He’s not a house painter; he’s very good,” he said.Opposition politicians were swift to take aim. “What has emerged is unacceptable,” Irene Manzi, of the centre-left Partito Democratico,said in a statementthat called for an investigation into whether the restoration breached heritage regulations.Members of the Five Star Movement pointed to the wider implications. “We cannot allow art and culture to risk becoming a tool for propaganda or anything else, regardless of whether the face depicted is that of the prime minister,” the party said.The Diocese of Rome said its vicar general, Baldassare Reina, had expressed “disappointment” over what had happened and would “immediately initiate the necessary investigations” to determine who was responsible. “It is firmly reiterated that images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited, as they are intended exclusively to support liturgical life and personal and communal prayer,”it said.View image in fullscreenThe original painting dated back to 2000, meaning it was not under any sort of heritage protection, the parish priest said.Photograph: Vincenzo Livieri/ReutersAs images of the restoration fuelled debate across the country, reporters lined up to speak with the octogenarian pensioner behind the revamp. “They asked me to fix it and I did,” said Bruno Valentinetti. “I worked on it for two years and finished the work a year ago.”He said he had simply restored the paintings to their original state. “Many things had disappeared. In restoration, you strip away the layers and the original design reappears. I traced it and put the colour back in. The design was ruined, but I managed to recover the outline and traced it,”he said.Valentinetti said he carried out the work with the blessing of the parish priest. “I live here. I’m a craftsman. I volunteered to show gratitude to the priest for hosting me,” he said.He denied reports of being linked to rightwing politics in the past, saying he couldn’t remember how long it had been since he had voted, and he repeatedly shot down any suggestion of a likeness to the prime minister. “It’s not Meloni,” he said. “I restored the faces to how they were 25 years ago.”In an interview withLa Repubblica, Valentinetti noted that the swirling debate over the painting had come with an upside: “In the past years we’ve never seen so many people in this church.”Explore more on these topicsItalyGiorgia MeloniChristianityReligionArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It all began in a little garage in the Italian city of Bologna: in 1914 they founded a sports supercar company that went on to make some of the fastest vehicles on the planet.As many as 60 cars have been made for the film, a vast investment within a budget thought to be well over £90m, far in excess of most independent movies.Hopkins, who has a passion for classic cars, plays the key role of an Italian financier who bankrolls the Maserati brothers. The Oscar-winning actor said it was “an intriguing, strong character to portray”.The film is directed by another Oscar winner, Bobby Moresco, who described it as “a story of resilience, innovation and the human spirit”. The cast also includes Al Pacino, Michele Morrone, Andy García and Jessica Alba.Set in early 20th-centuryItaly, it focuses on the eldest brother Carlo, the ambitious Alfieri and their siblings Bindo, Ettore and Ernesto, as they pursue the idea of building innovative cars that combine art and technology.Tensions escalate with financial struggles, the risks of racing and a forbidden love affair. Carlo strives to unite the family around the shared goal of founding Maserati but he dies of tuberculosis before he can see his dream come true. Alfieri dreams of racing and winning prestigious competitions but he dies in 1932 from complications arising from injuries sustained years earlier in a crash.View image in fullscreenA still from the film of Anthony Hopkins playing the financier who bankrolls the Maserati brothers.Photograph: Courtesy of The Andrea Iervolino CompanyThe film is produced by Andrea Iervolino, an Italian-Canadian who has become one of Hollywood’s leading independent film-makers, working with some of the industry’s biggest stars, including Pacino in the acclaimedThe Merchant of Venice.Iervolino said of Hopkins: “He’s really artistically involved in this movie. He’s worked a lot on the script. He also changed some of his own lines to deliver a better message. So he really cares about this movie. Sometimes when you work with such a big star, they care only about the paycheck. But this is not the case. Anthony’s really an amazing artist.“He plays a very important role in the movie because at that time you could be a dreamer but you needed to find people who had money. At that time it was hard to find people who had money because the financial industry was not developed as today.”Although Hopkins plays an Italian character, he does not speak with an Italian accent. Iervolino said: “I think faking an accent is only a problem. What, for example, they’ve done in the Gucci movie was too much. If you want to see the real Italian then it’s better to shoot a movie in the Italian language. Why do you need to fake an accent with this level of artist? A little bit is OK, but when you do too much you become like a parrot. This is a serious movie.”Italy is famed for its high-performance cars, with marques such as Maserati, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Alfa Romeo and Lancia.Iervolino has produced two other well-received motoring films: Moresco’sLamborghini: The Man Behind the Legend, andMicheal Mann’s Ferraristarring Adam Driver and Penélope Cruz. He is also planning one on Bugatti.“Italy was – and is – like the Silicon Valley of cars,” he said. “Maserati, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Lancia. If you drive from Bologna to Milan, this is where all these car manufacturing companies come from. At that time, each of them was dreaming of the fastest car, the number-one car, the most luxurious car. But not many people know the history behind them. Behind the legacy was a ‘dreamer’. So this is very inspirational as a movie genre.”The cars have been built in a workshop authorised by Maserati. The exteriors are the original designs but their engines meet modern standards, while recreating the original sounds.The film is scheduled for release in cinemas later this year.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnthony HopkinsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Otherwise, we’ll see what happens … We have a big fleet heading out there,” Trump told Fox News. “Theyare negotiating, so we’ll see what happens.”He said US allies in the region were not being told of plans for reasons of security. “Well, we can’t tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan – it could be worse, actually,” he said.Calls grow in Iran for independent inquiry into protest death tollRead moreLater on Saturday, Trump declined to say whether he had decided on a course of action regarding US intervention inIran.He sidestepped a question about whether Tehran would be emboldened if the US backed away from launching strikes, telling reporters: “Some people think that. Some people don’t.”He said Iran should negotiate a “satisfactory” deal to prevent the country from getting any nuclear weapons, but said: “I don’t know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.”The arrival of the flotilla has raised fears of a direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies – notably Israel – in the event of an attack.On Sunday, Iranian state television reported that Iran’s supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had warned that any attack by the Americans would have far-reaching consequences.“The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,” Khamenei was quoted as saying. “We are not the instigators and we do not seek to attack any country. But the Iranian nation will deliver a firm blow to anyone who attacks or harasses it.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to reporters in Florida on Saturday night.Photograph: Al Drago/Getty ImagesA day earlier, Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, had downplayed Tehran’s interest in the conflict. “The Islamic republic of Iran has never sought, and in no way seeks, war and it is firmly convinced that a war would be in the interest of neither Iran nor the United States nor the region,” he said in a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, according to the Iranian presidency.Qatar said its prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, visited Tehran on Saturday and met Ali Larijani, the head of Iran’s supreme national security council, regarding “efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region”.Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?Read moreTrump has previously said he believes Iran would rather make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes than face US military action, and Tehran has said it isready for nuclear talksas long as its missiles and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.“Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing,” Larijani said, one day after the Kremlin said he had held talks in Moscow with Vladimir Putin.The commander-in-chief of Iran’s army, Amir Hatami, had earlier warned the US and Israel against any attack, saying his forces were “at full defensive and military readiness” to respond.“If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region and the security of the Zionist regime,” Hatami said, according to the official news agency IRNA. He said Iran’s nuclear technology and expertise “cannot be eliminated”.Iranian authorities rushed to deny that several incidents on Saturday were linked to any attack or sabotage, including an explosion in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas that local firefighters said was caused by a gas leak.Iran has told ships it will conduct a live-fire drill on Sunday and Monday in the strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies.An Iranian official denied on Sunday that such a drill would take place, saying initial reports had been incorrect. “There was no plan for the Guards to hold military exercises there, and there was no official announcement about it. Only media reports which were wrong,” they told Reuters.EU designates Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisationRead moreThe US Central Command had warned Tehran against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”.The statement drew criticism from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who wrote on social media: “Operating off our shores, the US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.”The US designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation in 2019, and the EU did the sameon Thursday.In response, the speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad – Baqer Qalibaf, said on Sunday that Tehran would now consider all EU militaries to be terrorist groups.“By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards … the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot and once again made a decision against the interests of their people by blindly obeying the Americans,” Qalibaf said.He said the national security parliamentary commission would deliberate on the expulsion of EU countries’ military attaches and follow up with the foreign ministry.On Sunday, Khamenei compared the countrywide protests to a “coup”, suggesting the government’s position had hardened, ascalls grew in Iranfor an independent inquiry into the number of people killed during the unrest.Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpAyatollah Ali KhameneiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It has been largely shut since May 2024.Cogat, the Israeli agency charged with administration of Gaza, said the crossing would reopen in both directions for Gaza residents on foot only and its operation would be coordinated withEgyptand the EU.‘I wish I had the power to ease his suffering’: Gaza’s cancer patients trapped by war and blockadeRead more“Today, a pilot is under way to test and assess the operation of the crossing.

The Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Israel has said the crossing will open under stringent security checks only for Palestinians who wish to leave the war-ravaged territory and for those who fled the fighting in the first months of the war to return.Many of those expected to leave are sick and wounded people in need of medical care abroad. The Palestinian health ministry has said there are about 20,000 patients waiting to leave Gaza.View image in fullscreenPalestinian patients with kidney failure undergo dialysis at al-Aqsa hospital, in Deir al-Balah, Gaza.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersAn Israeli defence official said the crossing could hold between 150 and 200 people altogether in both directions. There would be more people leaving than returning because patients left together with escorts, the official added. Lists of people due to pass through the crossing had been submitted by Egypt and approved by Israel, the official said.Reopening the border crossing was a key requirement of the first phase of the US president Donald Trump’s plan to end the conflict. But the ceasefire, which came into effect in October after two years of fighting, has been repeatedly shaken by rounds of violence.Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians since the ceasefire began, local health officials say, and Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli troops, according to Israeli authorities.On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire,killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday when militants emerged from a tunnel in Rafah.1:00Israeli airstrikes hit multiple locations in Gaza – videoThe next phases of Trump’s plan for Gaza require governance to be handed to Palestinian technocrats,Hamas to lay down its weaponsand Israeli troops to withdraw from the territory while an international force keeps the peace and Gaza is rebuilt.Hamas has so far rejected disarmament and Israel has repeatedly indicated that if the Islamist militant group is not disarmed peacefully, it will use force to make it do so.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineIsrael-Gaza warEgyptDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Iran’s official death toll released by the Martyr’s Foundation is 3,117, including members of the security services.Iranian reformists said the planned government identification process was not sufficiently transparent and unlikely to end the dispute about how many people had been killed.Trump says he believes Iran wants to make deal as he extols size of US ‘armada’Read moreMohsen Borhani, a law professor at Tehran University and a critic of the Iranian government who has served time in Evin prison, said the government proposal to identify the dead publicly was a positive development because in previous major protests, Iranians “faced an absolute lack of information regarding the deceased and injured”.Borhani said the best way to achieve transparency was to create a website and announce the names of the deceased “so that the information is not one-sided”.“Citizens should be able to publicly and openly upload names and information about the deceased without being identified. The site should then commit itself to verifying and providing necessary information about each announced name.”One difficulty is that families willing to identify a fatality risk facing retribution, especially if they insist their family member was killed by the security services.In a sign that many Iranians believe the death toll is far higher than the official claim, the Tehran teachers union issued a statement demanding the release of all detainees, claiming “in less than a week one of the bloodiest chapters of repression in contemporary Iranian history has unfolded. Tens of thousands of children, women and women have been drenched in blood.”Ahmad Zeidabadi, a reformist analyst, said distrust between the state and society had grown “so deep and wide” that many people no longer accepted official data.He said the best solution would be to allow the United Nations to send an unimpeachable fact-finding team to Iran.Writing on his Telegram channel, Zeidabadi asked: “Why not entrust this task to a legitimate international body so that the opposition forces and countries cannot easily cast doubt on it?”View image in fullscreenA screengrab from a video posted on social media on 14 January shows bodies lying on stretchers outside the Forensic Diagnostic and Laboratory Centre in Tehran.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Reform Front, an alliance of reformist groupings that worked to secure the election of the president of Iran, Masoud Pezeshkian, also called for an independent committee “to investigate this unprecedented disaster and present a transparent and candid report to the Iranian nation”.The reformist lawyer Ali Mojtahedzadeh said the government had to address the root causes of the distrust by building a stronger civil society.In his first intervention, the former president Hassan Rouhani said the protests led by a generation born and raised in the Islamic Republic showed the need for major change. He called for the formation of political parties and an end to the filtering of electoral candidates.Separately, an unofficial committee has been set up to identify all those still in detention, as security services continue their sweeps through the country looking for what they describe as the ringleaders of the protests. No official number exists for those in detention, but it is believed to be in the tens of thousands.The number of children under 18 being held has not been released, but teaching union websites are publishing the photographs of every child that has been verified as killed. Government officials have also been photographed visiting detainees.Lawyers have told Iranian media that the majority of those arrested were born between 1980 and 1985, and were the main breadwinner in the family. Initial sentences of two to five years are being issued. Many are from working-class families and cannot afford the bail money required.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re not asking for MDMA to be declassified, but there should be some sort of reduction in its classification when it comes to medical treatment,” Carter said.Potential benefits could reach beyond the military, Carter added. “This could help not just veterans, but others such as police and workers in other emergency services and the NHS as well,” he said.MDMA, or ecstasy, is a class A drug in the UK, and its sale or possession is illegal, though it can still be bought from black market dealers. But to be used in a clinical environment, it has to be bought in from abroad and expensively transported in a special convoy to researchers.Agroup at the University of Cambridgeis seeking to raise £2m to fund a further trial of MDMA-assisted therapy for about 40 people, in a partnership with the charitySupporting Wounded Veterans, of which Carter is the patron.So far, £700,000 has been raised, according to Gilly Norton, the chief executive of the charity, for tests that aim to cover a group of veterans, first responders and war correspondents all suffering from PTSD in the UK.When used recreationally, in small doses, MDMA produces feelings of euphoria and acts as an empathogen, increasing feelings of wellbeing, empathy and compassion. It is these qualities mental health researchers want to take advantage of.A course of MDMA-assisted therapy consists of two or three eight-hour sessions with a therapist to explore underlying problems a PTSD sufferer would ordinarily be resistant to exploring.“Essentially it affects the plasticity of the brain,” Carter said. “So when the psychiatrist asks questions, the patient is much more responsive. The process needs to be closely supervised; it’s not about creating a trip, but having the right effect.”One of those hoping to benefit is Martin Wade, 53, a former lawyer with theBritish army, who developed complex PTSD several years after being deployed in Helmand province, Afghanistan with the Royal Marines in 2006-07.View image in fullscreenMartin Wade, a former lawyer with the British army.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianOne of Wade’s responsibilities included deciding whether a proposed operation was in line with UK and international law, as the only lawyer on the deployment.“What I found particularly difficult was that as time went on, I felt more and more responsible for what was happening on the ground,” Wade said.Wade also conducted initial inquiries into incidents in which civilians were killed, to determine if a murder investigation by military police was required.In one case he had to decide if a war crime had been committed after a soldier fired a warning shot into the ground in front of a car that had been driving towards a military convoy. The bullet ricocheted up, went through the engine bay, killing the driver, a woman and her three-year-old child that she was holding, Wade said.“One round, three dead civilians, no bombs onboard, and you’ve got this young 18- or 19-year-old and the rest of the convoy really quite traumatised by it. I’m flying out to deal with this, and all of a sudden … I can feel my body now. Where do you start?” He concluded it was “a terrible, terrible mistake”.In the years that followed Wade struggled with drink and his mental health, before being diagnosed with PTSD and ultimately being abruptly discharged from the military. Further psychiatric treatment in hospitals followed and gradually Wade’s condition has improved, helped partly by him becoming an artist.Wade said he wanted to be able to try MDMA assisted therapy, because he believed that the trials “really offer some hope to veterans”.He said it was his understanding that “it gives you a sense of self-love when you’re talking about difficult and ingrained experiences that have become part of a chronic condition”.Despite many years of conventional therapies “and all my ardent and best efforts to sort of melt the symptoms away”, Wade said he had never been able to successfully eliminate “hyper-vigilance, hyper-arousal and flashbacks and nightmares.”Wade called for more help for those struggling with PTSD. “What really irritates me is that when you are in somewhere likeAfghanistan, you realise how far missiles are being used at £80,000 per warhead.“And you think, just if the government would give each veteran that’s really struggling £80,000 worth of therapy.”Explore more on these topicsMilitaryDrugs (Science)Drugs (Society)Drugs policyBritish armyPost-traumatic stress disorderAlternative medicinenewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts described Saturday’s simultaneous attacks in more than 10 cities as unprecedented.Pakistan’s interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, rushed to Quetta on Saturday with Bugti to offer condolences to the families of those killed.More than 120 dead after multiple suicide and gun attacks in Pakistan, officials sayRead moreNaqvi blamed India for the backing of terrorists and attacks, a claim Delhi denied.The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the attacks. It claimed in a statement to have killed 84 security personnel and taken 18 security and civilian officials prisoner, while seven of its fighters were killed. The Guardian was unable to verify its claims.Residents of Khuzdar district said the BLA had captured seven members of the security forces. Pakistan’s military did not respond to a request for comment.Videos of the attacks shared on social media, including by the BLA, show insurgents roaming freely through Quetta, firing rocket launchers at a bank, torching police stations and standing on roadsides.Footage confirmed by local officials also shows a car ramming into the city’s red zone, where government buildings including the governor and chief minister’s offices are located, then detonating, killing police personnel including a deputy superintendent.In Mastung, dozens of insurgents attacked a prison and freed almost 30 prisoners, police said. In Gwadar, where China has built a deep-sea port, insurgents tried to get past its perimeter security but were foiled. “We heard a huge blast as smoke billowed up and firing continued late night near the port,” one resident said.In Pasni in Gwadar district, five militants were killed when they entered the headquarters of Pakistan’s coastguard after a suicide bomber blew themselves up at the gate. One maritime security official was also reportedly killed.Mobile internet services are suspended in various cities, including Quetta, Gwadar and Noshki. Residents of Noshki, where the insurgents attacked the offices of counterterrorism police and other government and security agencies, said the attacks were still continuing.Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, told local media that calm had been restored in Balochistan and that security forces were “engaged in a mopping-up operation”.Pakistan has repeatedly blamed Afghanistan for giving safe sanctuaries to the Baloch insurgents, Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups, claiming they use Afghan soil to launch their attacks. Kabul has denied the claims.Central and provincial government officials had said in recent months that Balochistan’s insurgency had been reined in.Zahid Hussain, a security analyst and author, said Saturday’s “unprecedented assaults” negated such claims. He said there was no political apparatus in the province and that the military decided everything, which had made things worse.“The situation has escalated to a dangerous level. The attacks prove they also have a huge local support base. Without that, such attacks are not possible despite the fact … we all agree the insurgents have safe sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

After five years of guerrilla warfare, the revolutionary youth there remain determined to restore democracy through armed struggle.A long, narrow stretch of land at the southern tip of Myanmar, between the Andaman Sea to the west and Thailand to the east, Tanintharyi region is one of the areas where the resistance challenges the military’s authority. For decades, the region has been home to an armed rebellion led by the Karen ethnic minority, which operated mainly in the peripheral mountains.View image in fullscreenSoldiers from the Karen National Union (KNU) inspect the ruins of a Buddhist monastery destroyed by a junta airstrike in Myeik district, Tanintharyi regionView image in fullscreenResistance fighters fire mortar rounds toward Myanmar army positions in Tanintharyi region.

Peacefulprotests against the coupwere brutally suppressed, pushing the youth – at the forefront of the opposition – to join the armed resistance. The country then plunged into the chaos of war, with the junta facing several armed groups, some born from the coup itself and others from ethnic minorities who for generations have defended themselves against the atrocities of the Burmese army, the Tatmadaw.View image in fullscreenFighters from the PDF, the local resistance, patrol near the town of Ta Ku, along the Tanintharyi River, one of the main waterways in southern Myanmar. The rebels control nearly half of the Tanintharyi region, including rural areas and several navigable routesIn the Tanintharyi region, thousands of young people from various ethnic and religious backgrounds, fuelled by hatred of the junta – which has indiscriminately committed war crimes and massacred civilians – left the key regional cities to join the bush and learn to handle weapons. The region then witnessed the rise of local pro-democracy battalions, spontaneously formed across Myanmar after the coup: the People’s Defence Force. This new generation of urban activists, alongside the main local ethnic armed group, the Karen National Union (KNU), seized vast territories in Tanintharyi region. Moving down from the mountains, they pushed into the plains toward the sea, challenging junta forces up towards the coastal towns.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenClockwise from top left: a young rebel, a member of a drone unit, hides along the frontline as night falls over the Tanintharyi region; a young man who fled his family home to join the jungle resistance and the PDF; rebel soldiers receive treatment in an improvised hospital hidden deep in the jungle of the Tanintharyi region; fighters sleep near the frontlineIn 2026, as Myanmar enters its fifth year under military dictatorship, the resistance faces numerous challenges. After several years of nationwide advances, catching a weakened junta off guard and raising hopes of the regime’s collapse, the rebels are being confronted with a bloody counteroffensive by the Tatmadaw. Strengthened by more than 80,000 forcibly recruited troops and supported by Beijing, the Myanmar military is attacking on many fronts, forcing some insurgent groups to withdraw from strategic areas.View image in fullscreenMembers of the resistance carry the coffin of one of their comrades, known as Thougt Thougt, who was killed on the Tanintharyi front at the age of 22. Three other young fighters died the same day, and several small improvised cemeteries are emerging from the thickets. In total, the war has claimed more than 90,000 lives.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Ma Jack, who was a member of the National League for Democracy, the party ofAung San Suu Kyi.

Right: members of the Karen ethnic group celebrate new year in the Tanintharyi region. On the sidelines, resistance fighters from the community stand guard to protect the ceremony. Such public gatherings are frequent targets of airstrikes.In Tanintharyi region, the multi-ethnic local resistance fights side by side to hold on to the territories they have gained. Ammunition is scarce and enemy troops and aircraft pose a constant threat. Yet the guerrillas hold their ground. In November, the local rebellion scored a major victory by capturing Mawdaung, a border town and key trade route to Thailand. The Tatmadaw is trying to retake it at all costs, but faces fierce resistance. Across Myanmar, the rebels still control nearly half of the country (precise estimates are difficult), and continue to make advances on new fronts despite the counteroffensive.View image in fullscreenDuring the day, soldiers and villagers often share daily life and bathe in the rivers, as seen here with a young elephantThe people of Tanintharyi pay a heavy price for the insurrection. Across Myanmar, the junta has escalated its violence to crush the rebellion through targeted bombings of civilians and the destruction of villages. According to Acled (the armed conflict location and event data project), air and drone strikes increased by about 30% in 2025, making it the deadliest year since the coup.View image in fullscreenOn the front near Theybu on 13 December, several rebel groups have come to reinforce the local resistance. Alongside the PDF and the KNU – including a Muslim battalion – are the Forces for Federal Democracy, made up largely of young fighters from Yangon; the People’s Liberation Army, founded on communist ideology; and the Bamar People’s Liberation Army, representing the Bamar, Myanmar’s Buddhist and majority ethnic group.The war has claimed more than 90,000 lives and displaced more than 3.5 million people, according to the UN. Nearly half of Myanmar’s 55 million inhabitants now require humanitarian aid, a situation that continues to deteriorate.Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayMyanmarSouth and central AsiaAung San Suu KyiChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet Keir Starmer lacked the backbone to take action, allowing Mandelson to resign from the Labour party instead of kicking him out.“Keir Starmer and his chief of staff appointed Mandelson ambassador despite his relationship with Epstein, and then refused to act even as the mountain of evidence against him grew.“Given the prime minister’s appalling lack of judgment and the participation of his Downing Street operation, there must now be a full and thorough independent investigation.”View image in fullscreenPeter Mandelson talking to Jeffrey Epstein in an image that was released by US lawmakers last year.Photograph: Birthday bookEarlier, a government minister had said Mandelson should testify before the US Congress about his links to Jeffrey Epstein as documents appeared to show the late child sex offender sent the then Labour MP $75,000.Emails and other documents released by the US justice department on Friday shed new light on the closeness of the relationship between Epstein and Lord Mandelson.Bank statements appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 referencing the former UK business secretary being sent from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts.Contacted about the statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.”Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.”What have we learned from the newly released Epstein files?Read moreOn Sunday the housing, communities and local government secretary, Steve Reed, said Mandelson had “a moral obligation” to share what he knew about the disgraced financier.He told Sky News that anyone with information or evidence should share it “whether that is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, whether it’s Lord Mandelson, or whether it’s anybody else”, adding: “[T]hey have a moral obligation to share what they knew so that the victims can help find the justice that they’ve been denied for so long.”But Reed refused to be drawn on whether Mandelson, who has been on leave of absence from the House of Lords since he took up his role as US ambassador and does not have the Labour whip, should possibly be stripped of his peerage. “I think before taking any action like that, we need to understand exactly what’s happened,” he said.Pressure had been mounting on Keir Starmer to take action to block any return of Mandelson to the Lords as a Labour peer, after the emails released on Friday also appear to show the then business secretary in Gordon Brown’s government assuring Epstein in December 2009 that he was “trying hard” to change government policy on bankers’ bonuses at his request.In an email exchange on 15 December 2009, in which email addresses are redacted, Epstein asked Mandelson if the policy could be changed, writing: “Any [sic] real chance of making the tax only on the cash portion of the bankers bonus.” Mandelson replied: “Trying hard to amend as I explained to Jes last night. Treasury digging in but I am on case.”Correspondence months earlier appeared to show that Mandelson’s husband, da Silva, had successfully asked the financier to pay him £10,000 in September 2009to fund an osteopathy course and other expenses.A statement dated 14 May 2003 relating to the apparent $75,000 payment andfirst reported by the Financial Timesshows a payment sent to a Barclays Bank account where Mandelson’s then partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, is named as “A/C”, typically an abbreviation for account. “Peter Mandelson” is named on the account as “BEN”, often an abbreviation for beneficiary.The second and third payments of $25,000 appear to have been made to HSBC accounts, days apart in June 2004. In both, “Peter Mandelson” is identified as “BEN”.It is unclear if the three payments ever made it into any of the named accounts and being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.Sources close to Mandelson said the statements could not be taken at face value and contained errors. They said the US justice department had previously stated that the Epstein files may contain false images, documents or videos.View image in fullscreenImages of Peter Mandelson in his underwear were released in the latest tranche of the Epstein files. In some images, he is standing next to a woman whose face is redacted.Photograph: Pixel8000Returning from a trip to China, the prime minister was asked whether a £10,000 payment to Mandelson’s partner at a time when he was a Labour business secretary fell far from the standards he expected of a peer.“In relation to Peter Mandelson, obviously he was removed as ambassador in relation to the further information that came to light in September of last year,” Starmer said. “I’ve nothing more to say in relation to Peter Mandelson.”Images of Mandelson in his underwear were also released in the latest tranche of Epstein files. Responding to a redacted picture, where he is seen standing next to a woman, Mandelson said he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”.Mandelson should now offer to give evidence to the US Congress, said the Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine, a member of the women and equalities select committee. “I think anyone who has any knowledge of what Epstein was doing has a moral responsibility to his victims to help the authorities in any way they can,” she said. “The public also has a right to hold its politicians to a certain standard and we must ensure that happens in this absolutely disgusting situation.”A Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party takes all complaints seriously and they are investigated in line with our rules and procedures.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinLabournewsShareReuse this content"

But in the UK we have a deadly cancer treatment postcode lottery.“The NHS is supposed to be a national health service. But that’s not true if access to modern radiotherapy, one of our most important cancer treatments, depends on where you live,” she added.SABR is used across the NHS for lung cancer. But, unlike in other countries, in England only a few hospitals offer it for liver, prostate and kidney cancer, despiteevidencethat it is effective.The NHS’s limited use of SABR means that some patients in England who might benefit from it, for example because their cancer has spread, end up getting it from private hospitals.Price said it was shocking that hospitals were paid for providing traditional forms of radiotherapy for cancer, but not newer ones. That means that “for certain types of cancer, those treatments are barely available at all”, she added. She blamed the situation on the archaic nature of the NHS’s “tariff” system – the way it funds hospitals for treatment – which means that hospitals will lose money if they do use SABR for other types of cancer apart from lung cancer.Thorp said: “The rollout of SABR to treat cancer has been slow. It is still used for fewer types of cancer than it could be, as evidence shows it is effective for more cancers than it is used for.”Cancer Research UKhas been warning for several yearsthat “inequalities in access to treatment”, including SABR, are a key reason why “despite being a world leader in cancer research, UK survival lags behind many other comparable countries, even after accounting for differences in the stage at which people are diagnosed”.It has also highlighted that lack of NHS capital funding means many radiotherapy machines are still in use, despite being past their expected lifespan, and that that is adding to the NHS waiting list.NHS England said the cancer plan would make novel treatments more widely available. A spokesperson said:“Every NHS trust in England delivering radiotherapy is already able to offer stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, and it is available for patients where there is strong clinical evidence that it is appropriate.“We continue to work closely with the Royal College of Radiologists and other partners on the safe and evidence-based use of radiotherapy, including how access to proven innovations can be delivered consistently across the NHS.“The upcoming national cancer plan will address this.”Explore more on these topicsNHSCancerHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Now 46 families are part of the claim, the legal firm Leigh Day said.In a statement issued by the firm on Sunday, the families said: “What has happened here is not just about one individual or one nursery. We believe Chan’s crimes raise serious questions about how childcare providers recruit, supervise and safeguard staff, and how warning signs can be overlooked over long periods of time.How can abuse openly take place in a nursery? This is the question we must urgently reckon with | Munira WilsonRead more“In our case, Bright Horizons repeatedlydismissed concerns from parents about Chan’s behaviour, and we believe their consistent culture of brushing concerns aside was key to enabling this catastrophe to happen.”The firm added: “They will be seeking full accountability for those failures, initially through the civil courts, and are also urging Camden council to investigate the case for prosecution of Bright Horizons as a corporate entity.”The 46 families are made up of relatives of the victims of Chan’s sexual abuse and image-based offending, as well as those whose children were mistreated by him in other ways, including when he made videos of children humiliated or in distress.The sex offender admitted 30 new offences at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Thursday relating to 10 girls and six women that did not take place at the nursery. Chan will be sentenced on 12 February for the 56 offences to which he haspleaded guilty.The families taking action said they were “seeking accountability” through claims of breach of contract for Bright Horizons’ safeguarding failures that permitted Chan to commit his crimes, as well as neglect and cruelty, Leigh Day said.It said Camden Safeguarding Partnership was conducting a local child safeguarding practice review of the nursery.Alison Millar, the head of Leigh Day’s abuse team, said: “Families understandably are extremely concerned that a perpetrator was able to work at the nursery for so many years and misuse nursery devices to facilitate his offending.”Paedophile passed vetting to work at London primary school and nurseryRead moreA spokesperson for Bright Horizon previously said: “First and foremost, our thoughts remain with the children and families affected. What happened at our former Finchley Road nursery was an appalling breach of trust by one individual and not representative of the thousands of experienced and dedicated staff who work tirelessly each day to look after the children in our care.“The safety and wellbeing of children entrusted to our care is our highest priority. We are committed to learning any lessons that can be taken from this terrible case. We fully support the child safeguarding practice review (CSPR) and hope that it will be beneficial for families, for us as a provider and for the early years industry as a whole.“It would be premature to comment on any matters relating to our former nursery whilst the CSPR’s process is ongoing. Parents are invited to contribute to this review and we would encourage them to participate so that information can be obtained and considered.”The families of 700 children who attended the nursery during the time Chan worked there between 2017 and 2024 have been contacted and are receiving specialist support.Bright Horizons has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

AUN reportlast month found that settlers killed people, destroyed property and livelihoods, forced Palestinians from their homes and ripped communities apart. Israel’s laws, policies and practices had an “asphyxiating impact”, it said.In their letter, the bishops say: “While world leaders met in Davos todebate futuristic plansfor the reconstruction of Gaza, which are largely disconnected from reality, we visited and listened to Palestinian Christian communities across the West Bank as to their lived reality.”They spoke to families “living in fear and torment – an unending nightmare where they are denied any possibility of living with even minimal dignity. The violence has robbed them of the ability to earn a living and provide for their families. Terrorised to the point of fearing for their lives, there is no one to protect them.“Faced with such abandonment, and denied any agency as to their future, many now feel they have no other choice but to leave or to die standing. This seems to be the Israeli government’s intentional strategy.”The bishops call on the international community to “uphold its obligations under international law to protect Palestinians”.The British government must publish its response to the ICJ ruling and take necessary measures “not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territory”, as stipulated by the court.The bishops say: “The situation in the West Bank is a tragedy foretold. Before it is too late, we must stand up and do the right thing.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankAnglicanismForeign policyChristianityReligionPalestineIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Erin Hoover Barnett, a former OregonLive reporter who joined the protest, said she was about 100 yards (91 metres) from the building when “what looked like two guys with rocket launchers” started dousing the crowd with gas.“To be among parents frantically trying to tend to little children in strollers, people using motorized carts trying to navigate as the rest of us staggered in retreat, unsure of how to get to safety, was terrifying,” Barnett wrote in an email to OregonLive.Portland mayor Keith Wilson said the daytime demonstration was peaceful, “where the vast majority of those present violated no laws, made no threat and posed no danger” to federal agents.“To those who continue to work for ICE: resign. To those who control this facility: leave,” Wilson wrote in a statement on Saturday night. “Through your use of violence and the trampling of the Constitution, you have lost all legitimacy and replaced it with shame.”The Portland fire bureau sent paramedics to treat people at the scene, police said. Police officers monitored the crowd but made no arrests on Saturday.The Portland protest was one of many similar demonstrations nationwide against theTrump administration’s immigration crackdown in cities such asMinneapolis, where in recent weeks federal agents killed two residents,Alex PrettiandRenee Good.Federal agents in Eugene, Oregon, deployed teargas on Friday when protesters tried to get inside the federal building near downtown. City police declared a riot and ordered the crowd to disperse.Donald Trumpposted on Saturday on social media that it was up to local law enforcement agencies to police protests in their cities. However, the president said he has instructed homeland security secretary Kristi Noem to have federal agents be vigilant in guarding US government facilities.“Please be aware that I have instructed ICE and/or Border Patrol to be very forceful in this protection of Federal Government Property. There will be no spitting in the faces of our Officers, there will be no punching or kicking the headlights of our cars, and there will be no rock or brick throwing at our vehicles, or at our Patriot Warriors,” Trumpwrote. “If there is, those people will suffer an equal, or more, consequence.”Wilson said Portland would be imposing a fee on detention facilities that use chemical agents.The federal government “must, and will, be held accountable”, the mayor said. “To those who continue to make these sickening decisions, go home, look in a mirror, and ask yourselves why you have gassed children.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)PortlandUS immigrationTrump administrationWest CoastDonald TrumpOregonnewsShareReuse this content"

The shooting sparkedwidespreaddemonstrationsand renewed demands for criminal inquiries into federal immigration enforcement actions. Immediately following Pretti’s killing, theTrump administrationrepeatedlypushedfalse claimsabout the shooting.At the time of the incident, both agents were participating inOperation Metro Surge, a large-scale immigration enforcement initiative that launched inDecember. The operation deployed numerous armed, masked agents throughout Minneapolis as part of a citywide sweep.CBP, the agency that employs both men, has declined to publicly name the agents involved and has released little additional information about the shooting. The lack of transparency has drawn heightened scrutiny, particularly because the incident occurred only days after another immigration agentshot and killeda different Minneapolis protester,Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three.‘We’re fighting for the soul of the country’: how Minnesota residents came together to face ICERead morePretti’s death and the secrecy surrounding the agents’ identities have unfolded amid growing national debate over Donald Trump’shardline immigration policies. Enforcement actions in cities nationwide have included violent encounters involving both immigrants and US citizens, carried out by agents who, controversially, arepermittedtoconcealtheir identities with masks.Lawmakers from both parties have since urged a full and transparent investigation into the killing of Pretti, who was 37 and worked as an intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital.Earlier this week, CBP sent a notice to select members of Congress confirming that two agents discharged Glock pistols during the encounter that led to Pretti’s death, though the notice omitted their names. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, said through a spokesperson that the agents wereplaced on leavefollowing the shooting.After days of protests and pressure from lawmakers, the justice department announced on Friday that its civil rights division hadopened an investigation.Records reportedly show that Ochoa joined CBP in 2018 as a border patrol agent, while Gutierrez began working for the agency in 2014. Gutierrez serves in CBP’s office of field operations and is part of a special response team that handles high-risk missions similar to those carried out by police Swat units. Both men are from south Texas.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationMinneapolisMinnesota ICE shootingsMinnesotaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The snowfall represented a top-five snow event all time there, Mullinax said.North Carolina’s governor, Josh Stein,saidthat more than 1,000 collisions on snowy roads had resulted in two fatalities across the state over the weekend. He did not give any details on the victims.Flight cancellations exceeded 2,800 in the US onSaturday, with another 1,800 onSunday, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking and data company. More than 800 of those Sunday cancellations were for flights departing from or arriving to Charlotte Douglas international airport.The frigid weather brought temperatures as low as the 20s F to Florida’s panhandle and the 30s in south Florida, Mullinax said.

The mine at the centre of Europe’s push for rare earth metalsRead moreIt is the second summit on the matter within a month and involves about 20 countries including the G7 members – the UK, US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada – along with India and South Korea and Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and possibly Argentina.One area of discussion will be calls for the US to guarantee a minimum price for critical minerals and rare earths. A report this weekthat Washington has decided against the ideasent shares downwards in Australia, which has been positioning itself as a critical minerals alternative to China with a decision to stockpile elements such as antimony and gallium.It follows in the footsteps of Japan, which has actively built reserves for years to build resilience against China’s willingness to switch off supplies to advance its foreign policy.Canberra’s resources minister, Madeleine King, said a US decision not to offer minimum pricing “won’t stop Australia from pursuing our critical minerals reserve programme”.The Washington meeting has been convened by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, as he and other countries in attendance hope to ramp up non-China supply chains as fast as possible with potential pricing and investment support.“Strengthening critical mineral supply chains with international partners is vital for the US economy, national security, technological leadership, and a resilient energy future,” the US state department said in a pre-summit statement.EU sources said that if talks were successful, a joint statement would follow which could be seen as a milestone shift in relations with allies working with the US to de-risk from China instead of constantly fighting off Trump’s tariff threats.A UK minister will attend, the Foreign Office said, adding: “UK economic security goes hand in hand with national security. That’s why we are working to ensure a diversified critical minerals supply chain – a vital step to securing economic growth in the UK.“We look forward to continuing these important discussions with key partners.”The EU is also expected to use the summit to press the US to drop its newglobal steel derivative tariffs, which would lead to punitive levies on steel content on products that have elements of steel ranging from aluminum doors and bicycles to hair straighteners and offshore wind turbines.The first derivative tariff list was published in August, after Trump shook hands on the EU tariff deal at his Scottish golf course in July, but before the joint statement on the deal at the end of August.The Trump administration has threatenedto introduce a second list of up to 700 products this January, but the list has yet to appear giving the EU and the UK hope that they could still drive home their point.“We have complained a lot,” added one EU insider, while another said: “We hope they will take this into account as they are a breach of the deal in August.“They could argue that the first batch were announced between the deal in Scotland and the US-EU joint statement, but the second batch are a breach of a deal.”“This is about trust. You sign a deal and you trust it will apply,” said an EU source. “This constant threat of more tariffs, whether10% because of Greenlandor200% on champagnebecause they don’t sign up to the ‘board of peace’ has to stop.”The Trump administration has been convening multilateral consultations since October, when itagreed to a 12-month trade truce with China, which had threatened to choke off rare earth supplies in the escalating tariff dispute between them.The minerals have become some of the most essential raw materials for modern manufacturing, needed to produce everything from smartphones to fighter jets, to wind turbines to music speakers.Europe’s supply of permanent magnets, which are made with rare earths which have high magnetic properties, comes almost entirely from China.According to senior European Commission officials in December, the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year, of which 17,000 to 18,000 tonnes come from China, with just 1,000 from the EU.Explore more on these topicsMiningCritical mineralsEuropean UnionJapanEuropeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

You may be getting “peanut butter”.Anew reportfrom compensation software and data provider Payscale predicts that in 2026, many employers will be giving “peanut butter raises” to their employees – increases given “across the board” as opposed to being calculated individually based on performance or merit. They’re spread evenly, like peanut butter on a slice of bread.“In total, more than 40% of organizations are either using or actively considering standardized across-the-board or peanut butter pay increases in 2026,” the report said. “This increases to 56% for top performers (organizations who reported that they would exceed their revenue goals in 2025).”Most employers, the survey says, plan to give an average of 3.5% raises in 2026, which Payscale says is similar to last year (although based on the millions of employees in its system, payroll companyADPsaid that employers actually gave anywhere from 4.4% to 6.5% salary increases last year, depending on whether they left or stayed at their jobs). Regardless, inflation is about 3%, so raises are keeping up, if not staying ahead.US small businesses are doing fine. Don’t believe me? Look at the numbersRead moreBut please, if you’re a business owner or manager and you’re considering a peanut butter approach to your pay increases this year – and you’re blaming inflation – please, don’t. Your higher-performing employees deserve better than this. And your lower performers should be put on notice. I have nothing against peanut butter. Or jelly. But this practice is simply lazy. And – let’s face it – you’re probably doing the same with your performance reviews. We suck at performance reviews.We don’t document. We don’t reward. We don’t mentor. We don’t coach. We’re too busy chasing profits. Instead, most of us are still going through the motions of the outdated annual review. Many of my clients are way behind in the process.The workplace has changed dramatically over just the past decade. Millennials and gen Z workers now representmore than halfof today’s workforce. Younger workers grew up receiving real-time comments on their social media posts and received Little League trophies just for participating. They want immediate gratification when they do something good. And they deserve honest feedback when they don’t. Yet most employers still behave as we did 20 years ago.If you’re one of those organizations that are considering a peanut butter raise for your employees, rethink this practiceA 2015 study from the Society for Human Resource Management found that more than two-thirds of employees were dissatisfied with performance reviews, with 65% saying the exercise wasn’t even relevant to their jobs. Managers also overwhelmingly said that their company’s performance review process was not satisfactory.A 2025Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends surveyof more than 10,000 employees found fewer than one in three workers thought their performance reviews were “very fair and equitable”, and a majority of employees and managers lacked trust in performance management. AJune 2025 reportdescribed broad misalignment between employees and leaders on performance, with many employees feeling their reviews were unfair, stressful or just a checkbox exercise, and only about 29% of workers trusted their evaluation outcomes.Which is why it doesn’t surprise me that so many businesses are opting for “peanut butter raises” this year. It’s the easy way out. Why spend the time to individually evaluate your people when you can just slap an across-the-board increase on everyone and just be on your way?When a customer pays you, it means they’re satisfied with what you delivered. It’s the same with your employees. Raises are a true benchmark of performance. Employees should not only receive them, but know how their raise compares to the average in their group. If they care, they’ll seek to exceed the average. If they don’t care, and consistently rate below average, then that tells you something else. And if you do let that person go, they (and their attorneys) can’t say they weren’t forewarned.The right way to do this is to set specific goals and give raises twice a year if those goals are met, along with incentive bonuses at the end of the year, depending on how well a worker performed. The bonus doesn’t need to be cash either. Today’s worker loves flexibility, so additional paid time off works well. If you can’t afford either, consider a smaller pay increase coupled with a new title. Titles are important too.If you’re one of those organizations that are considering a peanut butter raise for your employees, rethink this practice. Ever seen thefamous scenein Mad Men? Where Don Draper tells his employee Peggy Olson, who complained that he never said thank you, that “That’s what the money is for!”He isn’t wrong. Raises matter. But so does regular feedback. Don’t be lazy about either.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS work & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

He played a mature match against Djokovic, the fourth seed, maintaining his composure after a blistering opening set from the Serbian towin in four sets. Alcaraz is also the youngest man in the open era to win seven grand slam titles.Djokovic tries his best in time-warp final but cannot stop compelling declineRead moreThis was a historic match on both sides of the net. Djokovic, who reached the final after a spectacularfive-set win over Jannik Sinner, the second seed and two-time defending champion, had been attempting to become the oldest grand slam champion in the open era.“The results are a testament to his already stellar career,” said Djokovic. “I can’t think of any other superlatives about him. He deserves every bit of the praise that he gets from his peers, but also the whole tennis community. He’s a very nice young man. Good values, nice family. Of course, already a legendary tennis player that made already a huge mark in the history books of tennis with only 22 years of age. It’s super impressive, no doubt about it.”This tournament was Alcaraz’s first since deciding to split with Juan Carlos Ferrero and install Samuel López, formerly Ferrero’s deputy, as his head coach. Alcaraz’s coaching decision was the source of ample speculation and criticism throughout the off-season. Alcaraz says he is glad to have silenced the doubters.“I didn’t think about those people that had doubts about it,” he said. “I came here just playing for myself, playing for my team. We all know how hard I worked in the pre-season to be ready for this tournament, and I had too many things to think about during this tournament. Just focus on my game style, focus on myself, being passionate, and that’s all I thought about during this tournament. But once I get it, I’m just happy to prove all the people were wrong.”Alcaraz has commemorated his first titles at each grand slam with a tattoo. After Sunday’s victory, he is already planning a kangaroo tattoo on one of his legs: “I’ve said it’s going to be a little kangaroo. It’s going to be in the leg, for sure. I don’t know the right, the left one. So I got to choose a good spot, but it’s going to be for sure close to the French Open or Wimbledon. I just have to choose.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Carlos AlcarazNovak DjokovicAustralian OpenAustralia sportTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Taylor is clearly animated in the footage, but did not appear to be physically aggressive before he was handcuffed by a police officer and taken away from the court.Taylor’s attorney, Gregory Reynald Williams, said the coach was “concerned about a group of players from Morehouse’s football team who were acting aggressively towards the Tuskegee players and their parents.”Taylor was was later released and rejoined his players as they left the arena.He told The Field of 68that the incident was humiliating.“I am at a loss for words and I am upset about how I was violated and treated today,” he said. “For my players, my family and people of Tuskegee to witness that is heartbreaking for me. I was simply trying to get the football team out of the handshake line as they were following right behind me and the team yelling obscenities. It was a very dangerous situation.”Williams said Taylor and his legal team were considering whether to bring a civil lawsuit over the incident. “Coach Taylor is a good man who did the right thing to protect his team and deescalate a dangerous situation and this officer put him in chains for his troubles,” Williams said.Taylor has been Tuskegee coach since 2019. The 58-year-old has also coached Hawaii and Chicago State.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Cardinals’ announcement brought an end to a nearly four-week hiring process.The 38-year-oldLos Angeles Ramsassistant replaces Jonathan Gannon, who was fired in January after compiling a 15-36 record over three seasons, including 3-14 last year. LaFleur – who is the younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur – has been the Rams’ offensive coordinator for the past three seasons.Maye v Stafford for MVP and Aaron Rodgers getting flattened: NFL end of season awardsRead moreLos Angeles had the NFL’s top offense in 2025, averaging nearly 400 total yards and more than 30 points per game. The Rams fell one game short of the Super Bowl, losingto the Seattle Seahawks 31-27in the NFC championship game.“I couldn’t be more fired up to become the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals and am beyond grateful to [owner Michael Bidwill and general manager Monti Ossenfort] for this opportunity,” LaFleur said in a statement released by the Cardinals. “Having competed against them in the NFC so many times in recent years, I know the type of talent and toughness the team has and cannot wait to get to Arizona to hit the ground running.”The Cardinals’ brass got a good look at LaFleur’s offense twice this past season when the Rams piled up a total of 82 points in a pair of lopsided wins. LaFleur also was the offensive coordinator for the New York Jets in 2021 and 2022 and worked under 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan for several years – including in Cleveland, Atlanta and San Francisco.LaFleur inherits some intriguing pieces on Arizona’s roster, including All-Pro tight end Trey McBride, receiver Marvin Harrison Jr, left tackle Paris Johnson Jr and veteran edge rusher Josh Sweat. Arizona also have the No 3 overall pick in April’s draft.“In his career, Mike has been around some of the best and brightest coaches in football and has been a key contributor to highly successful teams,” Ossenfort said. “He understands what winning football looks like and what it takes to achieve it.”But the biggest questions surround quarterback Kyler Murray, whose future with the franchise is in flux. The 28-year-old has played seven seasons in the desert since being selected with the No 1 pick in 2019 but has been to the playoffs just once, losing in the wildcard round to the Rams in 2021.Murray played in just five games last season because of a foot injury, throwing for 962 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions. He’s in the middle of a $230.5m, five-year contract that could last through 2028.Backup Jacoby Brissett started the final 12 games of the season, throwing for 3,366 yards, 23 TDs and eight interceptions but winning just one game. He’s under contract next season.LaFleur has to rebuild the Cardinals in the NFC West, which was the best division in football this season; the Cardinals’ 14 losses last season were more than the Rams, Seahawks and 49ers had combined. All three of those teams made it to the division round of the playoffs; the Seahawks will play for the Super Bowl on 8 February.Explore more on these topicsNFLArizona CardinalsLos Angeles RamsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

What seemed at the break as though it was going to be an easy away win unexpectedly became a draw and, as a result, both ends of the table looked quite different at the final whistle to how it appeared they were going to look at half-time.It was a case of multiple immutable but incompatible laws running into each other. On the one hand, Tottenham are terrible and have picked up only 10 points at home this season. But on the other, City have developed a habit of needlessly squandering points and somehow always do worse than expected against Tottenham. The consequence was a game that simultaneously made very little sense but at the same time was predictable, at least in the way it remained true to those fundamental principles.Solanke dents Manchester City’s title hopes with stirring comeback for SpursRead moreThis fitted a concerning pattern for Manchester City. Althoughthey beat Leedsand Fulhamthey conceded five goals in total in the second half of those two games. Level at half-time at Manchester United, they lost 2-0. Leading at half-time against Brighton and Chelsea, they conceded in the second half to draw 1-1. There has been a clear trend in recent months of City conceding important goals after half-time. Seven points have been lost through the concession of second-half goals this year alone; if they had those seven points, City would be a point clear at the top of the table.But Spurs this weekend will also have been thinking about half-times and how different things could look. At half-time at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening, West Ham led Chelsea 2-0; at half-time here, Spurs trailed 2-0. Had those results remained like that, Spurs would have been only five points above the drop zone and it would have been increasingly difficult to maintain the belief that they are not engaged in a relegation battle. As it is,after Chelsea’s comebackand Solanke’s two goals, the gap is nine and it feels a lot less like Spurs are sleepwalking into a dogfight.It wasn’t just that City led at half-time; it was that Spurs had been shambolic. They looked a team without resistance, without a clue. If the booing at half-time was relatively restrained, it can only have been because so many fans were so numbed by what they had seen. And, being fair, perhaps also because there was a recognition that it’s not really fair to judge Spurs when they’re without 11 injured players.From Tottenham’s point of view, the opening goal was inexcusably limp. Yves Bissouma was dispossessed on halfway by Bernardo Silva and then Rayan Cherki, having been released by Erling Haaland, was given an extraordinary amount of time and space to measure his shot across Guglielmo Vicario and into the bottom corner. Frank’s fury was obvious as he slammed an environmentally sustainable water carton to the ground (he may have been angry, but Frank remains responsible and Danish). Whatever the issues of personnel and whatever problems Frank has had, this was just poor play by two players who should be better.Or maybe they shouldn’t be. After all, Radu Dragusin, recently recovered from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, had played only seven minutes this season and hadn’t started a game for 371 days. He had a nightmare first half, at one point sliding past Rayan Cherki as he chopped inside, like a passing bobsledder with only a vague interest in the game, but perhaps that’s not unreasonable for a player who has played so little over the past year. Bissouma, similarly, had not played for the club this season before coming off the bench at half-time in the home defeat against West Ham a fortnight ago.View image in fullscreenTottenham started horribly, when Rayan Cherki scored early.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersCity’s second was almost as facile, as Dragusin’s long pass from near his byline was intercepted and Cristian Romero was somehow left with two to deal with. Silva slid it square and Antoine Semenyo finished a straightforward chance. It was all extremely easy. The sense was almost of an early-round Cup tie, the bigger side holding the plucky underdogs at arm’s length and picking them off as and when.When Romero did not reemerge for the second half, the assumption was that it would just get worse for Spurs. But the assumption was wrong. It wasn’t only Dominic Solanke’s involvement in the two goals – although that did serve as a clear reminder of what Spurs have been missing in his absence for much of this season. Xavi Simons has looked increasingly dangerous over the past few weeks, Dragusin settled and João Palhinha emerged as a dominant figure. And City, again, buckled, only two fine saves from Gianluigi Donnarumma preserving a point for them.In the end, although City’s expected goals was more than double their own, Tottenham will probably feel the draw was the least they deserved. What does it mean? Certainly no one at Spurs could look at that first half and feel much in the way of positivity. The injury list, similarly, can inspire only dread. But there was at least fight and that hasn’t always been true in the recent past.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurManchester CityPremier LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

However Kirsty Coventry, the IOC president, insisted that once the Games begin on Friday, their “magic and spirit” would take over.Coventry refused to comment directly on the protests in Milan against immigration and customs enforcement agents and said she hadn’t spoken to Wasserman, who has apologised for flirty emailssent to Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003when he was married, which only surfaced on Friday.Milan protesters denounce ICE unit at Winter Olympics and ‘creeping fascism’ in USRead moreHowever Coventry did accept that such distractions were far from ideal. “I think anything that is distracting from these Games is sad, right?” she said. “But we’ve learned over the many years that there’s always been something that has taken the lead up to the Games, whether it has been Zika or Covid, there has always been something.“But what is keeping my faith alive, is that when that opening ceremony happens and those athletes start competing, suddenly, the world remembers magic and the spirit that the Games have. And they get to suddenly remember what’s actually important, and they get to be inspired.”Saturday’s protest against ICE in Piazza XXV Aprile in Milan, a square named after the date of Italy’s liberation from Nazi fascism in 1945, drew hundreds of demonstrators. Milan’s mayor Giuseppe Sala has also said that ICE agents, who will accompany the US vice-president JD Vance to Friday’s ceremony, are not welcome.The appearance of Wasserman in the Epstein files, and reports that another IOC member is also in the emails, have been another distraction. “I’ve not been in contact with Casey,” added Coventry. “The focus has fully been on Milano-Cortina. In terms of IOC members, we’re obviously watching and monitoring the media, and we’re aware of a few things that have been reported just today. We need some time to look into that.”Meanwhile the Olympic Games’ executive director, Christophe Dubi, has insisted that the 11,800-capacity Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena would be ready in time despite admitting that construction was going down to the wire.“Do we still have work? Yes,” said Dubi. “Cleaning, absolutely. It’s frantic. But it’s to make it a really, really great venue. And hats off, because it started very late. So what they have pulled out in very few months is absolutely outstanding.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Champions League winners benefited from being mid-season with players at full fitness – in contrast toCorinthiansbeing in their pre-season and the Concacaf Champions Cup winners Gotham FC in their off-season – and from the decision to hold the tournament in London, and play the final at the Emirates Stadium. This was a competition set up for European success and Arsenal delivered. They are officially the world’s best club and they have a nice trophy to prove it. The 13-point gap, albeit with a game in hand, between them and Women’s Super League leaders Manchester City though, says otherwise.Kerolin crushes Chelsea’s WSL hopes to send Manchester City 11 points clear at topRead moreThe mood prior to kick-off was one of general bemusement at a competition Arsenal did not need in their schedule, sandwiched between critical WSL fixtures against Chelsea and City. “I think we all, and the players first, want to be competing at the highest level and they want to play games,” said the Arsenal manager, Renée Slegers, when asked about how they managed to fit these games into their season.“That’s what they train for, what they live for. What’s important is that if the schedule goes further and further in adding games that we do it in a tempo that is fair to the players and the players’ health. We are in a position where we have a really good squad with a lot of quality, but I’m also aware that not all teams have this luxury. So I think we have to be really aware of what we’re doing, how we’re growing competitions and adding competitions to the schedule, so we grow it in the right way.”The club from São Paulo offered a far sterner test thansemi-final opponents AS Far. The desire to take the title back to Brazil was evident in the talk of the fans, the manager, Lucas Piccinato, in the outrage at two unfortunate Arsenal academy players caught in a spying storm because they were spotted looking out the window at the Brazilian side as they trained at Barnet’s stadium, where Arsenal’s academy is based, and in the one million people watching on the stream of the Brazilian broadcaster CazéTV at the same time the men’s team were playing Flamengo in the Supercopa.View image in fullscreenLotte Wubben-Moy runs away in delight after restoring Arsenal’s lead in the second half.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Fifa/Getty Images“It was a big advantage playing in their home, but it is what it is,” said Piccinato. “We hope next time Arsenal will come to Brazil to play against us. I think it would be better if it was in a neutral venue.”The home team were predictably dominant on their home turf, but it was the Corinthians faithful who dominated in the stands, outnumbered but not outsung. The opening goal arrived 15 minutes in, when Corinthians’ goalkeeper Leticia parried Stina Blackstenius’s effort into the path of Olivia Smith who swung home on the half volley.Corinthians threatened on the counter but the equaliser came from a set piece, when Anneke Borbe failed to prevent a header from the 40-year-old Gabi Zanotti from crossing the line following Andressa’s corner.Quick GuideGotham grab third with 4-0 successShowGotham won the Women’s Champions Cup third-place playoff by convincingly defeating AS Far 4-0 at Arsenal Stadium. The NWSL champions took the lead through Khyah Harper, before Savannah McCaskill's first-time finish and Jaedyn Shaw's penalty put the game out of reach by half-time. A Midge Purce tap-in after the break finished off the Moroccan side.Gotham's coach, Juan Carlos Amorós, still had his thoughts on his side's 1-0 semi-final defeat by Corinthians in the aftermath. “It's a similar game in a lot of ways to the one we played four days ago,” he said. “The main difference is we were able to get the early lead that we know unsettled teams, and we were able to be more clinical in front of goal, which really allowed us to then play a bit more of a game where players can enjoy.”Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Arsenal’s second came from a less familiar source, the centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy pulling away from her marker to head in from Emily Fox’s cross from the right.Seemingly home, though not dry, they were punished again by the never-say-die Brazilian side. Katie McCabe was adjudged to have fouled Gisela Robledo deep into added time despite appearing to have got the ball before the player and, after a video assistant review, Vic Albuquerque converted from the spot to force extra time.The celebrations were wild, but short-lived; the Gunners were patient and punctured the momentum of the visiting team on the counter when Frida Maanum dispossessed Duda Sampaio and found her fellow substitute Caitlin Foord, who fired in.There was a nasty accident at the close when Borbe collided with Wubben-Moy and a Corinthians player as she smothered the ball beneath their feet. The goalkeeper left on a stretcher and was taken to hospital as a precaution.It was relief for Arsenal when the final whistle blew, Foord’s strike saving them from embarrassment in a tournament where they had a significant advantage. If this competition is to gain credibility and momentum, it needs a substantial amount of work back at the drawing board.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Champions CupArsenal WomenCorinthiansWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

One shot snapped Miller’s head backward and caused his hairpiece to lift from the front, exposing his bald patch before the wig folded backward. The incident drew gasps and laughter from the crowd.Miller finished the round with the hairpiece still partially attached. Between rounds, he removed it completely and tossed it into the crowd before returning to the fight.Miller went on to win the fight on a narrow split decision. After his victory was announced, he rubbed the top of his head while celebrating in the ring.Speaking afterward, Miller joked that he had lost much of his hair only days earlier after mistakenly using “ammonia bleach” he said he found at his mother’s house instead of shampoo.“I’m a comedian,” Miller said. “You have to make fun of yourself.”The 37-year-old has been a controversial figure. He was originally scheduled to face then-champion Anthony Joshua at MSG in 2019 before being removed from the bout after failing pre-fight drug tests. Joshua instead fought late replacement Andy Ruiz Jr, who stopped himin one of the sport’s biggest ever upsets.Miller returned to the sport after serving suspensions related to anti-doping violations and has since worked to reestablish himself in a crowded heavyweight division. He certainly reestablished himself on Saturday night, although perhaps not in the way he had planned.Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsTeófimo LópezShareReuse this content"

It was an amazing night,” Stevenson said. “I put the work in. I stayed disciplined throughout my camp. I was in tremendous shape. He’s a hell of a fighter, but I was the better man tonight.”Stevenson said he felt in control early in the fight and believed he had mentally and physically broken down López well before the final bell.“Yeah, I definitely did,” he said when asked if he felt he had demoralized his opponent. “I feel like he’s a fighter, so he tried to fight back, but yeah, I picked him apart.”The 28-year-old said he also sensed a physical edge during the fight, recalling a moment early on when he realized he could overwhelm the champion.“In the second round, I told my corner, I said, I’m stronger than he is,” Stevenson said.Stevenson credited his tactical preparation as a decisive factor, saying extensive film study helped him anticipate López’s movements and tendencies.“I studied them. I studied them all,” Stevenson said. “Everything I saw on tape was there tonight. There is benefits from watching tape.”That preparation was particularly evident in Stevenson’s use of the jab, which he repeatedly used to control distance and disrupt López’s rhythm.“I told my team before the fight, I said I got one of the best jabs in the world,” Stevenson said. “Tonight I went out there and used my jab over and over and made it a weapon, and he couldn’t stop it.”Despite entering the fight having spoken openly about wanting a stoppage, Stevenson said he had no regrets about winning by decision against a durable opponent.“There’s no disappointment. It’s boxing at the end of the day,” he said. “When I was about to stop him, he started fighting back a little bit. So respect to him. He’s a sharp fighter. He got a lot of knowledge, and he did what he had to do to survive.”Stevenson framed the victory as a defining career moment, particularly given the age and pedigree of his opponent.“I told everybody my moment was gonna come,” Stevenson said. “I’ve been calling people out. Teo took the bait. Finally somebody took the bait. I’ve been begging for this moment. We finally got it.”He also suggested the win could mark the beginning of a new phase in his career as he pursues the biggest fights available.“I’m into big fights. I like big fights. I like big money fights. I like proving that I’m the best,” Stevenson said. “I like doing things that people say I can’t do.”Among the potential future opponents raised after the fight was Britain’s Conor Benn, who climbed into the ring moments after the decision was announced, briefly facing off with Stevenson as the crowd reacted.Stevenson indicated he would be open to the bout if terms could be agreed.“I’m into big fights. I like big money fights. I like proving that I’m the best,” Stevenson said. “There’s a lot of people that say I’m too little for Conor Benn and I can’t do it – so it makes for a tremendous fight.”But Stevenson suggested negotiations could hinge on weight and contractual terms.“If he’s not going to agree, then we probably don’t fight,” Stevenson said. “I’m a businessman at the end of the day.”Looking ahead more broadly, Stevenson said his next move would be determined by a balance of legacy and financial opportunity rather than a specific opponent.“I gotta go back to the drawing board and get in front of my management team and see who is going to bring the biggest money fight and the biggest legacy fight,” he said.For Stevenson, Saturday’s performance represented more than another title win – it was confirmation that he belongs at the very top of the sport.“For sure,” he said when asked if he believes he is now one of boxing’s central figures. “I just stayed steady. I told everybody my moment was gonna come.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingTeófimo LópezUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Dominic Solanke kicked through the back of the City defender Marc Guéhi, the ball then going in but neither the referee nor the VAR felt there was enough in it for a foul to be given.Familiar tale of two halves haunts Manchester City as Spurs find belated resolve | Jonathan WilsonRead moreSolanke went on to volley a ­stunning equaliser to give Spurs and their embattled manager,Thomas Frank, a lift and leave City six points behind the leaders, Arsenal.It was put to Guardiola that Solanke had clearly kicked Guéhi. “OK, then you make the answer [for me],” ­Guardiola said. “If it’s a central defender to a striker it’s a penalty, right? You said the same, so you saw it.”Guardiola told BBC Radio 5 Live that it was “fascinating in the ­Premier League”. He later added in his press conference that “there was an ­emotional issue for the first goal that the referee conceded to Spurs … and after that, the momentum is ­difficult to control, whatever happens here in England.”View image in fullscreenManchester City’s Pep Guardiola shakes hands with referee Robert Jones.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersGuardiola has complained about a number of decisions in recent weeks. He was unhappy that an Antoine Semenyo goalwas ruled out at ­Newcastlein the Carabao Cup, how Manchester United’s Diogo Dalot avoided a red card in the derby for a studs-up foul on Jérémy Doku, and why City were denied a penalty against Wolves for handball.Guardiola was asked about the wider picture. “Nothing changed the opinion I had in the past,” he said. Even Frank appeared to have some sympathy for Guardiola on the Solanke first goal.“There’s clear contact from him [Solanke] on it,” Frank said. “We want, in general, a higher ­threshold [for fouls]. I understand it’s in the grey area. The Liverpool goal by Hugo ­Ekitiké [against Spurs on 20­ December] was in my opinion still two clear hands in the back of Cristian Romero. So it’s no grey areas [there]. I’m just very happy it finally dropped for us, which I think was more than fair.”Frank, who was without 11 ­players because of injury, lost Romero to ­illness at half-time. Solanke has only recently returned from long-term injury and could not complete the full game. The 17-year-old centre-back, Jun’ai Byfield, came on for him in the 89th minute and played at right-midfield on his league debut.“This team’s ability to respond to setbacks and show resilience is ­growing bit by bit,” Frank said. “It’s game 11 since Nottingham Forest [when Spurs lost 3-0 on 14 ­December] and we are showing more ­consistency. We are more ­competitive. It’s going in the right direction.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurManchester CityPep GuardiolaThomas FrankPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Bruno Fernandes ran down the right, crossed, and Sesko did the rest, the grin from the striker, on as a replacement, lighting his face in ecstasy.Asked if this late winner had United’s DNA on it, Michael Carrick gushed. “It’s the best feeling, I have to say,” said the interim manager. “Some of the best moments that I’ve been lucky enough to be a part of [as a United player] have come when you get a moment of elation like that. There’s no better place, in front of the Stretford End and it ends up meaning a bit more. I think people leave here with more than United winning today. It kind of puts layers on top of that and the connection – it’s why we all love it so much.“The excitement that’s part of this club and it’s not always the easiest way, we’d like to win games a little bit more comfortably than that. But certainly when they come along, it’s pretty special.”Sesko’s was the third senses-tingling strike of a life-affirming second half. The first came from Matheus Cunha whose choice of celebration in front of the Stretford End was to dance after a strike reminiscent of the many which have illuminated this venue down the years.View image in fullscreenMatheus Cunha doubles Manchester United’s lead.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APFrom outside Fulham’s area, to the right of the D, Casemiro slid a no-look pass in behind. His fellow Brazilian Cunha hurtled forward and, with the angle closing, smashed his right boot through the ball to beat Leno.Cue a spreading of arms in a surfing-like action that might have come straight from the wave-riders of Copacabana beach, the winger’s finish following Casemiro’s first-half opener. This delighted United and their afternoon continued to be rosy when Jorge Cuenca was again affected by the video assistant referee, James Bell, after his lead role in Casemiro’s opener.Raúl Jiménez’s free-kick hit United’s wall inside the area, Samuel Chukwueze’s effort struck Lisandro Martínez and broke for the Spaniard to score. But, after a prolonged review, Bell adjudged Chukwueze to be offside, though the image used by the VAR seemed inconclusive. Fulham were far better after the break and scored a late Jiménez penalty, after Harry Maguire had chopped the Mexican down, before Kevin’s goal.Yet the spoils go to United, after their third consecutive victory under Carrick, which came via a front-foot display that featured two first-half penalty claims involving Cuenca – one denied and one given by the referee, John Brooks, before the VAR overturned the decision but awarded a free-kick for an earlier infringement that created Casemiro’s finish.View image in fullscreenFulham’s Marco Silva (left) was unhappy with the officiating at Old Trafford.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersFirst Brooks correctly denied Bryan Mbeumo a spot-kick because Cuenca took the ball first. But when the centre-back upended Cunha, Brooks pointed to the spot but had missed that the Spaniard had taken the ball before man. The penalty decision was overturned but the VAR indicated Cuenca had grabbed Cunha before he ran into the area and a foul was given.From the free-kick, Fernandes picked out Casemiro at the back post and he headed home to Marco Silva’s all-round disgust, the Portuguese booked for his protests.Silva’s argument was that the VAR had effectively re-refereed Brooks’s decision and decided on a different infringement. “The penalty was given for the tackle,” he said. “After, because the decision was so bad, they found a different foul. The story of the game started with [this] horrendous, terrible decision from John Brooks with the penalty he gave. Horrendous decision from that moment – big mistake. It was the first time we saw all thePremier Leaguefans and us coaches and players. We have to take all this frustration to win the next one.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Sesko fires home the stoppage-time winner.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersUnited had a flow seen rarely in recent years, an ease of play that had Kobbie Mainoo drifting a ball into the area that a flying Fernandes just missed and Amad Diallo, cantering to halfway, squaring inside to his captain, and Fernandes sweeping the ball left to Cunha.In the technical area Carrick emanated a cool persona that his players could feed off. The move they ended the first half with was illustrative – a Fernandes backheel into Amad that was as nonchalant as the winger’s swivel-and-unload which was deflected for a corner.Now came Fulham’s upturn in performance. A clever Alex Iwobi chip to Lammens’s right-post was hit back across goal and Martínez cleared. The rest of the half was breathless, featuring Cunha’s goal, Cuenca’s disallowed strike, and Sesko heading against a post before Kevin’s finish and the Slovene’s winner.Beforehand, The 1958 fan group, staged its latest action against United’s ownership.

Jorge de Frutos pulled Rayo level early in the second half, prompting visible anger from the Madrid fans at their team. Frustration was averted when Mbappé netted from the spot following Pathé Ciss’s red card at the death. Rayo also had Pep Chavarría sent off before the final whistle.Madrid’s interim head coach, Álvaro Arbeloa, and Mbappé had begged fans to support the team afterReal’s defeat at Benficain midweek, but the Santiago Bernabéu crowd was in unforgiving mood. The former Barcelona winger Ilias Akhomach fired narrowly wide early on – the atmosphere would have been further soured had his effort crept inside Thibaut Courtois’ post.Madrid suffered an early setback as the England international Bellingham pulled up holding the back of his thigh, going off in agony. The club later confirmed the midfielder is likely to be out for up to a month.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham departed the field after just 10 minutes in agony and clutching his hamstring during Real Madrid’s 2-1 in over Rayo Vallecano.Photograph: JJ Guillen/EPAVinícius put the hosts ahead in the 15th minute, showing tidy footwork just inside the area before firing high over Augusto Batalla and into the net. Los Blancos were in charge but, despite taking the lead, their fans were not content and whistled the team in at the break.They were even less impressed, minutes into the second half, when Rayo pulled level. Álvaro García nodded a cross down for De Frutos, a former Madrid youth player, to reach and drill home. The visitors should have taken the lead after an hour when Andrei Ratiu ran through on goal but Courtois made a superb save to deny him.Rayo made life harder for themselves when the midfielder Ciss was sent off for an ugly foul on Madrid’s Dani Ceballos. Eduardo Camavinga headed against a post as Arbeloa’s side turned the screw, before nine minutes of stoppage time were added on.With the clock ticking down, Madrid were awarded a penalty when Nobel Mendy clumsily fouled Brahim Díaz, and La Liga’s top scorer, Mbappé, dispatched it to snatch three points for his side.In France Nuno Mendes scored a late winner asParis Saint-Germainsurvived the second-half sending-off of Achraf Hakimi to beatStrasbourg2-1 and reclaim top spot from Lens in Ligue 1.

At Stockley Park, the video assistant referee, Paul Tierney, rewound the clock by 19 seconds, to the moment Leon Bailey, at the opposite end of the pitch, was deemed to have failed to keep the ball in play.Ten-man Nottingham Forest earn valuable point in feisty clash with Crystal PalaceRead moreAfter a VAR delay of almost four minutes, Robinson’s mic connected with the stadium speakers. “After review, the ball is factually out of play, so the restart will be a throw-in to Brentford,” the referee said amid mass groans – and much worse – from the restless locals. It was reminiscent ofNewcastle’s winner against Arsenal in 2023, when Anthony Gordon’s goal was allowed to stand because there was no conclusive evidence the ball had gone out in the buildup, though seemingly there were no such problems at the VAR hub on this occasion. The Premier League’s match centre said the ball was out of play “within the attacking possession phase (APP)”.Unai Emery suggested running play back so far sets a dangerous precedent. “I think it’s not fair, but it happened and I must accept it,” said the Villa manager. “The referees are so demanding of themselves to get everything right. If there is something they can improve, I know they will do it. My explanation is that the goal happened a long time after the initial incident, and if the linesman didn’t see it, we have to keep playing. It’s difficult for VAR to analyse this goal. It’s so tight. But when VAR asks the referee … the problem is the VAR must not ask the referee in this situation.”Keith Andrews, theBrentfordhead coach, acknowledged the period of time before a goal the VAR should assess is the “million-dollar question”, but insisted Abraham’s disallowed goal was in the “same phase of play” as Bailey facing his own goalline trying to keep the ball in play. Bailey, making a homecoming of a different kind after being recalled from Roma last month, was on his backside when the ball appeared to drift out of play near the corner flag. Villa kickstarted their attack from there, diagonally surging upfield, culminating in Jadon Sancho jinking inside Jordan Henderson and forcing Caoimhín Kelleher into an instinctive save. Abraham was quickest to the rebound and wheeled away in celebration, but it was short-lived. Invariably, the discourse surrounding the decision is unlikely to die down anytime soon.View image in fullscreenTammy Abraham’s effort was ruled out after a review.Photograph: Jacob King/PABrentford went close to compounding Villa’s misery, Kristoffer Ajer almost scoring from the restart, long-throw specialist Michael Kayode launching the ball into the box. It was one of just two shots the visitors mustered on target, the other Dango Ouattara’s brilliant goal in first-half stoppage time, five minutes after Kevin Schade was sent off for petulantly shoving his studs into Matty Cash’s groin after the pair tangled.Ouattara raced into the channel and after his attempt to square the ball for Igor Thiago was blocked by Pau Torres, from an awkward angle, he simply cut on to his left boot and lashed an unerring strike into the far top corner. Schade, Andrews said, was a relieved man. “He’s very grateful that his teammates put in the shift they did.”For Andrews, whose side moved within four points of fifth-placed Chelsea, this victory represented another feather in the cap, the Brentford manager eight months into the job getting one over on Emery, by comparison a veteran. Villa had lost just two league games here since the start of last season, though this defeat means they have lost successive home games for the first time in two years. “To say the performance was pleasing is an understatement,” Andrews said. “It was a defensive masterclass in the second half. The desire to stop the ball going in our net was immense.”View image in fullscreenKevin Schade clashes with Aston Villa’s Matty Cash, resulting in a red card for the Brentford winger.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesThe inevitable Villa onslaught felt unsustainable from a Brentford perspective. The visitors had to withstand waves of pressure. Sancho ran at Kayode time and again, with varying degrees of success. Kelleher smothered an Emi Buendía effort at the back post approaching the hour, by which point it had long turned into a game of attack v defence. A cute Sancho cutback eluded those in claret and blue that had loaded the box. Cash saw a stinging effort repelled by the busy Kelleher.Brentford required some respite but it also proved a draining experience for everyone of a Villa persuasion. Emery turned to Harvey Elliott, who entered as a substitute for his seventh appearance in all competitions since joining on loan from Liverpool and only his second since October. Villa tried to force an equaliser. Morgan Rogers whipped a devilish cross into the six-yard box and in the 90th minute Bailey wasted Villa’s best chance, ballooning over after driving inside the substitute Aaron Hickey.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaBrentfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was a chastening afternoon for Sonia Bompastor’s side at the Etihad Stadium where Manchester City dismantled the champions to open up a surely unassailable lead at the top of the Women’s Super League.In an emphatic victory symbolic of the ongoing changing of the guard, Kerolin scored a hat-trick as the runaway leaders won 5-1 and their jubilant fans were taunting Chelsea with chants of “easy, easy, easy” before the end. City are coasting towards clinching their first title since 2016 and this latest victory almost left their head coach lost for words.Manchester City v Chelsea: Women’s Super League – liveRead more“In the circle afterwards, that was the first time I said to the players ‘actually I don’t know what to say’, because I am [so] proud of the performance,” said Andrée Jeglertz, who felt his team were handling the pressure “marvellously”, adding: “A lot of people were expecting us to perform and they managed it. It’s amazing.”Jeglertz’s supremely confident-looking side now have a 12-point advantage over Chelsea, who slipped to third, and an 11-point lead over second-placed Manchester United, with eight games remaining. Even with trips to the Emirates Stadium and Old Trafford to come, none of City’s rivals will realistically harbour any hope of catching them.View image in fullscreenKerolin opens the scoring for Manchester City in their emphatic victory.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersThe star of the show was Brazil’s Kerolin, who opened the scoring with a deflected strike after Chelsea failed to clear a set piece. What followed was an impressive spell of Chelsea pressure but, when the visitors failed to score while they were on top, City punished them when Khadija Shaw ran on to Vivianne Miedema’s through ball, outmuscled Naomi Girma and finished past Hannah Hampton to make it 2-0 and put Jeglertz’s team in full control.Chelsea’s day worsened after half-time when they conceded possession in Manchester City’s half and found themselves exposed at the back. Kerolin raced away with such speed that no one could catch her, and she chipped Hampton in cool style.After slotting in another from Lauren Hemp’s pass, Kerolin was withdrawn to a standing ovation, on a day where her skill and lethal acceleration proved unstoppable. Their captain, Millie Bright, summoned her teammates into a huddle at 4-0 for a short, crisis team talk, and they did get a goal back through Alyssa Thompson’s classy finish. But Miedema was soon heading in from a corner to restore the four-goal cushion as the visitors’ poor defending continued and their body language stooped to new, low levels.Chelsea’s defensive collapse on Sunday afternoon summed up the rapid collapse of their title challenge since December. Having previously been unbeaten in the WSL since 1 May 2024 and yet to suffer a domestic loss under Bompastor, this latest defeat was their third in their past five WSL matches sinceDecember’s surprise loss to Everton. They have now lost back-to-back WSL games for the first time since July 2015, and Bompastor – seemingly invincible scarcely two months ago – suddenly found herself being asked after the game whether she was confident of keeping her job.Quick GuideWSL roundup: Naalsund double lifts Manchester UnitedShowManchester Unitedboosted their chances of Women’s Champions League qualification as they climbed to second with a victory that left their opponentsLiverpoolrooted to the bottom. Lisa Naalsund's double, either side of an Alice Bergström equaliser for the Merseyside club, was followed by a late strike from Fridolina Rolfö that gave Marc Skinner's side a deserved victory that moved them above Chelsea.Liverpool remain a point adrift ofWest Ham, who also lost on Sunday, with fifth-placedTottenhamboosting their own European hopes by fighting back from a goal down to win 2-1, with Olivia Holdt's scorching strike from just outside the box settling it, before Tottenham saw Drew Spence sent off for a bad challenge in the closing stages.There was finally a home league victory forEverton, for the first time this season, to significantly ease their relegation concerns and move them four points above Liverpool. Martina Fernández's two headers saw them fight back to beatAston Villa2-1, with the Spain youth international defender's winning goal coming in the 89th minute.London City Lionessesrecorded their first league win under the head coach, Eder Maestre, as they also came from behind to win 2-1, away atBrighton, to leapfrog the Sussex club in the table and climb to sixth spot. Brighton had led through Kiko Seike shot that went in off the post, before Moeka Minami's own goal was followed by a fine finish from Freya Godfrey, who scored for the second time in as many games.Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Really confident. I’m really honest. In the club, if people think I’m not the right person to stay in this job, then I’ll be happy to go if they think that’s the right thing. But I will never give up,” Bompastor replied. “In football, I know sometimes it happens. I will always fight but the institution at Chelsea is a lot more important than myself.”Asked what had gone wrong this season, the Frenchwoman added: “A lot of things could be said. I like to keep that more private with the board, players and the staff but obviously, as you can see, the squad is not the same as last season. A lot of people talk about Chelsea being an example of having depth in the squad – right now, I don’t think we are probably in that place. I’m not saying that explains everything, but being in that position probably doesn’t help.”Chelsea will now travel to Tottenham next Sunday in the sobering situation of needing to win to avoid slipping out of the Champions League places, so far have they fallen in such a short space of time.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The full-back produced a fantastic save and some amateur dramatics but was dismissed, having given away a penalty, in a game his side looked favourites to win.Ismaïla Sarr scoring the resulting spot-kick to cancel out Morgan Gibbs-White’s opener was the only additional damage, as Forest showed their defensive muscle. If it was not for Palace currently living in striker purgatory, waiting for one to leave and a replacement to arrive, they may have made more of the one-man advantage, rather than extend their winless run to nine matches.Aston Villa’s title hopes dealt blow by 10-man Brentford amid VAR dramaRead more“We missed the No 9 in the box,” Oliver Glasner said. “We just showed how thin our nerves are. We lost a little bit of nerves, then we started to run with the ball. Everybody wanted to take the responsibility and then took wrong decisions. We lost the balls too easily and then it was the last 15-20 minutes. It was just a very bad game, to be honest. But we don’t want to blame anybody. The reason for this is our psychological situation over weeks and months now.”There was plenty of animosity between the two clubs before kick-off. Forest took Palace’s place in the Europa League after last season’s FA Cup winners were demoted to the Conference League, creating a bitter feud. This week’s intense chase for Jean-Philippe Mateta’s services did little to bring harmony. His name appeared on the back page of the match programme but that is unlikely to be a regular feature because the French striker isheading to Milan instead, lured by a Serie A title battle rather than an English relegation fight.The home supporters did their best to wind up the visitors with chants about their owner, Evangelos Marinakis, seen as a villain at Selhurst Park. Palace fans unveiled an offensive banner during the reverse fixture in August, leading to an FA misconduct charge to add extra spice to this clash. Marinakis was in attendance, potentially with Monday’s deadline day in mind. Their latest arrival, the goalkeeper Stefan Ortega, was paraded and Lorenzo Lucca among the subs, with Sean Dyche adding there “two or three” potential incomings.The best way to infuriate opponents is to prevent them from scoring and then punishing them. Matz Sels saved smartly from Jefferson Lerma and within minutes Forest were ahead. Gibbs-White won a header from a corner and Palace failed to clear, the Forest man chested down and calmly finished, to further enliven an already raucous atmosphere.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest's Neco Williams handles a shot from Crystal Palace's Jefferson Lerma resulting in a red card for deliberate handball and a penalty.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAPalace enjoyed some dangerous moments in the early stages as they attempted to get back into the game but lacked confidence and conviction in a relatively open first half. It is understandable for a team that have lost their captain, Marc Guéhi, and Mateta, while Adam Wharton was suspended, forcing Glasner to name only seven subs, including two goalkeepers. Glasner had no recognised striker, so will be desperate for the Jørgen Strand Larsen deal to be completed.With Forest cruising to the break, Williams made the bizarre decision to palm Lerma’s header away. Never has there been an easier red card and penalty to award, despite the defender pretending the ball hit him in the face. Sarr did the rest from the spot to reinvigorate the away end and silence the majority. Victory would have taken Forest level on points with Palace but that was not a concern after losing a man.Williams apologised for his error at the break and Sean Dyche reacted by making three substitutions at half time, including a debut for Angus Gunn, who is effectively now the fourth-choice goalkeeper, replacing the injured Sels. Dyche elected to sit back and give Palace all the possession, leaving Gibbs-White and Igor Jesus as the only potential attacking outlets.Forest mixed up disciplined defending by doing everything they could to aggravate Palace with the ambition of levelling up numbers. Lerma and Yeremy Pino got heated with some pushing on Forest players, while Igor Jesus sought a card, claiming he had been pulled back when chasing a through ball but he undoubtedly made the most of it.Christantus Uche was sent on to provide a focal point against Dyche’s 4-3-2 formation, which was holding firm as Palace failed to have a single shot on target in the second half. The hosts were slowing the game down as much as possible, Gunn showing his merits as delayer-in-chief, if nothing else.“I think it has to be a point earned,” Dyche said. “It’s just an instinctive thing [from Williams]. We defended very well. I think that’s his [Williams] frustration is he knows it’s tough when you’re 10 v 11 but I thought the players were terrific.”Forest had moments on the counter but were unable to make the returning Dean Henderson work too hard in the Palace goal, as the match petered out to leave 17th-placed Forest six points clear of West Ham.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

We will take learnings from that. We will certainly address this series and look forward to the World Cup.”View image in fullscreenMarcus Stoinis top-scored with 23 runs off 22 balls.Photograph: Sameer Ali/Getty ImagesBut even though his inexperienced side should be bolstered going into their first World Cup match in Sri Lanka in 10 days’ time with the return of Glenn Maxwell, Tim David and Josh Hazlewood, there was no hiding from the humiliation of the past four days.Most alarming, with Sri Lanka’s similarly spin-friendly wickets awaiting, was just how at sea their batters looked against high-quality tweakers, with only Marcus Stoinis (23), Cameron Green (22) and Josh Philippe (14), who is not in the World Cup squad, reaching double figures.Pat Cummins ruled out of T20 World Cup as Australia overlook Smith for final squadRead moreAlreadywithout injured Test captain Pat Cummins, it seemed to show why Australia could have done with the experience, batting excellence and leadership of the overlooked Steve Smith at a World Cup where spin could prove key.Debutant Matt Renshaw had another tough day, bowled when trying to ramp Shaheen Shah Afridi, who ensured it wasn’t solely a spin show as he added that wicket to the scalp of Marsh, who he bowled with a beauty that cut back on just the fourth ball of the innings.It meant Renshaw has begun his T20I career with innings of 15, two and one to take into the World Cup, while Cooper Connolly has scored just one run and suffered three dismissals while facing eight balls. This time, he got flummoxed by Nawaz and was stumped.It proved a remarkable day for Nawaz, who enjoyed two separate overs in which he snaffled two wickets. The key over was the 10th, when he got rid of Australia’s two top-scorers Stoinis and Green, the latter being deceived by a superb turner.The match was also overshadowed later by news thatPakistan are planning to boycott their match against Indiain Sri Lanka in a fortnight.View image in fullscreenPakistan’s Usman Tariq has previously said he has ‘two elbows’ in his arm and that it bends naturally.Photograph: Sameer Ali/Getty ImagesBefore the third match Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq hit back after his bowling action appeared to be mocked by Green in the second T20I.Green (35 off 20) top-scored in Australia’s failed chase, then seemed to mimic Tariq’s sidearm, slinging action as he walked into the dugout having fallen to the spinner.Tariq later responded in an Instagram post, sharing a video of a child crying with the caption: “After getting out”.There is no indication that officials or the Australian team have lodged a complaint.Explore more on these topicsAustralia cricket teamTwenty20T20 World Cup 2026T20 World CupAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Elliott’s mare is top-priced at 11-4, though several firms bracket the pair as 5-2 joint-favourites.“If we’d run well and been beaten by Lossiemouth, that would have been enough to run in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham,” Michael O’Leary, Brighterdaysahead’s owner, said. “Winning was a bonus. If she’s run well and jumped well on that kind of [very soft] ground, then she’s fit to go to the Champion Hurdle and that’s where we’ll go. They’re two very good mares, her and Lossiemouth, and we’re very lucky to be in this position.”View image in fullscreenOwner Michael O’Leary gives Brighterdaysahead a kiss.Photograph: Niall Carson/PATownend, meanwhile, reported that he had not been happy at any point aboard the favourite. “I was never comfortable on her,” Townend said. “It surprised me that I actually got in with a chance at any stage. Everything was hard work today.”Brighterdaysahead’s win was a significant boost for Elliott in his attempt to depose Mullins as Ireland’s champion trainer and claim the title for the first time. Mullins, though, responded with two Grade One wins on the day, saddling the 5-1 shot, Kaid d’Authie, to upset his stable-companion, Final Demand, the 1-3 favourite, in the Ladbrokes Novice Chase before the mercurial Majborough returned to form in impressive style in the Dublin Chase.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Monday tipsShowKempton:12.52Jem’s Lilly1.27Aviation2.02Step Ahead2.35Graecia3.07Madara3.42Grand Conqueror4.17Lover DesboisSouthwell:1.02Roger Rarebit1.37Benmore2.12Wilstar2.45Moyganny Phil3.17Parish Star3.52Firm But Fair4.27La HigueraWolverhampton:5.00Take The Boat5.30Leonetto6.00Flicka’s girl6.30Ernie’s Valentine (nap)7.00Corundum7.30Francesco Baracca8.00Electrocution (nb)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Majborough was the beaten favourite in last season’s Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham and also in his two previous starts this season, but he jumped impeccably in front in first-time cheekpieces and eventually powered 21 lengths clear of Marine Nationale,last season’s Queen Mother Champion Chasewinner.“Mark [Walsh, Majborough’s jockey] wanted to do things his way today, and that paid off huge,” Mullins said. “He was happier doing it and the horse was obviously happier doing it, so onwards and upwards.”Majborough is the new favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase on 11 March at a top price of 7-4, while Marine Nationale, the ante-post favourite going into Sunday’s race, is out to 3-1.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bilateral cricket remains suspended between the neighbours, who engaged in a military conflict that nearly snowballed into a fully fledged war last year.Their fraught political relations prompted the governing InternationalCricketCouncil to broker an arrangement allowing them to play at a neutral venue when their neighbour hosts a global tournament.The 2009 champions had earlier announced their squad for the 20-team tournament beginning on 7 February, maintaining their participation was subject to government approval.Their decision to boycott the India match is a serious blow to the tournament because an India-Pakistan clash remains cricket’s greatest blockbuster.This is not the first example of political tension affecting the tournament.Bangladesh have been replaced by Scotlandin the global showpiece after their refusal to travel to India over safety concerns.The latest setback is a continuation of the soured India-Pakistan relations, which manifested in last year’s Asia Cup in Dubai. India beat Pakistan three times in the tournament, including in the 28 September final, butrefused to shake handswith their opponents and refused to accept the trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, who happens to be Pakistan’s interior minister.Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026CricketT20 World CupTwenty20Pakistan cricket teamIndia cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Harry Brook’s 12-ball 36 helped England chase down a revised target of 168 in the secondTwenty20international against Sri Lanka, securing a series victory.England had initially been set 190, but a rain break changed the equation; when Brook emerged England needed 87 from 7.5 overs. He put on an exhibition over the off side to turn the chase his team’s way. While the captain’s knock was brief, Tom Banton made his case for a starting spot at the T20 World Cup, putting aside his tough time in the field to stay the course with an excellent, unbeaten 54. He has three red-inkers in successful chases since joining the T20 middle order last summer.Sri Lanka v England: second men’s cricket T20 international – liveRead moreSam Curran finished it with two balls left, victory by six wickets, but the tension had gone a few overs before. Brook will head into the World Cup without a T20 series defeat during his reign, and with decent competition for places in that batting lineup; Ben Duckett was missing again with a bruised finger. “To get a series win in Sri Lanka is a special achievement,” said Banton. Now they’ve got two in one week.England went in unchanged fromthe series openerwhile Sri Lanka brought in Pavan Rathnayake and Dunith Wellalage, both having impressed in the one-day series. The hosts began well, just as they had done on Friday. Pathum Nissanka uppercut Curran and whipped Jofra Archer out of the ground, the umpire forced to pick out a new ball. Brook was proactive, calling for spin in the third over, but Nissanka swept Will Jacks away for six as the openers put on 56 for the first wicket.Nissanka could not go on, his footwork evading him on 34 when he dragged Archer on to the stumps. That rhythm was established; none of the batters advanced to a half-century, but a succession of cameos made for a decent total.Adil Rashid did not rip through the visitors but he did befuddle Dasun Shanaka: two tossed-up leg-breaks were followed by the googly, the Sri Lanka captain trapped leg-before. Liam Dawson contributed the key wicket of Kusal Mendis for 32, while Jacks was economical.Instead, the hosts welcomed the quicks, eight overs of seam conceding 103 runs. Jamie Overton made Rathnayake miscue the pull, but the edge flew over fine leg for six. The Surrey quick’s anger grew with Banton’s drop at short third off Rathnayake, who top-scored with a 22-ball 40.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook’s quickfire 36 helped turn the revised run chase England’s way.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APArcher, sending down his back-of-the-hand slower ball, watched two catches go down when bowling to Charith Asalanka: Phil Salt could not hold on after making up the ground at deep point, while Banton spilled at deep backward square. In the middle of all this, the global game grew more unstable. News filtered in ofPakistan boycotting their World Cup matchagainst India, which was meant to be played in Colombo.This was a memorable day for Jos Buttler, his 402nd game for England making him the country’s record appearance-maker. While Salt and Jacob Bethell departed cheaply, the veteran looked in good touch, pinging the ball through point for consecutive boundaries off the lively Matheesha Pathirana.The opener and Banton got their reverse-slaps out against Wellalage but rain interrupted their stand on 57 for two. The break in play lasted a little over an hour. The revised equation left 111 needed off 9.4 overs; big hits were required straight away.There was immediate drama but it wasn’t enjoyable. Eshan Malinga thundered in for one delivery and fell to the ground clutching his left shoulder. The right-arm quick’s game was over, prompting a trip to the hospital.The game continued to turn. Banton sent Wanindu Hasaranga over deep midwicket before Wellalage had Buttler caught at deep point on 39. Out came Brook. He provided a leading edge off his first ball; moments later he hit his first staggering shot of the night, a flick off the left-arm spinner that had the ball screaming to long-on.The brutality was just beginning. Brook hit three sixes off Pathirana, channelling the energy of his 50-over century on Tuesday. The scoop against the same bowler went wrong, leading to his departure with 38 still required. But the rate had dropped significantly and Banton remained, well supported by Curran, the series won with a game to play.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamTwenty20newsShareReuse this content"

(The Guardian had it 118-110.)In a contest between arguably the two best American fighters active today, framed all week as a clash between volatility and control, it was Stevenson’s composure and fistic acumen that defined the night. The unbeaten southpaw from Newark, New Jersey, dictated the tempo early, repeatedly forcing López into reset mode with sharp lead-hand work and disciplined foot positioning that prevented the champion from establishing rhythm or distance.A rollicking crowd of 21,324 spectators – a record for boxing at the present-day Garden – arrived primed for chaos after a combustible fight week that included heated press conferences and a weigh-in melee. Instead, Stevenson turned the main event into something colder and more clinical, methodically dismantling López’s offense while fighting in the pocket and off the front foot for nearly the entire duration.Stevenson (25-0, 11 KOs) established the geometry of the fight from the opening bell. He met López at center ring, touching him with his jab within seconds and following with clean left hands upstairs. López, born in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood to Honduran parents, landed occasionally, drawing chants of “TEE-OH! TEE-OH!” from the lower bowl. But Stevenson’s advantages in hand speed, footwork and timing were immediately apparent.View image in fullscreenTeófimo López, right, absorbs a blow from Shakur Stevenson on Saturday night.Photograph: Ishika Samant/Getty ImagesThe pattern only sharpened in the second. Stevenson landed the cleanest punch of the fight to that point – a flush shot that drew audible gasps – while continuing to push forward, undermining the narrative that he would box cautiously on the back foot. When Stevenson briefly went down, the referee ruled it a slip, and he resumed control behind a sharp jab and straight lefts that repeatedly split López’s guard.By the third and fourth rounds, the contest had already tilted decisively. Stevenson’s educated jab – ramrod straight and delivered with blinding speed – neutralized López’s attempts to close distance. The champion struggled to find the target, often lunging at empty air as Stevenson exited exchanges at sharp angles. By the end of the fourth, the question inside the arena had shifted from who was winning to whether Stevenson might eventually force a stoppage. “Tonight I went out there and used my jab over and over and made it a weapon – and he couldn’t stop it,” Stevenson said.López (22-2, 13 KOs) showed flashes of competitiveness in the fifth, attempting to increase output and vary his attack, but Stevenson’s jab continued to dictate terms. The sixth brought the first visible damage when Stevenson opened a cut over López’s left eye while continuing to walk his man down. López was investing heavily to the body, digging shots to Stevenson’s midsection, but the work produced little visible slowing of the challenger’s pace or sharpness.By the seventh, frustration began to mount. López’s best hope seemed to lie in catching Stevenson in transition or baiting him into a mistake, but the challenger’s ring intelligence left few openings that weren’t accounted for. “I studied them. I studied them all,” Stevenson said. “Everything I saw on tape was there tonight. There is benefits from watching tape.”View image in fullscreenTeófimo López lost all but one round on all three judges’ scorecards.Photograph: Cris Esqueda/Cris Esqueda Matchroom BoxingLópez found his best stretch in the eighth and ninth rounds when Stevenson eased off the gas, perhaps conserving his energy for the championship rounds. López built on it in the ninth, letting his hands go and connecting with heavy body shots in one of his stronger rounds of the fight. But even then, the broader picture remained unchanged.Any sense of momentum quickly faded. Stevenson reasserted total control in the 10th, delivering a masterclass in distance management and pacing. López, by contrast, looked increasingly desperate to create exchanges. By the championship rounds, the physical toll on López was visible. Blood trickled from the cut over his left eye entering the 11th, while a corner that had descended into chaos did nothing to slow it between rounds. López continued pressing forward but repeatedly ran into counters, Stevenson adding extra snap to his shots in the closing seconds.The 12th unfolded as a formality. Stevenson boxed comfortably to the final bell, raising his gloves as the outcome felt inevitable long before the scorecards were read. Compubox’s punch statistics lent numerical context to the one-way traffic: Stevenson landed more than twice as many blows (165) as did López (72).The result marked another milestone for Stevenson, who added a championship at 140lb after already claiming world titles at 126lb, 130lb and 135lb. Afterward, he said the performance reflected years of refinement rather than reinvention.“This was the art of boxing: hit and don’t get hit,” Stevenson said. “I felt good. I picked him apart and I did what I was supposed to do.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingTeófimo LópezUS sportsTurki al-SheikhShareReuse this content"

Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitorSun 1 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 06.02 ESTShareA little more than one week ago,TikTokstepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.TikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance,finalizeda deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.The day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.During the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.What the US TikTok takeover is already revealing about new forms of censorship | Paolo GerbaudoRead moreWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.Simultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedianMeg Stalter– accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut,tweetedthat TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.After days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued astatementblaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.Oracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.The most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.The late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolledpress releasenow claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.With more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.TikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.TikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.Explore more on these topicsTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Liberals are floundering, the right are flourishing, and what of the left? Well, it’s in a dire state. This is despite the fact that the key political problems of the last decade – rising inequality and a cost of living crisis – are problems leftists claim they can solve. The trouble is, reactionaries and rightwingers steal their thunder online, quickly spreading messaging that blames scapegoats for structural problems. One reason for this is that platforms originally built to connect us with friends and followers now funnel us content designed to provoke emotional engagement.Back when Twitter was still the “town square” and Facebook a humble “social network”, progressives had an advantage: from the Arab spring to Occupy Wall Street, voices excluded from mainstream media and politics could leverage online social networks and turn them into real-life ones, which at their most potent became street-level protests that toppled regimes andheld capitalism to account. It seemed as though the scattered masses would become a networked collective empowered to rise up against the powerful.But the model of friending and following put a cap on engagement. It’s hard to remember now, but there was a time when you could reach the end of your Facebook and Instagram feeds – our friends only had so many lunches to post. Platforms needed to find ways to keep us logged in. Instagram introduced “suggested posts” from accounts users didn’t follow. TikTok took this logic further: just sign up and start swiping, no need to friend or follow anyone. Creators with small social networks could go viral just by posting engaging content, and everyone could lose themselves in an infinite stream of shortform videos. Copycats such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts crowded into this new market. Over on X, Elon Musk reinstated far-right accounts and turned the “for you” feed into a home forracism and hate speech.In short, platforms that had once offered a space for debate and deliberation shifted toward emotion and immersion. Reactionaries and rightwingers have adapted their stories about who is to blame for the daily indignities of late capitalist life accordingly. Emotionally charged stories of elite villains and dangerous minorities resonate in algorithmically tailored spaces designed for doomscrolling through the permacrisis.Meanwhile, liberals were stillfocusing on old media platformssuch as newspapers and broadcast debates, as well as follower-focused platforms such as Bluesky. The left remains committed to residual media forms, launching new print and online journals. It also does a delicate dance between appearing on traditional media outlets and critiquing them – but whether it likes it or not, it has a symbiotic relationship with the liberal media.Their critiques are often excellent and politically consequential:Novara Media’s Ash Sarkaris the rare leftwing wit on televised panels, andJacobin helpedlay the groundwork for Zohran Mamdani’s campaign by offering a space to hash out democratic socialist ideas in a country where socialism is still a dirty word. But even Chapo Trap House, akey podcastfrom the US’s “dirtbag left” (a loose group of anti-capitalist and deliberately irreverent content creators) spends many a podcast roasting the New York Times. This may be cathartic, but it’s hardly a match for what we are seeing coming from the right.The right has established its own parallel media universe. It eschews most real news and instead tells convincing tales about how the shadowy functionaries of theCathedral, or thematrix,orcultural Marxismlie to you in the media and try to control your every action. The reactionary right is not just xenophobia, racism and misogyny. This online subculture also offerscamaraderie,new diets,natural medicine,exercise regimes, all of which arrive in new communicative forms such as memes and live streams.Instead of building an alternative new media ecosystem and amplifying each other’s work, the left focuses more on competition than the right. As the right convenes the intellectual dark web and manosphere, leftwing digital media is a scattered landscape of Substacks and X-to-Bluesky hot-take artists. The demands of the attention economy exacerbate the age-old leftist tendency toward infighting – it’s not just moral purity at stake. The rent is also due.Take one of the more interesting creators on the left who releases work on YouTube, Natalie Wynn, known asContraPoints. She has elevated her YouTube video essays to auteur status, combining cinematic lighting with French theory, camp dialogue and compelling political analysis. She is often put on a pedestal, only to be knocked down by others on the left. If you disagree with Wynn, you can say it’s because she sold out, and you might even be able to make your own “drama” YouTube video about it.On top of that, the centre right is often happy to engage with ideas from the right, but liberals and the left actively balk at exchanging ideas. Take, for example, the tussle between the socialism of the left and thetheory of “abundance”being forwarded by the centre in US Democratic circles at the moment. More time has been spent posting teardowns instead of focusing on the pretty big thing they have in common: state intervention in the economy. Like it or not, the “abundance” agenda has created an opening for progressive politics. The right would exploit this momentum. The left looks for flaws.Still, there are signs of life on the online left. The Irish comedian and “toxic spirit guide” Frankie McNamara has elevated the social media vox pop into a vehicle for deadpan takes on cultural types from “hot new dads” to “wellness warriors”. The Elephant Graveyard’sYouTube documentarieson the cult of Joe Rogan – in thestyle of Adam Curtis, but funny – have shown that disdain is a more powerful weapon against the manosphere than moral panic.There are even signs that the posting-to-policy pipeline can work for the left. The Palestinian-American influencer Kat Abughazaleh is carrying the same arguments about Maga,ICEand thegenocide in Gazafrom TikTok into her surprise frontrunner congressional campaign. Win or lose, her campaign shows that the real power of online politics is about waging the fight over how people view the world – and what they see as politically possible. The online right has had its sights set on this fight for a decade. Now, many on the left are leaving internal battles behind and entering the fray.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London"

Investors in the majority US-owned venture include Oracle, which is owned by Trump ally Larry Ellison, the private equity-group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi’s MGX, who will own80.1%of the new entity. ByteDance will own the remaining 19.9%.The announcement was madefive yearsafter Donald Trump firstthreatenedto ban the popular app in the US during his first term in office.TikTok’s new deal has been accompanied by changes to app’s terms and conditions, reports of technical issues and a growing debate among users and creators about privacy and censorship. The daily average of US users deleting the TikTok app has increased 195% from 22 Januaryto 28 January compared to the previous 90 days, according to data collected bySensor Tower, a market intelligence firm.Many social media users have voiced concern over language in the app’s terms and conditions, which specifically point out the types of data that TikTok may collect on its users, including “racial and ethnic origin” and “sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information”.That language was present in the previous version of platform’s terms,which were updated in 2024,but one noticeable new feature in the terms is the explicit acknowledgment that TikTok collects precise location data (unless you opt out), asreported by Mashable.TikTok user Julia, a 32-year-old caregiver based in Washington, told the Guardian that she deleted the app as soon as she heard about the company’s new agreement.“I trust Oracle and Ellison about as much as I trust eating a raw burger on a hot summer day,” she said.Afterthe killing of Alex Pretti by ICE agentson 24 January, some content creators expressed concern that videos condemning the federal agency were being suppressed by TikTok.Comedian Meg Stalter said in anInstagram postthat a video she made urging fellow Christians to speak up against ICE tactics was not being uploaded to the app. In response, she decided to delete the app.“[TikTok] is under new ownership and we are being completely censored and monitored,” she wrote in her post.California governor Gavin Newsom also voiced concern about potential TikTok censorship this past week,writing on X: “Following TikTok’s sale to a Trump-aligned business group, our office has received reports, and independently confirmed instances, of suppressed content critical of President Trump.” Newsom announced that the state will be launching an investigation into the platform and whether it is violating California law by censoring anti-Trump content.TikTok USDS Joint Venture attributed the issues to a power outage at a US datacenter, unrelated to the weekend’s events. On 27 January, the entity issued the followingstatement: “We’ve made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure with our U.S. data center partner. However, the U.S. user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content. We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible.”A 21-year-old software engineer, who asked to remain anonymous, first encountered TikTok in 2020 as a high school junior.“I was amazed how quickly it learned my interests, kept up with trends and recommended things I would’ve never sought out myself,” he said. “For better or for worse, I was probably using it at least four hours a day.”He says he stayed on the app for so long due to the quality of his algorithm; but after TikTok’stemporary shutdown in the US in January 2025, he began to notice differences.“I didn’t like how the pop-up message painted Trump as the ‘savior’ that would bring back TikTok once he was in office,” he said. “After it was brought back, I noticed a significant decline in recommendation quality.”Sullivan also noticed major changes following TikTok’s brief blackout, including a reduction in the income she was receiving through the company’sCreator Fund.She ultimately made the decision to pivot away from TikTok after noticing potential censorship issues, including thebanning of Palestinian journalist Bisan Owda, who had 1.4 million followers on the app. Even before TikTok found its US owner, Sullivan knew that it was in her best interest to disseminate her content far and wide.“In the internet ecosphere, you kind of have to create these different avenues for yourself, because you can’t rely on one platform,” she said. “The algorithm could change at any time.”Explore more on these topicsTikTokInternetCensorshipPrivacySocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He then lowered his fists, extended his thumbs and little fingers, and moved them up and down by his chest, as though milking a cow. Finally, he laid the fingers of one hand flat on his chin and flexed his wrist forward.Hartwell, who has no hearing problems, had just used BSL, British SignLanguage, to order his morning latte with normal milk at the deaf-run Dialogue Cafe, based at the University of East London, and thanked Victor Olaniyan, the deaf barista.“I have to be honest: when this cafe first opened near my office, I avoided it because the whole idea made me anxious,” said Hartwell, a lecturer at the university. “But now I’m fascinated. Sign language is amazing. I’m thinking of taking a course so I can learn more.”What gave Hartwell the confidence to try BSL was the cafe’s touchscreen menu. Instead of just listing the coffees and cakes on sale, the menus show videos of their BSL translation.For many deaf BSL users, this kind of direct access is crucial. BSL is a first language for tens of thousands of people in the UK.Olaniyan, who has worked at the cafe for five years and now does shifts alongside a degree in accounting and management at the University of Reading, seemed mildly amused by the reactions of hearing people to the video menu.“I was brought up by hearing people, so I have no problem in the hearing world,” he signed. “But hearing people often feel anxious communicating with us. If this technology helps them, that’s great, but I’m fine as I am.”View image in fullscreenWesley Hartwell ordering a drink at the cafe.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIn the past two years, there has been an explosion of digital and AI-linked products aiming to bridge communication barriers between the deaf and hearing worlds, from signing avatars to large generative models that aspire to rival mainstream AI platforms.Independent evaluations of many of these systems remain limited, however, and sign language researchers caution that current tools still struggle with linguistic nuance, regional variation and context, particularly in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and law.But the ambitions are striking: the UK startup Silence Speaks has built an avatar-based system that converts text into BSL, claiming it can convey contextual meaning and emotional cues.The British project SignGPT, backed by £8.45m in funding, is developing models to translate between BSL and English in both directions, while also building what it describes as the largest sign languages dataset in the world.Sign languages AI research has also become increasingly collaborative and international: a new £3.5m UK-Japan research project is developing systems trained on natural deaf-to-deaf conversation data rather than interpreter recordings.Much of this recent progress has come quickly. When Prof Bencie Woll, a co-investigator of the SignGPT project at University College London’s Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre, first entered the field of BSL research, communication beyond face-to-face interaction was extremely limited for deaf people.“The rest of the world was moving ahead with technology, but deaf people were often left behind,” she said. “What’s different now is the pace. In the last couple of years, the deaf community has benefited from an explosively powerful mix of possibilities.”Historically, technology has not always been positive, Woll cautioned. “There has often been a fantasy, particularly among researchers who don’t understand sign languages, that it is a quick fix. That you take a sign language, turn it into written English – and you’ve made deaf people’s lives wonderful,” she said.View image in fullscreenVictor Olaniyan works shifts at the cafe alongside his degree in accounting and management.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianThat assumption led to what Woll described as “really terrible technology”, including wearable translation suits, bulky gloves and head-mounted cameras designed to process signing.“All of these were doomed to failure,” she said, “because they were designed by people who did not understand sign languages and did not ask deaf people what they wanted, let alone work alongside deaf experts from the start. The community has been frustrated for years by the proliferation of bad solutions.”Yet the need for solutions is real. About 70 million people worldwide are deaf or hard of hearing. In the UK, census data records about 151,000 BSL users. For roughly 25,000 of them, BSL is their primary language. It is a distinct, natural language with its own grammar and structure, not a signed version of English.For this group, written and spoken English is often a second – or even a third language, following lip-reading, Sign Supported English or family-invented gestures.This has practical consequences: subtitles and written text are not always adequate substitutes for direct BSL access. A large 2017 study of deaf children aged 10 to 11 found that reading ability was significantly below expected age levels for 48% of deaf children educated using spoken language only, and for 82% of those whose everyday language was a sign language.Dr Lauren Ward has the unusual role of leading on AI technology for the deaf community at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), advising government and industry.“The pace of change has been so fast that RNID has made the unusual decision to employ engineers,” she said. “The potential to help the deaf community is huge – but so is the potential to cause harm.”Deaf people have long been early adopters of technology: SMS messaging transformed communication in the 1990s. But Ward said the last two years had brought a new intensity of interest and concern. “It has suddenly moved from university labs into startups and commercial products,” she said.This shift has been enabled by advances in machine learning and related technologies that finally make the processing of large-scale sign languages technically possible.View image in fullscreenHakan Elbir, the founder of Dialogue Hub.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianIncreased research funding, improved datasets and greater involvement from deaf researchers have also quickened the pace, as has a wider acknowledgment of the longstanding gap between the access deaf people are legally entitled to and what is delivered in practice: reliable sign languages provision has been promised for decades but has all-too-often failed to materialise.This combination of opportunity and risk makes the current moment a double-edged sword, Ward said.“It is incredibly exciting, and the next five years could bring real improvements,” she said. “But there is a danger that private companies respond by focusing on profit rather than working with the deaf community and being led by them.”Dr Maartje De Meulder, a deaf scholar and consultant on sign languages AI, agreed the stakes were high.“At the moment, deaf people are largely excluded from vast amounts of online information, from educational videos to government websites,” she said. “No one is ever going to have the resources to translate the entire internet into sign languages, so even partial solutions could be transformative.”Neil Fox, a deaf research fellow at the University of Birmingham, agreed that if avatar translation reached sufficient quality, it could open up many online spaces currently closed to deaf users.But all are highly cautious. Rebecca Mansell, the chief executive of the British Deaf Association, said this “has become a very lucrative area and too many projects involve deaf people only tokenistically”.“It is all happening very fast, and there is a real risk that solutions will be imposed on us,” she added.Mansell also raised concerns about regulation and appropriate use. “An avatar might be fine for ordering something simple,” she said, “but what about a cancer diagnosis? In schools, a human interpreter is often the only friend a deaf child has.”Dr Louise Hickman, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy and lead author of the report BSL Is Not For Sale, has worked in AI ethics for a decade.“Many companies claim they can solve these problems without understanding the linguistic and cultural complexity of BSL,” she said. “Current avatar systems still lack the nuance of human interpreters, which creates risks in medical and legal settings.”Hickman also pointed to the limits of available data. “British Sign Language is not the same as Irish Sign Language or American Sign Language. There are regional dialects within England. This means the data available for training AI systems is extremely limited.”So where, she asked, will appropriate training data come from?“The deaf community wants innovation,” she said, “but we want to slow this down so we can shape it and make sure it genuinely benefits us.”Back at the cafe, Hakan Elbir, its founder, saw little need for more complex tools than his static BSL video menu.“People talk a lot about innovation, but for most deaf people it is still theoretical,” he said. “What I wanted was a meaningful daily interaction for hearing people.”“Coffee is just the excuse,” he added. “I didn’t need complicated technology to break down barriers. I just needed people to interact openly.”Waiting for his latte at the counter, Hartwell quietly practised the sign for “flat white”, proving that it was this simple, human interaction – supported but not overshadowed by technology – that was drawing him back, one signed coffee order at a time.Explore more on these topicsDeafness and hearing lossAI (artificial intelligence)LanguageLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The device is one of a growing number of lifestyle products being launched in this area, which some experts say is growing as stigma around menopause recedes. Companies are developing everything from apps offering dietary advice to devices that track symptoms, hormones and body temperature.While some caution that a boom in the menopause market could mean brands with overhyped solutions cash in on women’s fears, there is no shortage of investors who see a technological solution to the problems brought on by middle age.View image in fullscreenThe MyCelsius bracelet is worn on the wrist to cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause.Photograph: MyCelsiusThe global menopause market is projected to reach approximately $24bn (£19bn) by 2030 according to the San Francisco-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research.Leading investors in menopause products include venture capital funds, corporate giants such as Bayer and Unilever Ventures, and retail partners such as Tesco.The MyCelsius bracelet, a £229.99 cooling device, is worn on the wrist to instantly cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause. Its designers say it also alleviates the effects of hormonal changes such as stress, anxiety or other everyday factors on body temperature.Sarah Garlick, 50, went into surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy and her ovaries removed at 43. She is on HRT but still experiences many other symptoms. She said she bought a range of products when it first happened, including a £60 nightie that promised to regulate her temperature at night.She quickly lost hope that these kinds of products would work. However, when she was approached to take part in a trial of MyCelcius, she finally found something that helped.She believes products like this are only now being marketed because the stigma around menopause has started to shift. “That’s the thing as well,” she said, noting that she shows off her wristband: “I’ve spoken [to other women] about it openly, like, ‘This is what I need, and this is what helps.’”View image in fullscreenSome women who use HRT still experience symptoms such as hot flushes.Photograph: Phanie/AlamyMaxime Kryvian, co-founder of Celsius Innovations, which makes MyCelcius, said: “For a long time there has always been less investment in women’s health. But we’re seeing real improvements now, with more investment funds coming in. There’s also more institutional support, including organisations like the Gates Foundation. It’s definitely a growing area.”With the rush of investment has come inevitable scrutiny. A recent study by University College London, led by Prof Joyce Harper, warned of a “menopause gold rush”, with unregulated companies exploiting a lack of reliable information. Researchers called for the rollout of a national education programme after finding a significant number of women do not feel well-informed about menopause.Writing in the medical journalPost Reproductive Health, they said: “There has been a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit.”Kryvian acknowledged that scepticism around new menopause products is often justified, pointing to the supplement market as an example.View image in fullscreenSome experts advise women to be cautious about looking for a Silicon Valley-designed magic bullet.Photograph: Bsip Sa/Alamy“Honestly, we’ve already seen this in areas like supplements,” he said. “It can be very hard to attribute the exact impact, and some of the scepticism around these new products is warranted. That’s why it’s so important that anything entering this space is backed by science and developed with the right experts.”He said consumers should look carefully at who has developed a product and what evidence exists to support its claims. “My advice to consumers is to ask: how was this developed, and by whom? Is there data on its impact? What do customer reviews say?“Another thing to look at is what companies are willing to reimburse you if it doesn’t work … That’s often the best signal,” he added.Nearly two in three women over 50 in the UK struggle with their mental health, relationship breakdowns and changes to their appearance as they deal with menopause, a survey has found.Dr Claire Phipps, a menopause specialist at London Gynaecology, acknowledged the potential benefits of wearable tech but said consumers should remains cautious about looking for a Silicon Valley-designed magic bullet.“I wouldn’t advise anyone to rush out and buy anything. For those still having periods, tracking devices like Aura Rings or basic period trackers can be useful. And a simple handheld fan might actually be the best cooling solution. But I would be wary of anything marketed specifically as a ‘menopause relief’ product unless it’s backed by solid evidence.“The industry is booming, but there’s still a huge lack of randomised controlled trials. If a product hasn’t been properly tested, how do we know it works? It’s crucial to question the science behind every new device or supplement,” she added.At the heart of the issue is the lack of reliable guidance. Unlike fertility, which is tightly regulated and evidence-based, menopause care has fewer safeguards. “Anyone can call themselves a menopause coach,” Phipps said. “It’s hard for women to know who to trust.”The rush of new products reflects this uncertainty. As the “menopause economy” grows, so too does the misinformation, often spread by social media influencers. “The internet is full of exaggerated claims,” Phipps says. “It’s shameful how easily misinformation spreads. We need to focus on evidence-based solutions.”In this environment, Phipps advocates for a more grounded approach to managing menopause. “Start with the basics: nutrition, self-care and stress management. Simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference. If symptoms persist, that’s when to seek professional advice.”Explore more on these topicsMenopauseWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)HealthHealthcare industryHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Wednesday 28 January, the FBIcarried out a stunning raidat the central election facility in Fulton county, Georgia.Its purpose:to seize ballots cast in the 2020 election. Such an actionisunprecedented.In another unprecedented development, Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was on the scene when the FBI carried out its raid. The New York Timesquotesa “senior administration official” who explained her presence by saying Gabbard “has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, and election infrastructure”.The deployment of such firepower shows the lengths to which the president is willing to go to press his claim that the 2020 election was rigged and to lay the groundwork for the seizure of ballots in 2026. The seizure of ballots inGeorgiais like a shot across the bow.It should prompt concerted planning by state attorneys general and secretaries of state to resist federal interference in November. We need more people like Maine’s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, whosaidafter the FBI raid: “In Maine, we have strict chain of custody controls over our ballots … There are only two people that have the key. One of them is me. And he is not getting our ballots. He’s not getting our voter rolls.”But don’t be fooled, the president won’t give up on his quest to find evidence that officials in Fulton county destroyed or altered ballots.That is why in addition to the physical ballots theFBIsought “tabulator tapes for every voting machine used in Fulton County … ballot images produced during the original ballot count beginning on November 3, 2020, the recount, and any other ballot images that were created from ballot scanning from the 2020 General Election in Fulton County”. They also sought voter rolls from the 2020 general election including records pertaining to “absentee” and “early voting” including “to whom an absentee ballot was issued, from whom an absentee ballot was received, or who participated in advanced voting or election day voting”.All told, the FBItook more than 700 boxes of election records.Wednesday’s search and seizureis the latest step in a long-running battle.In November 2024, the Republican-dominated state election board subpoenaed 2020 election materials from Fulton county. When the county went to court to try to quash the subpoena, the state election boardsought help from Pam Bondi“to effect compliance with voting transparency”, according to ajustice department lawsuit.In December, the justice departmentsuedon the grounds that “the county is in violation of … the Civil Rights Act”. The suit asserted that the attorney general had “sweeping power” to obtain election records.All of this makes sense when we recall the president’s obsession with Georgia’s 2020 election results. Among other things, heclaimedin a call with Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, that about 5,000 dead people had ballots cast in their names and that “thousands and thousands who went to the voting place on November 3 were told they couldn’t vote, were told they couldn’t vote because a ballot had been put on their name.”The president also alleged that “at least 18,000 ... voters” were connected to a Fulton county election worker who was a supposed “scammer”. “[The 18,000 ballots] weren’t in an official voter box, but they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases but they weren’t in voter boxes.”Each of those claims was proven false, and the Fulton county ballots were subject to multiple recounts.Nonetheless, in a recent interview with the New York Times, the presidentexpressed regretabout “not ordering the National Guard to seize voting machines in swing states after his loss in the 2020 election”. He “doubted whether the Guard was ‘sophisticated enough’ to carry out the order effectively”.Enter the FBI.It seems that in the world he wants to create, there is no future until the injuries (whether real or imagined) done to him are made rightAfter the FBI raid, the presidentrepostedthe following to his Truth Social account: “President Trump’s legal team exposing the 2020 election fraud at the Georgia State Farm Arena … running the same stacks of ballots over, and over, and over, all through the night until Biden was ahead, stealing the election from President Trump. This is exactly why the FBI raided the election center today … This is only the beginning. prosecutions are coming.”The presidentadded,“TRUMP WON BIG. Crooked election.”It seems that in the world he wants to create, there is no future until the injuries (whether real or imagined) done to him are made right. Just last week, during his speech to the World Economic Forum, Trumpreiteratedthat 2020 “was a rigged election”. And he added: “People will soon be prosecuted for what they did.”And in theTrump administration, what the president wants, the president gets. That’s why the FBI seized what it did in Fulton county.In the name of election integrity, the administration seems bent on ensuring that elections can be free and fair only if they turn out the way the president wants. That’s why it would be a mistake to write off the raid as just a rehashing of the past.It sends a powerful signal to election officials everywhere that they will be under scrutiny, as they never have been before, by an administration that insists that the federal government will take a leading role in policing elections and in making sure that they are carried out to its satisfaction. The FBI raid is, in the world of elections, what the ICE invasion of Minneapolis is in the world of law enforcement.An effort at intimidation.As one of Fulton county’s election officialsput it: “All of this is about disrupting the elections in November. All this is about Fulton – the most important County in Georgia and maybe even the nation … This is all a distraction to make people fearful to go to the polls in November.”It should also serve as a wake-up call, a preview of what is in store in several months. The FBI, the justice department, and the intelligence community are all coming to places like Fulton county, places where, left to their own devices, voters might not do what the president wants them to do.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsFBIOpinionGeorgiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS elections 2020commentShareReuse this content"

Now tactics are shifting to nonviolent civil disobedienceSun 1 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTShareOn 24 January, Alex Pretti waskilledby federal agents while he was helping another civilian inMinneapoliswho had been knocked to the ground – just weeks after an ICE agent killedRenee Good. In response to this second killing of a Minnesotan,demonstrations spreadacross the United States to protest the Trump administration and its ultra-violent immigration enforcement tactics.Minneapolis has been in a state of sustained protest. Its general strike on 23 Januarymobilizedtens of thousands of Minnesotans to participate in an economic blackout and march in the streets. Solidarity protests, strikes and marches also took place across the country,includingtheFree America Walkout, which involved more than 900 local actions across all 50 states on the anniversary ofDonald Trump’s second inauguration.As part of along-term projectstudying protest in America, which included documenting the resistance to the first Trump administration in my bookAmerican Resistance,I have been studying Resistance 2.0. The project aims to understand who is participating, what is motivating people to join this second wave of resistance, and the tactics being used by activists to protest the secondTrump administrationand its policies.Digested week: ICE’s performance is intimidating and deadly, but also farcical | Emma BrockesRead moreResistance to the first Trump administration was laser-focused on converting outrage-motivated resistance in the streets into action at the ballot box. Throughout those four years, activists focused most of their efforts onbringing about social changethrough formal political tactics such as lobbying, legally permitted rallies, and voting. Evidence shows that it worked: the 2018 midterm electionreturneda Democratic majority to the House of Representatives and then Joe Biden was elected the 46th president of the US in the 2020 election, which had thehighest turnoutin over a century.But this time it is different.During the first year of the second Trump administration, weonce againsawsome of the largestprotests in US history (though the protests were much moregeographically distributedthan during the first Trump administration). Although large-scale and legally permitted demonstrations continue to be scheduled, Resistance 2.0 has become more confrontational. Acts of nonviolent civil disobedience – such as blocking streets; following, recording and observing federal agents; and participating in generalstrikesandwalkouts– have become much more common. And this is only the beginning.Working with the organizers of the Free America Walkout, which involved participantswalking out ofwork, school and commerce for two hours during the afternoon of 20 January, my team and I surveyed 7,452 people who had signed up to participate from across the US – about 15% of all the registered participants. Our data provide clear evidence that Resistance 2.0 will continue to get more confrontational.An overwhelming majority of respondents to our survey (99%) reported that they support organizations engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience, including sit-ins and blockades. Moreover, when we asked participants about the degree to which they support the movement taking more confrontational actions against theTrump administrationand its policies, and if they personally would be willing to join such actions, the results were unequivocal: 79% agreed that they “support social movements taking more confrontational action against the Trump administration” and 65% agreed that they “would participate in more confrontational action against the Trump administration if [they] had the opportunity”.While criticism of the shift to more confrontational – but nonviolent – actions comes from across the political spectrum, including from mainstream Democrats, the expansion of what social movements scholars call the “repertoire of contention” is consistent with numerous successful social movements in US history.In the early 1900s, for example, women involved in the American movement for suffrage started expanding their tactics as they realized that “Sometimes, being polite just doesn’t work.” The movement turned to occupying public spaces and even burning an effigy of then president Woodrow Wilson before women in the US finallyearnedthe right to vote in 1920.Similarly, activists from the civil rights movement shifted their strategy after realizing that they did not have the necessary access to power to make change through legal and political systems in the US. Instead, they employed more disruptive tactics, including staging sit-ins and coordinating non-permitted marches. Thanks in part to the diversity of tactics employed and groups involved, the Civil Rights Act was signed into law in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act became law in 1965.While civil rights movement leaders trained activists in nonviolent civil disobedience, they were acutely aware that even nonviolent civil disobedience was likely to face a violent response from law enforcement and counter-movements. However, rather than cowering in fear, civil rights activists leaned into the violence against them, intentionally organizing actions in segregated areas that were likely to provoke a brutal response. As a result, many activists got arrested andfilled the jails, andothers were murdered.Minneapolis is in a state of chaos. Racist governance is to blame | Jamil SmithRead moreIn recent weeks, we have seen similar patterns of violence against peaceful protesters in Minneapolis. An unintended side effect of these horrible acts of violence is that they generate substantial public attention and support for protestors, which can be auseful tool for expanding the movement. Tragic events present opportunities for the broader resistance to grow and evolve.What’s giving me hope nowThe fact that Resistance 2.0 is expanding its tactics gives me hope. Americans are finding their voices and their power to push back against burgeoning autocracy. We are also seeing activists building solidarity with friends and neighbors along the way. The expansion of tactics and evolution of thinking about how citizens can push back against government violence and anti-democratic suppression is a step in the right direction. It is a sign that the people are mobilizing and working together to save America.This moment of resistance to the Trump regime opens up a window of opportunity for social change. Achieving that change will require every one of us participating in actions for justice and equity that may take us out of our comfort zone and stretch us in ways that help preserve democracy.As unfair as it may seem, neither a charismatic leader nor theDemocraticparty is ready to be the change we need; we are going to have to work together to save ourselves.Dana R Fisher is a professor in the School of International Service at American University and a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Liberals are floundering, the right are flourishing, and what of the left? Well, it’s in a dire state. This is despite the fact that the key political problems of the last decade – rising inequality and a cost of living crisis – are problems leftists claim they can solve. The trouble is, reactionaries and rightwingers steal their thunder online, quickly spreading messaging that blames scapegoats for structural problems. One reason for this is that platforms originally built to connect us with friends and followers now funnel us content designed to provoke emotional engagement.Back when Twitter was still the “town square” and Facebook a humble “social network”, progressives had an advantage: from the Arab spring to Occupy Wall Street, voices excluded from mainstream media and politics could leverage online social networks and turn them into real-life ones, which at their most potent became street-level protests that toppled regimes andheld capitalism to account. It seemed as though the scattered masses would become a networked collective empowered to rise up against the powerful.But the model of friending and following put a cap on engagement. It’s hard to remember now, but there was a time when you could reach the end of your Facebook and Instagram feeds – our friends only had so many lunches to post. Platforms needed to find ways to keep us logged in. Instagram introduced “suggested posts” from accounts users didn’t follow. TikTok took this logic further: just sign up and start swiping, no need to friend or follow anyone. Creators with small social networks could go viral just by posting engaging content, and everyone could lose themselves in an infinite stream of shortform videos. Copycats such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts crowded into this new market. Over on X, Elon Musk reinstated far-right accounts and turned the “for you” feed into a home forracism and hate speech.In short, platforms that had once offered a space for debate and deliberation shifted toward emotion and immersion. Reactionaries and rightwingers have adapted their stories about who is to blame for the daily indignities of late capitalist life accordingly. Emotionally charged stories of elite villains and dangerous minorities resonate in algorithmically tailored spaces designed for doomscrolling through the permacrisis.Meanwhile, liberals were stillfocusing on old media platformssuch as newspapers and broadcast debates, as well as follower-focused platforms such as Bluesky. The left remains committed to residual media forms, launching new print and online journals. It also does a delicate dance between appearing on traditional media outlets and critiquing them – but whether it likes it or not, it has a symbiotic relationship with the liberal media.Their critiques are often excellent and politically consequential:Novara Media’s Ash Sarkaris the rare leftwing wit on televised panels, andJacobin helpedlay the groundwork for Zohran Mamdani’s campaign by offering a space to hash out democratic socialist ideas in a country where socialism is still a dirty word. But even Chapo Trap House, akey podcastfrom the US’s “dirtbag left” (a loose group of anti-capitalist and deliberately irreverent content creators) spends many a podcast roasting the New York Times. This may be cathartic, but it’s hardly a match for what we are seeing coming from the right.The right has established its own parallel media universe. It eschews most real news and instead tells convincing tales about how the shadowy functionaries of theCathedral, or thematrix,orcultural Marxismlie to you in the media and try to control your every action. The reactionary right is not just xenophobia, racism and misogyny. This online subculture also offerscamaraderie,new diets,natural medicine,exercise regimes, all of which arrive in new communicative forms such as memes and live streams.Instead of building an alternative new media ecosystem and amplifying each other’s work, the left focuses more on competition than the right. As the right convenes the intellectual dark web and manosphere, leftwing digital media is a scattered landscape of Substacks and X-to-Bluesky hot-take artists. The demands of the attention economy exacerbate the age-old leftist tendency toward infighting – it’s not just moral purity at stake. The rent is also due.Take one of the more interesting creators on the left who releases work on YouTube, Natalie Wynn, known asContraPoints. She has elevated her YouTube video essays to auteur status, combining cinematic lighting with French theory, camp dialogue and compelling political analysis. She is often put on a pedestal, only to be knocked down by others on the left. If you disagree with Wynn, you can say it’s because she sold out, and you might even be able to make your own “drama” YouTube video about it.On top of that, the centre right is often happy to engage with ideas from the right, but liberals and the left actively balk at exchanging ideas. Take, for example, the tussle between the socialism of the left and thetheory of “abundance”being forwarded by the centre in US Democratic circles at the moment. More time has been spent posting teardowns instead of focusing on the pretty big thing they have in common: state intervention in the economy. Like it or not, the “abundance” agenda has created an opening for progressive politics. The right would exploit this momentum. The left looks for flaws.Still, there are signs of life on the online left. The Irish comedian and “toxic spirit guide” Frankie McNamara has elevated the social media vox pop into a vehicle for deadpan takes on cultural types from “hot new dads” to “wellness warriors”. The Elephant Graveyard’sYouTube documentarieson the cult of Joe Rogan – in thestyle of Adam Curtis, but funny – have shown that disdain is a more powerful weapon against the manosphere than moral panic.There are even signs that the posting-to-policy pipeline can work for the left. The Palestinian-American influencer Kat Abughazaleh is carrying the same arguments about Maga,ICEand thegenocide in Gazafrom TikTok into her surprise frontrunner congressional campaign. Win or lose, her campaign shows that the real power of online politics is about waging the fight over how people view the world – and what they see as politically possible. The online right has had its sights set on this fight for a decade. Now, many on the left are leaving internal battles behind and entering the fray.Robert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London"

The time to be alarmed is nowSun 1 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 09.41 ESTShareKeir Starmer’s tentative pivot to the Dragon Throne has played well in Beijing, though not in Trumpland. That’s partly because, like other needy western leaders, Britain’s prime minister did not dwell on awkward subjects such as human rights abuses, theJimmy Lai travesty, spying and Taiwan. But intalks with President Xi Jinping, one vital issue was avoided altogether and should not have been: China’s dangerous, unexplained, secretive and rapid buildup of nuclear weapons.More than the climate crisis, global hunger, Kaiser Trump’s Prussian militarism and the ever prevalent threat of pandemic disease, the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the most immediate, existential threat to humanity. Last week, the Doomsday Clock advanced to 85 seconds to midnight – closer to Armageddon than ever before. “Nuclear and other global risks are escalating fast and in unprecedented ways,” warned the clock-watchers, via theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists.Nuclear disarmament diplomacy is at a standstill globally. Consensus on collective future action is again expected to eludeApril’s non-proliferation treaty (NPT) reviewconference in New York. On Thursday,New Start, the last remaining arms control treaty limiting US and Russian strategic nuclear forces, will expire. Meanwhile, a scary international nuclear arms race is raging unchecked, as detailed in the 2025 report of theStockholm International Peace Research Institute(Sipri).Nearly all the nine nuclear-armed states – the US, Russia, China, France, UK, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel – are pursuing “intensive nuclear modernisation programmes”, Sipri reported, including new weapons such as hypersonic missiles and “useable” low-yield tactical nukes. Nuclear testing may soon resume. “Of the total global inventory of an estimated 12,241 warheads in January 2025, about 9,614 were in military stockpiles for potential use,”Sipri said. Of these, the US and Russia possess about 90%.With an estimated 600 warheads, China lags behind – but it’scatching up quickly. “China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country’s, by about 100 new warheads a year since 2023 … [It] could potentially have at least as many ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] as either Russia or the US by the turn of the decade,” Sipri calculated. Beijing offers no explanation or rationale for this dramatic surge – and rejects multilateral arms control talks.An official white paper,published by China in November, restated its position that countries with the largest nuclear arsenals must make the first move, by unilaterally making “drastic and substantive reductions”. Until then, it said, China would keep its own nuclear capabilities “at the minimum level required for national security”. The paper conveniently omitted to say what that level is.China’s criticism that the US and others ignore their NPT commitment to pursue disarmament is accurate, albeit hypocritical. It is on stronger ground when voicing objections to Donald Trump’s proposed multilayered, Greenland-related Golden Dome missile shield that could,if it ever materialises, dangerously upset the balance of terror.Despite its current advantages, the US is worried. The Pentagonwarned in Decemberthat “China’s historic military buildup has made the US homeland increasingly vulnerable”. It highlighted what it called a more attack-ready, “hair-trigger” nuclear posture, and claimed about 100 ICBMs were recently installed in silos in northern China. It also said Beijing was testing its ability “to strike US forces in the Pacific”, potentially crippling future US military assistance to Taiwan. “China expects to be able to fight and win a war on Taiwan by the end of 2027,”the Pentagon said.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Xi Jinping before their bilateral meeting in Beijing, 29 January 2026.Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersWhat is Xi up to? China’s nuclear weapons drive could be just a question of status. Maybe Xi simply wants to match (or surpass) the US and Russia. Maybe he is genuinely fearful of being attacked.He told Starmerthat “rampant” powers, meaning Trump, were following “the law of the jungle”. Or maybe, considering his legacy, Xi believes nuclear muscle-flexing (or worse) could help him conquer Taiwan and fulfil his ambition to make China the leading superpower.Xi has acquired emperor-like sway after 13 years at the top. But he is also an insecure, fallible and unimaginative politician not immune to global trends and pressures. On the one hand, he sees Trump’s US upgrading nuclear weapons, trashing key arms control pacts such as the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, andattacking non-nuclear Iran and Venezuelaon a whim. On the other hand, he sees an ally and fellow dictator, Russia’s Vladimir Putin,threatening nuclear war with the westas he tries to illegally seize Ukraine. It must be tempting to follow that example.Morality, military might and a sense of mischief: key takeaways from Trump’s New York Times interviewRead moreDisturbing, too, is the suspicion that, despite appearances, Xi may not be wholly in control of China’s armed forces. His sensationalsacking last weekof Gen Zhang Youxia, second only to himself in the military hierarchy, remains a mystery. Zhang, a grizzled veteran, is supposedly accused of disloyalty to his less war-experienced boss – and of leaking nuclear secrets to the US.Is it possible the two men disagreed over Xi’s bullishly confrontational nuclear and Taiwan policies? Xi previously purged rocket force commanders, but is still apparently struggling to pull the generals into line. In a cold war echo, Dr Strangelove’s disconcerting question recurs: whose finger on the button?Whatever China’s president is thinking, these are alarming times for anyone worried about global thermonuclear war – which should be everyone. Starmer’s talks with Xi reportedly included Chinese threats to UK national security. What bigger threat is there than proliferating nuclear weapons? Yet as far as is known, hedid not raise the issue.Starmer’s silence is unsurprising. Under his leadership the UK, too, isexpanding its nuclear strike force, by buying US F-35A nuclear-capable fighter jets. And it is reportedly allowing the US to store nuclear bombs at RAF Lakenheath for the first time in 20 years. Britain is in no position to criticise. On the contrary, its unspoken message to Xi is stark: bombs away!Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionChinaDonald TrumpXi JinpingVladimir PutinKeir StarmerDefence policycommentShareReuse this content"

It clearly had nothing to do with how we played that evening – we lost badly. This joy was about classrooms, routines, teachers and the quiet order that schools bring back into families’ lives.For us, it also meant something else entirely: my youngest, Naveed, is starting school for the first time.Over the past few days, we’ve been wandering through shopping centres and uniform shops, trying to dress and equip him for what feels, in his mind at least, like a major mission. Judging by his choices – bold backpacks, superhero-themed drink bottles – I suspect he believes some special powers might be required. Watching him prepare has been tender and amusing in equal measure.Young, lost and unemployed, I misread all the signs without realising the value in mistakes | Sofie LagunaRead moreIn the midst of all this, I’ve noticed something quietly beautiful. Whenever I take Naveed shopping with me – whether to big bookstores or op shops – he drifts instinctively towards children’s books. He already has a tiny collection at home, which he reads aloud to his favourite teddy, Mr Lion, whenever there’s nothing interesting on television and the older siblings are glued to their screens. There’s something grounding about seeing him like that: cross-legged, serious, absorbed.Watching him step towards this small but enormous threshold has stirred a question I’ve been carrying for years: how much of curiosity is innate, and how much is shaped – patiently, deliberately – by those who raise us?When I was a child, we were refugees in Pakistan. Material comfort was absent. Books were scarce. Stability even more so. And yet, it was there that my elder brother developed an extraordinary love for reading and writing. He read anything he could get his hands on – old newspapers, battered textbooks, scraps passed between families. This was the 1990s, before screens and easy internet access. His handwriting – meticulous, elegant – bordered on calligraphy.During the day, he worked long hours in a factory. In the evenings, he read, wrote and listened to music on an old Japanese cassette player, as if words and sound could hold the world together. That love didn’t fade with time. It sharpened. Years later, it would lead him to become a prolific writer in Afghanistan, shaping powerful stories under conditions of censorship, threat and political collapse.Looking back, it’s tempting to romanticise his trajectory: the gifted child who flourished against the odds. But that story has always unsettled me. Because if curiosity simply blooms under hardship, why doesn’t it do so for everyone?Now, my own children are growing up in materially comfortable Melbourne. Their shelves are full. Libraries are a weekend habit. Schools are safe, resourced, predictable. These are, we’re told, the ideal conditions for cultivating young minds.And yet, curiosity in our household is anything but uniform.One child devours books and asks questions that stretch late into bedtime. Another is thoughtful but resists reading, preferring movement, conversation, observation. A third drifts in and out of interest – deeply absorbed one moment, completely indifferent the next. The fourth was once a class topper and now seems far more invested in games and anime than schoolwork. Same household, yet entirely different relationships with learning.It is stated explicitly and implicitly that good parenting produces curious children. That reading every night, choosing the right school, limiting screens and modelling intellectual engagement will yield predictable outcomes. But curiosity doesn’t operate on a neat input-output system. Still, parental encouragement matters. I believe this deeply. Early, sustained, belief-driven support can be decisive – especially for children navigating marginalisation or instability. Someone must notice the spark and protect it long enough for it to grow.Sure, people tell you about sleepless nights. But why does no one mention the hell that is a parent WhatsApp group? | Sean SzepsRead moreYears later, I finally asked my brother what drew him so fiercely to reading and writing when no one around him seemed to care. He told me it was our late father. Even before I was born, Dad encouraged him to read and write – quietly, consistently, without expectation. That habit stayed. Those small acts of faith mattered.I’m sure my father encouraged all of us. And yet, some children arrive in the world with an appetite for ideas that feels almost bodily. They engage with the world differently.In his own way, Naveed feels different too. I love how he communicates – how he never walks away from a conversation halfway through. Even when he doesn’t like the answer, he’ll pause and say, “Ah, alright”, or “Leave it – don’t trick me”, before calmly changing the topic. There’s attentiveness there. Presence.As Naveed steps into his first classroom, I wonder what version of curiosity theAustralian educationsystem will recognise in him. I wonder how he will navigate his own path – and how much I must nurture and how much I must learn to let go.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionAustralian educationcommentShareReuse this content"

Even if Labour somehow wins this byelection, how does it arrest the slide into hopelessness?Sun 1 Feb 2026 10.24 ESTLast modified on Sun 1 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareThe route of the No 201 bus begins in the regenerated wonderland of central Manchester, and follows a straight line through the neighbourhoods to its east. The city’s box-fresh skyscrapers and gleaming new hotels quickly recede – and within 10 minutes you arrive in Gorton, at the outer edge of the constituency that, in not much more than three weeks’ time, will seethe byelectionthat could have profound consequences for the future of both the Labour party and British politics.Gorton is hardly a social desert. Millions of pounds arebeing spenton a regeneration scheme that – among its other benefits – will bring the area new housing and a revitalised high street. But in the covered market that is about to be upgraded to a “food and drink cluster”, when I ask people questions about the looming vote, I mostly hear expressions of fierce resentment. In that sense, the story of what is about to happen here may crystallise one of this year’s big political themes: a long-festering sense of disconnection and fury reaching a new extreme, thanks to a government that seems strangely powerless to even begin to tackle it.There are a few mentions of theawful WhatsApp messagesthat sealed the fate of the former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, but people talk most animatedly about grimly familiar subjects: grooming gangs, small boats, sky-high private rents and the impossible cost of living. “My mum’s got stage four terminal cancer and she can’t afford to put her heating on,” one woman tells me, with a bracing anger. And every 10 minutes, I hear some or other version of that dependable modern mantra: “I really don’t like Keir Starmer.” Beyond one man’s claim that “he hasn’t done what he said he’d do”, no one can specify exactly why, but that seems to fire people’s loathing all the more: on this evidence, his most damaging shortcoming remains that glaring failure to define who he is.Matt Goodwin is the most extreme Reform candidate yet. How Labour and the Greens react will define them | Zoe WilliamsRead moreTwenty minutes further along the same bus route, I spend the following morning in Denton, a part of the seat where voters are reckoned to be83% white and 86% UK-born, and the hills on the edge of the Peak District are suddenly within sight. Coming here entails crossing from the City of Manchester into the borough of Tameside, and the town feels distinctly “red wall”-ish: a corner of theold Lancashire coalfieldwhere old family businesses are apparently clinging on by their fingernails, and local hopes of an economic uplift are focused onanother new food hall, which will open in a matter of weeks.Mary is in her early-30s, works full-time in retail and still lives in Denton with her parents, something she describes with a biting frustration. Her friend Lexi, a mother of two, holds down three different jobs – as a care support worker, a dinner lady and a cleaner – and says she is just about holding everything together.But what they most want to talk about is immigration. When I say that without people from abroad, some of our most basic services would fall apart, they both agree: “They’re absolutely fine. It’s the people on the streets, and the ones coming in on boats.” They share a somewhat strange belief that the middle of Manchester is now so dangerous that visiting is unthinkable. Both of them say appreciative things aboutNigel Farageand his party, but insist they haven’t yet decided who to vote for. One thing, though, is clear. “It won’t be Labour,” says Lexi.Here, it seems, is a ready market for Reform UK’s blithe pledges (“Stop illegal immigration”, “Put the British people first”, “End lawlessness on our streets”), frontedthis time by Matt Goodwin, the one-time academic analyst of the new right who has become one of its prime movers. But for Labour, Reform’s menacing presence is only half this byelection’s headache. Its other worries centre on an area of the seat that runs southwards towards Stockport, and includes Levenshulme and Longsight – home to a mixture of Muslim voters who may move from Labour to support a pro-Gaza candidate, and sizeable numbers of students and young professionals being frantically targeted by the resurgent Green party.Both halves of the constituency highlight the painful vacuum left by Starmer and his allies’ decision to bar Andy Burnham from standing.Whatever riskscame with the prospect of Burnham resigning as Greater Manchester mayor, had he been the candidate, the party’s campaign might have centred on his personal record, hisdiagnosis of the modern British mess– “deindustrialisation, privatisation, austerity and Brexit” – and a contrasting sense of optimism. Instead, stranded without a narrative, Labour can only defend its pretty disastrous handling of its first 19 months in power, and a leader and prime minister no one likes.In Levenshulme, I meet Max, a loquacious 27-year-old who spends his spare time volunteering for asylum and refugee charities. Starmer, he says, “needs to kind of self-reflect: ‘What do I believe? What do I want?’” He mentions Farage. “He seems to have a vision. Starmer doesn’t. And you can’t combat Reform if you haven’t got that. They’ve got better stories … I think they’re toxic stories, but they’re better at telling them.” He then brightens. “But the Greens have got a good story as well.”Five minutes’ drive away is Longsight. After Friday prayers at a compact mosque tucked behind a residential street, the mostly middle-aged men I talk to express bafflement about the fact that Burnham was barred from standing, and worry about what a Reform victory – which could result from the left vote being split – would mean for their everyday lives. When I hold up one of the party’s leaflets, one reaction is instant and unsettling: “It upsets me. It’s not healthy. It’s dividing us.”Labour may hold on here: as ever, it has a formidable get-out-the-vote machine, and droves of activists. As evidenced by Starmer’srather stilted claimthat the contest is reducible to “true patriotism against the plastic patriotism of Reform”, the party may yet manage what eluded it at last year’s byelection in theWelsh seat of Caerphilly, and successfully position itself as the best tactical choice to defeat Farage and Goodwin. But what even a Labour win will barely shift is what runs deep, here and all over the county: anger, disconnection and bewilderment with a party and government that are now floundering and disoriented.This is what really ought to be eating away at Labour’s high-ups. So far, every relaunch andU-turnhas either left those aspects of the public mood untouched, or raised them to a new pitch. After the Gorton and Denton byelection, their next expression will surely define May’s elections in Wales and Scotland, and the council elections across England the partyhasn’t managed to postpone. As I wandered around Longsight’s open-air market, I found a Green party leaflet, featuring one of its best campaign lines, seemingly written as a knowing challenge to Starmer and his people: “Make hope normal again.” Is that something Labour can do? And if it can’t, how can it possibly hope to arrest its decline?John Harris is a Guardian columnistJohn Harris and John Domokos’s Anywhere but Westminster film about the Gorton and Denton byelection will appear later this weekExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionManchesterByelectionsReform UKGreater ManchesterLocal politicsNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

She expected conception and pregnancy to again be quick and easy but, after a year of negative pregnancy tests, Anna’s doctor used a term she had not heard before: secondary infertility.For Anna, the anguish associated with secondary infertility – the inability to conceive or carry to term a second or subsequent child – was pervading all aspects of her life. Anna believed her family to be incomplete without a second child and was devastated at the thought of her child growing up without a sibling.She came to dread kids’ birthday parties and other social interactions, fearful of inevitable questions about a sibling for her toddler. She became fixated on the idea of pregnancy, seeing pregnant women and families with multiple young children “everywhere”. While this could be explained by the psychological concept of attentional bias (paying attention to selective factors leads us to believe there is an increase in a specific event or occurrence), the distress and sorrow caused by these sightings was genuine.Secondary infertility forced us to re-evaluate life as a ‘triangle family’ | Mia RistovskaRead moreAnna spoke of feeling like a failure, that her body had let her down and, worst of all, that she was a disappointment to her partner and child. She blamed herself for taking fertility for granted in her younger years, wondering aloud if her current age and previous long-term use of the contraceptive pill had contributed to current fertility issues.Anna’s unrelenting desire for a second child also caused a strain on her relationship. While initially keen to expand their family, her partner was reluctant to pursue fertility treatment due to financial expense and likely side-effects. With her girlfriends announcing second and third pregnancies and her partner encouraging her to let go of their plans for a larger family, Anna felt increasingly isolated and misunderstood.Therapy provided a space in which Anna’s concern were not minimised or disregarded. Unlike social conversations, Anna felt able to fully express her thoughts and feelings without tempering her views. She felt relieved to have a space in which others did not share their anecdotes about pregnancy or fertility.Exploring Anna’s perceptions of family and the importance of siblinghood was central to our work together. Like all of us, Anna’s notion of family and thoughts about children were strongly informed by her own upbringing. Templates for our lives are based on our early experiences and shaped by cultural norms and observations of others. As Anna was experiencing, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness can arise from inconsistency or incongruence between expectation and reality.Anna had enjoyed a close relationship with her older sibling throughout childhood. The pair relied on each other through difficult times within their own family unit and remained close into adulthood. Anna couldn’t imagine a childhood without her sibling; by extension, the idea of her own child not having a sibling felt alien. In this way, Anna was projecting her own experiences on to her child and her own family.For Anna, coming to terms with secondary infertility meant recognising her fixed notion of family as being one that must include siblings. Sitting with uncertainty and acknowledging the worry of the unknown of being part of a single-child family – both for herself as a parent and for her own child – was key to adopting a more flexible view of family.As months passed, Anna continued to adjust to the notion of finding fulfilment in the absence of a second child. Yet she continued to find others’ remarks about children and fertility upsetting. Stories from others about falling pregnant after “just relaxing” or not actively trying felt unfair and insensitive. Comments encouraging Anna to be grateful for having one happy and healthy child also fell flat – shewasgrateful but also felt deep suffering about not being able to have more than one child.We devised a strategy to manage such queries and comments. Recognising secondary infertility as a little-known condition, Anna endeavoured to remind herself that most people were naive rather than ill-intentioned in asking about family plans and children. Developing several tailored responses to draw upon helped manage her anxiety about social situations and conversations.As the mother of a toddler, it was impossible for Anna to completely avoid talk of pregnancy and babies. While she felt a pang of envy at the announcement of yet another pregnancy or birth, Anna was able to recognise that the composition of each family differs but no family is more or less authentic or valid than another. Others’ successes with pregnancy were not Anna’s failures.*Anna is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify similar casesIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636 andLifelineon 13 11 14.

She was alive and dead all at once. It was a terrible thing. And the burden on those closest is also part of the radioactive damage of it all.”My mother, Pamela, a journalist, died of vascular dementia 10 years ago. My father, the football journalist and novelistBrian Glanville, died of Parkinson’s last year after living with the illness for five years. He also had a milder form of dementia. “Radioactive damage” is certainly a vivid description of the impact of caring for someone living with a degenerative illness, but the perception that someone in the last stages of dementia may be “dead” feels wrong when I think of my parents. How are you to know what is happening in someone else’s brain?A great revelation for me in caring for my parents was a discovery I made through reading to them – that in some respects, their brains were unimpaired.View image in fullscreenPamela Glanville in the 1980s.Both continued to enjoy being read to until the end of their lives. They responded positively to hearing stories, poems and novels throughout their illnesses. They retained their ability to comprehend and follow a story, as well as their knowledge of the meaning of obscure words. On one memorable occasion, when I was reading my father a series of memoirs by Arthur Koestler, one of his favourite writers, he noticed that I wasn’t reading them chronologically. I hadn’t even realised.However, neither of them were able to communicate that they wanted me to read to them. I only discovered this by accident. My father would spend all day sitting silently in a chair, unable to move without assistance or do anything without the help of his devoted, professional care worker, Molly. To a casual visitor, he would appear to be “dead” to the world, apparently vacant. But he wasn’t – it was simply that, as I observed, Parkinson’s and dementia had robbed him of the ability to initiate a conversation or express a desire. There appears to be some kind of motor in the brain that enables us to connect with the outside world, which his illness had destroyed. It was only when the family and his care worker made the effort to engage with him, asking questions, encouraging him to communicate, that he would begin to be able to connect. And reading to him was one of the key ways that enabled us to do that. It was a bridge to the world that revealed some of his sophisticated cognitive function was entirely unaffected by dementia.View image in fullscreenBrian Glanville in the 1970sI observed exactly the same process with my mother. There was a moment when she appeared to no longer be able to follow a story towards the end of her life. Then I began reading her Doris Lessing’s delightful memoir about cats and once again my mother, a great lover of cats herself, was fully engaged.As a result, I have learned that one must never assume that because someone with a degenerative illness is silent or uncommunicative that means they are unable to understand what is going on around them or are incapable of engaging. One has to make the effort to see if there is some way of making a connection.There is evidence that my experience is not an isolated incident. Case studies from the charity The Reader’sreading groupsshow that reading aloud can have a dramatic effect on people living with dementia, triggering fluency and communication in response to a story or poem.In an evaluation of The Reader’s work, Philip Davis at the University of Liverpool concluded that reading aloud to people with dementia produced a significant reduction in the severity of their symptoms and contributed to wellbeing.I am, of course, aware that there may be a point, with the devastating degeneration of Alzheimer’s for example, where this kind of connection becomes impossible. For me, “death”, for certain, only comes when someone physically ceases to function. People with dementia need others to advocate for them – and that includes opposing assisted dying. There are, it seems, still pleasures and connections to be made, even as the world dims all around.Jo Glanville is a journalist and radio producer.

I’m teasing: it definitely is Morvan narrating You Know It’s True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli.But as the recording of his book has been nominated for best audiobook, narration and storytelling recording at the 2026 Grammy awards – and Milli Vanilli are the only winners to have had their Grammy (given in 1990 for best new artist) rescinded, due to the revelation that the duo didn’t sing on their records – I do need confirmation.“It’s all me,” a smiling Morvan says. “I co-wrote the book with Parisa Rose, a journalist with the Los Angeles Tribune, and throughout I have been as truthful as I can possibly be.”Truth and lies feature through Morvan’s memoir: as half of Milli Vanilli he enjoyed pop stardom while living a lie, before being skewered by those demanding the truth. Almost everyone aged over 45 will probably have some memory of Milli Vanilli, so popular were they between October 1988 and November 1990: with three US No 1s, and more than 37m singles and albums sold in 1989 alone, they were positioned alongside Michael Jackson, George Michael and Madonna as pop’s most popular performers.We choreographed everything, and danced until our shoes were full of bloodIf 1989 was Milli Vanilli’s annus mirabilis then 1990 proved their annus horribilis: after their producer/svengali Frank Farian admitted they were “non-singing performers”. The duo were “cancelled” in today’s terms – Grammy rescinded, recording contract denuded, intense media and public opprobrium. Class action lawsuits under US fraud protection laws were served, while TV comedians ridiculed the photogenic performers.“It was an awful experience,” says Morvan, a youthful 59, speaking from his home in Amsterdam. “People hated us. And when we gave our press conference [in November 1990] after Frank had told the world our secret it felt like we were met by a media lynch mob.”View image in fullscreenGoing, going, gong … Fab Morvan with Rob Pilatus at the 1990 Grammy awards.Photograph: Frank TrapperFootage of the press conference makes for uncomfortable viewing: a baying crowd of predominantly white journalists shout questions and accusations at the duo, treating them like criminals. Morvan remains largely silent during the interrogation, seemingly shellshocked. His Milli partner, Rob Pilatus, tries to defend their position, stating: “We were poor, living in the projects – haveyouever lived in the projects?”No mercy was shown, and Pilatus and Morvan were left to suffer outrageous fortune’s slings and arrows. Pilatus never recovered, dying of an overdose, aged 33, in 1998, his post-stardom life being marked by addiction and a short spell in prison. His death might have signalled the end of one of pop’s most notorious stories, but instead, in recent years there has been a reconsideration of Milli Vanilli: both the exuberant Europop of the recordings, and the duo’s high-energy performances (“We choreographed everything,” says Morvan, “and danced until our shoes were full of blood”). Alongside this new appreciation, plenty have asked the question: did two young Black performers, ruthlessly exploited by white record executives, deserve such public humiliation?The reconsideration began with Luke Korem’s excellent 2023 feature-lengthdocumentary Milli Vanilli(currently streamingon iPlayer), followed by the 2023 German biopic Girl You Know It’s True (streaming on Prime), a far more engaging effort than recent hagiographic treatments of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. The interest these films generated encouraged Morvan to write his take on the story.“For the book I went all out because the truth will set you free,” says the French-born Morvan, his English fluent after years in Los Angeles. “People get sick from stress, from holding things inside – I know this from experience. My partner Tessa told me, ‘You have to tell the whole truth,’ but I’d been holding back because I didn’t want to throw Rob under the bus.I believe Rob died of a broken heart. He had been abandoned as a baby and he now felt abandoned as an adult“But, at the same time, I had to free myself and tell my story. It’s a combination of things – a dream and a nightmare. I experienced both. As Rob is no longer here, I wondered how could I communicate with him and I thought I will write him a letter. And that is how the book starts.”Morvan’s book describes his upbringing in a dysfunctional, Parisian Guadeloupean family, and then follows his teenage relocation to Munich (seeking work as dancer and choreographer), where he encounters Pilatus. Their athletic beauty helped the duo find work dancing for German pop singers and hosting club nights. They decided to form a band and were introduced by a local musician to Farian, a Frankfurt-based music industry magus responsible for Boney M, among others. Farian had already recorded Girl You Know It’s True with vocalists, but his problem was they weren’t remotely photogenic. Upon encountering Morvan and Pilatus, Farian proffered a contract.Morvan’s German was poor, so he couldn’t read the contract. But Pilatus, who was born to a German mother and US GI father (and initially raised in an orphanage), insisted they sign it. Morvan says he and Pilatus believed they would sing on their records; Farian, who died in 2024, had denied this, saying he employed them solely as performers. With a Faustian contract signed, the duo set off on the road to fame, if not fortune.“I’ve never received a cent from those millions of records and CDs and tapes that Milli Vanilli sold,” says Morvan. “And today our streaming numbers are huge, but the contract ensures we get nothing.”Farian had used similar tactics with Boney M: Bobby Farrell, the quartet’s frontman, was a dancer who never sang on the act’s records. By 1988, with Boney M’s European chart success long over, Farian was desperate to unleash Milli Vanilli: Girl You Know It’s True initially broke in Germany, before reaching the top three in the UK and US.Clive Davis, then the US’s most powerful record executive, signed Milli Vanilli to his Arista label, and soon the duo’s videos were on high rotation on MTV. With Farian working overtime, Milli Vanilli scored hit after hit. Morvan and Pilatus rocketed from poverty to penthouse: in Munich they had shoplifted food; in Beverly Hills they drove Ferraris. Blasted on cocaine, Pilatus declared himself in a Time interview the new Elvis Presley, and more talented than Paul McCartney.Yet rumours circulated suggesting the duo weren’t the ones singing the songs – due, in part, to the fact that both spoke heavily accented English. At a 1989 concert in Bristol, Connecticut, broadcast live on MTV, the vocal tape for Girl You Know It’s True started skipping, and Morvan and Pilatus were forced to flee the stage. And then, in early 1990, they won the Grammy.View image in fullscreenNo longer silent … Milli Vanilli at their infamous press conference in November 1990.Photograph: MediaPunch Inc/Alamy“The thing is, we never wanted to win it,” says Morvan. “Because the criteria for the Grammys is that you have to sing on the record. And we didn’t sing on the record. We go to the show and were moved to what is called the ‘camera seats’. I realised we might win and my heart started racing, and then, when they called out our name, something exploded in the pit of my stomach.”The end was nigh when the puppets turned against the puppeteer, demanding more money and insisting they sing on their sophomore album. When Farian refused to compromise, the duo threatened to work with a new producer. “But Frank was always two steps ahead of us,” says Morvan.Farian promptly held the now notorious press conference and revealed all. “Hoax” shouted a headline in the LA Times. Radio stations removed Milli Vanilli’s songs, MTV dropped their videos, Arista deleted their album. “Lies take the elevator while truth takes the stairs,” reflects Morvan. “I knew at some point truth would catch us.”The duo soldiered on, releasing the Rob & Fab album in 1992 on a tiny record label. Here, they shared the vocals while Morvan co-wrote most of the songs, but the public was unwilling to forgive them and the album sold poorly. Pilatus fell deeper into addiction, while Morvan focused on a solo career as a singer-songwriter, paying the bills by teaching French on the side. The duo did reunite with Farian in 1998 in an attempt to help the struggling Pilatus, but he died before anything developed. “I believe he died of a broken heart,” says Morvan. “He had been abandoned as a baby and he now felt abandoned as an adult.”Scottish rappers, deaf composers and an AI song called Zygotic Washstands: the biggest hoaxes in popRead moreMorvan relocated to Europe 16 years ago, met Tessa, a Dutch woman who had no idea of his past, and started a family. Today, as well as releasing his own music, he now owns the rights to the name Milli Vanilli: “For a long while I wasn’t allowed to use it. Now I’m playing concerts to thousands of people with a band and me singing, no backing tapes.” Morvan wants his book to serve as a warning of how ruthless the music industry can be.“In French we say ‘avec le temps’[with time]. People now realise how we went so high then dropped so low.” He shakes his head at the memory, then smiles and says: “I’m a lucky guy – I love my partner and four children and I love what I do. I’m not bitter. I feel blessed.”If, this week, Morvan again wins a Grammy it will signal one of pop’s most remarkable resurrections. And if he doesn’t, he has already pulled off a larger victory, the marionette who became his own man.You Know It’s True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli by Fab Morvan and Parisa Rose is published by the Los Angeles Tribune.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At its centre are acrimoniously divorced couple Amanda and Elyot, who bump into each other while honeymooning with their new spouses. Soon the fierce love that first brought them together has rekindled and they abscond together, initiating a dangerous dance of desire and violence.View image in fullscreenPlaying for laughs … Hope Yolanda.Photograph: PRBoth the play and director Amy Gavin’s production are at their best when trembling on the knife-edge between carnality and cruelty. After a gratingly broad first act introduces us to the protagonists and their insipid new partners, things settle when we arrive in Amanda and Elyot’s Parisian bolthole and get drawn into their tumultuous relationship. Here there’s a sense of how quickly love can sour into contempt, as the pair alternately sizzle and spar, a slap never far from a kiss. Gavin’s intervention of projecting recorded images from the couple’s stormy marriage on the surface behind them unnecessarily hammers home what we can already see playing out.The strongest performance is from Her Productions’ artistic director Hannah Ellis Ryan as Amanda, her sophisticated sheen barely concealing a restless, prowling energy that’s unleashed when she reunites with Elyot. While Charlie Nobel doesn’t quite capture the charm that draws his ex-wife so irresistibly back to him, there’s a fizzing chemistry between the two that boils over into something more ugly. Played purely for laughs, Hope Yolanda’s twitchy Sybil and Jack Elliot’s decent-but-dull Victor seem like creatures from another world, wrenching the play back into the realm of awkward comedy when they interrupt their spouses’ love-hate tryst.Gavin has clearly made a choice to amp up the brutality with some wince-inducing instances of violence. These then sit jarringly alongside the play’s comic moments, which sometimes veer into the cartoonish. By pressing too hard on extremes this version sacrifices nuance and detail, struggling to make a case for why we should still care about Coward’s play almost a hundred years on.AtHope Mill theatre, Manchester, until 8 February; thenThe Dukes, Lancaster,from 24-28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreNoel CowardreviewsShareReuse this content"

On her return trip, she accepts a lift from a polka band. Its leader is played byJohn Candy, one of O’Hara’s stablemates – along with Martin Short,Eugene Levyand Gilda Radner – from her early days in Toronto’s improvisational comedy troupe Second City.To misplace a child once may be regarded as a misfortune. To do so twice looks like carelessness. Then again, plausibility is no match for the pressure to repeat a $477m hit – and so it was that Kevin was again estranged from his family in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992). O’Hara transformed maternal despair into frantic comedy once more.The role brought her fame but was not typical of her work. Eccentrics suffused with vanity, mischief or vulnerability were much more O’Hara’s style.Before Home Alone, she had found a wide audience in Tim Burton’s comedyBeetlejuice (1988). She played Delia Deetz, a pretentious sculptor who moves with her husband and stepdaughter into a creaky Connecticut house whose previous occupants – now ghosts – plot to evict them.In the film’s standout sequence, the family and their dinner party guests are suddenly possessed and forced to sing and dance toHarry Belafonte’s calypso hit Day-O (the Banana Boat Song). As the first to be turned into a kind of human marionette, O’Hara’s blend of horror, embarrassment and slow-dawning rapture isa delirious slapstick joy. In her review of the film, the criticPauline Kaelsingled out the actor’s “sexy evil eyes” and called her “the possessor of the freakiest blue-eyed stare since early Gene Wilder”. O’Hara returned as Delia in the sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (2024), roaming the underworld after being fatally bitten by asps.View image in fullscreenCatherine O’Hara and Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone, 1990. Her panicked cry of ‘Kevin!’ became world famous.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarThe most deranged of O’Hara’s creations, however, was Moira Rose in the popular sitcom Schitt’s Creek (2015-20). This grande dame, former soap star and woman of many wigs, each of them named, is reduced to sharing cramped rooms in an Ontario motel with her doting husband and two spoilt adult children after the family loses its fortune. Dreaming of recapturing her former opulence and status, she hitches her wagon to dubious projects including a horror sequel calledThe Crows Have Eyes 3: The Croweningand acommercial for ghastly fruit wine(“It tastes like amoxicillin”) in which an increasingly sozzled Moira mangles the vintner’s name in ever more tongue-twisted ways.Instances of her cuckoo behaviour across the show’s six series were innumerable, her couture wardrobe incongruous in the folksy setting, her accent mystifyingly wayward: she might airily pronounce her son David’s name as “Dare-vid”, or render “baby” as “bare-bare”. For O’Hara, this verbal crazy-paving was part of the point. “When people try to imitate that character,” she said, “the mistake they make is to be consistent.” Still, Moira was rarely less than a loving mother. “What have I told you about putting your body on the internet?” she asks her daughter in one episode. “Never! Never without proper lighting.”O’Hara won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her performance in the series, which was co-written by Levy and his son, Dan Levy, who played her husband and son respectively. O’Hara and Eugene Levy, who briefly dated in their improv days, also sparked together magically in four astute and exceptionally funny films directed byChristopher Guestand co-written by him and Levy.Waiting for Guffman (1996) concerns a Missouri am-dram society whose members believe that their new musical celebrating local history (there is a production number about the manufacture of foot-stools) has Broadway potential. In keeping with the film’s genial tone, O’Hara’s evident love for her character, a travel agent and atrocious actor, generates a warmth that precludes cruelty.View image in fullscreenCatherine O’Hara in the television comedy Schitt’s Creek, 2019.Photograph: CBC/ITV/Kobal/ShutterstockIn Best in Show (2000), she and Levy play a married couple whose trip with their terrier to a dog show is beset with problems, beginning when a lack of funds sees them downgraded at their hotel from a suite to a broom cupboard.They were a couple again, albeit estranged, inA Mighty Wind (2003), about a memorial concert of folk musicians. Reunited for the gig, their characters Mitch and Mickey provide the touching emotional undercurrent of this silly but painstakingly authentic film, before going their separate ways. O’Hara, as Mickey, is last seen performing a song about catheters at a medical supplies trade show.For Your Consideration (2006)was the only one of her films with Guest not to adopt the mockumentary format, though it was no less hilarious for that. O’Hara is the humble veteran whose head is turned by rumours that she may receive an Oscar nomination for playing a dying matriarch in a modest indie drama. Soon, she is wearing red leather numbers and undergoing plastic surgery that fixes her mouth in a rictus grin. The part played to O’Hara’s speciality: the comedy of delusion.While the structure and plot points of Guest’s films were committed to paper, the lion’s share of the material was improvised by the cast, and it was not unusual for the finished 90-minute product to have emerged from as many as 60 hours of raw footage.“To me, the most rewarding improvising is having agreed on an idea beforehand, where the scene might go, who your character is, or what might possibly be funny about your character, and at the same time be completely open to the other people because you’re not alone,” O’Hara said.In his book Improv Nation, Sam Wasson calls her “one of the most fluid improvisers of her generation. Others may be crazier; none were as elegantly at ease.”She was born and raised in Toronto, the sixth of seven children. Her mother was an estate agent and her father worked for Canadian Pacific Railways. Their sense of humour, she said, informed hers. “My father told great jokes he brought home from the office and my mother imitated everybody. I like to think I’m a combination.”She was educated at Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute, Toronto, and auditioned for the Second City company only to end up as a waitress. Eventually, she was appointed understudy for Radner, who was dating O’Hara’s brother. Explaining her initial approach to improv, O’Hara said: “My crutch was … when in doubt, play insane. Because you didn’t have to excuse anything that came out of your mouth. It didn’t have to make sense.”Between 1976 and 1984, the sketch show SCTV, a television spin-off of Second City, became a cult success, earning O’Hara and her fellow writer-performers an Emmy in 1982.In Martin Scorsese’s zippy black comedy After Hours (1985), she drove an ice-cream van through Manhattan as part of the nocturnal hunt for the film’s hero, a computer programmer falsely suspected of murder. She was a gossipy journalist in Heartburn (1986), directed byMike Nicholsand based onNora Ephron’s semi-autobiographical novel about her marriage to the journalist Carl Bernstein. She was also in Warren Beatty’s comic-strip adventure Dick Tracy and Alan Alda’s comedy Betsy’s Wedding (both 1990).Most recently, she was impressive in very different roles in two 2025 TV hits: as a former studio boss modelled on Sony’s Amy Pascal in Seth Rogen’s film-industry comedy The Studio, and in the second season of the zombie drama The Last of Us as therapist to the hero, played by Pedro Pascal.O’Hara’s many voice performances included Chicken Little (2005), Spike Jonze’s live-action adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are (2009) and The Wild Robot (2024). She also provided voices in two stop-motion gothic animated films from the Burton stable: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), directed by Henry Selick, and Burton’s 2008 feature-length version of his own 1984 short Frankenweenie. Her various roles in the latter included “Weird Girl” – a fair description of the niche she carved for herself.She is survived by her husband, the production designer Bo Welch, whom she met on the set of Beetlejuice and married in 1992, by their children, Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings, including the singer Mary Margaret O’Hara.Catherine Anne O’Hara, actor, born 4 March 1954; died 30 January 2026Explore more on these topicsFilmUS televisionSchitt's CreekCanadaComedy filmsTim BurtonMartin ScorseseobituariesShareReuse this content"

He was 50.Since his death, Jackson’s legacy has been met with opposing forces – one that exalts his musical and performing talents and another which takes note of his artistry but refrains from celebrating it further given the detailed abuse accusations against him.His personal physician, Dr Conrad Murray, was ultimately convicted of giving Jackson the deadly dose of propofol as the singer prepared for a series of comeback concerts.Murraywas found guilty of manslaughter and served nearly two years in prison.The Trial’s release was set to come after the US government released millions of files pertaining toJeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and then was reported to have died by suicide in federal custody while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Those files contain photos of Epstein with some of the most significant figures from the last century, including Jackson.The singerwas shownin one picture posing with Epstein next to a large painting. It is not clear why that picture – initially released in December – was taken. And there is no suggestion Jackson was aware of, or involved in, any of Epstein’s crimes.Explore more on these topicsMichael JacksonMichael Jackson trialnewsShareReuse this content"

What’s next?’Stuart HeritageAs the 20th book in his Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is published, the author shows no signs of slowing down – scripting films, opening a bookshop and making plans to rebuild his hometownSun 1 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTShareWatching Jeff Kinney sign books is akin to watching an elaborate piece of performance art. Backstage at a theatre in Chester, where the author is continuing his UK tour, three folding tables heave under the weight of thousands of copies. Kinney wheels round the table on a swivel chair, signing as he goes. He is a picture of total focus.Today Kinney is signing copies of Partypooper, the 20th book in his blockbuster Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. Every copy bears the phrase “Over 300 million books sold”. To put that into perspective, Kinney has sold more books than Led Zeppelin have sold albums. If you’ve had – or been – a child of reading age at any point over the last couple of decades, Kinney is a rock star. And nowhere is that clearer than at his sold-out event later that evening, as he is custard-pied while a crowd of 800 children and parents scream with excitement.Kinney shows are a world away from the usual sedate author signings. This is a performance, with walk-on characters and audience participation so enthusiastic that one poor mum almost tore herself in half trying to do the splits. It’s impressive stuff, especially since Kinney claims not to be a natural. “I’m not the type of person who needs to stand in the spotlight,” he insists backstage. “I’m a writer. I chose that profession because I’m an introvert. So it’s a weird thing to be on stage, but these days, if you’re a children’s writer, you also need to learn to be an entertainer.”Formerly a software engineer, Kinney first created Wimpy Kid – about the various misadventures of titular middle school student Greg Heffley – for the browser game site Funbrain. Three years later, the first book was released and immediately became a sensation, thrilling children with its relatable characters and the sheer density of jokes. The Wimpy Kid books read like exceptionally well-crafted observational comedy routines, something that lures in children reluctant to delve into, say, bricklike, lore-heavy fantasy series.Now 54 years old, and greying at the temples, Kinney is both very tall and extremely polite. And, for someone who has to be richer than God, unflappably normal. He could quite easily pass as a friendly teacher, or someone who runs a small pottery business.Yet, at this point in his career, Kinney feels untouchable. Every new Wimpy Kid book is an event and while the pressure of maintaining such a beloved series for so long might get to some authors, Kinney wears it lightly. “I’ve got a whole world that I feel responsible for, and employees that I have. People have careers that come out of this engine, so I definitely need to keep the motor running. I’m aware of that, but I wouldn’t call it pressure. It’s a nice place to be.”View image in fullscreenJeff Kinney on stage in Cheshire.Photograph: Joel GoodmanAlthough the series has existed since 2007, Partypooper is just as funny and kinetic as any of his previous books, with a gleeful darkness that lingers around the edges. Greg Heffley remains possibly the most lovable psychopath in all of children’s literature; one scene in the new book sees him blow out a funeral candle in a crazed bid to have a wish granted.“Every year I ask the big questions,” he says. “What am I doing? Why am I doing this? Three days ago I was trying to state my goals. Consistency and longevity at a high level in comedy is my current goal. I think a lot about Bob Dylan. I’m certainly not trying to compare myself to Bob Dylan, but he just moves forward. And I think that’s a nice model.”Kinney has become the custodian of an entire franchise. As well as the books and the riotous shows he takes around the world (as soon as the Chester show finishes, he flies out for a leg in Germany), he also writes the screenplays for all of Disney’s Wimpy Kid movies (the latest, The Last Straw, came out in early December). He credits working across so many mediums for his ability to keep the books fresh.“My first few books are just like a collection of jokes,” he smiles. “I didn’t care that much about telling a good story. But when those books were adapted for the screen, I started learning about structure. It wasn’t until book nine that I even tried to tell a good story. And it wasn’t until book 12 that I started to get the hang of it. The first book that I’m proud of as a narrative is my 19th book, which only came out last year.”If that wasn’t enough to juggle, Kinney also has a sideline as a town planner. When his books started to take off, he used some of the funds to open a bookshop – An Unlikely Story – in his hometown of Plainville, Massachusetts. And when the store became a success he decided to branch out and apply the same formula to the entire region.View image in fullscreen“The downtown is very depressed,” he says. “The industry is gone, and now you’re left with this town where everybody lives, but they don’t have anything to do. So what we’re doing is we’re building. We just finished a beer garden, and now we’re gonna put in a pizza restaurant, and then we’re going to create a town green and some other things too.”When a series has enjoyed a run as long as Wimpy Kid’s, some authors can begin to feel restless. Kinney has toyed with the margins of his universe in recent years, with a spin-off series about Heffley’s best friend, and a collection of short stories. I ask him if he has an end goal, a number of books he’d like to hit before he moves on.“Right at this moment, I really am looking out over the horizon,” he replies, slowly at first. “There were two goals I wanted to reach. One was book 20, and the other was 300 million books in print. I didn’t ever think beyond that. And now I’ve gotta say, what’s next?”For a moment, I worry that he’s about to give me an unhappy exclusive and announce his retirement. But no. “When you look at what I’ve created here, it’s not so much a literary character as a cartoon character,” he goes on. “Cartoon characters tend to go on for a long time. I’m not embarrassed by it. You know, Charles Schulz did Peanuts for 50 years.”A quietly logical man, he writes his books with an elaborate process that involves obsessively journalling and then using a practice derived from engineering called Systematic Inventive Thinking to mine the journals for jokes. And this formula should allow Wimpy Kid to run and run.“It’s just such a privilege to have a long-running series because, you know, it’s hard to break in as a writer,” he says. “I’m very aware of how lucky I am to not have to introduce myself to the public when I have a new book. I’m more like a legacy person now, and I like that better. You know when you see photos of Schulz or Dr Seuss and they’re old? They’re looking a little bent over with their glasses on. I’m headed for that. I’m headed to my final form.”Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Partypooper by Jeff Kinney is published by Puffin. To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Whether in a professional, social or romantic setting, there is a particularly painful sting to the discovery that one has been judged undesirable in some way. If you have ever experienced proper rejection – and that would be most of us – it may stand out in your mind for a long time, like a boulder lodged in the landscape of memory.And it can hurt literally. The late anthropologist Helen Fisher, who studied human behaviour in the context of romantic love, showed that rejection and physical injury have much in common. In 2010 sheled a studyof people who had been recently rejected romantically. Functional MRI scans of their brains revealed that areas associated with distress and physical pain were more active. The passage of time did seem to reduce the pain response for Fisher’s participants, but for some people rejection can resonate for months or years. This overlap in the brain’s response to what we think of as physical and mental pain isn’t limited to romance. Social psychologist Naomi Eisenberger scanned the brains of people who were socially excluded from a ballgame in an experiment. Her results showed that “social pain is analogous in its neurocognitive function to physical pain, alerting us when we have sustained injury to our social connections”.From an evolutionary perspective, it is easy to understand why rejection hits so hard. The realisation that one has been socially excluded induces a sudden chill, like being cast out from a Palaeolithic campsite and left at the mercy of sabre-toothed predators. To be exiled from the warmth of the communal fire could have meant death for our ancient ancestors – so it was something to be avoided at all costs. While the spurned of modern Britain won’t usually have to contend with the dangers that social rejects of 30,000 years ago faced, the impulse to seek shelter in the company of others is strong and enduring. We yearn to be accepted. For 21st‑century Homo sapiens, though, recoiling from rejection may do more harm than good. In fact, strong and lasting negative emotional reactions to rejection often cause more damage than the rejection itself. In order to lead fulfilling lives, to figure out what we enjoy and are good at, we have to be prepared to try things – and to fail at them. Make avoiding rejection your priority and you’ll find yourself becoming more risk-averse and less spontaneous, with a paradoxically narrower social world.What if, rather than shrinking from rejection, we attempted to embrace it? What if instead of being slapped down by the wave, we tried to ride it? Not only is it possible to overcome the fear of rejection, but doing so can improve our psychological health too, leading to better social functioning and greater wellbeing. The key moves are acceptance and cognitive reframing: rejection happens to everyone, and can’t actually be avoided. Not only that, but it can be the means by which you learn and become more resilient. Keep that in mind, and you’ve already softened the blow. Cultivating equanimity in the face of disappointment has a long pedigree: in spiritual traditions such as Buddhism, meditation aims to bring about an attitude of lucid openness to the slings and arrows of life. But there are other, novel ways to respond, as one American entrepreneur showed.In 2012, Jia Jiang received a “no” from an investor that left him feeling crushed. Rather than wallow in his pain, he decided to learn to embrace his greatest fear by accumulating rejections over 100 days. He uploaded videos of himself making ridiculous requests, starting off by asking a total stranger if he could borrow $100. Over the course of his project, Jiang noted that his anxiety around rejection quickly diminished as he became desensitised. “It reminded me of the ancient Iron Fist technique in kung fu,” he wrote, “where a person repeatedly pummels hard objects with his or her fist to gain resistance to pain.” But beyond this increased psychological resilience, he also found that his sense of agency, awareness of possibility, social skill and delight in engaging with other people all flourished. Not only that, but as his outlook and demeanour shifted to one of greater openness and positivity towards the strangers he was approaching, he found that more and more people were actually sayingyesto his absurd proposals. When one doughnut chain employee agreed to his request for a set of doughnuts iced and arranged to look like the Olympic rings and gave them to him free, Jiang’s mission went viral.Throughout history, rejection has often functioned as a crucible, helping to forge some of the most extraordinary artistic movements, from impressionism to punk. A reject has less to lose and doesn’t have to behave in the way the group dictates, and from this can come a delicious freedom to play and make. The most dramatic form of rejection, exile, can generate the greatest innovation. Would the brilliance and influence of the Bauhaus group, or the strange sublimity of the surrealists, have been quite the same had they not been rejected at some point or another? And while there is plenty of evidence that social rejection has harmful cognitive effects, for those with a particular kind of self-conception, it can act as artistic rocket fuel. In 2013 academic Sharon Kimled a studyshowing that people with a strong sense of their own uniqueness as individuals experienced a boost in creativity after social rejection.Whatever your temperament, rejection is inescapable. Nobody gets to swerve it entirely, however rich, famous or beautiful they may be. Training ourselves to abandon the tendency to catastrophise after a setback – reacting as if we have been cast out from our encampment into the freezing tundra, when in reality we have merely been NFI’d to a birthday party – can transform the way we move in the world. Reframing things in a more optimistic way, while practising exposure, gives us the freedom to play. Embracing rejection means embracing being thrown back. So let us endeavour to bounce like a rubber ball, perhaps in an unforeseen direction, but comforted by the fact that we are in excellent company.Further readingRejection Proof: How I Beat Fear and Became Invincible Through 100 Days of Rejection by Jia Jiang (Harmony, £10.99)The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga (Allen & Unwin, £10.99)The Power of Letting Go: How to Drop Everything That’s Holding You Back by John Purkiss (Aster, £16.99)Explore more on these topicsPsychologyThe big ideafeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is apparent in this lyrical two-hander, full of imagination and whimsy, about twins whose close sibling ties bring intimacy, ambition and fantasies of taking flight. But it also sets their place in the world: he is the genius of the family and she, by comparison, is defined as the “idiot.”Both Daisy (Jess Senanayake) and Luke (Tyrese Walters) are neurodivergent, growing up in a high-rise block, aged 11 when we first meet them. She is navigating dyslexia and ADHD, trying to live authentically within herself while Luke is in denial of his autism, and it takes some time to see him as anything but a clever and supportive brother.Blending poetry and movement, Jammz’s grime compositions bring this show infectiously to life. The young actors’ raps are impressive too, and there is an affectionate chemistry between them. But under Eleanor Manners’direction, the pace could be slower with more tonal nuance so you can absorb the drama and the beauty of Stevenson’s script.Movement and action as a whole could be clearer and sharper too. Even though the story blends realities – inner, outer, real and imaginative worlds – it takes a while to follow some scene switches. The set design by Erin Guan, comprising a curtain, a swing and a cardboard stereo system, is rather undefined too.View image in fullscreenSibling ties … Jess Senanayake and Tyrese Walters.Photograph: Chris SaundersThe twins seek escape and liberation of different kinds. Luke’s ambition is to be the first teenager on Mars, Daisy wants to train in circus acrobatics. The actors also voice several other roles, from teachers to parents. A lot is packed in, from parental violence and a mother with mental health issues to sibling rivalry. There is omniscient narration as well and it sometimes builds confusion, but perhaps the story and its switches are deliberately meant to be oblique and non-literal.When it works, it is absorbing and moving, such as a scene in which Daisy feels as if she is floating and seems finally to have found a home in circus training. Walters gives a lovely performance too of a protective but single-minded brother in denial of his own neurodivergence.As aSheffield Theatresand National Youth Theatre co-production, it is an idiosyncratic and infectious drama, affirming Stevenson as a uniquely gifted playwright.

We’re laughing!” There’s a lot of this reflexive shtick at the start ofStephen K Amos’s touring show: lots of thinking aloud about laughter, and reminding us that’s what we’re here to do. One routine asks whether and why animals laugh, and another – all amygdala this and endorphins that – considers what laughter does to our brains. Yet another drolly explores the Venn diagram that unites the laugh, the orgasm and the sneeze.This all bespeaks a certain confidence from the veteran that his 75-minute offering will keep the laughter flowing. And it does, if not in the most adventurous way. Later in the show he tells us that Now We’re Talking! is a departure for him; “I wanted to be more honest.” But the show is notable not for the novelty of its thinking, or any sense that we’re being granted intimacies. Its hallmark is convivial, consensual good fun, in which Amos ventures orthodox opinions and relatable observations about a-changin’ times, social media and dumbed-down modernity.So after the laughter material, the show scrolls back to Amos’s youth, the son of Nigerian immigrants navigating casual racism, harsh parental discipline and TV with three channels only and a night-time curfew. Compare that to nowadays, where everyone’s dimwit opinions are freely broadcast. “I’m not saying it was better in the old days,” protests Amos, reluctant to seem like a grumpy old man. But if it’s not what he’s saying, it’s what he’s implying.But at least he’s doing so amusingly. It may rely on fairly cheap funny-accent humour, but it’s hard to resist his routine about an African newcomer to the UK encountering a meat raffle. Elsewhere, there’s a twisty number aboutthe Dunning-Kruger effect, by which the ignorant overestimate their own intelligence. The thumbnail sketch of the comic’s upbringing, meanwhile – the home economics classes and unglamorous rubber-hose shower attachments – brings the 1970s pungently back to life. It may be familiar standup fare. But given Amos’s newfound interest in the science of laughter, there’s enough here to ensure his own show might serve as a case study.At The Trades Club, Hebden Bridge, 5 Feb; then touring.Explore more on these topicsStageComedyStephen K AmosreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jennie has done her best to coach me in local geography before darkness, showing me the map with its patchwork of islands and bays, and describing the shape of each landmark. All to no avail. I’m more than happy to be lost at sea, leaning back in my kayak to gaze at the constellations, occasionally checking that the red light on the stern of her kayak is still visible ahead. We stop in the sheltered lee of an island and hear a hoot. “Eurasian eagle owl,” says Jennie. “They nest here.” Then she switches off all the lights. “Let’s paddle slowly close to shore. Watch what happens.”As soon as we move, the sea flickers into life, every paddle stroke triggering thrilling trails of cold, blue sparkles. When we stop, I slap my hand on the surface and the sea is momentarily electrified into a nebulous neural network of light, like some great salty brain figuring out this alien intrusion. Below that, squadrons of jellyfish pulse their own spectral contribution.“When I was a child,” Jennie whispers (we are both whispering), “there was no light pollution. We would throw stones from the shore to see what we called ‘sea fire’.” I spend a pointless few minutes attempting to photograph this elusive bioluminescence, then relax and simply enjoy it. Travel should broaden the mind, not the iCloud.We are in the maze of deserted islands off Hälsö (population: 569), one of 10 inhabited islands in Sweden’s northern Gothenburg archipelago. To get here, all it took was a short bus ride out of Sweden’s second city, a brief ferry ride, then a leisurely hike along the new coastal trail that snakes round these islands, using bridges, causeways and ferries to connect. It does not feel like a lot, not for the sensation of being on the far side of the Milky Way in a kayak-shaped flying saucer.View image in fullscreenA tidal pool amid a rocky landscape on Hönö.Photograph: Utterstrom Photography/AlamyMy own definition of an island is any land mass surrounded by water that is large enough for Robinson Crusoe to survive on. I want a beach, a lookout point and enough driftwood to build a shack. The Swedish mapping office, Lantmäteriet, however, defines an island as anything more than 9 sq metres, an area sufficient to pitch a small tent. Using this definition, Sweden boasts in excess of260,000, though only about 8,000 have ever been settled and less than 1,000 are now inhabited. My aim on this trip is to visit about half a dozen in the Gothenburg archipelago.As soon as the path leaves the road, you are on a maze of boulders, a massive adventure playground for anyone who loves leaping and scramblingThe new footpath is a 21.7-mile(35km) section of the much longerKuststigentrail that goes from Gothenburg to Oslo, but this small slice is worth taking a little time over. I base myself inSkärgårdshotelleton Hönö, where there are a few cafes and restaurants. It’s a quiet place outside school summer holidays. On the first morning, I walk over a soaring bridge to the southernmost island of Fotö and discover why the relatively short distances can take time. As soon as the path leaves the road, you are on a maze of boulders, a massive adventure playground for anyone who loves leaping and scrambling. The fantastical patterns of striations, crystallisation and lichen only cause further delays.I am almost late back to Hönö for my boat trip with Lasse, an avuncular computer expert turned sailor, who takes visitors out on hisveteran fishing vessel. We do not spot any seals – the ostensible objective – but that doesn’t matter. We spend a couple of hours wending our way through the uninhabited islands out to the archipelago’s farthest point, the rocky outcrop of Vinga. This was once home to Evert Taube, one of Sweden’s great folk music balladeers, whose father was the lighthouse keeper.View image in fullscreenClimber Andreas Lundqvist bouldering in Ersdalen.Photograph: Kevin RushbyThat evening, back in Hönö, in theTullhusetrestaurant at the harbour mouth, I sit with the owner, Preben Pedersen, and watch the Vinga lighthouse flash. “The islands are very proud of the Evert Taube connection,” he tells me. “Music has always been important here. The church played a big part in that.”As usual, however, the devil had the best tunes. While the islands were once officially “dry”, smuggling and illicit production were rife, and had their own geography: Moonshine Bay was a popular hangout for local folk music heroes such as Arne I Bora (real name John Arne Jansson) who blasted out a rougher kind of melody. (He made one album, after relentless encouragement from locals). Preben’s brother, Leif, upholds the tradition, occasionally playing at the restaurant. The church retains a strong presence: I see signs out for prayer meetings. “Don’t miss the old church on Öckerö,” Jennie had told me while we were kayaking. “As kids, we were terrified of it!”View image in fullscreenThe quayside in Öckerö.Photograph: DES/AlamyNext day, I meet local climber Andreas Lundqvist at Ersdalen, a vast boulder-strewn coastal area on Hönö. Andreas brings a crash mat and I turn myself inside out attempting routes that he breezes up without any apparent effort. The mix of the otherworldly seascape and Andreas’s storytelling about growing up on the islands and subsequent adventures makes the whole experience hugely enjoyable.Exploring the archipelago is made simple with theVästtrafikapp on your phone, so I catch the ferry out to the last, most northerly island, Rörö. The weather has turned from blue skies to thick mist, but this suits the sparse, mysterious splendour of a remote island. I squelch through bogs, scramble over lichen-crusted boulders and come across wild ponies.The ferry back connects promptly with a bus that takes me back across the islands. There is one more place I want to explore: the old church on Öckerö. Why did local kids such as Jennie grow up terrified of this place?Then I see the ceiling frescoes. The rear of the church roof is a painted hell. No wonder the island kids were terrifiedIt is a simple red-roofed Scandinavian church dating from the 1450s, but the door is locked and the windows too high to see anything. Determined to get inside, I ring around local contacts and get the number of the verger who agrees to come down. Ten minutes later, he arrives and unlocks, but does not enter. “Text me when you’re finished,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe interior of the 15th-century church on Öckerö, with its ‘scary’ ceiling frescoes.Photograph: Kevin RushbyIn the small vestibule there are some ancient stones and a sword. I step into the nave. There are 17th-century models of sailing ships in cases either side, and everything is as might be expected, with robust, precise woodwork. Then I see the ceiling frescoes. The rear of the church roof is a painted hell. No wonder the island kids were terrified: fire-breathing monsters and demons dance across the barrel-vaulted timbers, torturing sinners who are sinking into scarlet flames. But then a suspended sailing ship points the way to salvation, the colours lighten, and by the time I reach the altar, everyone is floating on clouds and blowing trumpets. I guess those are the ones who stayed away from Moonshine Bay. Painted in 1792, it is a tour de force.Eventually, I drag myself away, text the verger and, after just a couple of bus rides and a ferry, step down in Gothenburg. I’m still feeling a little dazed, as if I’ve been somewhere very far away indeed.The trip was provided by theGothenburg Tourist Boardand travel to Gothenburg byInterrail(a four-day in within one month adult passis £189).Skärgårdshotellethas doubles from £93.Jennie Walkertakes evening kayak tours from £63ppAndreas Lundqvistoffers bouldering adventures from £115.Boat tripswith Lasse from £20Explore more on these topicsGothenburg holidaysSweden holidaysScandinavia holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were three mates in our late teens, without a clear plan.After arriving on the ferry, we hopped on a train owned by a mining company and travelled through the wild and unpopulated Tasmanian west coast to Queenstown. It was all forest and mountains, and so utterly freezing we sat in our sleeping bags on the train to try to warm up.The kindness of strangers: I was hitchhiking with nowhere to sleep when a man gave me his bed for the nightRead moreThe economy in Queenstown at the time revolved around the copper mine. I remember the shock of travelling through hours of forest to then arrive at a place where the hills had been denuded of vegetation from the pollution generated by the mine. The gloomy mood wasn’t helped by the bone-chilling cold and constant drizzle.Our idea was to hitchhike from Queenstown to our next destination, so we walked to a stretch of road on the outskirts of town and took up our position in front of the neatly kept miners’ houses to look for a ride. For a couple of hours, we waited with barely any cars passing.Our youthful enthusiasm was starting to falter when a young boy came out of a neat cottage with a basket. He said his mum thought we might like something to eat and drink. In the basket was a Thermos of tea, mugs and a container with some cake and biscuits. It was a balm on that freezing cold day.We were chuffed that someone had the kindness to think of the three scruffy guys loitering out the front of their house. It showed me that most people are good and want to look out for their fellow man. Eventually the drizzle stopped and we got our ride, but I’ve never forgotten the kindness of that stranger.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Food styling: Lucy-Ruth Hathaway.Felicity Cloake's masterclassFoodHow to make mulligatawny – recipeHave you forgotten how good this spicy soup tastes? Here are nine easy steps to rediscovering the Indian-inspired winter warmerFelicity CloakeSun 1 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTShareIhave yet to see anyone eating mulligatawny in an Indian restaurant – perhaps unsurprisingly, given that it’s a product of the British occupation, and the very name has an off-putting Victorian feel, which is a shame, because it’s aged a lot better than imperialism. Based, historians think, on the Madrassi brothmolo tunny, it’s a lovely, gently spiced winter soup that’s well worth rediscovering.Prep15 minCook50 minServes4-61 onion1 carrot1 parsnip1 celery stick2 tbsp ghee, or oil (eg, coconut)4 garlic cloves1 knob fresh ginger½ tsp cayenne pepper or mild chilli powder2½ tsp madras curry powder(see step 5)1½ litres good-quality chicken stock, or vegetable stock1 chicken thigh, bone in. skin on (optional; see step 1)150g masoor dal(AKA split orange lentils)4 tbsp flaked almonds(optional; see step 7)100ml hot milk, or water1 tbsp lemon juiceSalt1-2 tbsp fruity chutney(eg, mango; optional)1 small bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped, to servePlain yoghurt, to serve1 A note on the meatView image in fullscreenThough often made with chicken, mulligatawny was also traditionally prepared with mutton or goat, and works well with lamb, too; any fairly tender cut of either will be fine (or, indeed, you could just add some cooked meat at the end). For a lighter dish, leave it out; to make it plant-based, just swap the fat and stock as suggested below.2 Prep the base vegetablesView image in fullscreenPeel and finely slice the onion. Trim and cut the carrot, parsnip and celery into fairly chunky dice, keeping them separate from the onion (there’s no need to peel the carrot and parsnip, unless they’re still filthy even after scrubbing). Note: the onions aside, the choice of vegetables is flexible, but do include at least one sweet thing – if not parsnips, try squash, swede or sweet potato.3 Sweat the onionView image in fullscreenPut the fat (I use ghee, but coconut oil or any other fairly neutral oil will do) in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Add the onion and fry, stirring occasionally, for about five minutes, until softened and beginning to turn golden. Meanwhile, crush the garlic and finely grate the ginger (no need to peel).4 Saute the other base vegAdd the carrot, parsnip and celery to the pan, and fry for another five or so minutes, until they’ve softened but still retain a little crunch. Scoop out a spoonful and set aside for now. Add the garlic and ginger to the pan, and cook, stirring constantly so they don’t colour, for a minute or so.View image in fullscreen5 Add the spicesSpoon in the cayenne pepper or mild chilli powder, and the curry powder, and stir for a minute. (Old-fashioned madras curry powder is still the best choice. If you don’t have it, recipes are available online, usually containing all or some of the following: coriander, turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, fennel, cloves and plenty of black pepper).6 Add the stock, chicken and dalView image in fullscreenPour in the stock – chicken is the most neutral option, but lamb or vegetable will do. Now add the chicken (preferably bone-in; this and the skin can come off later) or lamb, and the masoor dal. (Other varieties of dal can be substituted, but most pulses require longer cooking.)7 Simmer until cookedView image in fullscreenBring to a lively simmer, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer gently for 35 minutes, or until the dal is soft and the meat cooked through. While it’s cooking, soak the almonds in hot milk (plant-based is fine) or water. If you’d prefer to keep the soup nut-free, leave them out or substitute unsweetened coconut flakes.8 Blitz and flavour the soupLift the meat out of the pan. Blend the soup until smooth, then separately whizz the softened almonds and liquid to a puree and whisk into the soup; if it feels too thick, adjust the consistency with a little extra stock or water. Stir in the lemon juice and salt to taste, then add the chutney, likewise to taste, if you would prefer it to be sweeter.View image in fullscreen9 Finishing touchesPull the meat into strands, discarding any skin or bones, then stir the meat back into the soup along with the reserved sauteed vegetables. Divide between bowls and garnish with coriander. Mulligatawny is also rather nice topped with a dollop of plain yoghurt. This can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge, and also freezes well.Explore more on these topicsFoodFelicity Cloake's masterclassSoupWinter food and drinkVegetablesBritish food and drinkMeatChickenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The project has been tantalisingly dangled as an opening for some years, then delayed umpteen times, because, quite understandably, erecting a purpose-built, gargantuan, multi-floor Willy Wonka’s Booze Factory in the West End of London for a corporate behemoth is no easy feat. Imagine the layers of global, bureaucratic, cross-platform multi-media team Zooms that had to happen to hone the ultimate Guinness experience. So many Is to dot and Ts to cross, particularly, because food is a central part of the venture, with two restaurants on site –The Porter’s TableandGilroy’s Loft– where exec chef Pip Lacey is serving non-challenging yet hearty menus, as well as acourtyard pie stallbyCalum Franklin.View image in fullscreenSafe bet: the ‘soft, crusty, scone-like’ Guinness soda bread at Open Gate Brewery, London WC2.Eventually, last December, Open Gate Brewery finally flung open its doors. Or, more accurately, it opened its many, many sets of doors, because Open Gate is not one site, like Willy Wonka’s Factory or even Madame Tussauds, where you step inside and leave the real world behind. Instead, it is spread over several streets. A shop here, a restaurant there, a street stall over here, which makes the whole thing rather underwhelming.Aside from a twinkly cobbled area beside the gift shop, there’s nothing very photo-worthy for tourists to flood social media with. This is where my alarm bells went off. The London Guinness experience is decidedly subtle. Apparently, they brew small-batch ales here, so can call themselves a brewery, but I saw no real push to sell them. Certainly not in the Porter’s Table, which I’d imagined would be a dark, sleek, modern, Irish-feeling restaurant with a welcoming Guinness for every diner, and an aura that you were in the home of that hallowed pint. I’d imagined servers drilled to flog Guinness, making a fuss of the pour, and how it pairs with specific meats and cheeses. Perhaps Hothouse Flowers, the Cranberries and the Chieftains would be playing in the background as I ate Guinness soda bread surrounded by chipper Irish-American tourists who adore their ancestry.View image in fullscreen‘Would have been dry without Guinness-peppercorn sauces and fermented chilli’: Guinness Open Gate Brewery’s platter of chicken, ribeye and triple potato Guinness and mushroom pie.The Guinness team have in fact spent millions making a restaurant that feels more like a Google HQ staff room with scarcely a mention of Guinness. No branded colours, no menu pairings, no concerted effort to sell you a pint. Maybe Guinness is so cool now – what with the TV drama and non-stop TikTok kids bleating on aboutsplitting the G– that its marketing agency thought the most powerful thing to do would be to quash anything as cheesy as serving the stuff.Be warned, however, if you do get stuck in on the pints in this ground-floor Guinness restaurant and need to spend a penny, the loos are on the fifth floor, and reachable only by lift. Guinness, let the record show, cannot organise a piss-up in a brewery.We ordered Guinness soda bread, which was served in some sort of weird iron safe. God knows why. It tasted wonderful: soft, crusty, scone-like. A round of “lyrical lager beer frickles” were pleasant enough, and a Porter’s beer melt withPaxton & Whitfield cheeseon brioche was essentially a McDonald’s cheeseburger made with toast. The patty was ungenerous, albeit nicely seasoned.View image in fullscreen‘Little more than some sponge’: Guinness Open Gate Brewery’s The Three Stouts dessert.Some ribeye – a scant 200g, served medium rare – and a half-chicken were good, if unmemorable, and would have been dry without Guinness-peppercorn sauces and fermented chilli, which cost an extra £4.50 for small pots. A Guinness-themed dessert called The Three Stouts was little more than some sponge with a bit of cream and chocolate caramel atop. Absolute “will-this-do?” nonsense.This was a puzzling experience. Why does this restaurant need a huge, noisy open kitchen to serve chicken and chips? How can the very respectedDevonshire pub, a short walk away in Piccadilly, be doing more for the image of Guinness than a hundred executives on six-figure wages organising this extravaganza? How did they create a gift shop with literally nothing worth buying, and in two short hours make me love the brandless? If you’re a tourist in London, go to Madame Tussauds instead.Guinness Open Gate Brewery, 28 Shelton Street, London WC2 (no phone). Open all week, Mon-Thurs 11am-11.30pm, Fri & Sat 11am-midnight, Sun noon-10.30pm.
