And it originated from a longtime friend of the president who would go on to acquire business interests in the Danish territory.The businessman, Bolton learned, was Ronald Lauder. Heir to a makeup fortune – the global cosmetics brand Estée Lauder – he had known Trump, a fellow wealthy New Yorker, for more than 60 years.Bolton said he discussed theGreenland propositionwith Lauder. After the billionaire’s intervention, a White House team began to explore ways to increase US sway in the vast Arctic territory controlled by Denmark.Trump’s renewed pursuit of Lauder’s idea during his second term is typical of how the president operates, Bolton said. “Bits of information that he hears from friends, he takes them as truth and you can’t shake his opinion.”The proposal seems to have stirred Trump’s imperialist ambitions: eight years on, he is mulling not just buyingGreenlandbut perhaps taking it by force.Like many of those around the president, Lauder’s policy suggestions appear to intersect with his business interests. As Trump has ratcheted up his threats to seize Greenland, Lauder has acquired commercial holdings there. Lauder is also part of the consortium whose desire to access Ukrainian minerals appears to have spurred Trump to demand a share of the war-torn country’s resources.Lauder has said he met Trump in the 1960s when they went to the same prestigious business school. After working for the family cosmetics business, Lauder served under Ronald Reagan at the Pentagon, then as ambassador to Austria, before running unsuccessfully for mayor of New York in 1989.Quick GuideContact Tom Burgis about this storyShowIf you have something to share on this subject you can contact Tom  using one of the following methods.Email (not secure)If you don't need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email  tom.burgis@theguardian.com.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

When Trump’s sanity was questioned in 2018, Lauder called him “a man of incredible insight and intelligence”.That same year, Laudersaid he was assistingTrump with “some of the most complex diplomatic challenges imaginable”. This seems to have included sowing the idea of Arctic expansion. The following year, the Wall Street JournalrevealedTrump’s interest in Greenland. Denmark’s rulers expressed outrage. Trump responded by tweeting animageof a golden Trump Tower looming over a village, beside the caption: “I promise not to do this to Greenland!”I promise not to do this to Greenland!pic.twitter.com/03DdyVU6HA— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)August 20, 2019‘A treasure trove of rare-earth elements’View image in fullscreen‘Trump’s Greenland concept was never absurd – it was strategic,’ Lauder wrote.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesTrump’s fixation with Greenland endured, as did Lauder’s. Last February, shortly after Trump returned to the White House, Lauder leapt to his defence when the president publicly contemplated a military takeover of the world’s largest island.“Trump’s Greenland concept was never absurd – it was strategic,” Lauderwrotein the New York Post. He went on: “Beneath its ice and rock lies a treasure trove of rare-earth elements essential for AI, advanced weaponry and modern technology. As ice recedes, new maritime routes are emerging, reshaping global trade and security.”With Greenland at “the epicentre of great-power competition”, Lauder argued, the US should seek a “strategic partnership”. He added: “I have worked closely with Greenland’s business and government leaders for years to develop strategic investments there.”Since Lauder steered Trump’s attention to Greenland in 2018, as firstreportedby the US journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser in their book The Divider, the cosmetics billionaire seems to have ploughed lots of his own money into the Arctic territory.Danish corporate records show that a company with a New York address and unnamed owners has in recent months bought into Greenland.One of its ventures is exporting “luxury” springwater from an island in Baffin Bay. When aDanish newspaperreported in December that Lauder was among the investors, it quoted a Greenlandic businessman involved in the endeavour. “Lauder and his colleagues in the investor group have a very good understanding of and access to the luxury market,” he said.This group of investors is also reportedly seeking to generate hydroelectric power from Greenland’s biggest lake for an aluminium smelter.It is unclear what effect a US takeover of Greenland – by invasion, purchase or persuasion – might have on Lauder’s commercial interests there.Following Trump’s comments – in the aftermath of sending troops to capture the ruler of Venezuela – that the US needed Greenland “very badly”, Denmark’s prime ministerwarnedthat military action by one Nato member against another would break the alliance.Trump appears unmoved. “We’re going to be doing something with Greenland,” he said last week, “either the nice way or the more difficult way.” After a White House meeting on Wednesday, the Danish foreign minster, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said: “We didn’t manage to change the American position. It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering Greenland.”A deal to exploit Ukraine’s mineralsView image in fullscreenDonald Trump in a heated exchange with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February 2025.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockLauder’s apparent involvement in shaping US policy adds to mounting questions about conflicts of interest during Trump’s second term and the apparent self-enrichment of those close to the president. Trump’s two elder sons, Don Jr and Eric, have been on a globalmoneymaking campaignfrom Vietnam toGibraltar.They insist there is a “huge wall” between their business activities and their father’s position as the most powerful man alive. Trump’s spokesperson has said: “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.” But foreign rulers have facilitated the enrichment of the first family, while sometimes seemingly securing the president’s favour.Lauder, though, appeared for a time to havebrokenwith his old friend.In 2022, while he was out of office, Trump hosted the far-right agitator Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago club. Lauder, who heads the World Jewish Congress, joined the condemnation. “Nick Fuentes is a virulent antisemite and Holocaust denier plain and simple,” hesaid. “It is inconceivable that anyone would associate with him.”But once Trump regained the White House, Lauder resumed financial support. In March 2025 he gave $5m to Maga Inc, afundraising operationfor Trump’s movement. The following month, Lauder was reportedly among the guests at an exclusivecandlelit dinnerwith the president. Tickets were $1m each, payable to Maga Inc.By then, Lauder’s business interests once again appeared to be overlapping withTrump administrationpolicy.A leaked November 2023lettersent by the head of TechMet, a mining company, to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, named Lauder as part of a consortium hoping to exploit a lithium deposit in the war-torn country.Lauder said at the time that he had not discussed Ukrainian minerals with Trump himself but had “raised the issue with stakeholders in the US andUkrainefor many years up to the present day”. Leading Republicans joined a campaign for the US to gain a hold on Ukraine’s prodigious resources. Trump became its loudest proponent.Weeks after Lauder’s Maga Inc donations, Washington and Kyiv signed a deal to jointly exploit Ukraine’s minerals. It went some way to preserving Trump’s support for Ukraine following his televised Oval Office tirade against Zelenskyy for what he deemed insufficient gratitude for US backing.The lithium deposit was the first to be tendered under the minerals deal. This month, the Lauder consortium reportedlywon it. TechMet, the company leading the consortium, declined to comment, as did Lauder. His Greenland business partners and the White House did not respond when contacted by the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsGreenlandUS foreign policyUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Addiction is a tricky business. What starts as fun inevitably, insidiously, tears away the soul. And there are signs that Nigel Farage’s press conference habit is getting out of control. He started off at one a week. Then his narcissistic need craved more and more attention. So he upped it to two or three a week. Each time the buzz got less. He was mainlining more and more just to try to stand still. To keep the withdrawals at bay. Still not enough. So on Thursday, Nige upped the dose to two inside a day. This can only end in a spell in rehab. Followed by meetings of PA. Pressers Anonymous.Boom. The best laid plans etc. Nige was just six minutes into his first press conference of the day – the unveiling of the latest Tory defector, the meg-rich Malcolm Offord, whose lifetime achievements amount to buying yachts, as the leader of Reform Scotland – when it all kicked off. Malc had just signed a card renouncing his peerage, when every journalist in the room started looking at their phones. There was breaking news. Kemi Badenoch had announced she was sackingRobert Jenrickfrom the shadow cabinet and the Tory party.Here was a story of our times. One that had it all. Treachery and stupidity. The Tory party at its very best. Kemi’s message was simple. “I never loved you anyway. I’m dumping you before you get the chance to dump me. So there.”She had irrefutable evidence that Honest Bob was planning to imminently defect in a way that would cause maximum damage to theConservatives. Well, hello, Kemi. What kept you so long? It was an open secret Jenrick had been on defection watch for months. The man who believed in nothing except his own dishonourable career – never forget Bob began life on the liberal wing of the Tory party before selling what passed for his soul to the populist right – had made no secret he had been in talks with Nige.The tipping point for Kemi turned out to be his resignation speech, which had apparently been found face up on his desk and handed over to Tory HQ. Imagine being so quarter-witted you leave evidence of your treachery in plain sight. Even when you know you are under suspicion. But then Honest Bob has always been one to keep his dealings in plain sight. As a junior housing minister, he had been happy to wave through a planning permission that saved the erstwhile Tory donor and pornographer turned property developer Richard Desmond £50m.That was effectively the end of Nige’s first press conference as planned. Poor old Malc. Yet again relegated to a walk-on part in his own life story. He would go as he had come. Largely forgotten. Instead of questions about the May elections, all anyone really wanted to know was whether Farage and Jenrick had made a deal. Was that the announcement Nige had intended to make at the later presser? If so, how had the deal been made? What promises had been made?It’s not often that Farage looks wrongfooted. He is a grifter who is used to winging it. But even he seemed rather taken aback. No, he hadn’t been planning to unveil Honest Bob in London later that day. The news had come as much of a shock to him as it had to everyone else. Yes, of course he had been having talks with him,but he’d been having talks with lots of Tories. But he always kept his conversations confidential. Up until the point when he chose to share them with a few friendly journalists.Soon, though, Nige could see the upside. The Tory party in complete disarray. Again. Where Honest Bob took the lead, other sheep may follow. Plus there was an upside to Jenrick’s sacking. Bob would have far fewer bargaining chips in the defection negotiations. Perhaps Nige wouldn’t have to offer him the job as chancellor after all. Time to sound as if he was playing hardball. “We don’t take every disaffected Tory,” he sniffed. Really? You tookZahawi. And any other number of deadbeats. Just imagine how useless you would need to be to get rejected. Take a bow, Liz Truss.An expulsion, a smirking leader and now a defection: it’s episode one, series one of the Farage/Jenrick show | Zoe WilliamsRead moreCue later that afternoon. The second press conference on the cancellation of local elections to be replaced by a third. Nige was in dreamland. Rushing on his run. The cold turkey tomorrow could look after itself. “Thank you, thank you Kemi,” he gushed. Before this morning he had been nowhere near to securing a deal with the man whom he had described less than five months ago as a liar and a fraud. But he has never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Honest Bob had been signed on a free transfer.It took Jenrick more than a minute to find his way into the room. Maybe he was having last-minute second thoughts. Or maybe he still hasn’t quite learned how to open a door. With a bit of assistance from his carer, Honest Bob made his way to the podium to give the speech that only he and the entire shadow cabinet had previously seen. One in which he would discover new lows even for him. Words as vomit.“Britain is horrible,” he said. Everything was as bad as it could be. It took him a while to realise that he had actually been part of the Tory government that had broken the country. This wasn’t about him. Gushing fake sincerity. It was about his patriotic duty. It turned out that what was in the national interest was also in Honest Bob’s self-interest. Uncanny that.A touch of self-laceration. Though not too much. Jenrick was more sinned against than sinner. He was ashamed of himself. Good. We’re all ashamed of you, too. There should never be another minister quite as bad as me, he continued. And that’s why he had to join Reform. To resist the temptation of being quite so hopeless as before. To save us all. He didn’t want to badmouth his former colleagues. But Mel Stride, Priti Patel and Kemi … Give him a break.Honest Bob fell to the floor. “I love you, I love you Nige,” he sobbed, clutching Farage by the leg. Nige patted him on the head affectionately. “The best people are often failures,” Farage observed kindly. It had been that kind of day. A meeting of two untrustworthy minds. Both with an eye on the main chance. Nige has got to keep feeding that habit.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickThe politics sketchReform UKConservativesNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

Maze featuring Frankie Beverly – Live in New Orleans (1981)Already stars in Black America, Maze became the ultimate if-you-know-you-know band among British fans of underground soul thanks to Live in New Orleans. It perfectly encapsulated their appeal: smooth but not slick, an awesomely tight band making breezily relaxed music, one fantastic song after another.29. Hawkwind – Space Ritual (1973)Live albums can often seem like an afterthought, a nice addendum rather than a pivotal part of a band’s career. But Space Ritual is the best way to experience Hawkwind’s unique melding of psych, proto-punk, electronics, motorik krautrock-like repetition: advertised with the fabulous line “88 minutes of brain damage”, it’s immersive, hypnotic and awesome.28. Portishead – Roseland NYC Live (1998)Capturing a one-off gig featuring Portishead’s standard decks/synth/guitar lineup supported by strings, woodwind and brass, Roseland NYC Live is magical. Rather than clutter their eerie sound, the orchestra augments it, the perfect setting for Beth Gibbons’ voice: the dramatic climax of Mysterons is worth the price of entry alone.27. Laura Nyro – Laura: Live at the Bottom Line (1989)Recorded years after her commercial peak, Live at the Bottom Line nevertheless offers a perfect summation of what made Laura Nyro special: it feels intimate and supple, ranging across her career and musical styles from soul to gospel to jazz. Her voice sounds amazing; whether classic or previously unreleased, the song quality never dips.26. Grateful Dead – Europe ’72 (1972)They didn’t invent the term cosmic American music, but no artists embodied it like theGrateful Deadin 1972, their sound split between freeform exploration, earthy blues and country-rock. Stuffed with incredible, hitherto unleased songs – He’s Gone, Brown-Eyed Women, Ramble on Rose – the triple Europe ’72 might be their greatest album full stop.View image in fullscreenCosmic … Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead in London, 1972.Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty Images25. Otis Redding – Live at the Whisky a Go-Go: The Complete Recordings (2016)Six CDs may seemde tropbut this is still the best way to hear Otis Redding live. Deposited in a rock venue in an attempt to snag a white audience, he didn’t change his soul circuit approach but worked hard to win them over, with electrifying results.24. Iggy and the Stooges – Metallic KO (1976)Metallic KO is a mess: a low-quality recording of the Stooges on their last legs – frequently out of tune and time – before a crowd so hostile you can literally hear hurled bottles smashing on stage. But as a piece of rock mythology, an account of screw-you defiance in the face of disaster, it’s utterly gripping.23. Sylvester – Living Proof (1979)Disco was not a genre that produced many great live albums, but then Sylvester wasn’t just any disco artist: his joyous performance at San Francisco’s War Memorial Opera House hurtles from You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) to versions of Billie Holiday’s Lover Man and the Beatles’ Blackbird, his voice incredible throughout.View image in fullscreenNot just any disco artist … Sylvester performing with backing singers Martha Wash and Izora Rhodes-Armstead.Photograph: Max Redfern/Redferns22. Talking Heads – Stop Making Sense (1984)The visuals are what everyone remembers from the movie of Stop Making Sense: the big suit, the boombox. The album obviously strips them away, but what’s left is still remarkable: the vast majority of the songs here smoke their studio incarnations, variously sounding more urgent, more joyful, more writhingly funky.21. Iron Maiden – Live After Death (1985)Hailed in some quarters as the greatest live metal album full stop, Live After Death offers the sound of Maiden cresting their mid-80s imperial phase: everything you might conceivably want from a Maiden set of the era performed by a band firing on all cylinders, with Bruce Dickinson in full-on ringmaster mode.20. Beyoncé – Homecoming: The Live Album (2019)The live album feels like a dying art in the 21st century, but this sparkling recording of Beyoncé’s marching band-assisted Coachella performance carries a genuine sense of event and risk: it isn’t like anything else in her catalogue.View image in fullscreenSparkling … Beyoncé at Coachella.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Coachella19. Sam Cooke – Live at the Harlem Square Club (1985)There’s something very telling about the fact that Cooke’s label refused to release this 1963 recording at the time: it’s fast-paced, raw and incredibly intense, none of which fitted with the smooth pop image they were trying to project of the singer – all of which make it such an electrifying listen today.18. Depeche Mode – 101 (1989)A perfect snapshot of the pointDepeche Modeascended from synth-pop hitmakers to US stadium-filling alternative superstars, 101 also underlines why it happened: subtly tweaked and rearranged, these familiar songs hit harder in their live incarnations. Dave Gahan sounds imperious, as if he always expected to end up playing in front of 60,000 people.17. Curtis Mayfield – Curtis/Live! (1971)Mayfield was at a peak when he taped Curtis/Live! in New York. You can tell: it flits effortlessly between Impressions classics and fresh solo material, the gentle optimism of People Get Ready and the tough fatalism of If There’s a Hell Below We’re All Gonna Go, the aching I Plan to Stay a Believer and the supremely funky Check Out Your Mind.16. Johnny Cash – At San Quentin (1969)It could easily have been 1968’s At Folsom Prison, but San Quentin has, well, San Quentin, which the inmates compel Cash to play twice. The tumult the second performance occasions should be impossible to top, but Cash does it, thanks to another ace in his pocket, the live debut of A Boy Named Sue.View image in fullscreenTumultuous … Johnny Cash at San Quentin.Photograph: ITV/Rex Features15. Elton John – 17-11-70 (1971)Recorded weeks after his career-kickstarting gig at LA’s Troubadour Club and an education for anyone who only knows the hits, 17-11-70 offers the purest expression of his original vision for theElton JohnBand, “a power trio with a piano” big on extended improvisation – even the ballads rock surprisingly hard.14. Donny Hathaway – Live (1972)A rule of thumb is that a great live album should sound substantively different from the artist’s studio work. That’s true here: Hathaway’s voice is as exquisite as ever, but his band sounds jazzier, looser, more given to jamming. The audience appear to be going bananas throughout: who can blame them?13. Thin Lizzy – Live and Dangerous (1978)You could argue that Live and Dangerous isn’t really a live album – producer Tony Visconti claimed that 75% of it was re-recorded – but you’d have a far harder time arguing against its quality: it captures Thin Lizzy at their pre-heroin peak, far punchier and more potent than even their best studio album.View image in fullscreenPunchy and potent … Phil Lynott performs with Thin Lizzy.Photograph: Fin Costello/Redferns12. Motörhead – No Sleep ’til Hammersmith (1981)The suggestion Motörhead achieved everything they were put on Earth to achieve with No Sleep ’til Hammersmith irked Lemmy deeply, but it’s understandable: it’s nasty, speedy, brutish, gruff and utterly relentless, grabbing the listener by the neck from the moment Ace of Spades kicks into life and declining to let go for the next 40 minutes.11. Joni Mitchell – Miles of Aisles (1974)Miles of Aisles captured Mitchell at a moment of flux: at the height of her fame, but about to push her music in more expansive, less commercial directions. It’s a process that might have begun at these shows, as she radically rearranges songs from her earlier career in the company of a flatly incredible band.View image in fullscreenMoment of flux … Joni Mitchell at the Berkeley Community Center, 1974.Photograph: Larry Hulst/Getty Images10. Bill Withers – Live at Carnegie Hall (1973)For a man who was still working in a factory 18 months before this album was recorded,Bill Witherssounds fabulously relaxed and loquacious on stage at New York’s Carnegie Hall: that he’d amassed a set of songs as incredible as the 14 here doubtless helped. It’s all wonderful, but the climax of Harlem/Cold Baloney is something else.9. Bob Marley and the Wailers – Live! (1975)Live albums can be a poor substitute for attending a gig, but Live! was taped in such a way that you feel you’re actually in the crowd. The Wailers’ performance is obviously amazing, but the way the recording captures the audience and the atmosphere is almost equally so. And the unedited deluxe edition is the way to go.8. Nina Simone – ’Nuff Said! (1968)Nina Simone’s discography is packed with incredible live albums – from 1959’s At Town Hall to 1976’s fraught Live at Montreux – but none have quite the emotional charge of Nuff Said’s recordings from Westbury Music fair, three days after Martin Luther King’s assassination: a performance that alternately mourns and blazes with fury.View image in fullscreenIncredible … Nina Simone performs at Newport jazz festival, July 1968.Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns7. The Who – Live at Leeds (1970)Tommy had sent their career stratospheric but – as ever with the Who – caused turmoil: the album was treated like high art, a reception that ignored the band’s brutal, incendiary side. Live at Leeds was the solution, offering raw live recordings with no songs from Tommy. This was rock music as visceral and explosive as you could wish.6. Van Morrison – It’s Too Late to Stop Now Vol 1 (1974)Latterly, Van Morrison’s reputation as a live performer has often centred on his irascible attitude. It was not ever thus: the performances here are fluid, extraordinary things, the songs bent and shaped in the moment to sensational effect. Furthermore, it’s evidence for the claim that he’s the greatest white R&B singer of all.5. Aretha Franklin – Amazing Grace (1972)If you want secular live Aretha, 1971’s Live at Fillmore West should be your first stop. But for emotional heft and astonishing vocal power, her gospel performance on Amazing Grace – recorded in her father’s LA church – is absolutely unbeatable, regardless of your faith or lack thereof.View image in fullscreenAstonishing … Aretha Franklin performing Amazing Grace.Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy4. The Jimi Hendrix Experience – Live at Monterey (2007)There’s stiff competition for the title of the best live Jimi Hendrix album – not least from 1970’s Band of Gypsys – but Monterey just squeaks it, thanks to the almost tangible crackle of excitement about the show that introduced Hendrix to America, not to mention the chaos about the band’s feedback-laden performance.3. Bob Dylan – The Bootleg Series Vol 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The ‘Royal Albert Hall’ Concert (1998)Bob Dylan’s Manchester Free Trade Hall show (initially wrongly credited on bootleg recordings as the Royal Albert Hall) may well be the most famous gig in rock history. The story is incredibly familiar (“Judas!”) but what’s amazing is how tensely gripping the recording is, even when you know what’s going to happen. NB: on Spotify, it doesn’t happen, because – wait for it – all the between-song chat has beenedited out.2. James Brown – Live at the Apollo (1963)All three of Brown’s Live at the Apollo albums are essential, but the first volume clinches the prize: it’s atmospheric, electrifying, and it captures classic chitlin’ circuit soul, simultaneously raw and incredibly tight. The screams and cries from the audience that strafe its eight tracks only add to the experience.1. Jerry Lee Lewis – Live at the Star Club, Hamburg (1964)Live at the Star Club is a badly mixed recording ofJerry Lee Lewison his uppers in every sense: his career has flatlined and his performance sounds like a 40-minute advert for the alarmingly invigorating properties of amphetamines. Songs start at an astonishing pace and frequentlyspeed up; his backing band, Britain’s Nashville Teens, just about cling on by the skin of their teeth. It should be a disaster. Instead, it’s almost indecently exciting, capturing the feral essence of rock’n’roll like nothing else. “It’s not an album,” gawped Rolling Stone’s review, “it’s a crime scene.” They had a point.Explore more on these topicsMusicRankedJerry Lee LewisJames BrownBob DylanAretha FranklinVan MorrisonThe WhofeaturesShareReuse this content"

He discusses Buddhism, partisan politics and the terrifying flight that changed his lifeThu 15 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 10.55 ESTShareLike his first novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, which won the Booker prize in 2017, George Saunders’s new novel is a ghost story. In Vigil, an oil tycoon who spent a lifetime covering up the scientific evidence for climate change is visited on his deathbed by a host of spirits, who force him to grapple with his legacy. What draws Saunders to ghost stories? “If I had us talking here in a story and I allowed a ghost in from the 1940s, I might be more interested in it. It might be because they are in fact here,” he says, gesturing to the hotel lobby around us. “Or even if it’s not ghosts, we both have memories of people we love who have passed. They are here, in a neurologically very active way.” A ghost story can feel more “truthful”, he adds: “If you were really trying to tell the truth about this moment, would you so confidently narrow it to just today?”Ghosts also invite us to confront our mortality and, in so doing, force a new perspective on life: what remains once you strip away the meaningless, day-to-day distractions in which we tend to lose ourselves? “Death, to me, has always been a hot topic,” Saunders says. “It’s so unbelievable that it will happen to us, too. And I suppose as you get older it becomes more …” he puts on a goofy voice: “interesting”. He is 67, grizzled and avuncular, surprisingly softly spoken for a writer who talks so loudly – and with such freewheeling, wisecracking energy – on the page. He says death is close to becoming a “preoccupation” for him and he worries that he is not prepared for it.About 25 years ago, Saunders was on a passenger plane that was hit by geese shortly after taking off from Chicago. There was a loud bang, the plane began making terrible noises, black smoke filled the cabin, people screamed, the lights of the city appeared to approach very fast, and Saunders believed he was going to die. At the time he was “at peak spirituality”, a Tibetan Buddhist who meditated for three hours a day, and yet he experienced pure terror. “It was like all the elements of my identity got rolled back. I wasn’t thinking about writing. I wasn’t even able to think about my family, there was just some primal self that was about to be lost,” he recalls.“And then this funny, I don’t know …” he trails off for a moment, apparently unsure if funny is the right word, before telling me that the teenage boy next to him asked: “Sir, is this supposed to be happening?” and he, his fatherly instinct kicking in, replied with bravado: “Yes, of course”. Itisa funny story – Saunders puts on voices to tell it – and he deploys it the way he uses humour in his fiction, to temper the earnestness and moral seriousness of what he is trying to convey.The plane landed safely in Chicago, and for about a week after, Saunders felt euphoric. Buddhists believe that a true awareness of one’s own mortality enables a person to fully embrace the wonder of being alive. “It’s almost like if you were invited to a really wonderful party and it was going to end at 11.30 and they let you know that – it would change the quality, as opposed to: this is a six-day party, or an infinite party,” he says. He has had “flare-ups” of that feeling since, and he chases it in his writing.If you’d seen the stuff I was writing at 25, you’d never think that person would be published. You’d feel sorry for themSaunders won a MacArthur genius grant in 2006 and is perhaps best known for his short stories. He has published five collections and a couple of novellas, which are dark and satirical, often set in fantastical, dystopian worlds – strange theme parks or malls or futuristic prisons – that present American society through a fun-house mirror, its most grotesque and absurd and spirit-crushing features magnified. They are compassionate stories, told by a man whose advice to students – a 2013 commencement speech on regretting “failures of kindness”, a mid-pandemic letter on the importance of bearing witness – often seems to go viral, and who sees writing as a “sacramental act”. He holds the impassioned, optimistic belief that literature can make us better people, because it requires that both the writer and reader transcend themselves and their coarser instincts, and exercise their capacity for reflection and empathy. Just as when he meditates he might practise a visualisation to generate compassion – one involves imagining someone you love dearly being washed away down a river, and as that feeling of wanting to help wells up you try to expand the feeling outward, to all people – he has found the act of writing enables him to expand his empathy outwards. It pushes him to what he describes as “a certain view of things in which everyone is just me on a different day, or a different life”.View image in fullscreenThe ghosts in Lincoln in the Bardo and Vigil can practise empathy in the most direct, literal way, by stepping into each other’s minds. Vigil is told from the perspective of Jill Blaine, the ghost of a sweet-natured, 22-year-old newlywed who was killed in a car bomb explosion and then entered the mind of her killer. Her moral purpose is to comfort the dying, and she calls her guiding philosophy “elevation”, the view that our lives, all our failures and our triumphs, were inevitable, shaped by forces beyond our control. “Who else could you have been but exactly who you are?” she asks KJ Boone, the oil tycoon. “All your life you believed yourself to be making choices, but what looked like choices were so severely delimited in advance by the mind, body, and disposition thrust upon you that the whole game amounted to a sort of lavishjailing.” Is she right? Saunders says he hasn’t decided, and believes good fiction should aim to ask the right questions, rather than provide answers. “My job is to be the rollercoaster designer and try to set the elements up so it produces the maximum amount of ‘wow’… My feeling is always to err on the side of ‘what makes sparks fly’, and then the meaning is kind of secondary.”But Saunders does remember being six or seven years old and thinking, when someone told him “oh, you’re such a good boy”, that “I didn’t choose any of those things, that’s just the way I am”. He recalls when he was younger still, three or four, knocking over a coffee pot and scalding his sister, and later worrying about whether he had done it on purpose. He’s always been “neurotic” and “OCD” (although not officially diagnosed), and refers to these looping, self-interrogating thoughts as his “monkey mind”. Writing is a “mental health thing” for him. It quietens the monkey mind.He grew up in Oak Forest, south Chicago, where his father worked for a coal company and later owned and ran a fried-chicken franchise called Chicken Unlimited. He was an “errant” reader, who read the books his father left for him before he went to work, an eclectic mix that included Machiavelli’s The Prince and The Other America, an exposé of American poverty by the socialist writer Michael Harrington. He got into Colorado School of Mines to study geophysical engineering and read in his spare time, but had “no taste”. “Ayn Rand was the only novelist I really liked for a while and I didn’t detect anything false in it. Because I was so young I thought: ‘Well, that’s how it is,’” he says.After college he worked with an oil exploration crew in Sumatra, and wrote fiction in his spare time, trying to emulate Hemingway. “If you had seen the stuff I was writing at 25, you would never think that person would be published. You would feel sorry for them,” he says. He was, in his telling, redeemed by an unearned arrogance. “I think this is true and it is even a compositional principle: if you say ‘I’m going to do this’, and then you don’t allow yourself to be rebuffed by the things that should rebuff you, then eventually the problem heals,” he says.View image in fullscreenGeorge Saunders in New York.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianA few years after returning from Asia, when he was living a “nicely out-of-control life” in Texas, he wrote a story unlike anything he’d written before, inspired by a dream he’d had about a theme park without any gravity. A Lack of Order in the Floating Object Room was published by the Northwest Review, and it helped him win a funded MFA at Syracuse University in upstate New York. He spent his first weeks in Syracuse sleeping in a truck.There, he met a novelist named Paula Redick, and he fell in love so quickly and completely that in three weeks they were engaged and less than a year later they were married. They have two daughters, now grown, and live together in LA with their 13-year-old dog, Guin. “It’s such a nice life,” he says, with real feeling. He and Paula write in their separate offices and meet up for lunch, they walk the dog, they are each other’s first readers – although she is a better one than he is. He knows that if a story doesn’t produce a strong emotional reaction in her, it’s not ready. They push each other to produce work with spiritual weight. “It’s not enough to be clever or sarcastic, we want there to be that undercurrent of something deeper,” he says.How did he know so quickly that she was the one? “The word that comes to mind is undeniable: I cannot not get on that boat,” he says. She was “very deep”. Both had been raised in religious families – he was a “really rabid Catholic kid”, she was from a “kind of fundamentalist” family – and they remained very “spiritual”. “We have that at our core: like, are we at all moving towards being better people and more ready for the end?” Plus, Paula was “so beautiful”, he adds. Zadie Smith once joked to him that, in old photos, George – very blonde and hirsute, with a mullet and a moustache – looks as if he is abducting Paula.Paula got pregnant and went into labour at four months, forcing her to go on bedrest to save the baby, and Saunders completed his degree by correspondence. His thesis was “crap”, he says, because he laboured under the misconception that he needed to produce Serious Literature, and reverted to writing lifeless, derivative prose. On graduating, he got a job as a tech writer. He noodled about on boring work calls, composing scatological poems accompanied by little doodles, and it cheered him that they made Paula laugh. Eventually, he began writing short stories again. This time, he made them funny. In 1996 he published his first short story collection, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline. A year later, he began teaching at Syracuse, where he remains a creative writing professor. “I often think at that level the difference between very, very good writing and great writing has to do with letting something into the mix that you’ve been holding back for complicated reasons.” For him, it was humour.Saunders is an enthusiastic teacher. Since 2021 he has been running his Story Club Substack, which he posts bi-weekly, to discuss craft. “I thought I’d do it for a year, and then it turned out to be so much fun,” he says. It now has more than 315,000 subscribers and about 30,000 paying ones. “There’s something really non-internet-y about the comments. People are so smart and generous,” he says, which he finds a “consolation”, a corrective to the political climate. Sometimes he finds himself wondering: “how does this impulse to kindness coexist with, say, ICE raids?”My nature is to be a peacemaker – but I don’t want to be a peacemaker for Trump’s regimeI had run into Saunders on the stairwell on the way to the interview, and somehow by the time we reached the second floor landing we were discussing our shared fears over Trump’s authoritarianism. “I keep thinking, ‘well, the people won’t tolerate this’, but people are tolerating it,” he says now. Mostly he feels “yucky” when talking about such things, however. “The person I am at a family party arguing politics is not so interesting, just another old dude with opinions,” he says, aware that many of his views are “robotic”, a product of his media diet. When writing fiction, he’s a different creature politically, one forced to consider multiple perspectives. “That person, through working every day, can become a slightly more interesting person, and that person is a little slower to judge, a little more confused, a little quieter,” he says. “That in itself made me think I don’t have to be so despairing about, say, the partisan political war, because we’re all just trapped in that lower mode. There is this possibility, however remote, that we could for brief periods ascend out into the other mind – and then it’s actually not so terrifying. Now, the problem is scale. I mean, if just one person does it, we’re still fucked.”He began writing Vigil because he was curious about whether the people who devoted decades to covering up climate change had regrets now, “given the weather”. The challenge – and he sees it as a moral one – is to “see if you can imagine how this action, which to you seems so bad, can to that person seem good”, he says. It’s partly a question of technical skill. “There’s a facile way to do it and a complex way to do it, and you can only find that out in the lines themselves,” he says. “If you don’t do it right, it leads to a facile kind of sympathy, that kind of liberal thing where someone drives a spike through your head and you say ‘thank you for the coat rack’.” In other words, he didn’t want to present KJ Boone in a sympathetic light or suggest his actions were right – but he did want to make him understandable, recognisably human and complex, the qualities we often struggle to recognise in our adversaries in the heat of a political argument.Saunders is still pondering how, given his platform, he should talk about politics when he goes on tour with Vigil in February. “To preach to the converted in the familiar terms in which they’re preached to feels a little too good, like it’s too much sugar. Whereas my nature is to be a little more of a peacemaker. But that’s dangerous right now because I don’t want to be a peacemaker for this regime,” he says.For now, he has a few months of quiet, walking the dog, pondering potential new writing projects. “The one thing I’m doubling down on is: just keep making fictive worlds. Improve the quality of your thought, improve the quality of your compassion, by that sacramental exercise, then whatever you have to do you’ll be better equipped,” he says. And then, inevitably, he adds the joke: “also start weightlifting, build a machine-gun turret …”Vigil by George Saunders will be published by Bloomsbury on 27 January.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

And for large portions ofArsenal’s 3-2 win at Chelseain the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday, it certainly was not. But for Mikel Arteta and his players there was a beauty in the physicality, the remorseless levels of aggression.Arsenal won because of what they did without the ball. Yes, there were nice moments from them in possession, most obviously Martín Zubimendi’s goal for 3-1. His gliding run from right to left inside the penalty area, especially the fake-to-shoot move that removed the Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana from the equation, the composure amid the maelstrom, before the execution, was jaw-dropping.Sánchez nightmare suggests Rosenior will soon have to show his ruthless side | Jacob SteinbergRead moreYet the biggest takeaway was that maelstrom, the sense that Arsenal had expected a scrap and refused to countenance anything other than winning it. There was a chest-out power from them, evident in the duels but more than that, in the battle to close the spaces, to mass men around any opposition player who got on the ball.When Chelsea, bravely, tried to play out from the back, each pass felt fraught in the face of the pressure; they had to be perfect to avoid dangerous turnovers. In fairness, they showed plenty of skill and personality in this regard. But still, getting out was precarious, draining.It was also easy to fixate on the moment when Estêvão Willian blasted clear of a posse of red shirts in central midfield on 37 minutes. When the Chelsea winger went right, trying to make something happen, he saw no teammates in support, only more red, Arsenal players swarming around him. Eventually he lost the ball for a goal-kick.View image in fullscreenBen White watches his header find the Chelsea net as Arsenal once again scored from a set piece.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThe overall impression was of an intimidation factor, which Arteta has long wanted to bring. And that is before we get to the set pieces, particularly the inswinging corners, which Arsenal have turned into an exercise in chaos; an example of their desire to unsettle with brute force. They scored the opening goal at Stamford Bridge when the Chelsea goalkeeper, Robert Sánchez, was boxed in on a Declan Rice corner, Ben White heading home.When Arsenal had their last Premier League title-winning team, one of the Invincibles, Gilberto Silva, commented that rival players got the losing feeling before a ball was kicked. “When we got into that Highbury tunnel, we knew we were going to win,” he said.It is a feeling that Arteta remembers from his days as a visiting Everton player, most notably when he was on the wrong end ofa 7-0 mauling in May 2005. “I have been in the tunnel playing with a different shirt,” he said in 2024. “Looking at the Invincibles, I had that feeling … tonight is going to be really tough. Hopefully we can create that.”William Saliba is one of the symbols of Arsenal’s strength and the defender believes his team are intimidating their opponents on a physical level. “Yes, I think so,” he said. “We are a good team and we are all connected. We need to keep going like this. Always when we play against Chelsea, it is a big fight and we want to win every duel. I think we dominated them.”Saliba was asked whether he saw the beauty in the approach. “Yes,” he replied. “It’s good. We want to be like this. We want to be strong everywhere – in defence and attack.”The frustration for Arsenal was that they did not put the tie to bed. After Zubimendi’s moment of magic, they had two clear chances for 4-1 before being pegged back by Alejandro Garnacho’s goal, the substitute’s second of the game. Both of them were soft concessions from an Arsenal point of view. The overriding feeling, though, was that this was a statement of intent. Suffocating defence is the hallmark of trophy winners.Explore more on these topicsArsenalanalysisShareReuse this content"

Even hand soap can strip skin of its natural oils, causing dryness and irritation. Whether you’re struggling with skin dryness or want something with anti-ageing benefits, there’s probably a hand cream that can help.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The best hand cream for you will depend on the specific problems you’re facing, so I asked dermatologists to identify the best ingredients for each goal.

I’ve also completed a course in cosmetic science, which taught me to scan ingredients lists to identify the best products and make solid, science-backed recommendations.I occasionally suffer from eczema on my hands, especially if I’ve neglected to wear gloves while cleaning, so I’m also painfully aware which creams can help calm down flare-ups.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I noted how quickly each cream sank into my skin.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI tested 15 hand creams from popular manufacturers, taking notes on skin-hydration levels, star ingredients and how good each cream felt on application.Nobody wants to be left with slippery, oily hands, so I noted how quickly each cream sank into my skin. If a cream was scented, I checked how well the fragrance stuck around after application.I also used a moisture reader to test the hydration levels of my hands before and after using each hand cream. I washed my hands as usual during this period, testing my hydration levels after each wash. This showed how well hydration levels lasted without needing reapplication.I took a close look at each hand cream’s ingredients list, checking for the dermatologist-recommended active ingredients in decent quantities, as well as any common irritants, such as alcohols or heavy fragrance.The best hand creams in 2026View image in fullscreen‘It’s never let me down’: L’Occitane shea butter hand creamBest hand cream overall:L’Occitane shea butter hand creamL’OccitaneShea butter hand creamfrom£25£25 at M&S£25 at AmazonWhat we loveSoothing, softening and protective without feeling greasyWhat we don’t loveAluminium tubes are prone to splittingPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£25 for 150ml at M&S£25 for 150ml at AmazonThe L’Occitane shea butter hand cream launched more than 30 years ago and has rightly become a handbag essential. It’s formulated with 20% shea butter, making it beautifully soothing, softening and protective without feeling greasy. I’ve used this hand cream for years and it’s never let me down, especially in the colder months when my hands need extra TLC.Why we love itAlongside a high concentration of moisturising shea butter, this hand cream includes humectant glycerine to help draw moisture into the skin for hydration. Argan and coconut oils also help soften and condition. Despite its rich, buttery consistency, the cream is fast-absorbing, leaving skin feeling instantly hydrated, and it doesn’t leave a greasy residue.That hydrated feeling lasted between multiple washes, as confirmed by my moisture-meter tests. And, since the cream has a jasmine and ylang-ylang scent, it was a pleasure to reapply when the time came for a top-up.This 150ml recyclable tube is the best-value way to buy this cream, but it’s also available in a30ml handbag size.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive, and the aluminium tube tends to split when it’s getting towards empty. If this happens, I recommend decanting the leftover product into a reusable tub so nothing goes to waste.Price per ml:about 17pKey ingredients:shea butter, argan and coconut oilVegan:yesCertified cruelty-free:noL’OccitaneShea butter hand creamfrom£25£25 at M&S£25 at AmazonWhat we loveSoothing, softening and protective without feeling greasyWhat we don’t loveAluminium tubes are prone to splittingBest budget hand cream:E45 repairing hand creamE45Repairing hand creamfrom£4.79£5.99 at Boots£4.79 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat value, as a little cream goes a long wayWhat we don’t loveIt’s neither vegan, nor certified cruelty freePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£5.99 for 50ml at Boots£4.79 for 50ml at AmazonThis budget-friendly cream is also my favourite option for sensitive skin and eczema. It has a simple fragrance-free formula, including some of the best ingredients for hydrating and healing cracked skin. Its rich texture means a little cream goes a long way, so this 50ml tube will last you through a whole winter.Why we love itThe cream includes 10% urea, a natural moisturising factor (NMF) that helps to hydrate and gently soften thickened areas of the skin. This, paired with the hydrating glycerine, has a smoothing effect on the hands, helping to keep them soft with continued use.I found this cream particularly lovely to use. On application, it was immediately cooling and hydrating, like a refreshing drink of water for the hands. Its thicker texture felt nourishing, without feeling sticky or heavy. It’s an easy recommendation for most people, but especially those with sensitive skin.It’s a shame that …it’s not vegan or cruelty-free, and those who prefer to use a scented hand cream won’t find any fragrance here.Price per ml:from about 10pKey ingredients:urea, glycerineVegan:noCertified cruelty-free:noE45Repairing hand creamfrom£4.79£5.99 at Boots£4.79 at AmazonWhat we loveGreat value, as a little cream goes a long wayWhat we don’t loveIt’s neither vegan, nor certified cruelty freeBest for dry, chapped hands:Margaret Dabbs Pure Hands repairing hand creamMargaret DabbsPure Hands repairing hand cream£18£18 at Victoria HealthWhat we loveRebuilds the skin barrier with every applicationWhat we don’t loveThe scent isn’t for everyone, and it lingers for hoursPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£18 for 75ml at Victoria HealthDry, chapped hands need rehydrating and a layer of protection to help lock in moisture, allowing the skin barrier to heal. Margaret Dabbs’s Pure Hands goes one step further with an ingredient that helps strengthen the skin barrier every time you apply it.Why we love itThe natural ingredient in question is Pentavitin (scientifically known as saccharide isomerate). This is a plant-derived carbohydrate that acts as a hydrating humectant and a skin-barrier strengthener by binding to the keratin in your skin.In the formula you’ll also find softening, anti-inflammatory sweet almond oil and vitamin F Forte, which is a protective complex commonly used to treat dry and sensitive skin.I found this cream hydrated my skin well, with hydration levels lasting through three hand washes before starting to dip. It also softened the thicker areas of my hands, while soothing my fragile, often irritated cuticles. Its rose and lemon scent lingered for a few hours, too.It’s a shame that …its scent won’t be for everyone, and the packaging is plastic. I’d prefer aluminium tubes, which are easier to recycle (even if they are more prone to splitting).Price per ml:24pKey ingredients:Pentavitin, glycerine, sweet almond oil, vitamin F ForteVegan:yesCertified cruelty-free:yesMargaret DabbsPure Hands repairing hand cream£18£18 at Victoria HealthWhat we loveRebuilds the skin barrier with every applicationWhat we don’t loveThe scent isn’t for everyone, and it lingers for hoursBest hand cream for ageing skin:Lancôme Absolue the hand creamLancômeAbsolue The Hand Creamfrom£56£56 at John Lewis£56 at LookfantasticWhat we lovePacked with quality ingredients to slow skin ageingWhat we don’t loveAt more than £1 per ml, anti-ageing comes at a pricePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£56 for 50ml at John Lewis£56 for 50ml at LookfantasticHands are exposed to more environmental stressors than any other part of the body, so are often the first place to show signs of ageing. This luxurious cream from Lancôme promises to plump the skin on the hands and defend it from further damage.Why we love itThis cream has lots of natural moisturising factors, ceramides and antioxidants to help protect and restore firmness. Specifically, it includes Pro-Xylane (hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol), a naturally derivedanti-ageing ingredientthat thickens and plumps the skin. It works by strengthening the connection between the top and bottom layers of skin – connections that get weaker as we age, as collagen production slows. The cream also has soothing niacinamide, antioxidant vitamin E, shea butter and ceramide NP to protect the skin from daily life.In my tests, I enjoyed this cream’s thick, satin-like feel and light rose scent. It had an immediate softening effect on my skin, with a notable increase in hydration levels. As I would expect for a cream at this price, it also didn’t feel greasy – making it simple to apply during busy days.It’s a shame that …it’s so expensive.Price per ml:£1.12Key ingredients:NMFs, ceramides, niacinamide, vitamin E, shea butter, glycerineVegan:noCertified cruelty-free:noLancômeAbsolue The Hand Creamfrom£56£56 at John Lewis£56 at LookfantasticWhat we lovePacked with quality ingredients to slow skin ageingWhat we don’t loveAt more than £1 per ml, anti-ageing comes at a priceBest hand cream for cuticle and nail care:Weleda Skin FoodWeledaSkin Foodfrom£9.96£11.96 at Lookfantastic£9.96 at AmazonWhat we loveAll the hard-working ingredientsWhat we don’t loveThe smell really isn’t appealingPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£11.96 for 75ml at Lookfantastic£9.96 for 75ml at AmazonThis cream is, without a doubt, the most hard-working in this guide. I like using it after manicures to soften up cuticles, but it can also soften the skin on your elbows, feet and even the face. Some makeup artists use the cream as a primer, although it’s far too rich for my sensitive skin.Why we love itSkin Food’s main goal is to give your skin lots of nourishment. It has a thick, rich texture that can help soften cuticles without irritation. When massaged into the hands, its occlusive formula can also help repair dry, cracked skin. This cream took more massaging to sink in, but the softening payoff was incredible and lasted all day. It’s also cruelty-free and vegetarian, with its distinctive scent derived from natural essential oils.The ingredients list includes a mixture of softening, soothing oils, such as calendula, vitamin- and antioxidant-rich sunflower seed oil and soothing chamomile extract. It’s the only cream on this roundup to feature emollient beeswax, which explains the cream’s thick, rich texture.It’s a shame that …it has a distinctive smell. Weleda describes this as sweet orange and lavandula; in reality, it smells like a potent mixture of my grandmother’s handbag and a citrus-flavoured throat sweet.

These handbag-size creams have a soft, satin-like consistency that melts into the skin and dries quickly. They use glycerine and hyaluronic acid to give the skin a hit of moisture, with sunflower seed oil and fatty acids helping to condition and moisturise.For me, the star of the show is the scent. I adored the wood sage and sea salt cream I tested, and can see it becoming a staple for those who already love thematching perfume– this would make a lovely gift for any Jo Malone lover.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pricey and the formulation isn’t doing anything hugely groundbreaking. It doesn’t feel as nourishing or protective as other, and cheaper, options – such as Weleda’s Skin Food or the E45 cream.

This is usually a bigger problem in winter, as colder air has lower humidity and central heating indoors dries out the air even further. Pair this with the comparatively low number of oil glands in the hands, and you’ve got a recipe for dryness.Do I need to buy a hand cream or will body moisturiser work?Hand creams andbody moisturisersare formulated differently, according to Phillips. “Hand cream typically has a thicker and more emollient consistency, with a higher oil content in order to address the dry skin.“It’s also usually formulated to help create a protective barrier against the elements, as well as lifestyle habits such as frequent washing. Body moisturiser is typically made with a higher water content so that it’s easier to spread over large areas.”Buying a dedicated cream is a targeted way to protect your hands’ skin barrier. That said, if your budget can’t stretch to a hand cream, using a body moisturiser can help hydrate the hands in the short term – you’ll just miss out on some of the protective benefits associated with hand creams that have higher oil and emollient formulations.What are the best ingredients for dry, cracked hands?“The best ingredients are those that focus on hydration and drawing moisture into the skin. Humectants are key to this,” says Akhavani. The most popular of these are glycerine and hyaluronic acid, although many exist, including AHAs (lactic acid and glycolic acid), aloe vera and panthenol.Also, “ceramides are essential as they replenish the natural lipids in the skin barrier, helping it to seal in hydration and protect against further irritation,” says Phillips. He also recommends shea butter, “a rich emollient that coats the skin in a protective layer, soothing dryness while helping to restore suppleness”.Natural moisturising factors, or NMFs, are also crucial in a hand cream, as they mimic naturally occurring components of the skin barrier, helping restore the skin’s moisture levels long term. “Urea is especially valuable for rough or cracked skin because it hydrates and gently softens thickened areas, making the skin feel smoother,” says Phillips. Other NMFs include peptides, sodium PCA and amino acids.What are the best ingredients for ageing skin on the hands?“Many people notice that with age their hands lose their natural volume, elasticity and plumpness, making them appear more wrinkled and saggy,” says Akhavani. “Some people may also experience this after weight loss.”According to the experts, ageing skin on the hands can be tackled in much the same way as ageing skin on the face. That is, by using retinol to smooth fine lines over time, vitamin C to brighten uneven tone, and niacinamide to help support the skin barrier while reducing pigmentation.For more:The best anti-ageing creams, serums and treatmentsWinter beauty essentials: Sali Hughes’s 30 favourite cold weather productsThe best moisturising lip balms to hydrate and protect your lipsSarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in giving health and beauty recommendations.

The Tory leader appointed the West Suffolk MP Nick Timothy as shadow justice secretary after Jenrick’s sacking.His dismissal appeared to have caught both him and Farage off-guard. The Reform leader called it the “latest Christmas present I’ve ever had” and said it was still “60/40” if Jenrick would defect until Badenoch forced his hand.However, Jenrick later admitted that he had already resolved to defect by the morning of his sacking, and that it would probably have happened in the coming days.Jenrick arrived on stage – after a lengthy and awkward delay – with a savage denunciation of his former party and its time in government. “What’s the truth? Both Labour and the Conservatives broke Britain. Both parties are committed to a set of ideas that have failed Britain,” he said.View image in fullscreenJenrick (left) with Nigel Farage and the Reform deputy leader, Richard Tice, in Westminster on Thursday.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockA senior Reform source said: “He’s the No 1 Tory we have all wanted to come over. He’s been a lone warrior in his party ever since Kemi won [the leadership].”Jenrick said discussions had started with Reform in September, understood to have been facilitated by the former Tory adviser Tim Montgomerie, who joined Farage’s party in December 2024. He also confirmed that he would not call a byelection in his Newark constituency.But Jenrick added that there had not been discussions about a defection, but about the state of the country.“Nothing has been offered, I’m proud to join and work with a set of people I have come to know over a very long time … who have built this party from nothing and I’m just here to play my part,” he said.Jenrick said that some around the shadow cabinet table had said behind closed doors they knew the UK was broken but could not admit it “because it was us who broke it”.He singled out the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, and the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, for direct criticism. Stride, he said, was the work and pensions secretary who “oversaw the explosion of the welfare bill and blocked the reforms needed”.He said that Patel as home secretary had overseen the surge in legal migration.The former immigration minister admitted he had not intended to leave the Tories on Thursday but said he had resolved to leave soon.“I didn’t know I was going to leave today, but I had resolved to leave the party, and that was, as I said, something I had given a great deal of thought to over a very long time, and the fact that it’s happened a little bit sooner … so what?”Farage said that after the 7 May local elections there would be no more Tory defections, and Reform would reject more seeking to join. He said Jenrick was “in sackcloth and ashes” about decisions made during his time in the Tory government.Over the course of the next few weeks, Reform would begin to allocate jobs and responsibilities to key people, Farage said. Jenrick is understood to have discussed party’s economic policies with Farage, but any appointment as its economic spokesperson could cause tensions with the party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, and Zia Yusuf, the head of policy, who are also potential contenders.Farage said he knew the party had to have some experienced people if it was to enter government. “We need the experience, I think that’s absolutely vital.”Jenrick denied he was interested in becoming the leader of Reform. “No one joins Reform unless they believeNigel Farageis the best person to lead this country … that’s why I’ve put aside my personal ambition.”Both men brushed off their previous criticisms of each other, saying it was the way of politics, despite Farage having described Jenrick as a “fraud” who cannot be trusted as recently as last summer.Westminster sources said Badenoch had been monitoring Jenrick’s activities for some time because of suspicions he was working to undermine the party, and she believed his defection was imminent.It later emerged one of Jenrick’s own inner circle had discovered his draft resignation speech and sent it to the leader’s office, parts of which were released by the Conservative party on Thursday. One person from Jenrick’s wing of the party said they believed the MP had defected after realising he did not have enough support in the party to launch a challenge to Badenoch with guaranteed success after the May elections – especially with rising star Katie Lam building a support base.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch during a visit to Edinburgh on Thursday. ‘Robert Jenrick is not my problem any more. He’s Nigel Farage’s problem now,’ she said.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSpeaking to journalists on a visit to Edinburgh ahead of May’s Holyrood elections, where polls suggest the Scottish party will incur heavy losses at the hands of Reform, Badenoch denied this was “a very bad day”. She said defections to Reform were evidence that “a lot of people have gone into politics for the wrong reasons”.“People who go into politics because they think it’s a gravy train, or because they think it’s a way to get on TV, are finding out that the Conservative party is not the party for them,” she said.“And they’re going to the party that is for people like that. Robert Jenrick is not my problem any more. He’s Nigel Farage’s problem now.”The Tory leader said more details on the “irrefutable evidence” that prompted her to sack Jenrick on Thursday morning would come “in due course”.“Every time we have a press conference, we have announcements, we have ideas of how to improve the country,” Badenoch said. “When Reform has press conferences, it’s just: here’s another defection.”Badenoch told Sky News that Jenrick was planning to “torch the Conservative party by putting out comments and allegations that would have been very, very bad”.Shortly before the news broke on Thursday, Jenrick had posted on X: “It’s time for the truth.”Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickReform UKNigel FarageKemi BadenochConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

At the center of DHS’s campaign are Somali and Latino people, who are being targeted for stops and arrests based on racial profiling motivated by prejudice,” the lawsuit said.It added: “DHS’s crude dragnet ensnares non-citizens, including individuals with immigration status, without warrants or any lawful basis for arrest. And its discriminatory practices also sweep in numerous US citizens in the process, shackling them and scanning their faces while ignoring documentation of US citizenship.”According to the lawsuit, one of the plaintiffs, 20-year old Mubashir Khalif Hussen, was detained by masked ICE agents while walking to lunch in Minneapolis’ Cedar-Riverside neighborhood last December.Despite repeatedly stating “I’m a citizen,” Hussen said agents refused to check his ID, placed him in a headlock and took him to the Whipple federal building in south Minneapolis. There, Hussen was shackled, fingerprinted, and denied medical assistance and water before being released, the lawsuit alleged.“At no time did any officer ask me whether I was a citizen or if I had any immigration status,” Hussensaidin Thursday’s press release from the ACLU, adding: “They did not ask for any identifying information, nor did they ask about my ties to the community, how long I had lived in the Twin Cities, my family in Minnesota or anything else about my circumstances.”Following his release, Hussen walked by ICE officers and protesters earlier this month and recorded the scene on his phone from a public sidewalk. A car carrying federal agents then drove past him and, as it did, one agent rolled down the window and pepper-sprayed directly into Hussen’s face, the lawsuit said.Another plaintiff, 25-year-old Mahamed Eydarus, was shoveling snow out of his parking space with his mother after leaving work last month when they were surrounded by several unidentified, masked federal agents in plain clothes.The agents allegedly did not identify themselves or present a warrant, but demanded identification to ensure Eydarus was “not illegal” and also questioned his mother. The lawsuit further alleges that the agents instructed Eydarus’s mother to remove her niqab, a religious face covering, separated her from her son and questioned why they were speaking Somali, referring to it as a “foreign language”. The agents eventually left without asking about their community ties or providing any explanation.In astatementon Thursday, ACLU Minnesota attorney Catherine Ahlin-Halverson said: “ICE and CBP’s practices are both illegal and morally reprehensible. Federal agents’ conduct – sweeping up Minnesotans through racial profiling and unlawful arrests – is a grave violation of Minnesotans’ most fundamental rights, and it has spread fear among immigrant communities and neighborhoods. No one, including federal agents, is above the law.”Echoing Ahlin-Halverson, Kate Huddleston, an attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said: “The government can’t stop and arrest people based on the color of their skin, or arrest people with no probable cause. These kinds of police-state tactics are contrary to the basic principles of liberty and equality that remain a bedrock of our legal system and our country.”The Trump administration has defended its immigration sweeps in Minnesota, saying the operations target people living in the US illegally, particularly those with criminal records, and areaimedat tackling what officials describe as widespread fraud.The operations have come under intense scrutiny in recent days following thekilling of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother, by a federal agent, which has sparkedintense protestsin Minnesota and nationwide. The DHS has defended ICE’s use of force, saying its agents acted lawfully and inself-defensewhen confronted or threatened.However, Minnesota’s governor,Tim Walz, and local officials have sharply disputed this framing, calling the surge of thousands of federal agents an unconstitutional and harmful“federal invasion”, as well as a “campaign of retribution” that has terrorized communities and violated residents’ rights.The Guardian has reached out to the DHS for comment.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaUS constitution and civil libertiesICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationMinneapolisUS immigrationLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Some also fear that under European Union law they will be returned to another EU country and from there forcibly returned to their country of origin, where they believe their lives may be in danger.They raised concerns about what they consider to be the random nature of the “one in, one out” scheme, which allows the majority of passengers on a dinghy to have their asylum claims processed in the UK while a minority are detained in preparation for forcible removal to France. The scheme has been called ineffective by those who support asylum seekers and those who oppose them.Before the flight on Thursday just 193 people had been forcibly removed to France, with 195 legally brought to the UK in turn. While just 32 people have crossed the Channel so far this year, thought to be a result of adverse weather conditions, 803 people crossed in 13 boats on 20 December, a few months after “one in, one out” was introduced, indicating the scheme was not yet serving as a deterrent in the way the government had hoped.At the beginning of the action on Wednesday detainees sent a message explaining why they were protesting, saying: “We are asylum seekers, we are not criminals we are not animals. Between 41,000 people who crossed the Channel, why just we 200 persons are in detention? End the detention of asylum seekers. End our pain.”At first the protest proceeded peacefully and the asylum seekers sent a message saying: “All is good. More than 60 here [at Harmondsworth] and 50 at Brook House, all protesting in a very nice and safe way. We are in the hall they locked the doors. We can’t go to toilet or have a rest or eat and drink. We don’t know what they gonna do next. Please help us. Do whatever u can for us.”But the protesters said things became more violent. One detainee, who told the Guardian he had significant reasons to fear smugglers in France, said the situation deteriorated when officers with riot shields and dogs were brought in.He sent a message saying: “Maybe they coming for us,” followed shortly afterwards by: “They come now and they bring [police dogs].”Asked if he was OK, he said: “No.”The man’s last communication with the Guardian was at 2.14am on Thursday morning. He was able to make a phone call and alleged he had been beaten. “I have a terrible pain in my head, I have been locked in a room by myself,” he said. “The situation is very bad.”The protesters say they were also teargassed.Another detainee who participated in the action but did not have a ticket for Thursday’s flight told the Guardian by phone in the early hours that the situation was getting worse. He sent a message at 3.33am saying: “They brought special forces for us, they used [teargas], they took us by force inside rooms, they took the ones who have tickets by force. We are in pain, our eyes and bodies are burning.”A spokesperson for the organisation Captain Support, which supports migrants on the move including people crossing the Channel in small boats, said they were in contact with protesting detainees. “We are horrified by the violence used against [the protesters] to enact the government’s ‘one in, one out’ plan,” they said.Libby Kane of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) said: “This cruel UK-France scheme ultimately amounts to state-sanctioned human trafficking. We stand in complete solidarity with them and their demands.”TheHome Officedeclined to comment.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

She and Musk are the parents of a son born in 2024.She is being represented by Carrie Goldberg, a victims’ rights lawyer who specialises in holding tech companies accountable and has previously represented women who were victims of sexual harassment and abuse.Goldberg told the Guardian: “xAI is not a reasonably safe product and is a public nuisance. Nobody has born the brunt more than Ashley St Clair. Ashley filed suit because Grok was harassing her by creating and distributing nonconsensual, abusive, and degrading images of her and publishing them onX.“This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm. We intend to hold Grok accountable and to help establish clear legal boundaries for the entire public’s benefit to prevent AI from being weaponised for abuse.”The filing alleges the social media company “retaliated against her, demonetising her X account and generating multitudes more images of her, including unlawful images of her in sex positions, covered in semen, virtually nude, and images of her as a child naked”.Images generated by Grok, according to the filing, include one of her as a 14-year-old stripped into a string bikini plus sexualised content of St Clair as an adult, including a request to “put the girl in a bikini made out of floss”.Not only were the images de facto nonconsensual, the filing states, but “Grok and xAI also had explicit knowledge that St Clair was not consenting to the creation or dissemination of these images because of her requests for removal”.Grok also responded to user requests to add tattoos on to St Clair’s body – including the words “Elon’s whore”, the filing said.St Clair, who is Jewish, alleges Grok digitally dressed her in a bikini decorated with swastikas.The lawsuit states that X “financially benefited from the creation and dissemination of nonconsensual, realistic, sexualised deepfake content depicting Plaintiff as a minor and adult”.The filing states that “xAI is directly liable for the harassment and explicit images created by its own chatbot, Grok”.Musk has posted on X that the users of his app are responsible for the images they create. He said recently: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”He added: “Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests.”X said on Thursday it had “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content”.The company has filed a countersuit claiming that according to the terms of service of X, St Clair cannot sue the company in New York but has to do so in Texas.St Clairpreviously told the Guardianthat she felt “horrified and violated”, adding: “It’s another tool of harassment. Consent is the whole issue.”Acolytes of Musk had disliked her since she went public about his desire to build a “legion” of children, she said. Musk is the father of13 other children, with three other women.X has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXAI (artificial intelligence)Elon MuskDeepfakeInternet safetyInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

In the case of Saudi Arabia, its reticence led it to deny the US use of its airspace to mount any attacks.Continuing discussions, the Saudi Arabian foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, conferred by phone with his counterparts from Iran, Oman andTurkeyon Thursday.Iran remains politically apart from the Gulf states, partly owing to its continued support for its weakened network of regional proxies, known as the axis of resistance, and its refusal to back a two state-solution for Palestine as well as disputes over three islands in the Gulf claimed by the United Arab Emirates, a claim backed by the Gulf Cooperation Council.But Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has also undertaken a series of visits to Arab capitals that are said to have improved relations. Last year, for instance, he visited Bahrain, the first Iranian minister to do since 2010. He also visited Cairo four times last year in an effort to improve relations. The two sides had severed diplomatic relations in 2016.The Saudi-Iranian relationship, once the most fraught in the Middle East, has been on a recovery path for three years. Araghchi makes a point of being photographed sampling local cuisine in the Arab capitals he visits.All the Gulf states are further aware of the disruption Iran could cause to maritime traffic in the Gulf.Araghchi has recently been trying to persuade the Gulf states than Iran is less of a risk to global stability than Israel, a case made more plausible after Israel bombed Doha last September with the intent to kill the Hamas negotiators that have lived in the Qatari capital for nearly a decade. The Israelis failed to hit their primary targets, but reportedly killed five lower-ranking members of the group.The US, not informed of the strikes in advance, apologised directly to Qatar’s emir and offered new security guarantees for Doha designed to protect Qatar from further Israeli attacks. At the time, Qatar accused Israel of trying to sabotage every opportunity for peace in the region.The US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is a supporter of the Qatari state’s self-appointed but often effective role as a global mediator.The US al-Udeid airbase, its largest in the region, is in Qatar, and as tensions mounted on Wednesday the US withdrew key personnel from the base.The withdrawal, after Tehran’s open threats to hit US bases in the region if attacked, underscores how static American land and naval bases in the region designed to project US power could also be a source of vulnerability. Iran persistently claims that the US ordered Israel to end its 12-day assault in the summer on Iran’s leadership and nuclear programme after Iran struck the US base.Araghchi has also managed to exploit the political capital he has invested in diplomatic outreach by ringing Arab leaders to explain Tehran’s rationale for the crackdown.Many of the states deeply resent the interference of Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. Yet by the same measure, few of them would welcome the example of an authoritarian regime being toppled by street protests riled by falling living standards, and leading to a new democratic transition, or even the fragmentation of a unified Iranian state.Saudi Arabia for instance has recently put down a rebellion in the south of Yemen that would have broken up the country. The Egyptian military leadership dedicates much its energy to suppressing calls for human rights reforms.The spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, Majed al-Ansari, told reporters on Tuesday: “The big challenges in the region – and we are talking about internal and external challenges in different countries – require all of us to return to the negotiating table.”The Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, has called for dialogue. “Hopefully, the United States and Iran will resolve this issue among themselves – whether through mediators, other actors, or direct dialogue. We are closely following these developments.”Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyTrump administrationSaudi ArabiaOmanTurkeyQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s cruel but increasingly widespread.“We’re seeing ICBs curb patients’ access to ADHD assessment without telling GPs or patients that they are doing this, and without having made any assessment of the consequences.“The NHS should be ashamed of itself for such secrecy and hiding the fact that they are depriving people of this vital type of care.”Adults and children awaiting an ADHD assessment in many parts of Englandalready faced long delays– on average eight years – in getting an appointment. Limiting access to assessments will force affected people to wait even longer, Shelford said.The government’s ADHD taskforcewarned in a reportin November that people with ADHD who have not been assessed can be left struggling to work or attend school. The lack of support costs £17bn a year as a result of crime, educational underachievement, drug misuse, suicide and mental ill-health, it said.“People with suspected ADHD desperately need to have a full assessment as soon as possible so they can get treatment and get on with their lives,” Shelford said.“And family doctors need to know whether a patient on their waiting list, desperate to know if they have ADHD or not, is going to be assessed or not. If they don’t know what’s going on, how can they properly advise and care for their patients?”North Central London ICB confirmed in its FoI response to ADHD UK that it had introduced indicative activity plans (IAPs) – which cap the number of appointments it will pay for – for both ADHD and autism assessments.While it had undertaken an impact assessment, it had not drawn up any communications to either GPs or patients explaining the move. In all, 8,583 people across the five London boroughs it covers were waiting to be assessed for ADHD and 1,306 for autism at the time it responded last October.‘He tried so hard to get help’: the tragic results of NHS right-to-choose for ADHD patientsRead moreHowever, 10 ICBs said they had informed family doctors and affected patients.Other ICBs – regional NHS bodies – that have curbed access but not told GPs or patients include those in Kent and Medway, Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes.The Guardianrevealed on Mondaythat the NHS spending on ADHD services is over budget by £164m this year amid record demand for assessments.NHS England said people seeking an ADHD assessment could still join the waiting list, despite the widespread use of IAPs.A spokesperson said: “The claims that the payment scheme proposals are designed to restrict patient choice and access to ADHD services are incorrect, and GPs can continue to make referrals when it is clinically appropriate to do so.“As we work to put ADHD services on a more sustainable footing, these proposals are designed to the right to choose for patients, improve consistency and quality of care, and ultimately deliver fully funded and effective pathways for all patients across England.”The reasons behind the rise in recent years in diagnoses of ADHD, autism and mental illness will beexamined in a reviewordered last month by Wes Streeting, the health secretary.Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderNHSHealthGPsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those of us privileged enough to be working in education have a professional and moral duty to stand against discrimination.“Last weekend I tasked inspectors to consider the evidence, speak with the school and determine whether further action was needed. They have concluded the threshold for an inspection was met and they are at the school today. The school was informed this morning and I am very grateful to them for their openness in engaging with the inspectors.”Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said she would consider further action against the school after the inspection.She said: “What happened to my colleague Damien Egan is shocking and completely unacceptable. My department has been in direct contact withOfstedand I welcome their urgent inspection and look forward to their findings – I will not rule out further action.”Egan’s visit, to speak to pupils about democracy and the role of MPs, was meant to have taken place last September but the school called off the event after it learned of plans for a protest.The cancellation was first revealed by Steve Reed, the communities secretary, who told a Jewish Labour Movement conference on Sunday: “I have a colleague who is Jewish, who has been banned from visiting a school and refused permission to visit a school in his own constituency, in case his presence inflames the teachers. That is an absolute outrage.”The issue was raised at Westminster during prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, withStarmer telling MPs: “It is very serious, very concerning, and all members of parliament should be able to visit anywhere in their constituency, schools or other places, without any fear of antisemitism.”Pro-Palestine activists and NEU members said they opposed the visit because of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. The Bristol NEU branch claimed on social media: “We celebrate this cancellation as a win for safeguarding, solidarity, and for the power of the NEU trade union staff group, parents, and campaigners standing together.”This week a spokesperson for the academy said: “We have remained in contact with Mr Egan and an alternative date for his visit was arranged some time ago. We have also been in contact with the police and followed their advice.”Explore more on these topicsOfstedBristolSchoolsLabourEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The maps below show how this is developing.Sea ice is meltingThe average extent of sea ice in the Arctic over the last five years was 4.6m sq km. This is roughly equivalent to the size of the EU.But this is a 27% drop compared with the average of 6.4m sq km between 1981 and 2010, according to data from theNational Snow and Ice Data Center. The sea ice lost is roughly equivalent to the size of Libya.Sea ice mapThe shrinking Arctic ice means that, in the summer, the ice cap no longer reaches the Russian and Canadian coasts. And because there is no land beneath the north pole it is exposing seas that were once inaccessible.Arctic shipping routes are becoming more viableThis is opening up new shipping routes. As the polar seas become navigable for longer periods, routes once limited to icebreakers have become commercial corridors.View image in fullscreenThe Russian nuclear icebreaker Yamal breaking through sea ice in the Arctic.Photograph: Sue Flood/AlamyThe most developed is the northern sea route, which overlaps the north-east passage and runs along Russia’s Arctic coast from Europe to Asia. It is central to Moscow’sambitions.Further west, thenorth-west passagecuts through Canada’s Arctic archipelago, while a central Arctic route across the north pole is also emerging in long-term planning.Shipping routes mapThis is redrawing the global trade map, adding routes that could provide alternatives to the Suez canal and cut the journey from westernEuropeto east Asia by almost half.In 2025, the container ship Istanbul Bridge became the first liner vessel to travel from China to Europe via the northern sea route, also known as the “Polar Silk Road” shortcut.Istanbul bridge mapThe ship travelled from Ningbo, China, to Felixstowe, UK, in about 20 days.Data from theMarine Exchange of Alaska, a maritime monitoring organisation,showed there were 665 transits through the Bering trait, which separates Russia from the US, in 2024, a 175% rise from 242 in 2010.Chart showing more ships are travelling through the Bering straitThese routes are not without risks, which affect their commercial viability.Serafima Andreeva, a researcher at the Norway-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says Moscow is aiming for “year-round” use of the north-east passage from Europe to Asia and is investing heavily in nuclear icebreakers.But ships are still getting stuck in the ice, Andreeva says, adding: “Even now there are occasional issues with use of the route even in the ‘summer’.”Rising tensions around the ArcticSeveral Arctic nations have claims in the Arctic: Canada,Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US.The UN’s Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) makes recommendations to coastal states on these claims.Continental shelf claimThe US already has a military presence in the Arctic and in Greenland specifically.The remote Pituffik base in north-west Greenland hosts missile warning, missile defence and space operations for the US and Nato.View image in fullscreenPituffik space base in northern Greenland.Photograph: Thomas Traasdahl/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty ImagesRussia has opened several military bases in the last decade, as well as restoring old Soviet infrastructure and airfields.In 2018, China declared itself a “near-Arctic state” in an effort togain more influencein the region.Andreeva says: “There has been an increased military interest in the Arctic over the last 10 to 15 years, and the landscape has changed significantly since 2022 [when Russia invaded Ukraine].”She adds that Finland and Sweden’s recent accession to Nato has reshaped the security landscape, increasing the focus on the Nordics as a collective. This has entrenched Russia’s desire to assert control over areas such as the Kola peninsula and the Barents bastion.Map of regionEven though Russia’s focus has been on Ukraine since 2022, it has maintained its presence in the Arctic.Nato countries have been reinforcing their Arctic naval presence and there have been announcements on increased icebreaker building. With Nato’s Nordic expansion, Denmark’s air force has become more integrated with Finland, Norway and Sweden. In 2024, China deployed three icebreaking vessels to the Arctic.Interest in Greenland’s critical mineralsGreenland is also important in theglobal racefor critical minerals. The island ranks eighth in the world for rare earth reserves, estimated at 1.5 million tonnes by theUS Geological Survey.It hosts two of the largest known deposits, at Kvanefjeld and Tanbreez. Foreign interest in these is growing. China’s Shenghe Resources is the largest shareholder in the Kvanefjeld project, holding a 12.5% stake, according to theCenter for Strategic and International Studies.Chart showing how Greenland is thought to have one of the world’s largest rare earth reservesNo rare earth mining has taken place as yet because of inaccessibility. Only about 20% of Greenland is ice-free, and much of the island is inaccessible for large parts of the year.But as with the shipping lanes becoming more viable, global heating is also beginning to alter this equation, and retreating ice is exposing new mineral resources.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandRussiaEuropeDenmarkDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The week before he had sat through a shadow cabinet awayday taking copious notes.While the Tory leader had been aware for some time of speculation over her shadow justice secretary’s future, she had no hard proof of his plans, so it was business as usual. That all changed just 24 hours after their one-to-one conversation.On Monday, senior figures in Badenoch’s office were sent screenshots of what one said was “irrefutably” Jenrick’s entire resignation speech from what sources claimed was a mole in his office, along with the accompanying media plan.His speech, which was double-spaced for easy reading, implored his fellow Tories to defect with him as their party had “lost its way”, singling out senior figures such as Priti Patel and Mel Stride for criticism. He added that Nigel Farage was the “right person” to lead the country.Despite all the rumours, the Tory leader’s top team were still shocked by the betrayal. Jenrick’s aides had been openly speculating at party events about when he would choose to defect.“It was all presented jokingly, but of course it wasn’t a joke. We all thought he would wait till May to see if he still had a chance to depose Kemi. But that became more and more obvious that that is not going to happen,” one party source said.Treachery and stupidity to the fore as Robert Jenrick defects to Reform | John CraceRead moreShortly after receiving the screenshots, a journalist who is close to – and trusted by – the Badenoch operation told the team they had heard from a close friend of Jenrick that he was definitely making the leap, sources told the Guardian.Badenoch’s senior aides were already aware that Farage was due to appear on the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg show this Sunday and feared he would drop heavy hints before announcing the defection the next morning, to maximise the damage.They immediately told Badenoch – and advised her to sack Jenrick and kick him out the party. “Kemi was regretful; she wished we weren’t in this position,” one source said. “But she was absolutely clear and focused: Rob had to go.”There was no attempt to win over Jenrick. “We knew we had to act immediately. If we challenged him first, there was a risk of him going straight out and doing it anyway,” a Tory source said.Badenoch left it to her chief whip, Rebecca Harris, to phone Jenrick, a move which one ally described as “delicious”. Speaking to Harris, the MP angrily denied he was planning to defect, one Tory shadow cabinet source alleged.The Tory leader’s ambush – a video message where she laid out the charges – was hastily recorded just before. She released her video just after 11am, timed to coincide with Farage’s press conference in Scotland, knowing journalists would confront theReform UKleader.2:01'Clear, irrefutable evidence': Badenoch on Robert Jenrick sacking over 'plot to defect' – videoThe video was also emailed out to all Conservative party members with a message from Badenoch, promising them they “deserve better” than MPs who stand for the party and then defect.Farage, at his press conference in Scotland, also seemed caught on the hop. “It sounds to me like she’s panicked,” he said of Badenoch, insisting there was no deal done with Jenrick – yet.“I’ll give him a ring this afternoon,” he told journalists. “I might even buy him a pint.” Pressed on Jenrick’s defection destination, Farage replied: “Could be the Lib Dems? I don’t know!”One former cabinet minister said Badenoch had acted swiftly in a way that Rishi Sunak should have done as prime minister while allies of Jenrick plotted against him in No 10.The Guardian view on Robert Jenrick’s defection: Britain’s right is in a crisis of its own making | EditorialRead moreBadenoch’s team were euphoric to have got one over on her former leadership rival. “Jenrick’s clever-dick people, they’re not so clever after all,” one senior Tory said.“She’s blown him up with his own grenade, very decisive, no pissing about, fair play to her,” another added.Condemnation of Jenrick from across the Conservative party was swift – and brutal. One Tory MP called him a “coward”. Another said he was “a traitor”, dismissing him as “ruthlessly ambitious and unprincipled”.“Jenrick was a snake in the grass in the Rishi years, you cannot trust him. There was so much deceit and dishonesty and leaking stuff to journalists from the people who worked with him. We never dealt with these people properly then. We should have bulleted them a lot earlier,” a former cabinet minister said.Even among some of her Conservative sceptics, Badenoch drew widespread praise for acting decisively. “She has got some cojones,” one MP said. “Iron Lady with a titanium overlay.”“She’s done absolutely the right thing,” another senior MP said. “People need to realise that she’s serious, has the guts to sack people when they deserve it, that we have standards, that people who go that way can’t come back, and that we are not a populist Reform-lite party.”Jenrick’s star with theConservativeshas waned since the party’s October conference, when Badenoch impressed MPs and the membership there, while he became embroiled in a racism row. Her performances at PMQs have improved, and her ratings have gradually crept up, encouraging some sceptics to stick with her – for now.Jenrick went to ground. With the wind in her sails, Badenoch flew to Edinburgh to campaign for the Holyrood elections – taking in a quick whisky tour at the Johnnie Walker Experience with Scots colleagues. Sources would not divulge whether they raised a glass to Jenrick’s sacking.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch tastes a tipple during a whisky tour in Edinburgh.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianBut the breathlessness did not last long. Rumours began circling that Farage had, indeed, got a defection deal with Jenrick over the line.The pair had begun talking as long ago as last September – the month after the Reform leader called him a “fraud” – and there were rumours of a lunch in December, while Jenrick dined recently with Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice.A scheduled press conference about Reform’s plans for a judicial review of delays to local elections at the party’s headquarters on the 24th floor of Millbank Tower, central London, later in the afternoon gave the opportunity.Within moments of standing up, Farage confirmed the worst-kept secret in Westminster: that Jenrick was Reform’s highest-profile defection yet. But he told the packed room the MP hadn’t been planning to join Reform UK anytime soon and “might not have joined at all”.Twisting the knife, he told Badenoch: “You’ve handed me on a plate the man that is by far the most popular figure [in the Tory party].” He announced the arrival of his new recruit … but nothing happened.For a very long two minutes – which one attender described as “like the bride being late to her wedding” – Reform UK appeared to have lost Jenrick. “Wouldn’t this be a funny way to end this day,” Farage said.The mood of the room shifted away from Farage’s jovial tone as Jenrick finally swept into the room and launched into an earnest speech about his political philosophy, waiting more than 20 minutes to even mention Reform or his new boss.Railing against his “rotten” former party, he laid into his former shadow cabinet colleagues Stride and Patel personally for causing failures in welfare and immigration – just as Badenoch had predicted from his leaked speech.Jenrick looked uneasy as journalists repeatedly pressed him about his honesty and trustworthiness, insisting he had put aside his own personal ambitions to be Tory leader in order to help make Farage prime minister.He was confronted with evidence that he had told a Telegraph reporter he would “never, ever defect” just last Friday, and admitted that he had actually already resolved to defect some time before Badenoch sacked him.Jenrick’s longtime allies, Sam Armstrong and Jake Ryan, watched from the sidelines, while Reform figures James Orr and Tice, in the audience, nodded along to his claims that “Britain is broken”.But one notable absence was the party’s policy chief, Zia Yusuf, who has previously expressed contempt for Jenrick for being a “traitor” over his actions as immigration minister. Farage admitted Yusuf was suspicious of former Tories who had been in government – a sentiment no doubt shared by many in Reform.Later, it emerged that Jenrick had been delayed because he had got lost in the corridors of Millbank Tower, getting stuck one floor below the press conference location after failing to find his way up the stairs.He will be hoping to now navigate Reform’s labyrinthine politics with greater success.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickKemi BadenochConservativesReform UKfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Four others, who had also been on hunger strike but were officially on a “pause”, would be doing likewise.View image in fullscreenLewie Chiaramello, Heba Muraisi and Kamran Ahmed.Photograph: HandoutThe announcement came on day 73 of Muraisi refusing food, the same number of days as reached by the Irish republican hunger striker Kieran Doherty, who survived the longest of 10 men who died in a 1981 action.Shahmina Alam, the sister of Ahmed, who she said stopped his strike on Tuesday (day 65 for him), spoke of her relief. “For the first time I woke up today not afraid,” she said. “We don’t need to think about the prospects of more health complication.” At the same time, she stressed that residual fear remained over the re-feeding process, which is in itself precarious.The end of the action was presented as a victory, sealed by the government’s decision not to award a £2bn defence contract to Elbit Systems UK, a subsidiary of Israel’s largest arms producer. This was described by Prisoners for Palestine as a key demand of the hunger strikers and this was partially true.One of five key demands was to shut down the UK sites of Elbit, which some of those refusing food are accused of targeting. While this has not happened, within that demand was a requirement not to grant the Ministry of Defence contract to Elbit Systems UK, which would have seen it train 60,000 troops a year.Francesca Nadin, of Prisoners for Palestine, said: “We’ll never know for sure but it’s quite clear to me that all of the campaigning, whether it be the hunger strike, whether it beDefend Our Juries, whether it bethe judicial review[challenging proscription of Palestine Action], all had an impact on that, because now the public is talking about this in a way that wasn’t happening before.”Alam said her brother had been feeling “deflated” about the prospect of stopping when she spoke to him on Monday, as he did not feel enough progress had been made towards the demands, but he had succumbed to pressure from those close to him. However, she said the news about Elbit would cheer him up and Nadin said Muraisi was very happy when she told her about it on the phone.Other key demands were clearly not met, such as immediate bail for the prisoners – none of whom have been convicted and all of whom will have spent well over a year in jail before trial – and the de-proscription ofPalestine Action. However, the latter is still a possibility through the judicial review, the decision of which is keenly awaited.View image in fullscreenSupporters rallying outside Pentonville prison.Photograph: Martin Pope/Sopa Images/ShutterstockPrisoners for Palestine also pointed to other “victories”, including, it said, HMP New Hall, in Wakefield, agreeing to Muraisi’s transfer back to HMP Bronzefield, in Surrey, which is near her family and friends and from where she was moved last year. Another key demand had been to end the censorship of communications and, to that end, it said that, during the hunger strike, some of the prisoners started receiving bulk packages of withheld mail.They might also note that the death of the hunger strikers would have been a devastating loss which might have achieved little beyond what has already been secured – and that the sacrifice to their health has been enormous.While they did not get all of their demands, nor did the Irish republican prisoners in the last hunger strike of such scale and longevity in a UK prison, yet they were retrospectively recognised aschanging the course of the Northern Irish conflict.This is not to say that the results of the modern protesters’ action will be on anything like the same scale. But with the US congresswoman Rachida Tlaibposting on X about their plight, interventionby UN experts, and international news coverage, they drew attention to their cause as well as wider problems in the prison system. And Prisoners for Palestine said that, in the last few weeks, 500 people had signed up to take direct action – more than the amount of people who did so with Palestine Action over its five-year campaign before proscription.Nadin said: “From the very beginning – all the hunger strikers said this – it was a rallying cry to the people, and that was the big success. Demands were kind of secondary to all that, we know what the government’s like.”Alam said: “I think their name was very much in the shadows for a while, but people are very aware of Elbit Systems now and a lot of that is due to the hunger strike.”Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionPrisons and probationProtestanalysisShareReuse this content"

Before this, users had been able to ask @Grok to manipulate images, with the results being published on the platform.X said this restriction would apply to all users, including paid subscribers to X. There are about 300 million monthly users of X and up to 2.6 million subscribers.The platform also said the ability to create and edit any images at all via the @Grok account would be limited to subscribers. This means individuals who attempt to break the law or X’s policies can be more easily traced.X is introducing further limits for specific countries that fold in the Grok button inside X and the Grok app, which is owned by X’s parent company, xAI. It is limiting the ability of users in certain jurisdictions to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar clothing via @Grok and the Grok button inside the app if such behaviour is illegal in those countries. This is a process known as geoblocking and is expected to apply to the Grok app as well.Distributing intimate images of people without their consent, known colloquially as “revenge porn”, is illegal in the UK, so geoblocking will be applied in this jurisdiction at least.What is new in X’s statement?Prior to Wednesday, the @Grok account on X said it had switched off its image creation function for non-subscribers – the vast majority of its user base. However, this wascriticised by the UK governmentbecause this indicated the digital undressing of women and children could still be carried out by paying subscribers. The Grok app appeared to be unaffected.This latest announcement is the first statement by X on the matter since 4 January. It goes into greater detail than the @Grok message, making clear there will be sweeping restrictions across the @Grok account and the Grok button inside the X app, with the separate Grok app also expected to be included.How did the UK government react?A Downing Street source described the move as a “vindication” for the prime minister. Keir Starmer has called the flood of stripped images “disgusting” and “shameful”. The UK tech secretary, Liz Kendall, said she welcomed the move but still expected the facts behind what happened to be “fully and robustly established” by an ongoing investigation by Ofcom into X’s behaviour.Last week the government said it would support Ofcom if it decided to use the full suite of its powers under the UK’s online safety laws, including aUK-wide ban of the platform.Does X’s announcement make a UK ban less likely?Yes. A ban was always the nuclear optionunder the Online Safety Act(OSA) and is supposed to be reserved for serious, ongoing breaches of the law. X appears to have addressed this with its announcement.“If the technical measures that X has taken work then banning the platform is reduced as a possibility,” says Lorna Woods, a professor of internet law at the University of Essex.Does X still face punishment?Ofcom released a statement on Thursday saying it was still investigating X, which means it can still be punished.“This is a welcome development,” the regulator said of the changes. “However, our formal investigation remains ongoing. We are working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what’s being done to fix it.”X remains under investigation for the circumstances around theintimate image torrent, which started in December and accelerated after Christmas.Ofcom is focusing on whether X has breached the act in the following ways: failing to assess the risk of people seeing illegal content on the platform; not taking appropriate steps to prevent users from viewingillegal contentsuch as intimate image abuse and child sexual abuse material; not taking down illegal material quickly; not protecting users from breaches of privacy law; failing to assess the risks X may pose to children; and not using effective age checking for viewing of pornography.If it is found to have breached the act under those circumstances, X still faces the prospect of a fine of up to 10% of global turnover or being forced to take specific steps to comply with the OSA.What is the likely outcome?This is Ofcom’s highest-profile investigation yet, so it could fine X to send an example to others if it is found to have been in breach of the act. Alternatively, it could decide that X is now in compliance with the act and move on, as it did with Snapchat on Thursday.Ofcom announced it had raised concerns that the platform had failed to carry out an adequate risk assessment related to illegal content appearing on the site. It said Snapchat had addressed its concerns as part of the enforcement process, made changes, and it had decided that no further action would be taken.Nonetheless, if X is found to have breached the act, Ofcom may feel the need to issue a fine as a precedent.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXOfcomSocial mediaAI (artificial intelligence)Internet safetyexplainersShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Joe Rogan’s comparison of US immigration raids to Gestapo operations, made during a podcast episode earlier this week, has sparked speculation about whether the wildly popular podcaster, who endorsedDonald Trumpin 2024, has fully soured on Trump’s presidency – and what that might say of the millions ofmainlyyoung men who listen to Rogan’s show.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Rogan’s views, as expressed in the podcast discussion, were more complicated than the Gestapo remark taken alone might make them seem. Yet even his more measured skepticism aboutImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)raids feels somewhat significant, given Rogan’s cultural status and the evidence that Americans in general areturningagainst Trump’s hardline anti-immigration efforts.The Joe Rogan Experience is the biggest podcast in the United States, by most metrics, and political observers track it with keen interest. Rogan’s enormous listenership makes him a powerbroker for the digital age; his publicly stated decisions to vote for Bernie Sanders in 2020 andDonald Trumpin 2024 are considered at least as significant as traditional political endorsements.But it is also because of a perception that the everyman Rogan, whose views do not map neatly onto either major party, is an avatar for millions of politically fluid, vaguely centrist Americans – a weathervane whose shifts might, like a groundhog emerging from his burrow, predict looming changes in the ideological weather.As Ben Burgis, a leftwing writer and academic, recentlyput it: Rogan is “America’s most famous swing voter”.Many heads in the political and media worlds turned when Rogan asked during an episode of his show released on Tuesday: “Are we really going to be the Gestapo? ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”The remark happened during a nearly three-hourconversationwith Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, in which he and Rogan had been discussing the death ofRenee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent during an altercation earlier this month in Minneapolis.Trump says Renee Good probably a ‘wonderful person – but her actions were pretty tough’Read moreGood was a volunteer “legal observer” who had been tracking ICE operations from her car when agents approached her. During a brief verbal confrontation, Good started driving her car; an agent responded by shooting her through the car’s windows.The tragedy, which was widely caught on video, has become a political football. Progressives argue that Good was merely confused, while the Trump administration and some rightwing commentators insist that the agent acted in self-defense. Last year, that same agent was dragged 300ft by a car while trying to detain a motorist,accordingto the Minnesota Star Tribune.CNNandthe Hillhave described Rogan’s remarks on Tuesday as evidence that he is breaking with Trump. What Rogan actually said was slightly more ambivalent. During the segment, he described himself as frustrated by the political debate over immigration because he could “see both perspectives”.Conservatives believe that people in the country illegally must be deported “because if we don’t … it’s going to accelerate”, he said, whereas progressives say: “Yeah, but you don’t want militarized people in the streets just roaming around, snatching people up, many of [whom] turn out to actually be US citizens that just don’t have their papers on them. Are we really going to be the Gestapo? ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to? So it’s … more complicated than I think people want to admit.”While explaining the conservative point of view, Rogan also appeared to agree with an unproven belief, held by some on the right, that the Biden administration deliberately indulged illegal immigration to rig Democratic electoral prospects. Recent reporting by the New York Times has suggested that the Biden administrationgrossly mismanagedthe border crisis, but that it did somore out of incompetenceand fear of alienating progressive constituencies than any deliberate political conspiracy.When Paul argued that ICE raids were partly the left’s fault because “sanctuary cities”, such as Minneapolis, have not cooperated with federal immigration authorities seeking to deport serious criminals, Rogan pushed back slightly.“I think most liberals are in favor of getting rid of gang members, criminals, murderers, rapists,” Rogan said. “Most people are in favor, right?”“But the thing is, is that the leftwing cities that are sanctuary cities are not reporting [these suspects],” Paul said. “That’s part of the reason why ICE is in Minnesota.”Rogan then seemed to agree. “A good example of that … is Aurora, Colorado,” he said, “whereTren de Araguawastaking overapartment buildings.”Since last year, a number of prominent male comedy and talk-show podcasters who had previously endorsed Trump havewalked backtheir support, including Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Schulz. Trump’s immigration policies have been a particular source of alienation.In March, responding to the news that agay stylist and makeup artistseeking asylum had been deported, Rogan said: “If you want compassionate people to be on board with you, you can’t deport gay hairdressers seeking asylum – that’s fucking crazy – and then throw them in an El Salvador prison.”Von learned that his image had been used in US Department of Homeland Securitymessagingwithout his knowledge in September. In a later deleted post, he wrote on Twitter/X: “Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”Tucker Carlson, the rightwing commentator, podcaster and former Fox News anchor, has also criticized the Trump administration, though mainly in relation to what he views as the US’s illegitimate support for Israel. In a recentnewsletter, however, he also criticized the killing of Good and the conservative response to her death.“Did we disagree with her views on immigration? Probably,” he wrote. “But that shouldn’t matter. Her death is a tragedy, regardless of her partisan affiliations, ideological beliefs, or who pulled the trigger.A woman got shot in the face.How come so few conservatives are viewing this story through a human lens?”Explore more on these topicsJoe RoganDonald TrumpICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Minnesota ICE shootingUS immigrationTrump administrationPodcastinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Has anyone ever been more legendary than Harriet?April O’NeillThu 15 Jan 2026 11.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 11.56 ESTShareWednesday’s episode ofThe Traitorswas explosive: Matthew’s recruitment deal with Traitors Stephen and Rachel “confirmed”, James stealing a shield, Rachel revealing her “FBI training”. But let it be known, if I ever go missing I want Harriet Tyce on the case. Her behaviour was nothing short of Shakespearean – dropping the secret writer and criminal barrister bomb, calling out Rachel against the dramatic backdrop of a gothic chapel, publicly prosecuting her at breakfast then presenting nothing but vibes-based evidence at the round table. To top it all off, she is the first Faithful in the show’s history toaskto be banished simply to prove a point. I fear Harriet is operating on levels of camp no TV show has ever seen before.It’s a common trend that emerges every season: a woman over 50 captures the nation’s heart and becomes a viral sensation, elevated to “mother” status by fans. And this mother is always powerful, outspoken and often utterly incomprehensible. In series one, we had Amanda Lovett, the then 54-year-old estate agent turned Traitor, masking her ruthless “Welsh dragon” instincts behind a clueless appearance. Series two brought us Diane Carson, the 63-year-old Faithful and former teacher, who came armed with blunt directness and a ginger bob only to be offed by fizzy rosé as Ross, her secret son, took part in her funeral procession. Turn to 70-year-old Linda Rands in series three, a retired opera singer who clung on as a Traitor until episode seven despite blunders so blatant they made billboards.View image in fullscreenNothing short of Shakespearean… Harriet Tyce on The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/PAIn this series, I thought we couldn’t get better than Fiona, the 62-year-old local government officer who totally flew under the radar, fooling not only Traitors Rachel and Stephen but the audience with her sweet, chatty mumsiness – only to be the Secret Traitor. I thought her swift transformation from cunning liar to total kamikaze, gunning for fellow Traitor Rachel out of nowhere in front of the whole castle, was the peak of television. But with Fiona banished, 52-year-old Harriet clearly saw a gap in the market and took matters into her own hands.View image in fullscreenKeeping mum … Diane Carson from series two of the UK Traitors.Photograph: BBCHarriet entered that chapel as a woman on a mission, swiftly wiping the smug grins off Rachel and Stephen’s faces as she scoffed at their responses (“I think that this answer is not worth the paper on which it’s written”), turning that confessional booth into the witness stand. After she told Rachel “the gig is up” and taunting the Traitors for not murdering her earlier, the nation held its breath as she marched into breakfast, overruling calls for a private chat, to totally annihilate her fellow player. Gone was the controlled eloquence of the courtroom she used to uncloak Hugo: Harriet didn’t just drop a “truth bomb”, she went straight to nuclear.Was it a bit wild? Yes, but that is what makes her iconic. What these women share is that they are fearless and brazen, if not always on the right track. They don’t just fade into the background like many players have done – there’s always a handful you never quite learn the name of – they throw themselves into the spotlight, all guns blazing to find answers. Be they Traitor or Faithful, they take action. And make brilliant television.View image in fullscreenForce to be reckoned with … Celebrity Traitors contestant Celia Imrie.Photograph: Cody Burridge/BBC/PAThe fan fervour comes from a place of underestimation. Despite Fiona telling us to “never underestimate a woman of a certain age” in her banishment speech, we’re still shocked that these women can cause such chaos and be so gloriously compelling. No one thought 73-year-old national treasure Celia Imrie would get stuck right into the missions on The Celebrity Traitors, and no one expected Harriet’s calm control to tip over into fiery brilliance by asking the cast to “call her bluff” and vote her out to prove that she is a Faithful (and Rachel a Traitor). There is nothing more legendary – nothing more “mother” – than sacrificing yourself to prove you’re right.Well, partly right: Harriet’s assertion that there are four, maybe even five, Traitors is so far off the mark it makes her performance border on farce. But her tunnel-vision brilliance and forceful cross-examinations cement her in the show’s hall of fame. Before tonight’s episode, I ask the remaining Faithfuls to heed Harriet’s parting words: “Do not let this sacrifice be in vain.”Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s entirely AIRead moreThe pros and cons of chatbot guidanceAI-driven goal-setting isn’t inherently good or bad, explains Zainab Iftikhar, a Brown University PhD candidate, whoseresearchexamines artificial intelligence and users’ wellbeing. Artificial intelligence can lower the barrier to self-reflection and be genuinely empowering for some, she explains. For people who feel stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure of where to begin, prompts “can act as a scaffold” for expressing and understanding your ideas, says Iftikhar.If the AI has access to information you’ve either shared or asked it to generate, it’s also an efficient tool at synthesizing that information, explains Ziang Xiao, an assistant professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. The compilation and interpretation of your previous data could help you efficiently organize the thoughts that initiate your goals.But there are also drawbacks to using AI for goal-setting, says Iftikhar. Navigating the potential harms can come down to how well you know yourself – and how well you can navigate bad AI advice.The risks of using AI for personal growthBecause large language models (LLMs), the type of AI that drives these systems, are trained on large-scale human-generated data, they can reproduce assumptions about success, self-improvement and relationships, Iftikhar explains. LLMs are also predominantlytrainedon English text and tend toexhibit a biastoward western values.AI-suggested goals risk being over-generic, reinforcing “dominant cultural narratives, rather than what is meaningful for a specific individual”, says Iftikhar.It can be very difficult to detect this bias. AI chatbots can be persuasive in a way that individuals may have difficulty detecting if they are being nudged toward mismatched goals, says Xiao. These tools may “inappropriately affirm goals that may not actually be a great fit for you”, he says.Even if you use a chatbot frequently and request that it specifically base its responses on previous conversations, there’s still a chance that the chatbot’s replies will incorporate insights that have nothing to do with the information you’ve already shared, he explains.During her research, Iftikhar noticed that the people who are routinely correcting or ignoring bad AI responses are at an advantage in using AI itself. Those who are not, for a variety of reasons, including technical expertise, are “more likely to suffer from incorrect or harmful responses”, she explains.AI can also reflect the bias of the user asking it for guidance. In a 2024study, Xiao and colleagues observed that LLM users were more likely to become trapped in an echo chamber, compared with those who use traditional web searches.AI chatbots are designed to make us happy, explains Xiao. In a 2025paperpublished in the journal npj Digital Medicine, researchers show LLMs often prioritize agreement over accuracy. These tools are typicallyoptimizedwith human feedback that rewards agreeableness and flattery.In turn, chatbots engage in sycophancy, or excessive agreement, with users. (In May 2025, OpenAIannouncedit was rolling back an update that made ChatGPT too sycophantic.)How to be better at goal-setting with AIIftikhar says it’s worth being wary of tools that skip self-reflection or emotional processing in favor of tidy action plans.That said, AI can help brainstorm the actionable goals we want to set for ourselves, says Emily Balcetis, an associate professor of psychology at New York University. She recommends prompting AI to consider what obstacles you might face as you attempt to accomplish these goals, as well as back-up plans you might need.“Have it be a collaborator in how you’ll track your progress and monitor performance along the way,” says Balcetis.Xiao recommends critically analyzing the chatbot’s responses – and then giving it feedback. Does this plan actually fit with your life? Is it aligned with your priorities and hopes?“Try to give informative, quality feedback to the AI just as you would give feedback to another person,” says Xiao. “This process will help AI generate a more personable, realistic goal and help you consider the things that you really want.”Are you taking supplements correctly? Here’s a guide on their dosage limitsRead moreGood goal-setting also includes a review of why you haven’t pursued these goals already, explains EJ Masicampo, an associate professor of psychology at Wake Forest University.“When it feels like we’re failing at a goal, it’s often that we’ve just prioritized the other things we’re trying to do,” says Masicampo. Multiple goals are difficult to juggle, he explains. It can be more productive to examine one ambition and what’s obstructing your motivation to achieve it.Ultimately, chatbots may work best as reflective partners, albeit partners that don’t actually care about your success.“These tools sound very human-like, but by design, they can’t take responsibility for your actions,” says Xiao.For better or for worse, that is up to you.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAI (artificial intelligence)ChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Washington, Trump and his wrecking crew were already busy razing every last brick of Joe Biden’s legacy, but in Brussels, the Democratic exiles put on a brave face. They summoned the comforting ghosts of white papers past, intoning old spells like “worker-centered trade policy” and “middle-out bottom-up economics”. They touted their late-term achievements. They even quoted poetry: “We did not go gently into that good night,” Katherine Tai, who served as Biden’s US trade representative, said from the stage. Tai proudly told the audience that before leaving office she and her team had worked hard to complete “a set of supply-chain-resiliency papers, a set of model negotiating texts, and a shipbuilding investigation”.It was not until 70 minutes into the conversation that a discordant note was sounded, when Adam Tooze joined the panel remotely. Born in London, raised in West Germany, and living now in New York, where he teaches at Columbia, Tooze was for many years a successful but largely unknown academic. A decade ago he was recognised, when he was recognised at all, as an economic historian ofEurope. Since 2018, however, when he published Crashed, his “contemporary history” of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, Tooze has become, in the words of Jonathan Derbyshire, his editor at the Financial Times, “a sort of platonic ideal of the universal intellectual”.Though he still teaches history, Tooze is also widely acknowledged as an expert on the infrastructure of global finance and the economics of the green-energy transition. He is the rare commentator who can speak credibly about the political economy of Europe, the US andChina, and he has been an outspoken advocate on issues ranging from central-bank reform to Palestinian rights. In addition to being the author of five books, he writes regular columns and essays for outlets like the Financial Times and the London Review of Books, hosts podcasts in English and German, and publishes a wildly popular and influential Substack newsletter called Chartbook, which he sends out daily in English to more than 160,000 subscribers, including Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, and Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary. Chartbook also goes out in a Chinese-language version that, Tooze estimates, received 30m total impressions last year.Yet for all that, and despite being motivated occasionally by what he calls “an energy of wanting to put the world to rights”, Tooze is not generally regarded as an eager controversialist. (Last year, Krugman sounded delighted to see “the normally calm Tooze come across as a bit angry” in one of his Chartbook posts.) In person as in his work, Tooze prizes connection and synthesis, a tendency that helps explain why he is equally at home, and equally welcome, talking to activists in South Africa, or senators in Washington, or development economists in the West Bank, or financial executives in London, or Chinese Communist party officials in Beijing, or finance ministers in Berlin.It was notable, then, that after joining the Brussels panel, Tooze didn’t waste much time before stating flatly that the Biden team had “failed in its absolutely central mission, which was to prevent a second Trump administration”. Not only that, he argued, but the dismantling of the liberal world order – something discussed with much rueful lamentation at the conference – had been hastened, not hindered, by the Biden veterans on stage. Ashe’d writtena few months earlier,Tooze saw Biden no less than Trump aiming “to ensure by any means necessary” – including strong-arming allies – “that China is held back and the US preserves its decisive edge”.“I feel the need to say something,” Tai said, when Tooze was finished. She recalled a parable Martin Sheen had delivered in front of the White House during the 25th anniversary celebration of The West Wing, the haute-liberal political fantasia that remains a touchstone for professional Democrats. Sheen’s story concerned a man who shows up at the gates of heaven and earns an admonishment from St Peter for his lack of scars. “Was there nothing worth fighting for?” St Peter asked the man. Tai turned the question on Tooze: “Where are your scars, Adam? I can show you mine.”Recalling this exchange several months later, Tooze was still flabbergasted. “I’d be silly if I didn’t admit that it was a bruising encounter,” he told me recently, in one of three long conversations we had over the past year. Nevertheless, he said, “it confirmed my underlying theory about what was going on. These were a group of entirely self-satisfied American liberal elites who were enacting a morality tale in which Sheen and The West Wing and that whole highly sentimental vision of power and politics is a central device. She says this, I think, meaning to sound tough, like, ‘I’m the warrior. Who are you? You’re just some desktop guy.’ Which just shows how little she understands what I’m saying, which is: ‘You people are a bunch of sentimental schmucks who don’t understand that you lost. If you had any self-respect, you would not be on any podium again, ever, sounding off about anything. Because comrades, if we were in the 30s, I would have taken you out and shot you. You fail like this, you don’t get to come back and show off your wounds.’”Though it’s difficult to remember now, there was a time when Joseph R Biden was hailed as a president with the transformative potential of a Franklin D Roosevelt or a Lyndon B Johnson. During the 2020 campaign, Biden had positioned himself explicitly as the moderate alternative to both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. After the election, however, he quickly made clear that he did not intend to govern as a doddering centrist placeholder. He seemed particularly keen to flatter the aspirations of the left wing of the Democratic party, which, despite Sanders’ defeat, was experiencing its most significant resurgence in half a century.The early days of Biden’s presidency saw what appeared to be a new rapprochement between centrist liberals and the rising left. Tooze, a self-described “left-liberal”, was perhaps the representative intellectual figure of this development. Some of this had to do with Crashed, which established him as a leading economic commentator and found an admirer in Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate Democrats. Some of it also had to do with Tooze’s longstanding interest in climate policy, which was shaping up to be a central focus of the Biden administration. And some of it, too, had to do with a belated but intense engagement with Twitter, which he joined in 2015 at the urging of his daughter (then a teenager) when he was in his late 40s, where he soon gained a huge following.Five years after Biden’s inauguration, the political atmosphere in the US could not be more different. Yet Tooze remains no less relevant as an intellectual force. Whereas once he had personified the appeal of high-technocratic expertise – the feeling that if you could just read widely enough and understand deeply enough, you might be able to chart a sensible approach to crises like climate change – today Tooze stands as one of the more eloquent analysts of a new and confusing world order.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend the Victory Day military parade at Red Square in central Moscow on 9 May 2025.Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/AFP/Getty Images“My basic wager in interpreting modern history is to bias toward the thought that it might be unprecedented,” Tooze told me. “I’m interested in the way the present continuously breaks us. It challenges us. It does not, when you’re honest and serious about it, confirm what you know.” In The Deluge,his 2014 book about the legacy of the first world war, Tooze described the way early-20th-century world leaders confronted “the radical novelty” of a world in which the US economy was newly dominant. These days, Tooze spends most of his time tracking a dynamic that he believes is similarly unprecedented and consequential: the rise of China as an economic superpower.In Tooze’s view, what he calls the “radicalism of the present” keeps many people, including policymakers, from seeing the world as it actually is. Hence his argument to the Brussels panel that Biden and his staff were not the defenders of the liberal world order that they imagined themselves to be. Hence, too, theclaim he madein this newspaper, a few weeks before the 2024 election, that “Bidenomics [was] Maga for thinking people”. And hence his belief that – even though the past year has seen the darkest warnings of the Biden and Harris campaigns come to gruesome fulfilment – the American liberal obsession with Trump is too often framed in terms borrowed from decades past. “Why can’t we have new bad things?” he asked me at one point. “Like really new, really bad things?”Though he only leads two courses a year at Columbia, Tooze still thinks of himself primarily as a teacher. His job, he told me, “is to help people understand the situation that we’re in, as clearly as we can. It’s to go, ‘Look at this, look at this: what does this tell us if we pin our eyes open and don’t flinch and don’t blink?’ And then to say that out loud.”Aglance at Tooze’s family tree or his sterling CV makes it tempting to imagine his career as an untroubled glide among warm updrafts carrying him along from the day he was born. In conversation he does not obscure his many privileges: the fact, as he puts it, that he is “the product of five generations of university-educated women”, or that his mother’s parents were wealthy cosmopolitans who published influential reports on nutrition and took Le Monde as their daily newspaper, or that his father was a prominent molecular biologist.Yet Tooze’s upbringing was more complicated than that sketch implies. His maternal grandfather, Arthur Wynn, was a civil servant who had also been – as Tooze and his family learned alongside the public in the 1980s – a Soviet spy. Tooze still speaks fondly of Arthur and his wife, Peggy; they are the joint dedicatees of Wages of Destruction, his 2006 book about Nazi economics. But he also describes Arthur as “a tough, tough, mean son of a bitch”.Tooze describes his father, John, as “a guy that got shit done” and also as someone with a well-deserved reputation for what we now call toxic masculinity: “I regularly would have people come up to me in life-science centres and say, ‘Does your name mean what I think it means?’ And then the reaction would be, ‘I’m sorry,’ or, ‘I hate your father.’”It was John’s work that took the family to Heidelberg in 1974, when Tooze was six years old. West Germany was reckoning with its Nazi past, and Tooze says that the ambient political atmosphere weighed heavily on his youth. “I spent a lot of time identifying with the perpetrator, asking myself what kind of a Heydrich I would have been.” At that time in that place, the question was far from abstract. “I went to school with Albert Speer’s grandson. We were the big science dignitaries that arrived in the little village outside Heidelberg where the Speers lived, and they made us welcome. My parents were invited to dinner, and the Speers said, ‘Do you need some furniture? Here’s a table.’ Literally the whole time we were in Germany we were eating off Albert Speer’s table.”The difficult legacy of the difficult men in his family ultimately steered Tooze away from economics, his first academic love. Though he was fascinated by the field, and good at it, he also recognised in it “an absolutely toxic culture”. By the time he graduated he knew he had to leave the discipline. “I had a terrible relationship with my father, and I couldn’t be around that kind of academic man,” he says.View image in fullscreenAdam Tooze in 2018.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianWith this resolution in mind, Tooze moved back to West Germany in 1989, just in time to see the Berlin Wall come down. That experience was something other than exhilarating: “I was quite shaken by it, to be honest, because I realised at that point that the West German bubble that I’d grown up with was disappearing before my eyes.” Like Brexit a quarter-century later, Germany’s reunification “massively destabilised” the hybrid identity he’d built for himself.In the newly unified Germany, Tooze did historical research that ultimately prompted him to undertake a doctorate in history at the London School ofEconomics. The change in field suited him, but it did not exactly settle his existential unease. It was not until he got a teaching job at Cambridge, after his PhD, that he felt entitled to start assembling a library of his own. “Before that I felt so insecure. I didn’t feel I should own anything permanent.”Though he was writing books for general audiences, even as late as 2015 Tooze was still, in his self-deprecating description, “a secret name that grad students knew about”. Crashedchanged all that. The book had its origins in a seminar on the philosophy of history he taught at Yale, which included a group of students who were involved in left politics. “Working with that cluster really just changed my life,” Tooze says, not least because it reawakened in him a political impulse that had more or less fallen dormant. The class showed Tooze that there was an opening for a comprehensive account that would help his new friends on the left understand what had happened during the financial crisis.Gillian Tett, Tooze’s fellow columnist for the FT and the provost of King’s College, Cambridge, his alma mater, told me that “before 2008, it was incredibly hard to get a picture of how the entire global financial system worked as a single organic unit”. In Crashed,Tooze analysed the global economy as a matrix of interrelated corporate balance sheets, rather than as a point-to-point comparison of national economies. Tett says that this approach gave him “a very good overarching framework” for analysing how money actually moved around the world, which proved crucial for understanding the crisis.Joseph Stiglitz, a colleague of Tooze’s at Columbia who won a Nobel prize in Economics in 2001, says that being a historian gave Tooze “a big advantage” in analysing the crisis. Modern economics tends to focus on mathematical models, an approach that, while fruitful in some cases, often struggles with multifaceted events like the financial crisis. “The world is complicated, and when you put all the pieces together, the mathematical model becomes so difficult that you can’t understand it,” Stiglitz told me recently. For Tooze, by contrast, “the freedom from the constraints of writing down a fully articulated mathematical model gave him the ability to give a true story of what was going on”.View image in fullscreenThe Euro Dollar options trading pit after the Fed Interest Rate announcement at the CME Group in Chicago.Photograph: M Spencer Green/APCrashed was published in 2018, two years after Trump’s first electoral victory prompted many Democrats to reconsider the party’s longstanding embrace of neoliberalism. Against the foundational neoliberal presumption that the point of politics is to serve the market, Toozesupplied a 600-page demonstration of the “irreducibly political” foundations of the global economic system. Crashed was especially popular among Democrats who wanted to argue that Obama’s fiscal caution in the wake of the 2008 crisis was responsible for the rise of Donald Trump. Tooze thinks the situation was more complicated than that, but he makes no secret of the fact that he wrote Crashed“under the influence of left Dems from whom I’d acquired this narrative of the basic conservatism of the Obama response to the crisis”.In 2019, Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate Democrats, invited Tooze to Washington DC, to address a caucus luncheon. Schumer’s interest reflected a new determination on the part of Democrats in Washington to test the Keynesian dictum that “anything we can actually do, we can afford”. Tooze recalls the senator engaging him in a conversation after his keynote. “Schumer said: ‘OK, Tooze, am I hearing you right? Are you saying that what we should be doing here is focusing on a massive investment surge? We should not be prioritising debt as a main concern? I said, ‘Yeah.’ He looked around at three people in the audience and said, ‘Do you hear what this guy’s saying? Next time we have a chance, we go big.’ I walked out and went, ‘Jesus Christ, did that just happen?’”Crashed vaulted Tooze into what he calls a “global existence” that has him travelling frequently and speaking earnestly about the community of people he runs into at conferences and in airport lounges around the world. Though not a journalist – with a few exceptions, his contemporary histories rely on documents more than interviews – Tooze shares the journalistic impulse to see “policy processes reasonably up close”. He also clearly enjoys being a sounding board for people with the power to set national, continental and even global agendas: “They have the sense that you understand the way in which these pieces move. And so you become a point of confidence, somebody they feel they can speak to openly because you clearly get it,” he told me.When Covid hammered the global economy in March 2020, Tooze recognised echoes of the events he had written about in Crashed. “The crazy thing was,” he told me, “we all knew we were playing a version of 2008, but it wasn’t quite the same and somebody needed to explain how. There’s a handful of people in the world that are going to try to explain this to people, and one of them is me.” A month later, in the Guardian – and later in his book Shutdown, published in 2021–hedid just that, detailing the unprecedented measures central banks deployed to stave off a total collapse. All through the early months of the pandemic, he says, “there were days when I was publishing two things a day: the Guardian, the New York Times, the FT. This was before I was doing Chartbook. I wasn’t sleeping.”In Germany, when Olaf Scholz was finance minister, Tooze was invited to speak on panels to provide intellectual support for Scholz’s efforts to move the ministry away from its traditional fiscal conservatism. And in the spring of 2020, during the delicate negotiations over an EU pandemic-recovery plan, Tooze acted as an informal messenger between the German and Italian governments.In the US, meanwhile, Schumer continued to use Crashedas a policy playbook. “In the spring of 21, I started getting these texts from friends on the left wing of the Democratic party going, ‘You’re not going to believe this. I’ve just been in a meeting with Schumer and he said, we all have to read this guy, Tooze, on going big. Schumer was going, like, do you know this guy? T-O-O-Z-E?”View image in fullscreenPresident Joe Biden confers with his adviser Jake Sullivan during a roundtable at the White House, 2023.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesTooze says that Schumer’s staff stayed in contact with him throughout the drawn-out negotiations over what would become the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s signature climate bill. In 2022, he was summoned to the White House for consultations. He accepted the invitation – largely, he says, because “it’s the one and only time I’ll ever get to the White House, so whatever, let’s go and see.”The encounter was disillusioning. Already by that point Tooze had been frustrated with Biden on a number of fronts, including the compromises of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was vastly smaller than originally intended, “conservative in its political framing”, and “larded with concessions to fossil fuel interests”. Yet nothing seems to have disturbed Tooze quite as much as seeing what he calls the “narcissism” of the Biden team at close proximity. In all his many years of therapy, he told me – he has been seeing a therapist multiple times a week for a decade – there were only two occasions on which he sought help specifically in response to political incidents. One was Brexit – “if there’d been an armed-resistance wing I would have wanted to be Michael Collins,” he says – and the other was his encounter with the Biden administration.“Part of what motivated the unhinging of my relationship with the Biden people was being invited on to calls with their climate team,” he told me. He cited a conference call with Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, that took place in 2023, not long after a Chinese balloon drifted into US airspace and sparked an international incident that Tooze described in Chartbook as “the first, bona fide war scare of our new era of Sino-US confrontation”. On the phone call, he said, “It was just, ‘Oh Jake, you guys are rock stars.’ This was in the middle of the balloon incident, where we were sliding towards war and everyone in DC knew it.”One of Tooze’s friends, the novelist Zoe Dubno, told me that Sullivan is often “enemy number one” at Tooze’s dinner parties, where many of the guests, like Sullivan, are products of elite Ivy League educations: “He hurts everyone because they’re like, ‘That could be me. If we decided to be completely compromised fuckheads, that’s the kind of evil that is available to me.’”Despite his political flirtations on both sides of the Atlantic, Tooze says he has “a very ambiguous relationship to power”, an uneasiness he traces back to his lifelong effort not to be like his father. “The thing that haunts me is that I know perfectly well that I could be that kind of person in the world,” he said. For these reasons, he has tried to maintain an “obliqueness” and a “distance” from power. “I look at myself and say, a system which puts somebody like me in charge is a bad system.”Not everyone thinks this effort has been successful. In 2019, in the New Left Review, Perry Anderson, the venerable leftist historian, published a scathing 16,000-word review-evisceration of Tooze that took for its formal targets the loose trilogy comprising Wages of Destruction, The Deluge and Crashed, and ended up attacking his entire modus vivendi.The fiercest aspect of Anderson’s essay addressed Tooze’s politics. All three books, Anderson argued, share a telling fault: namely, a failure to reckon adequately with the deep forces that gave shape to the events he described. In Wages of Destruction and The Deluge, Anderson says Tooze approaches each of his subjects “in medias res,dispensing with a structural explanation of its origins”.Anderson is a Marxist, and so it’s not particularly surprising that he was unimpressed by Tooze’s self-description as a “left-liberal”, a compound phrase that, he noted, “has often, perhaps typically, proved unstable”. Nor was it difficult to see how someone with Anderson’s theoretical views would decide that Tooze was no true leftist at all.View image in fullscreenBulldozers working to level the ground at the construction site of a wind and solar power base in Kubuqi Desert in May 2024, Ordos, Inner Mongolia of China.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesBy the end of the essay, however, that latter judgment has expanded well beyond the content of Tooze’s books into a sneering indictment of his whole public existence. The breadth of interests, audiences and sympathies that for so many of Tooze’s admirers mark his signal virtue stood for Anderson as proof of his political unreliability. “Tooze spreads himself widely, and his accents and formulations vary from place to place,” Anderson wrote. “That’s often the price of a growing reputation [and] shouldn’t be taken too seriously. To criticisms of inconsistency, he can in any case reply quite reasonably that nothing he has written falls outside the parameters of a basic commitment to liberalism as it has developed in the west from the time of Wilson and Lloyd George to that of Geithner and Macron.” (In the context of the New Left Review, these points of comparison could hardly be more damning.)Anderson’s implication that Tooze is essentially keeping two sets of books – one set of accounts for his lefty graduate students, another for his discussion partners at Davos – becomes the basis for his essay’s bitter final judgment: “In today’s world, the question can be asked: how far does that differ from running with the hare and hunting with the hounds – indignant sympathy for the hare, awed admiration for the hounds?”Tooze does not hide the devastation he felt on reading Anderson’s essay, or the fact that he still thinks about it often. He told me that his disorientation had much to do with his longstanding admiration for his antagonist. Tooze has subscribed to the NLR since his 20s, has written for it several times, and says he always read Anderson’s essays “religiously”.Perhaps predictably, Tooze rejects much of Anderson’s critique. He is also plainly offended that his attempt to be honest about who he is, and where he’s coming from, was taken by Anderson as a kind of shiftiness, or even hypocrisy. Over the past decade or so, Tooze’s politics have shifted notably leftward. Yet Tooze still feels it imperative to acknowledge “how deeply I am the product of the circumstances I was raised in”. As he put it to me at his office, last April, “I take that more seriously than the average academic leftist. Because I don’t imagine that by virtue of thinking a bunch of radical thoughts, I can get more than a little bit of the way towards escaping my professional upper-middle class identity. I’m a senior professor at an immensely rich private university. Where do I get off kidding myself about this?”In another conversation, in October, Tooze noted that he had done “a lot of activism around green politics and central banking and naming and shaming the IMF economists”. His voice rose to an exasperated pitch as he imagined a conversation with Anderson: “It’s like, ‘Show me your cards. Where the fuck have you been on any of these issues? What’s your position on climate? Where were you with the Green New Deal? Where have you been on Gaza?’”More surprisingly, Tooze said that Anderson’s attack helped him clarify his own principles and practices. Anderson used the phrase “in medias res” as a jab at Tooze’s neglect, as he saw it, of the deep political and economic forces that shaped his narratives. Yet Tooze has come to embrace in medias res both as “a very succinct summation of the challenge that I’m particularly interested in” and as a simple but profound description of the basic human situation. In his view, there is no escaping the middle of things: every one of us is born, lives and dies in a rushing flow of events that precedes us and will outlast us.He told me that he is not a Marxist in part because he thinks treating a body of theory produced in the middle of the 19th century as “the be-all and end-all” – a stable point from which one might stand outside history and discern its hidden forces and patterns – is “a lazy way of dealing with reality”. To accept the radicalism of the present, he says, means acknowledging that you can’t understand history before it happens: “If you’re in the middle of shit, you don’t actually know what the shit is that you’re in the middle of.”Last spring, Tooze became an American citizen. The decision predated Trump’s return to office and had mostly to do with the precarity Tooze felt previously: “If you’re in a green-card situation, you do not want to be arrested. And it is remarkably easy to get arrested in this country.” Nevertheless, he admits that he considered leaving the US after Trump was re-elected. He was particularly frustrated by the situation at Columbia. On the one hand, he was not eager to watch, as he had during Trump’s first term, another “ding-dong battle between Trump and indignant New York Times-reading liberals” on the faculty. On the other hand, he’d been appalled to see how many of his colleagues, including serious leftists, had gone quiet during the Gaza turmoil on campus.Tooze himself has been vocal in his defence of the rights of both Palestinians and pro-Palestinian protesters; an online watchlist featured video screenshots that showed him in an orange faculty vest at a 2024 Columbia protest. He acknowledged that he felt a freedom to speak his mind for “thoroughly bourgeois reasons”. Thanks to Chartbook, he said, which brings him more income than his salary at Columbia, “If I get fired from this job, I walk away. I’m totally fine.” Still, he was dismayed at how much the fear of losing their accumulated academic privileges had “constrained people in what they’ve been willing to say. They are so fucking scared of losing that. It’s disgusting how scared they are.”View image in fullscreenA column of Soviet era T-34 tanks drives across Red Square during the Victory Day military parade in central Moscow, May 2025.Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty ImagesTooze says he decided to stay in the US in large part because his daughter lives here. He was confirmed in that decision, however, by news that three of his former colleagues at Yale, Timothy Snyder, Marci Shore and Jason Stanley, were moving to Canada. “Their decision just radically clarified it for me. Because it’s absolutely the wrong decision in every respect: it’s wrong politically, it’s wrong ethically. Even if, as Tim Snyder has claimed, it has nothing to do with politics, the optics are terrible. They should have deferred the move for 12 months.”Tooze is still reluctant to use the word “fascist” to describe Trump’s government, even as he recognises “the possibility of a kind of escalation here towards something truly catastrophic”. Tooze told me that his increasingly lonely resistance to that term has much to do with not wanting to shoehorn the present into the past. When I pressed him on the question, though, he also admitted a frustration with the kind of people who invoke the analogy, and the reasons they invoke it. He allowed that “fascist” might be a useful way to emphasise the radical character of Trump’s rule but said he still didn’t like the way the analogy encouraged the kind of smug moral satisfaction that he came to despise in the Biden administration. He noted that he keeps several models of Soviet T-34 tanks in his office at Columbia to remind himself, and his visitors, that it was not high-minded western ideals like democracy and freedom that defeated the Nazis in the second world war. “If you’re willing to admit that it was the Red Army that beat fascism,” Tooze said, somewhat grudgingly, “then you can have your fascism analogy.”Over the past year, in all the many parts of the Toozeosphere – the newsletters, the podcasts, the columns – Tooze has diligently tried to make sense of Trump’s second term. He has covered Trump’s tariffs, his Gaza peace plan, his abduction of Venezuela’s president, and his soya bean deal withXi Jinping. He has also wrestled publicly with one of the central questions that any analyst of this bizarre period in American history must confront: namely, whether the possibility of “making sense of Trump” is its own kind of delusion – sanewashing, as it’s sometimes called. Tooze doesn’t think so. Though Trump himself is “obviously a degenerate buffoon”, Tooze’s analysis goes further. “If it’s true that the key to decoding what’s going on is facelifts and boob jobs at Mar-a-Lago, why? How do we make sense of that?”Yet in our conversations as well as in his writing, he often seemed less than energised whenever the subject turned to Trump. He acknowledged as much. Though he sees Trump undertaking a “profound reshaping of American society”, Tooze also made it clear that he interprets Trump as a symptom rather than a cause of the US’s decline. And that decline, while consequential, is far less interesting to Tooze than the concomitant rise of China, which has recently become his all-consuming obsession.Working on Crashedconvinced Tooze that China was on a trajectory to overtake the US as the dominant global economic power, but he says there is also a generational component to his interest. While he travelled frequently to the US with his family as a child, “I just wasn’t twigged into the significance of what was going on in China.” He has lately felt himself rushing to catch up.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump greets Joe Biden as he arrives for inauguration ceremonies in the Rotunda of the US Capitol on 20 January 2025.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockThis summer and last, Tooze travelled to Tianjin and Dalian for the summer Davos meeting, and lately he has been taking Chinese lessons three times a week. That endeavour, Tooze says, was largely motivated by his relationship with a Chinese journalist and podcaster named Qing Wang: “Her fluency in English expanded this huge emotional world for us, and I really urgently want to reciprocate.” (Tooze has been married twice; he separated from his second wife in 2023.) In a Chartbook published last May, Tooze described using ChatGPT to help him translate Mao’s Little Red Book from Mandarin into Pinyin into English, “a dizzying experience” that ended with him watching DeepSeek, a Chinese AI engine, refuse to translate Mao once its censorship training kicked in: “Hello, I’m unable to answer this question at the moment. Let’s switch topics and continue our conversation!”Tooze says that learning Chinese has been a lesson in humility: “I am not super good at it. Being in China is hugely irritating if you’re a lower-intermediate level, because there’s so many characters you know you ought to know. It’s like having a mosquito bite on your brain like you’re constantly trying to itch.”One weeknight in October, Tooze gavea sold-out lectureto about 400 people at the New School, in Manhattan. He opened the lecture by recalling a “silent disco” experience he’d had in China over the summer, when he stood on a street in Chengdu and saw, but did not hear, hundreds of electric vehicles whiz past him. In that moment he realised that China’s transition to electric power was not some future prospect but a fait accompli.As he flipped through his presentation, which reproduced several graphs and quotations that had appeared in Chartbook, Tooze narrated a winding story about the transition from fossil fuels to green energy. As ever, he brought in an astonishingly wide range of references: quotes from late-20th-century social theorists like Ulrich Beck and Stuart Hall appeared on his slides, as did statistics about Prius sales and American natural-gas production.View image in fullscreenAerial view of goji berries planted under rows of photovoltaic power panels at an agrivoltaic integrated power project, Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesForty-five minutes into his talk, he showed one of his favourite graphs, which charts global coal production going back to 1700 – a summary, as he described it, of “the fossil fuel history of our species”. On the left side of the chart, up to 1850 or so, coal production everywhere is essentially a flat line. Between 1850 and 2000, the period of western industrial development, the lines for Britain, Germany and the US all leap off the baseline. But the point of the graph is the blue line that belongs to China, which ramps up starting in 1950, overtakes the US around 1990, and becomes almost a vertical line for a decade starting in 2000. Since 2010 China has produced at least three times as much coal per year as the US did at its peak.Tooze likes the graph because it demonstrates, in especially dramatic terms, a point he returns to often. What’s happened in China over the past 70 years – specifically the process of urbanisation powered by all that coal, which brought more than 800 million Chinese into cities – is simply unprecedented. Also unprecedented is the speed and scale of China’s green-energy rollout. As he put it on a slide in his lecture: “Chinaisthe climate crisis and its solution”.Tooze surprised me at one point by suggesting that he’s not even sure that climate is the biggest environmental problem the world is facing: “Biodiversity loss and pollution may do us in first.” Nevertheless, he said, the climate crisis is “happening with increasing speed, and it’s happening all over the world, and in the last 25 years it’s happening with that dramatic force because of China”.At the New School, Tooze made a similar argument. He cited another favourite statistic: whereas the US’s total installed solar capacity is on the order of 250GW, “China currently has the capacity to churn out 1,200GW of photovoltaic panels in a single year.” In those Chinese solar panels Tooze sees a climate-era analogue to the Soviet T-34 tanks. At development and climate meetings, he said, you can go a long time without hearing anyone acknowledge that China matters vastly more to the climate-change story than anything happening anywhere else, very much including the US. The point of all this, Tooze insists, is not to chasten liberal self-regard – or not only that. The point is to get people to confront our radical new reality.Tooze told me that the climate book he started working on after Crashed, which is now nearing completion, will argue “that if we’re serious in the west, if you’re serious about climate, then you have to face the popular front question”. In other words, many of the same countries that chose 80 years ago to ally with the Soviet Union to fight Germany will have to decide whether and on what terms they want to work with an economically dominant China on the climate problem.The last humanist: how Paul Gilroy became the most vital guide to our age of crisisRead moreTooze thinks there are two available choices. One involves a “truly escalated hard-power competition”. The other option involves finding an accommodation with Chinese partners that, as Tooze puts it, “include Stalinists – proper Stalinists”. He told me that while he sometimes gets accused of being a “useful idiot” for the Chinese Communist party, he is not naive about the regime. In Tianjin this summer, he was overcome by a “sadness” when seeing a massive conference centre that was under construction. “It’s as though you were watching the pyramids being constructed. The pyramids are very impressive, but you don’t get to see the forced labour. China right now is like watching the pyramids being constructed in real time. You see all of the inequality. You see the Pharaonic ambition. All along the edge of it you’ve got these people sleeping in their cars and slumped over their mopeds.“The moral weight of that is what we have to wrestle with,” Tooze says. Still, it’s clear which option he prefers. “My deep conviction is that the west needs to accept the end of its era of global domination. That doesn’t mean that we have to give up our own values, or not defend our own perfectly legitimate interests in our own system, or that we should not be absolutely clear-eyed about the nature of the Chinese regime.” What it does mean, he says, is embracing a deep realism of a sort that the west – and the US in particular – has never exactly been famous for. Actual progress, he believes, will require us to accept the humbling imperatives of the unprecedented present moment. As he put it in his New School lecture: “Ours is a bit part and not the starring role. We’re not the love interest. This song is not about us.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readEconomics (Business)Joe BidenDonald TrumpUS politicsEconomics (Books)Financial crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will it be big enough for the both of them? Keep watchingThu 15 Jan 2026 13.19 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareThe best thing right now would be to read the turmoil in the Tory party as told by the spy novelist Len Deighton. He would give us more detail on Robert Jenrick’s defection media-handling plan: a statement on what a future in Reform meant to him, how he’d wrestled with his decision to leave the Conservatives behind. Kemi Badenoch would discover it by a process of intricate deduction, rather than the more likely story – that some mischief-maker leaked it to her. The trail of clues would be ever more ominous, as Jenrick skipped opportunities to show loyalty to his party leader, mysteriously didn’t show for longstanding commitments. The betrayal would unfold slowly in scarce-to-be-believed fashion until, wham: someone saw his to-do list. Iron turquoise shirt. Call Sophy Ridge.Instead, Jenrick’sejection from his partyis slightly spoiled, from a storytelling point of view, by the chaos of conjecture and semi-analysis. What happened this afternoon was beyond Deighton. For hours, Nigel Farage would confirm only that he’d had conversations with Jenrick, and stated categorically that he hadn’t signed a deal with him. There were questions over whether Badenoch had successfully ruined Farage’s Westminster press conference, planned for 4:30pm today, where he would purportedly reveal Jenrick as his latest defector. And even more about what it would mean for Jenrick’s political ambitions, inside or outside the Tory party.And then, the press conference came. Farage insisted there was no imminent deal with Jenrick and that a defection, if it came at all, could be months off. Badenoch sacking Jenrick had been seen by some as evidence of her political nous, blindsiding both him and Reform. Torching this narrative and basking in his own opportunism, Farage said: “I want to say thank you to Kemi Badenoch. This is the latest Christmas present we have had. I welcome Robert Jenrick into this room and into Reform UK.” Except it was something of a wait for his latest Tory acquisition to step into the light – a vacuum Farage was forced to fill until his new champion arrived to applause. Theytook the applause and shared the stage, but there is an immediate question: how long will that stage be big enough for the both of them?Show some gratitude, people – Nadhim Zahawi has joined Reform for our benefit, apparently | Marina HydeRead moreFor all the bonhomie and jollity on display, it is a mixed blessing for Reform when senior Conservatives defect: while it solidifies its claim to be the new centre of rightwing gravity in British politics, it has staked that claim on the basis that it is the outsider, that it is the new breed. The more high-profile itsConservative joiners, the more it’s associated with (arguably tainted by) old eras of Conservatism, whether that’s Nadine Dorries as an emblem of the Boris Johnson era, or Nadhim Zahawi as lieutenant to every Tory prime minister since Theresa May.It’s hard to ignore the relational fallout, all the old enmities that will have to be skimmed over or forgotten. Farage hasexplicitly called Jenrick “a fraud”in the recent past, though of insults, my personal favourite was“he is no friend of Epping”. Zia Yusuf, Reform’s punchy former chair, has claimed on X that Jenrick is aFarage impersonator. It’s hard to imagine them working together harmoniously, but it’s often hard to imagine Reform’s leading lights working together at all, yet here they still are.As engrossing as these personal considerations are, there is nothing dramatic about this from the perspective of values. Jenrick spent most of last year establishing how comfortable he was around the tropes of the far right, whether that’s immigrants posing a threat to women and girls (specifically, hewrote in the Daily Mail, his daughters) or Birminghamnot having enough white peoplein it. He will fit in fine with Reform, as he would with the BNP.In an earlier press conference today, Farage sought to amp up the then rumoured defection as an earthquake for British politics,saying that“for all the talk that Kemi’s doing better at PMQs, for all the talk of a supposed Kemi bounce, on 8 May, the Conservative party will cease to be a national party”. Which would indeed be dramatic if the earthquake only happened this afternoon, but it’s been happening in slow motion since 2016 reshaped the Tory hegemony. Since May quit in despair, since the membership dwindled to its current hardcore, since its nativist and pop-con voices became dominant.Even through the return to sense that Rishi Sunak was supposed to represent, the party bears no resemblance to the unflappable, centre-right, establishment institution that historically defined its role. Do those mainstreamConservativesstill exist, the ones that put business interests first, who are open-minded about immigration in the service of growth, who want life on the poverty line to be hard but not unlivable, who liked Europe for its seamless trade and prosecco? There seem to be a few of them in the Labour party, but as voters, who’s to say; they are no longer represented, and therefore are invisible.Farage would have us believe that pragmatists and conservation-minded one-nation Tories are extinct, because of course he would; that effectively anoints him.

They say they have nothing to lose but their chainsThu 15 Jan 2026 12.25 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 12.32 ESTShareIt has been more than 40 years since I was imprisoned inIranfor speaking out against human rights abuses and state executions, and for defending women’s rights. I spent eight years behind bars in Iran’s notorious Evin prison. I was tortured. I remember it as if it happened yesterday.Every few years, uprisings erupt across Iran – and each wave of resistance is deeper and more widespread than the one before. In 2022, it was women who led theWoman, Life, Freedom movementafter the murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini by the country’s “morality police”, and it revolutionised my country. Today, women wear what they want, go out in public with their boyfriends – even live with them – without fear of being arrested. Women earned these rights with their lives. In late December 2025, the spark was once again lit – this timein an old bazaar in Tehran.The demands are the same ones we raised in the 1980s: an end to poverty, corruption and unemployment, the right to organise, and freedom from repression. Despite the gains for women’s freedoms made since 2022,workers are still denied basic labour rights. Students are arrested and even executed for peaceful protest.Womenare still fighting for fundamental rights. People are still risking their lives to stand up to torture and state violence.The regime’s response has been brutal. Human rights organisations report security forcesshooting into crowdsof largely peaceful protesters. I have seen heartbreaking images of families desperatelylooking for their loved onesamong hundreds of body bags. The true death toll remains unknown, but reports suggestmore than 2,000 peoplehave been killed. Given the scale of the protests and the footage of violent clashes, the real number is probably far higher.According to the Human Rights Activists news agency, by the end of the 17th day of protests18,434 people had been arrestedand, so far,97 forced confessionshave been broadcast on state television. These scenes bring back painful memories of my own imprisonment, where many people were tortured until they “confessed”. For survivors like me, moments like this reopen old wounds. I still see the faces of friends who were executed.The regime is terrorising civilians, burning shops and destroying beautiful, historic bazaars.Doctors are reportedly preventedfrom treating the wounded. Injured protesters are taken away from their hospitalbeds. But despite the killings, people are still in the street. They say they have nothing to lose but their chains.But the situation is changing so quickly. As of yesterday, military vehicles now patrol the streets in Tehran day and night, stopping anyone who dares go out. Only bakeries remain open, and people are leaving their homes only to buy the bare necessities.Now, Iran has been plunged intoan internet blackout. The regime wants to hide its crackdown from the rest of the world and stop Iranian people from organising. For those of us in exile, we wait in agony for news. I have not been able to reach my family and friends for more than a week. Watching the few grainy videos that reach us, survivors like me relive our worst nightmares.When I fled Iran, I left everything behind – my family, my friends, my home. I was lucky though, I survived. I rebuilt my life. Many others did not.Freedom fromTorturehas supported Iranian survivors like me for years, and in 2024 they assisted more people from Iran than any other country. For those who have escaped, the harrowing reports of brutality the world has been hearing since December are deeply triggering. We know exactly what the regime is capable of.My heart aches for my country. Iran has gone through half a century of war against its own people. Our society is deeply wounded, but the status quo cannot continue, because the Iranian people will never give up fighting for their rights and freedoms. Iran’s rulers use torture to silence dissent and instil fear. They tried to take my voice away because I dared to dream of equality and freedom. Today, I use that voice to speak out about the horrors that continue, and to ask the world to speak up for Iranian people.Since 2022, I’ve watched with dismay as global attention has drifted away from Iran. Silence only empowers those who torture and kill with impunity. The international community and the media must keep shining a light on what is happening.We must raise the political cost of executions. We must demand the release of political prisoners. We must insist that the use of torture ends right now. We must stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the Iranian people, in their struggle for what many of us in the UK take for granted every day: freedom, dignity and a life without fear.Nasrin Parvaz is a women’s rights activist and torture survivor from Iran.

In the UK, national morale feels all but shot. Politics commands little faith. Ditto the media. The idea that, as a country, we still have enough in common to carry us through – the idea embedded in Britain’s once potent Churchillian myth – feels increasingly threadbare.Welcome, in short, to the Britain of the mid-1980s. That Britain often felt like a broken nation in a broken world, very much as Britain often does in the mid-2020s. The breakages were of course very different. And on one important level, misery is the river of the world. But, for those who can still recall them, the 1980s moods of crisis and uncertainty have things in common with those of today.But – and here’s the point that needs to be grasped – those moods did not endure. Not everything was broken. With effort and tough judgment, we managed to get out of that place; imperfectly, because life is always imperfect; sometimes at a cost, though sometimes with reward; but nevertheless in real and significant ways. So the question is whether we can do something of the same kind now. I know we must. I also think we can.The world of the generation before last can slip into a collective memory hole. For me, growing up in the 1960s, that era was the 1920s. My mother recalled her Edinburgh father telling her with great solemnity: “The prime minister’s name is Mr Andrew Bonar Law.” I was a boyhood know-all, but it was a name I had never heard. I knew nothing about the 1920s until, as an adult, I started reading about them and grasping their importance.Here in the 2020s, it feels as if the 1980s may be slipping into a similar memory hole. The Britain of the 1980s, which was the Britain in which I first started working for the Guardian, was a country whose inherited assumptions were disintegrating. It had lost an empire, but too often still thought in imperial terms; was in the midst of a necessary but sapping cold war against the Soviet Union in a wholly divided Europe; and it was a country dependent for its security ona maverick US president. They were frightening times. Yet how benign Ronald Reagan now seems.It was a Britain, too, of the revolt against consensus, of rising unemployment, double-digit inflation, the collapse of great industries, overmighty trade unions and press barons, and the politicisation of what was then called law and order. Northern Ireland was in permanent unrest, and the IRA almostblew up the prime minister. Terrorism cast a real not a confected shadow.The point of saying this is not to play one era off against another. Nor is it to extol the answers of the 1980s, a low dishonest decade that would leave legacies of bitterness and dereliction alongside imperfect forms of renewal. But it is to say that we have been here before. What is more, we found a way out, a path forward.We must not turn the clock back, even if that were possible – although some still seem to believe it is. There is no golden age to reclaim, just as there is very little point in attempting to expunge history. There is no magic bullet policy answer either. Nor do I have time for heroes – well, Garibaldi maybe. Put not your trust in princes, as my matchless mentor, Hugo Young, said in our last meeting. Nevertheless, there are lessons to be learned and reapplied from those now distant years.One of the most important is that it is better to cooperate on things on which you can agree than to focus on the things that divide you. Historically, this is a huge lesson. What might have happened in Germany if the 1930s communist movement had tried to work with the social democrats and liberals against the fascists? Instead they perished in the same camps.A similar lesson applies to less apocalyptic times. Crucially, it applied and was slowly relearned in Britain after the divisions of the 1980s. At the start of that decade, the labour and socialist traditions and the liberal and social democratic traditions had split into separate parties. The result was a divided electorate and a succession of large Conservative majorities.But it was also a catalyst. The only solution was some form of reconciliation between the two traditions and with electoral reality. Neil Kinnock began that from the Labour side,moderating its offerto make it palatable to more moderate voters. The process then evolved into Tony Blair’s New Labour, with its tacit alliance with Paddy Ashdown’s Liberal Democrats.You can say it was far from perfect, and that would be true. New Labour was always too soft on market regulation and too self-interested about constitutional reform. You can say that, like most things in politics, it ended badly. You can criticise Blair all you want, and I would agree with some of it, including Iraq, butalso the foxhunting ban. But he found a path that mattered.NewLabourwon three elections in a row because it was willing to learn, change and cooperate, though in all cases not enough. It is an open question as to whether Labour and the other parties are willing to do something similar, and perhaps more radical – working not just with the Lib Dems but with the Tories on a programme of political reforms perhaps – in today’s very different circumstances. But change is the bottom line.Politicians have no alternative but to try. At the former police chief Ian Blair’s funeral last year, there was a reading from aTheodore Roosevelt speech of 1910. “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better,” Roosevelt said. “The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds.”The arena matters more than the grandstand. We should rally behind politics, not turn away from it. I hope that necessity will once again drive politics on the kind of process that emerged after the 1980s. Although this is my last regular weekly column for the Guardian after 41 years on the staff and after more than 30 years of writing these columns, I also hope from time to time I shall be able to return here, perhaps even to cheer that desperately needed process on.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionCold warRonald ReaganTony BlairLabourTrump administrationConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

The US president has once again threatened to take control of the world’s biggest island, just like he didback in 2019and in2024/25. Yet it feels different this time.This time it seems as if there are more concrete plans being shaped within the Trump administration to annex Greenland. Trump wants to “take” it“whether they like it or not”, as he stated at a recent White House press conference. And the only option he seems to be offering currently is to do it “either the nice way or the more difficult way” – whatever that means. These are obviously plans for the forceful theft of Indigenous land and a self-governing territory; they are loud threats against our democracy – threats that are coming directly from the US president, again and again, through the media. That is scary. And the Greenlandic people do not feel safe.A diplomatic conversation finally took placeon Wednesday. The foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, Vivian Motzfeldt and Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, met in Washington DC, with the US vice-president, JD Vance, as host. That’s the same JD Vance who tried to set up an official visit to Greenland with his wife in March last year, but wasturned away by Kalaallitand ended up only visiting the US military base atPituffik. The one who has been veryvocal about his dissatisfactionwith the EU and Denmark’s efforts in the Arctic. As you can imagine, this became the basis for a great deal of unease for Kalaallit, and everyone seemed to be holding their breath while waiting for some kind of clarity on what was in store for the future of Greenland as this historic meeting was happening.After about an hour at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the meeting was being held, the Greenlandic and Danish foreign ministers came out, lit a cigarette each, and had a chat before returning to the Danish embassy. It was an unexpected and surprisingly calming reaction that was noticed across the Kingdom of Denmark.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, speak to the media in Washington DC after a meeting with US senators, 14 January 2025.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersLater came the Greenlandic/Danish press conference, where Motzfeldt and Rasmussen announced that the US position hadn’t changed and that they had agreed to disagree. It was not a very satisfying statement. However, they also said that it had been agreed to establish a high-level working group to try to find a solution and accommodate some of the concerns the US president had expressed, regarding Arctic security. They added that they had also seized this opportunity to go against the untrue narratives about the Kingdom ofDenmarkthat the US has been pushing lately, and Motzfeldt had once again stated that Greenland does not want to become part of the US, but that this was a good opportunity to strengthen cooperation as allies. And I think most importantly she reported that the meeting had been characterised by a sense of mutual respect and a willingness to agree to meet further down the diplomatic road.Wednesday’s developments have created a brief moment to take a deep breath. But it is far from over. During the meeting, the White Houseposted a picture on X, showing two Greenlandic dog sleds having to make a choice between the sunny US or the stormy China and Russia (it also riffs on the “Which way western man?” meme, which is prominent infar-right subcultures). And Donald Trump stated, once again, that the US needed to take control of Greenland for security reasons. This unpredictability is scaring a lot of people – some are starting to prep in case of a US invasion; others are starting to consider emigrating. But for now, everyday life goes on.There is much speculation as to why Trump wants Greenland so much. Some say it is to get free access to therare earth minerals, as Greenland has very strict laws on mining and extraction. Others claim that it is for national and international security. However, the US already has a military base in Greenland and would be able to expand its military presence through the 1951 Greenland Defence Agreement if it wanted to. Plus, Denmark has recently increased its spending on security in the Arctic and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte finally revealed earlier this week that the alliance is working onstrengthening securityin the Arctic. Rutte had previously been criticised for his noticeable silence on this issue.Lastly for Trump, ownership is“psychologically needed for success”, because “ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document”. The truth is, we can only guess what the reasoning behind this madness is.Trump has said that the US will treat Greenlanders well. I doubt that will be the case. Because we also know that the president has a tendency to lie.There is great pressure on the Greenlandic people. We are constantly worrying whether our country will be taken by military force. We follow the news intently in fear of new threats. All eyes seem to be on us right now. We need to be clear: Greenland is not for sale.For a while, Greenland has been a warning sign to the rest of the world as to what to expect with the climate crisis, and unfortunately Greenland is now becoming a warning sign for what is happening in the world order. Things have changed in geopolitics. We’re hearing warnings on how democracy is at risk, how this decade everything is being reshaped. We witness how one Nato ally threatens another and gets away with it. This is alarming. So I think it is important to ask ourselves: what comes next? How far should we be willing to go to keep an unpredictable, insatiable ally content? And could this moment perhaps be seen as a chance for a critical self-reflection in colonial history?Malu Rosing is a Greenlandic writer and an Arctic adviserExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionUS foreign policyDenmarkDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

With four and a half years to go, one can’t say his chances of landing the retention payment – or “service award” – are good. In fact, it will be surprising if he’s still infuriating the residents of Tunbridge Wells four and a half weeks from now.In the latest episode of this long-running double saga of outages that has left thousands of households in Kent and Sussexwithout running waterfor days, Ofwat has opened a first-of-its-kind investigation into whether South East complied with its obligation to provide “high standards of customer service and support”. That comes a day after Emma Reynolds, the environment secretary, called for the regulator toreview the company’s operating licence.Meanwhile, even the company’s shareholders, who normally shun the spotlight on these occasions, are spluttering into their bottled water. NatWest Group’s pension fund, a 25% owner, said it was “extremely concerned” by the impact on customers and said it would use its influence “to direct South East Water’s board to ensure these issues are fully resolved”. That wasn’t quite an instruction for heads to roll, but it wasn’t far off.One can understand its alarm. Shareholders sank £200m in fresh equity into South East as recently as May, on top of £75m in December 2024, to support an over-extended balance sheet. Yet the company’s last annual report was still full of scary lines about how it needed “a more balanced regulatory settlement” to be able to “fulfil its purpose as a provider of the public water service now and in the future”. On that score, developments aren’t encouraging either: South East asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for an 18% uplift on the bill increase granted by Ofwat. However, in its provisional finding (the final is still awaited), the appeals regulatorallowed 4%.Against that strained financial background, it was vital that South East handled any operational crisis, such as two big outages in two months, slickly. We’ll see what Ofwat says but one doubts it will award the “eight out of 10” that Hinton gave himself when appearing before MPs this month. To outside eyes, he has served up a masterclass in how not to communicate during a crisis: he told MPs his reluctance to give interviews was in case he was asked distracting questions about his pay or shareholder dividends.There’s a lot to ask about. Why did South East’s board feel Hinton needed a performance-free £400,000 incentive to stay in post for five years, as the Guardianreported on Thursday? It had simultaneously just awarded him a 30% increase in his annual salary to the same level and reintroduced a long-term incentive scheme (on top of the annual bonus scheme) worth 150% of salary, which is the normal way to encourage executives. How many carrots does he need? Actually, one more: a one-off £50,000 “cash allowance” for work on the CMA appeal.Separately, Ofwat is running an engineering-related investigation into whether South East “failed to develop and maintain an efficient water supply system”. That one dates from 2023 and the outcome is due within weeks. The potential penalties are piling up. In the shareholders’ shoes, you’d get a new boss in there as soon as possible in the hope of saving your investment.Explore more on these topicsWater industryNils Pratley on financeExecutive pay and bonusesCorporate governancecommentShareReuse this content"

And they are in line with Trump’s willingness to use the national security state as a weapon against the press, which is a serious threat to our democracy. But those weapons were not invented by Trump nor did he pioneer their use against free press.The raid of Hannah Natanson, is a shocking escalation, not a rupture. The United States has been backsliding to this point – at both the federal and local levels – for quite some time.Following the publication of the Pentagon Papers, the Nixon administration turned to the first world war-era Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowerDaniel Ellsberg. Nixon’s illicit campaign against Ellsberg, modelled after techniques like break-ins then routinely used by the FBI and CIA, tanked the prosecution. But the Espionage Act sat as a loaded gun against both journalists and their sources. It went largely unfired until the Obama administration.The former constitutional law professor had promised the most transparent administration in history. Instead, his administration normalized the archaic Espionage Act as the go-to weapons for prosecuting journalists’ sources. Whistleblowers, such asChelsea Manning,Edward Snowden,Thomas DrakeandJohn Kiriakou,who helped journalists inform the public about war crimes, torture and unconstitutional surveillance, were transformed into criminals.Targeting journalists’ sources is an affront to press freedom. It also quickly leads to targeting journalists. The Obama administration attempted to compel the national security reporter James Risen to name his source about a botched CIA covert action, threatening him with jail if he refused to name names.While the Department of Justicebackedoff on incarcerating the prestigious journalist, they put his alleged source, Jeffrey Sterling, on trial. Although Sterling maintains his innocence, he was convicted in partbasedon metadata that showed he had called or emailed Risen.Surveillingjournalists is key to building cases against their sources.As bad as these prosecutions were, the government’spursuitof WikiLeaks took the threat to press freedom to a whole new level. WikiLeaks source Manning was subjected totorturousconditions of confinement and a then unprecedented prison sentence. But the government was not satisfied with persecuting the source alone. From the beginning, there was anattemptto pursue publisher Julian Assange, as well.Manyspeculatedthat the harsh treatment of Manning was an attempt to turn her into a witness against Assange. During Trump’s first term, the moribund case against the WikiLeaks founder was resurrected in the form of an unprecedented Espionage Act indictment. Some of those counts dealt with pure publishing; the vast majority alleged the journalist-source relationship constituted a criminal offense. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Justiceextracteda plea deal from Assange.According to the plea deal, Assange, by receiving and publishing newsworthy information from Manning about US war crimes, backroom dealings, and abuses of power, was guilty of conspiring with her to violate the Espionage Act.Routinely prosecuting whistleblowers under the Espionage Act, surveilling journalists to enable the prosecution of their sources, and ultimately prosecuting a journalist himself under the Espionage Act all created the condition Trump needs to go after the press – not just legally, but in the court of public opinion.As we saw last week with the bipartisancongressional subpoenaof journalist Seth Harp, Americans and their representatives in Congress have been primed to accept the administration’s nonsensical claims that reporting government secrets is illegal “leaking” and that naming government officials driving the world’s biggest news stories is illegal “doxing”.It wasn’t always so easy to sell lawmakers on criminalizing routine journalism. Congress passed thePrivacy Protection Act of 1980in response to a raid of the Stanford Daily to find evidence against student demonstrators. The Daily, like Natanson, wasn’t accused of a crime.The US supreme court rejected the Daily’s lawsuit challenging the search, but Congress stepped in, recognizing the dangers of allowing law enforcement to commandeer newsrooms whenever journalists might have evidence they want. Lawmakers may have also foreseen how pretextual raids and seizures could be used to intimidate journalists, or to stop their reporting in its tracks by seizing their drafts, communications and research.The PPA was supposed to put an end to that. But the law is relatively toothless – victims can sue, but government officials can assert a good faith defense that essentially amounts to saying “my bad”. The law does not expressly bar admission of illegally seized evidence. That means its efficacy largely depends on police, prosecutors and judges taking it seriously.Too often, they don’t. The 2023 raid of theMarion County Record– based on a bizarre claim that reporters violated identity theft laws by pursuing a tip about a local restaurateur’s driving record – became the most famous example after the paper’s co-owner Joan Meyer died from shock the next day.Reached by email, her son, Record publisher Eric Meyer, expressed alarm at the Natanson raid. “Have law enforcement officials lost the ability to read?” he asked, noting the repeated disregard for the PPA’s protections. “The whole idea of searches and seizures isn’t about actually finding information. It’s about intimidating journalists and incriminating them in the eyes of the public.”Also in 2023, the Florida journalist Tim Burke’s home newsroom was ransacked by the FBI over Burke’s alleged violation of computer crime laws to find outtakes of Tucker Carlson’s Fox News interview with Ye where the musician went on an antisemitic rant. Many of the government’s tenuous legal theories have beendismissed(an appeal is pending) but the impact on Burke’s journalism can’t be undone. As Burke’s lawyer, Mark Rasch, explained, during newsroom raids “the government invariably seizes materials wholly unrelated to whatever they are investigating. That act alone has a chilling effect on freedom of the press.”There have been other examples. Police in San Francisco raided the home and office of the independent journalist Bryan Carmody in May 2019. The case against Carmody, like theMarionone, eventually fell apart and led to a lawsuit andsettlement. But the initial raids are what get the publicity, not the repercussions that bad actors may or may not later face.Case in point, San Francisco police again issuedanotherunlawful warrant to an independent news outlet just five years after the Carmody debacle. And Kansas cops ignored the lessons of the Marion case andsoughtan illegal warrant for a newspaper last year.The normalization of invading newsrooms, in violation of federal law and based on the flimsiest of pretexts, has now spread to the highest levels of the federal government (assuming prosecutors followed their ownguidelines, the Natanson raid should have been approved by Pam Bondi, the attorney general, herself).Combined with the decades-long attack on whistleblowers and national security journalists under a law that treats them no different from enemy spies, it’s a deadly weapon to be wielded against the free press, especially by a president who muses about journalists beingbeaten,jailed, and evenraped in prison.Seth Stern is the director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation and a first amendment lawyerChip Gibbons is the policy director ofDefending Rights & Dissent.

Even if he doesn’t actually do it, this is a new era: a post-western world of illiberal international disorder.The task now for liberal democracies in general, andEuropein particular, is twofold: to see this world as it is and to work out what the hell we’re going to do about it.A global public opinion poll published today is a useful starting point. It was conducted last November in 21 countries for the European Council on Foreign Relations, in partnership with ourEurope in a Changing Worldresearch project at the University of Oxford (and do please readthe full report, which I have written with Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard). This is the fourth ina series of pollswe’ve done every year since Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, so we can see how things have evolved from very bad then to critical now.Back in 2022,we founda transatlantic west united in outrage at the full-scale invasion of Ukraine but divided from other great and middle powers, such as China, India and Turkey, who were quite happy to go on doing business as usual with Russia. The Russian economy was surviving unprecedented western sanctions because those other states now had sufficient wealth and power between them to counterbalance even a united west. So this was already a post-western world, but still with a west acting in it.Trump 2.0 has changed all that. Now we have a post-western world, but with no coherent geopolitical west acting in it. To the extent that any strategic coherence should be attributed to the erratic narcissism of Trump, his approach is closer to that of Putin than it is to that of any US president since 1945. As his right-hand man Stephen Millerfrankly explains, they believe the world is “governed by strength … by force … by power”.Europeans have understood this. Astonishingly, less than one in five continental Europeans (taking an average of the 10 EU countries we surveyed) and just one in four Britons now see the US as an ally. In Ukraine, the figure is down to 18%. We Europeans do still see the US as “a necessary partner”, but not as an ally.The rest of the world is also waking up to this. While inour first poll, 60% of Chinese respondents saw American and European approaches as the same or similar (ie there’s a single west), now just 43% say that, while a clear majority thinks they are different. As of now, the west is history.So what should we do about it? The worst thing we could do is to go on bleating about the lost “rules-based international system”, making selective invocations of international law (Ukraine but not Gaza) while continuing the sycophantic appeasement of Trump. At the same time, we obviously don’t want to behave like him or Putin.What we need is a new internationalism: faster, more flexible, harder-edged. Reject the use of force but embrace the use of power. Don’t fixate on existing structures and alliances but seek a wider range of partners, pragmatically, from issue to issue. Worry less about rules, more about results; less process, more progress. This is a challenge particularly to the institutional EU, the ultimate slow-moving, rules-based, process-heavy instantiation of 1990s-style liberal international order.Yet we are already beginning to do it for Ukraine, with the novel combination of a coalition of the willing and the EU itself moving at what, for Brussels, is warp speed. As Iargued last month, we should urgently prepare to sustain an independent Ukraine even without US support.What aboutGreenland? First, we should be guided in everything we do by the elected governments of Greenland and Denmark. That, after all, is what distinguishes liberal democrats from authoritarian imperialists.On Wednesday, Denmark and some of its European Nato allies announced the sending of further troops to Greenland. The foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmarkthen met in Washingtonwith the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and agreed to set up a high-level working group. It’s quite clear the fundamental disagreement has not been resolved. All the signs are that Trump is going to get more extreme and unpredictable as time goes by and his domestic difficulties increase.So here are a few suggestions. To highlight the European commitment, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, French president Emmanuel Macron and British prime minister Keir Starmer should visit Greenland, along with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen. They should be joined by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, since Canada is theNatoally that is Greenland’s actual western neighbour and directly impacted by Arctic insecurity.If they can take a train to Kyiv, they can take a plane to Nuuk. Oddly enough, this visit may be as important as the substance of the security commitment, for President Trump’s second language is television. He’ll get the message from the pictures. A number of highly visible, vividly uniformed European and Canadian liaison officers should be stationed in Greenland for the foreseeable future.On Tuesday, Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said if they have to choose, “we choose Denmark … we choose the EU”. So the EU should rapidly find a way to increase its currently tinyfinancial support to Greenland– and not just, as apparently planned, in the new budget period starting in 2028. This will be a good occasion for European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European council president António Costa to get on the plane to Nuuk.While they are there, they should start a strategic discussion about a possible future close relationship between an independent Greenland and the EU. It’s quite clear that the EU of tomorrow is going to have a range of customised relationships with key neighbours, including the UK, Ukraine, Turkey and Canada. Why not also with Greenland?Meanwhile, Europe – the US’s biggest single economic partner – should privately review the full range of economic responses (including, for example, selling off US Treasury bonds) it could make in the still unlikely event of Trump ordering a Putin-style military takeover of Greenland. The outline of these contingency plans could be discreetly conveyed to the White House via US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent or presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.There are doubtless other possible moves, but the general thrust is clear: a Europe (and Canada, and other liberal democracies) projecting quiet strength, power and resolve.One of the most depressing findings in our poll is that Europeans lead the world in pessimism. Almost half of them don’t think the EU can deal on equal terms with global powers such as the US and China. If we start practising this new, faster, harder-nosed internationalism, maybe more Europeans will believe in Europe again.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDenmarkNatoEuropeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

With Mr Jenrickshiftingpublicly to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, the issue became less about party discipline and more about the Conservatives’ political viability. Mr Jenrick says he left because Britain is broken and the Tories refused to acknowledge their role in breaking it. His claim rests on a self-serving distinction: that the damage was done by a party he served, but not by him.Despite her improving polls, Mrs Badenoch is still recovering from the devastating 2024 election loss. With ambitious colleaguescovetingher job, she could not afford to tolerate dissent. By acting she exposed a deeper fragility in UK rightwing politics. Mr Jenrick was not merely a restless colleague but a plausible alternative centre of gravity. His embrace of hardline populism could attract Reform voters; he had support among party members; and he was ambitious enough to believe his moment had arrived. Mrs Badenoch calculated that delay, in such circumstances, could be fatal.The Tories’ problem is not that senior figures talk to Reform. It is that enough of them now believe Reform offers salvation from extinction. More than a dozen former Conservative MPs havealreadysigned up. Mr Jenrick is the first figure with real grassroots traction to have switched sides. Mrs Badenoch can claim she has inoculated the party against further infection. But removing Mr Jenrick highlights Tory disunity. The Conservatives’ survival is at stake. But so is thecoherence of opposition politics. A right split between rival claims to authenticity offers voters noise rather than a credible programme – and dims the prospect of an effective government in waiting.There are also downsides for Mr Farage. He increasingly looks less like an outsider. What is striking is how closely the two parties’personnel– and increasingly theirphilosophies– are beginning to resemble one another. Acquire too many ex-Tories, and Reform seems like politics as usual. Whether voters can easily distinguish between Mrs Badenoch’s party and Mr Farage’s is almost beside the point, though the latter is still more extreme. The British right is now split between two camps competing for the same voters.The risk for Mrs Badenoch is that she has triggered a change in the politics of the right that cannot be closed down by discipline alone. By defenestrating Mr Jenrick, she has forced Conservative MPs to confront questions they have postponed since 2024: where does power on the right now reside? Is Reform a threat to be contained or a vehicle to bejoined, or bargained with? Once defection becomes plausible for a senior figure like Mr Jenrick, it becomes an option for others. That changes the calculus. MPs are no longer simply judging Mrs Badenoch’s competence, but weighing exit,accommodationor confrontation.This does not end the drama. It starts four months of campaigning ahead of key May elections. This will put party leadership and survival up for debate – and every act of authority can appear as an escalation of a fight. The British right likes to present its current turmoil as a tragedy inflicted from without. But it is a self-administered wound. For more than a decade, Conservatives promiseddelusions– control without cost, growth without trade-offs, sovereignty without responsibility. When reality arrived, it was reality that was blamed. Reform is not a revolt against that failure, but its grim and logical outcome.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But his short-term victories have profound long-term costs for his country and the worldThu 15 Jan 2026 14.09 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 18.59 ESTShareThe Middle East was braced on Wednesday night, but the anxious petitioning of Gulf states and Iran’s attempts to appease the US president appeared to win out – at least for the moment. No bombs fell on Tehran. After all his threats, and with military options under discussion in Washington, Donald Trumpstepped back, announcing that “the killing [of protesters] has stopped”.Despite the telecommunications blackout, it seems clear that a ruthless regime has shed still more blood than in previous protest crackdowns. Rights groups say that thousands have been killed and vast numbers arrested; one official spoke of 2,000 deaths. Witnesses compared the streets to a war zone. If thelarge-scale killingshave indeed ebbed, that is probably because Iranians have been terrified out of the streets – for now, at least. Iran’s foreign minister chose Fox News to insist no hangings were imminent, in case the identity of the message’s one-man audience was in any doubt. But while retributionmay have been postponed, it will not be cancelled as it should be: the calls for the regime’s downfall are seen as an existential threat. The Iranian authorities can wait. Mr Trump will move on.Even as the threat of reckless military intervention in Iran receded, if only for the moment, the dangers facingGreenlandwere underscored as European troops flew in on Thursday. Meetings in Washington had failed to bridge the “fundamental disagreement” over its future, with Mr Trump reiterating that the US “needs” Greenland and Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, warning that the president is still set on “conquering” Greenland.Venezuelais on the back burner for now, after Mr Trump took his lap of victory for illegally snatchingNicolás Maduro. But he has already warned Cuba, Colombia and Mexico that they could be next. Alarmingly, the former anti-interventionist has concluded that foreign adventures have fewer costs than he anticipated and more gains. He hopes that menace, spectacle and diversion can work abroad as well as domestically.Richard Nixon’s “madman theory” was that presenting him as uncontrollable and volatile would keep adversaries in line. But Nixon had a clear strategic framework and aims. While the same cannot be said of Mr Trump, it would be wrong to see him as irrational. Despitegrandiose threats, he has often been cautious in military action. He does not need to follow through every time; he just needs people to know that he might. But his causes (resource grabs, imperial splendour, vengeance, “civilisational” supremacy and self-glorification) are alarming, his idea of victory is short-termist and egocentric, and caprice rules his court. He revels in unsettling his inner circle too.As a leading analyst of Irannoted this week, policymaking has shifted from a clear, deliberative, strategic process to bureaucracy mobilising in response to off-the-cuff presidential comments. Post-Maduro, Mr Trump is emboldened – and more likely to miscalculate. It’s telling that Iran’s regional rivals were key in holding him back from a strike, fearing the destabilisation of the region, the strengthening of Israel or perhaps the emergence of a still more hardline regime in Tehran.Addressing the French army in his annual speech on Thursday,Emmanuel Macronspoke of a brutal world “where destabilising forces have awakened”, with “competitors [Europe] never thought it would see”. He did not need to name names. Permacrisis is not just the cause and result of Trump – it’s his method too.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The piece beautifully captures the joy, closeness and rebalancing that meaningful paternity leave can bring, and it makes a compelling case for why this time matters so deeply.But as we read it, we were also struck by what was missing. The article does not mention self-employed or freelance parents at all, and that absence reflects a wider pattern in the current conversation about paternity leave reform. For families like ours, it is impossible to read about extended paid leave without also feeling the sharp edge of exclusion.My partner is self-employed. Like many freelancers, he already lives with significant stress and instability in his working life. Under the current system, he would not even be entitled to the two weeks of statutory paternity leave that employed fathers can access, let alone any form of extended leave. Taking meaningful time with a newborn would mean taking unpaid leave, losing income entirely, or attempting to juggle work and care at the most intense moment of family life.As a result, my partner and I find ourselves in a painful limbo. We very much want a child and to start our family, yet we feel paralysed by anxiety about how we would cope in those early months without any form of paternity support. We are even considering whether to delay starting a family in the hope that this might change as part of the government’s review, despite knowing that I have limited years left in which to make that choice. The fact that people are weighing up such deeply personal decisions based on employment status alone feels profoundly wrong.Extended paternity leave has the potential to transform family life, support partners, and challenge entrenched inequalities around care. But unless reform explicitly includes self-employed parents, it risks reinforcing the idea that shared parenting and early bonding are privileges reserved for those in secure, salaried work.If we are serious about valuing care and family life, then self-employed parents cannot continue to be overlooked. Any meaningful reform must recognise the realities of modern work and ensure that all families have the chance to be together at the very beginning.Ruby BayleyEdinburghExplore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsParents and parentingWork & careersFamilylettersShareReuse this content"

Dressed in full Native American attire, complete with sumptuously feathered headdress, his was the concluding speech of the play. It was a moving and sombre piece delivered beautifully in that rich and sonorous voice.Unfortunately, a group of kids in the stalls were making a noise, talking and laughing throughout, which clearly angered Alan. As the rest of the company entered to take our call, Alan jumped off the stage and marched into the auditorium to confront the culprits, who shrank at the terrifying sight of him looming over them.He remonstrated with them, but seemed a little perplexed afterwards. Their response to his tongue-lashing had deflated his ire: “We never knew you could hear us, we’ve never been to the theatre before – we thought it was like the telly.” A lesson was learned on both sides of the footlights.David Joss BuckleyLondonOn what might have been the evening of my first day at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, we were all in the pub. Somebody called Rima introduced herself to me and told me that she was Alan’s partner and that he was going to be great. Okeydokey, I thought, that puts me in my place. Fast forward through classes, and then to our first attempts at performances in the potted Greeks in the LittleTheatre. I do my bit in Oedipus and then we all went to watch the other half of our cohort doing The Bacchae.I remember a blackout and this voice coming out of it: “I AM DIONYSUS, SON OF ZEUS. MY MOTHER WAS SEMELE…”Then some light came up, and, standing on a chair, wearing tasteful eyeshadow, there he was and ever will be in my memory.Nicholas WoodesonLondonAll those wonderful memories ofAlan Rickmanin your article reminded me of the time I was in New York for work, but also to see his production of My Name is Rachel Corrie.I had somehow managed to leave my wallet at home in England, arriving with neither cash nor credit cards. As it was at the weekend, the banks were all shut.Alan rescued me with bemused laughter, fistfuls of cash and his always-generous hospitality. Another time I dropped in on him at home in London, having tea with his secondary school drama teacher. Loyal, funny, incisive, he was a model of friendship and care.Margaret HeffernanFarrington Gurney, SomersetThank you so much for the tributes to the much-missed Alan Rickman. I saw him on stage only once, but a friend and I had a running joke: “The problem with this play is it’s impossible to believe the heroine could fancy that man.” “Unless you cast Alan Rickman.” “Well,of course, Alan Rickman.”Ten years ago, I dreamed I was in a theatre and had a problem with my seat, so I asked the couple in front if they’d mind my climbing into a seat next to them.They were very welcoming, and I suddenly realised the man was Alan Rickman. On waking, I heard he had just died; I often sleep with the radio on, and must have absorbed his name while semi-conscious. But he was every bit as lovely in the dream as in the tributes you published, so I treasure that unexpected imaginary farewell.Harriet MonkhouseManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We do not confuse opportunity with ability (Letters, 12 January) and our admissions team is skilled at assessing academic potential in the context of background and schooling. We know from experience that our top-performing students come from every part of the country, every school type and every background.The data backs this up: 73% of our domestic undergraduates on average in the past three years are from state schools (up from 61% 10 years ago) and more than 20% are from disadvantaged backgrounds.The action referred to in your articles applies to a small number of humanities subjects where applications are dropping across higher education, in part because pupils have less access to study relevant A-levels in state schools.We propose adding a small number of independent schools to a mailing list of more than a thousand state schools to advertise our outreach work, online Q&A sessions and informative podcasts about these subjects.We understand why language used in the memo has caused upset, but it does not reflect our continuing commitment to offering places to students with the potential to thrive. We are proud to support opportunity across the nation and our commitment to that, and our students, has not changed.Mary HockadayTrinity Hall, CambridgeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Scottish distillery tests eco-friendly aluminium bottles, 11 January). The marketing director of the distillery seems to believe that younger consumers could be motivated by promises of far better green credentials from using aluminium bottles rather than glass ones.However, the production of aluminium at Fort William, in the Highlands of Scotland, is anything but green. The smelter there uses electricity part-generated by the Spey dam, diverted from the Spey catchment.According toan independent reportproduced by the environment consultancy Envirocentre for the Spey Fishery Board, the River Spey, one of Scotland’s most iconic salmon rivers, is under pressure from overabstraction.This dam is responsible for 66% of all water abstraction from the Spey. The dam also acts as an obstruction to migratory fish, including the salmon, which is now an endangered species.Is it any wonder that the campaign to “release the Spey”, backed by the Spey Fishery Board, has called on the Scottish government to remove the dam? Speyside produces the best whisky in the world, and hopefully it will never be served from aluminium bottles.Charlie WhelanMember of the Spey Fishery BoardHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Fonseca is 19 and he makes that succinct list of his goals sound almost as casual as a few fun things a more ordinary teenager might aim to do this weekend. But Fonseca is different.He is a generational talent who, in recent years, has been spoken of as a future superstar amid predictions that he might have the best chance ofdenting the dominant hold that Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinnerexert over men’s tennis. But, as time in Fonseca’s company proves, he is remarkably grounded and mature for his age. Those attributes underline his credentials far more effectively than the hype that has trailed him.“I’ve got a long way to go,” Fonseca says with healthy realism, “because it’s a very long and difficult dream. But, at the same time, I think it’s possible and I’m doing the best things I can to achieve it.”This time last year Fonseca was ranked No 145 in the world and he had to win three qualifying matches to reach the first round of theAustralian Open. He smiles ruefully as he relives the excruciating tension of the qualifiers. Hungry players are desperate to scrap their way into the main draw where large amounts of money and ranking points can be earned. “I remember my first match was against an Argentinian guy, [Federico Agustín] Gómez. It was super tense because it was only my third slam and I was nervous. I played really tight in the beginning and then, after that, I played good.”View image in fullscreenFonseca celebrates a point during his second-round victory against Lorenzo Sonego at last year’s Australian Open.Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty ImagesFonseca won 6-4, 6-0 and he was more convincing in his second match as he dropped only three games. “But I was tense in the third qualifier because I had lost in the third quali of the US Open in 2024. So it was another tough match because I wanted to win so much and make my first main draw.”Another Argentinian, Thiago Agustín Tirante, was ranked much higher than Fonseca but was beaten 6-4, 6-1. Fonseca had made his first grand slam tournament and his reward was a formidable challenge against the thenworld No 9, Andrey Rublev, who had spent 255 consecutive weeks in the top 10 and reached 10 grand slam quarter-finals.But Rublev was crushed after a blistering and seemingly nerveless display from Fonseca who won in straight sets to announce his arrival on the world stage. “Playing well and beating Rublev was just amazing for me and a great achievement,” he says. “I was playing good and I was confident I could win the biggest match I’d ever played at that time. As the underdog, I had no pressure. I just played my game because I knew he would feel the pressure against an 18-year-old. I was just there to enjoy it and I played amazing tennis.”Even though he lost a five-setter in the second round against Lorenzo Sonego, last year’s Australian Open heightened the already intense expectations of Fonseca. “My life changed a little bit,” he says. “Not on the interior, with my personality, but the exterior changed a lot – with many more people following me and so many more people knowing me. My ranking went up and my level [of play] gave me more confidence. When my parents got home they said: ‘You don’t know what it’s like in Brazil now. People know you.’ But it was part of the goal to achieve a lot and become No 1. That’s my dream. So it was a great step in my career.”View image in fullscreenJoão Fonseca in action against Jack Draper during the third round of last year’s French Open.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesEven more impressively, Fonsecawon his first ATP title a month laterin Buenos Aires, beating four Argentinian players in front of a vociferous crowd. He describes that championship as his sweetest moment of 2025. “It was my first title and the highlight of last year. I could also say Basel, but the first time just means a lot.”Fonseca won his second ATP title in Basel in October when he defeated Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-3, 6-4 in the final of the Swiss Masters. Davidovich Fokina praised Fonseca’s “unbelievable tennis” anddescribed him as the next Novak Djokovic. “You are the person of this sport,” Davidovich Fokina told Fonseca after losing in straight sets. “You are, for sure, going to be the next Nole [Djokovic] to beat Carlos [Alcaraz] and Jannik [Sinner].”While admitting that “it’s a pleasure hearing those kind words”, Fonseca responded by saying: “Actually, I am not a fan of the comparisons. I’m going to make my own history.”View image in fullscreenFonseca poses with the trophy after winning the Swiss Indoors in Basel in October last year.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesFonseca rose to world No 24 after that victory but he is acutely aware of the gulf that separates Alcaraz and Sinner, who have won the last eight majors between them, from the rest of the pack. He watched their past three grand slam finals at the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. He picks outthe unforgettable final in Pariswhen Alcaraz produced a miraculous comeback from two sets down after it looked as if Sinner had an iron grip on the title.“It was brilliant tennis and I watched the full match at home. The level was unbelievable. It’s difficult to say I can play that level. But I’m practising hard and working 100% every day so at least one day I can play at this level, against these guys in finals.”He needs to improve in many ways to reach such a sustained peak: “It is a lot of things. Consistency, responsibility, mentality. The most important thing is your mentality – because that gives you the responsibility and consistency to keep working hard every day. And the right mentality on court is the most important thing for you to be a great tennis player, to become a legend of the sport. At our level all the players are really good. But the amazing players, the top-flight players, know how to play the important points and how to deal with pressure and nerves.”Courage is also vital. Against Rublev last year, Fonseca was often brave in his choice of shot at crucial points. “It’s more to do with confidence. I practise those shots a lot but sometimes it’s normal to think: ‘What do I do now?’ You don’t want to miss the important points. At the same time I just think: ‘I want to do what I have practised so hard. Just go for the shot.’ Sometimes I’m going to miss, but I did the right thing. I try to be brave. Sometimes I go crazy when I miss an important point. But I have the courage and I just go for the shots and it’s great.”View image in fullscreenFonseca faces a serve from Carlos Alcaraz during an invitation match in Miami in December.Photograph: MediaPunch Inc/AlamyIt will be hard for Fonseca to go deep in the Australian Open this month as he has been struggling with a back injury and chose to miss recent tournaments in Brisbane and Adelaide as a precaution. He has been drawn with world No 89 Eliot Spizzirri of the US in round one and could face Sinner in the third round.Fonseca says: “Every day I’m feeling better. Hopefully I can be near 100% [when the tournament starts on Sunday]. I need to respect my body and take the right decision because I have a long career ahead of me. I want to play 15 more years. So you need to take care of your body and understand that sometimes you have to wait. But hopefully I can play well these next weeks. If I don’t, well, it doesn’t matter. It’s part of the process.”Fonseca has yet to play Sinner or Alcaraz in a competitive match – but he faced the Spaniardin an exhibition in Miami last month. Alcaraz won the first set 7-5, Fonseca took the second 6-2 and the third was a tie-break which the world No 1 shaded 10-8.“I’d already practised with him two or three times,” Fonseca says of Alcaraz. “But it was great to see how he deals with the important points. I played a good match and almost got him in the tie-break. We talked a little about life and his career before the match. He’s a great guy, very humble, and an inspiration for the next generation.”Fonseca thinks carefully when I ask him which player, from this next generation, might challenge Alcaraz and Sinner first. “I’m going to say [Jakub] Mensik. I really like his game. He’s a very complete guy, very confident and also young [at 20]. He’s already won a masters and he can do great things. He’s a great friend as well.”View image in fullscreenJoão Fonseca is flattered by comparisons to Gustavo Kuerten and describes his fellow Brazilian as ‘an idol’.Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/ATP/Getty Images for the GuardianMensik has the game to rise to the top but the Czech will do so without the fervour surrounding Fonseca who is already a phenomenon in Brazil. Comparisons are being made with Gustavo Kuerten – his countryman who was world No 1 and won three French Opens between 1997 and 2001. “Guga is not only the idol of Brazilian people that follow tennis,” Fonseca says. “He’s an idol for the whole nation because of his charisma and the way he represented Brazil.”Almost every Fonseca match is played against a sea of Brazilian colour and noise with his fans kicking up an almighty racket of passionate support. It’s compelling, of course, but how does Fonseca deal with their expectations, and those of so many others who have made grand predictions about his future? “My parents and my coach help me a lot and I know you can’t control the expectations. You can’t control what people are going to say. You just need to focus on your routine and what you need to do to become a better player and a better person.”Fonseca pauses and then, maintaining eye contact, the impressive teenager says: “I know what people are saying. I can hear it, I can read it: ‘Is he going to be the next Sinner or Alcaraz?’ We don’t know the future. It’s unpredictable. But I’m working very hard towards it and I’m just thinking what I need to do to achieve it.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2025Australian OpenTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday night all host cities were illuminated by yellow beams in recognition of them staging the Tour.Simon Morton, UK Sport’s director of events, said that the ambition was “to host a massive sporting event that would genuinely thread together the countries, cities, and communities of Great Britain.“The route details do just that, enabling us to reach, unite, and inspire people right across the country – providing moments of joy for millions, bringing communities together, and delivering lasting benefits beyond race day.”View image in fullscreenThe routes of the 2027 Grands Départs will thrill cycling fans across Britain.Composite: Getty ImagesThe Tour’s last British Grand Départ, in 2014, followed Tour wins by Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome and was a resounding success that drew an estimated 3.5 million people to the roadsides and fuelled £128m of economic benefit. Jon Dutton, chief executive of BritishCycling, said that they expected to see 10 million people at the roadside in 2027.The double-headed Grand Départ is far more ambitious than 2014 and will be easily the biggest logistical undertaking in the history of the Tour. It is also the first time that men’s and women’s Grands Départs have been hosted by the same country, outside France.View image in fullscreenThe Beatles statues adorned with yellow scarves at the Pier Head on Liverpool’s waterfront.“The UK has always welcomed the Tour with passion and pride, and the route details reflect the beauty and diversity of Britain’s terrain,” said Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour. “Bringing both Grands Départs here is a testament to the strength of our partnership with British Cycling and the enthusiasm of the UK.”The two Tour visits will be the cornerstones of a summer of cycling that will traverse Britain from north to south. The men’s race starts in Edinburgh on Friday 2 July with a first stage through the Scottish Borders to Carlisle.Stage two takes the peloton from Keswick to Liverpool, while the third stage starts in Welshpool and finishes in Cardiff, after a long stage through the Welsh Valleys that takes in eight climbs in the final 50 miles.View image in fullscreenTour de France general director Christian Prudhomme and Geraint Thomas during a press conference in Cardiff to announce the Welsh stage of the 2027 Grand Départ.Photograph: Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com/Shutterstock“Wales is proud to host a stage of the Tour for the first time, which will be a fantastic opportunity to showcase our stunning landscapes,” said Eluned Morgan, the first minister ofWales. “Hosting the final UK stage of the men’s race will raise Wales’ profile as a world-class destination for cyclists and other visitors, while inspiring more people to get active and deliver lasting benefits for Wales.”Four weeks on, the Tour de France Femmes starts in Leeds on 30 July with a first stage to Manchester and a second stage through the Peak District to Sheffield. The final day of Tour racing is in London on 1 August, although exact route details are yet to be specified.“Racing the Tour de France Femmes has been one of the highlights of my career, and seeing the women’s edition go from strength to strength has been genuinely inspiring,” the former world champion Lizzie Deignan said. “This is a huge moment for the sport and an opportunity that will inspire countless women and girls to get on their bikes.”View image in fullscreenFormer world champion Lizzie Deignan says seeing the growth of the Tour de France Femmes has been ‘truly inspiring’.Photograph: Procycling Magazine/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesBritish Cycling is also expecting the two Grands Départs to have wider and long-lasting benefits. “This is a once‐in‐a‐generation chance to build a healthier, more active and more connected nation,” Dutton said. “It shows the power of major events when they’re done right, to help deliver a legacy that will be felt long after the peloton has left UK shores.”Explore more on these topicsTour de FranceCyclingWalesEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

One minute you are riding the perfect wave, the next you’re being dumped from a great height and having your world tipped upside down. Which is essentially how “Razor” will now be feeling afterbeing ousted as All Blacks head coachbarely two years into his tenure.On the surface he was everything New Zealand rugby could have wished for. The serial domestic winner who had guided the Crusaders to seven successive Super Rugby titles, the empathetic everyman with the break-dancing skills to match. If anyone could connect with younger generations and encourage everyone to fall in love with the ABs again, surely he was da man?The Breakdown | Rugby is moving towards Moneyball-style data but value of flair remainsRead moreInstead he has been swallowed up and spat out after only 27 Tests. An internal review into the All Blacks’ problematic year uncorked a torrent of salty feedback that proved impossible to ignore. New Zealand Rugby’s chair, David Kirk, sought to dampen reports that the All Blacks’ best player, Ardie Savea, had threatened to jump ship if Robertson remained but the swiftness of the union’s response, despite currently having no permanent chief executive in place, suggested player unrest was indeed a factor.It invites several questions, none of them comfortable. As Manchester United can testify, sacking the top man does not guarantee instant smooth sailing. Robertson’s record was not disastrous – he oversaw 20 victories, a 74% ratio that was statistically an improvement on his predecessor Ian Foster’s 69.6% winning return – but, as anyone who watched the All Blacks face England in November can attest, there was clearly something not quite right.As much asEngland’s 33-19 win was a striking result, New Zealand were transparently not their usual forbidding selves. Whatever Razor was muttering into the ears of his backs, in particular, was definitely not working; when an All Black backline looks so visibly short of cohesion and rhythm there is trouble at mill.Add to that the humbling43-10 defeatat home by a rampant South Africa, the heaviest in the All Blacks’ 120-year history, plus a first-ever loss in Argentina and the review was never likely to be cosy. “I think trajectory is a good word to apply, we just weren’t seeing the trajectory,” said Kirk. “We were falling a bit short of the excellence that we’re looking for, it never really got addressed over the year.”View image in fullscreenKwagga Smith of South Africa celebrates with RG Snyman after scoring a try in a chastening defeat for the All Blacks in September.Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty ImagesThe former World Cup-winning captain also acknowledged the All Blacks “are not on track the way they need to be on track” for the 2027 tournament, which is as close as a senior New Zealand rugby official will ever come to admitting the wheels of the national team have fallen off. It is one thing to lose a Test match or two, quite another when the All Blacks’ once globally famous “culture” is perceived as not fit for purpose.Particularly when Razor was supposedly the feelgood antidote to the more buttoned up regime of Foster whose side, remember, lost the2023 World Cup finalby only a point. “My job is to connect them and make them believe,” Robertson told some of us in a small room in Dunedin in the summer of 2024. “What does it look like? How does it feel? How are people going to own it?”So much for such worthy intentions. If ever there was a stark illustration that coaching domestically and at Test level require a different skillset, Razor’s short-lived tenure in charge of the All Blacks is probably it.There is still time – of course there is – to resurrect the drooping silver fern. Jamie Joseph, the early favourite for the job, and Dave Rennie have significant experience of the international game, while the rugby IQ potentially at NZR’s disposal remains extensive. Joe Schmidt, Vern Cotter, Chris Boyd, Warren Gatland, Wayne Smith, Pat Lam – there are plenty of seasoned coaches out there who know exactly how to reassemble an underperforming rugby team and make it tick. Even the Boks have a Kiwi guru – Joseph’s old colleague Tony Brown – now shaping their attacking strategy.View image in fullscreenJamie Joseph in 2019, when coach of Japan. The former All Black flanker is among the frontrunners to succeed Scott Robertson.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesThe right mix is crucial. The game is changing rapidly; what worked last week can be instantly picked apart by every analyst in the world. What was once New Zealand’s secret weapon – the aura that made opponents nervous about facing them even before they took the field – has also faded. Rebuilding any international team is hard, let alone an All Black squad in which key men such as Beauden and Scott Barrett, Codie Taylor and Savea are all aged between 32 and 34.On the flip side, for all their huffing and puffing, New Zealand are still ranked second in the world, ahead of England and Ireland. It is way too early, accordingly, to write them off as 2027 World Cup contenders in Australia. As South Africa have proved in the past, a mid-cycle jolt can sometimes concentrate minds and prove highly beneficial.Maybe someone such as Joseph – the former All Black flanker who coached Japan and is now back with the Highlanders – will rediscover the “edge” that, ironically, Razor could not supply. What does seem certain is that the latter will attract interest from club suitors, including one or two in the UK. Harlequins, among others, are in the market for a heavy hitter capable of providing fresh impetus. Notwithstanding the lack of surfing on the Thames, you suspect Robertson would need little persuading to hop on the first available flight north.Explore more on these topicsNew Zealand rugby union teamRugby unioncommentShareReuse this content"

There are concerns relating to one of the host countries, the US, with armed immigration officials roaming through its cities and visa restrictionsstepped up against foreign visitors. One qualifying nation, Iran, is experiencing a public uprising against its leadership, with the regime attacking its citizens in response. Among other qualifiers there are concerns over democratic backsliding in Tunisia, ecological crimes in Ecuador and , in the future host country Saudi Arabia. And that’s just for starters.It sometimes feels as if this summer’s tournament, the one Gianni Infantino recently described as “the greatest show ever on planet Earth”, will serve as an inescapable reminder of the depressing state of the world in 2026. It could yet be an event that goes down in infamy. But it is hardly the only tournament to have prompted ethical concerns and serves as a reminder that the issue of how global sport should engage with such issues has remained largely unresolved.In 1978, theWorld Cupwas held in Argentina, which two years earlier had been taken over by a military dictatorship. It prompted a response from Amnesty International, which ran what is understood to be the organisation’s first campaign focused on a major sporting event. Under a slogan devised by its West German branch, Amnesty made an appeal for “Fussball ja – Folter nein” or “Football yes – torture no”. The campaign played a part in generating a debate over the ethics of participation in the tournament and West Germany’s Paul Breitner refused to play. The final ended with the dictator, Jorge Videla, handing the World Cup trophy to Argentina’s captain Daniel Passarella.View image in fullscreenA demonstration in Paris in May 1978 against Argentina’s hosting of the World Cup.Photograph: Michel Clement/AFP/Getty Images“It wasn’t a push to boycott the World Cup,” says Steve Cockburn, Amnesty’s head of sports and human rights, of the Argentina campaign. “It was a push to raise the issues with some very specific demands.” These demands related to gaining access to prisons and transparency about those who had been arrested or disappeared, but Amnesty also made demands of other countries to place greater diplomatic pressure on Argentina. “It would have been opportunistic in the sense of trying to generate attention and make change on issues in Argentina, using the World Cup as a hook,” Cockburn says. “My guess is that this was also coinciding with a time when the World Cup was reaching more and more people via television.”View image in fullscreenThe Argentina president, Jorge Videla, after the hosts’ victory over the Netherlands in the final.Photograph: Mirrorpix/AlamyWhat it didn’t do was make demands ofFifa. “We didn’t necessarily frame this as arguing that a sports body like Fifa has a particular human rights responsibility legally in the way that we do now,” Cockburn says. That changed much later, after the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the events of 2010, when Fifa awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar amid accusations of corruption and human rights neglect. This period, says Cockburn, coincided “with a broader movement in the human rights sector which was about trying to define the responsibilities of organisations. You had the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, which Fifa adopted [in 2016]. That led to an acceptance within sports bodies that they have human rights responsibilities, I think partly as a result of pressure, but also out of a desire to protect their autonomy and avoid regulation.”In the years since, Fifa has protected its autonomy, grown its influence and found itself increasingly the focus for criticism over human rights. Campaigns to influence Fifa’s behaviour in Qatar, or to prevent it handing the World Cup to Saudi Arabia, or for it to suspend Israel from its competitions have not been successful. Fifa is accused of neglecting its direct responsibilities but also of failing to stand up for values that many believe should be intrinsic to the sport. Fifa’s statutes, however, remain clear: “Fifa remains neutral in matters of politics and religion.”As the world’s most popular sport, “football will always have very significant social, cultural, political and economic significance”, says Nick McGeehan, co-director ofFairSquare, which works to achieve “systemic change” in the relation between sport and human rights. “So rather than repeating the nonsense about keeping sport and politics separate we need to recognise its power and look to use that power appropriately and effectively,” he says. “A big problem that we have is that neither Fifa nor the IOC [International Olympic Committee] – to take the two biggest and most influential organisations – have any rules on how to deal with serious geopolitical developments.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi is dressed in a Qatari bisht by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, at the 2022 World Cup medal presentation.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe biggest political intervention by sporting bodies in recent years highlights this point. A decision toban Russia from international footballwas made jointly by Fifa and Uefa after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It came about after political pressure, including from the UK government, but Fifa justified the ban on sporting grounds. It claimed that the threat of boycott by European teams scheduled to play Russia had endangered Fifa’s obligation to “guarantee the smooth running of its flagship competition”. It was, Fifa said, “imperative that this calendar is not disrupted” and so action had to be taken.Dr Antoine Duval is a researcher at the Asser International Sports Law Centre in the Netherlands. He is scathing of the past 15 years of avowed commitment to human rights. “I would say this entire sequence has been rather a lesson in pessimism,” he says. “China didn’t become more democratic after the Olympics, it became more autocratic. Russia became even more aggressive as a state after the two mega sporting events [the World Cup and Winter Olympics in Sochi]. Qatar didn’t really reform kafala,didn’t really improve the life of migrant workers, didn’t really became a democracy because of the 2022 World Cup.”He is also, however, understanding of the approach by Fifa and the IOC to ensure any decisions are grounded in their rulebooks. It may be possible, Duval says, to create a system whereby Fifa or the IOC would act as an “arbiter of compliance” for international law, expected to take action against countries that are the subject of adverse rulings by the International Court of Justice or resolutions by the UN General Assembly, for example. But it would come with real risks. “Proper, in-depth reform is difficult to trigger,” he says. “You need to have proper rules in place to determine which country is to be excluded and which is not. If not, you risk ending up having, in practice, double standards.”Duval says a more useful focus could be on ensuring governing bodies enforce the rules they have. “My own impression is that we should not overplay the capacity of Fifa or the international Olympic movement to actually achieve democratisation or spread human rights,” he says. “We should be prudent in what we hope to achieve.” Instead Duval believes the best thing to be hoped is that the Olympics and World Cup fulfil the expectation billions of people around the world place on them: namely that they showcase the best in human endeavour. And that this should extend to the conditions in which the tournament is played out.View image in fullscreenChina’s hosting of the 2008 Olympics drew protests such as this in Brussels, over its treatment of Tibet.Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters“You can see the World Cup or Olympics as a circus that comes to a country every four years,” Duval says. “My suggestion would be to consider it not only a circus that is about the commercial interest of Fifa and the IOC and the security of those events, but also that those events are moments where we ensure radical non-discrimination. Where the rights of people exceed those within the host country, where we ensure free expression and that the fundamental rights of those that participate are fully protected in that particular space.”Duval admits that the power of a World Cup such as the one described above would be largely symbolic, but it would at least be a symbol that inspires hope. Until then many football fans, some perhaps still pondering whether to travel to the World Cup this summer, or whether they will be allowed in, will still be experiencing something of a disconnect. “It feels like people want sport to be this beautiful escape from everything else but it’s just as affected by power struggles and human failings as any other industry,” Cockburn says. “There’s a mismatch between what you’re seeing and what’s happening around it in terms of power, politics, business, abuse. There’s probably a better word for it, but to me it’s jarring.”Explore more on these topicsFootballFootball politicsWorld CupWorld Cup 2026FifaUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It added that “visible distress” was caused by fans being directed towards a confined space for almost 30 minutes before being allowed to leave.“No advance communication was provided to supporters regarding the possibility of a post-match holdback, leaving thousands unprepared for what followed,” Dominic Rosso, the CST chair, wrote. “While operational challenges are understood, clearer communication is essential for maintaining trust and reducing frustration in high-pressure situations.“As supporters exited via the red gates on to Valley Grove, a visible police block of three police vans on the right-hand side led many to assume that the correct route was to the left. This directed hundreds of supporters into a poorly lit and hazardous dead-end residential area. Freezing conditions meant muddy ground quickly turned to ice, resulting in people slipping, falling and navigating low walls in darkness. The absence of clear direction, signage or a stewarding presence in this area significantly increased confusion and unnecessary risk.”Chelsea were given an allocation of 3,065 tickets for the third-round tie. The CST sought feedback from its members and said the action by police was “deeply disappointing” and evoked “uncomfortable comparisons with policing approaches more commonly associated with past decades”.View image in fullscreenPedro Neto scores Chelsea’s fourth goal against Charlton in their FA Cup win at the Valley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“When the holdback was eventually lifted, supporters were released through an opening of approximately two metres,” Rosso said. “This immediately caused a forward surge, with people being pushed towards a narrow and poorly lit path bordered by a raised ledge. Several supporters stumbled and fell, while others stepped into private gardens in an effort to avoid injury. In addition, a further hold of approximately 15 minutes took place adjacent to Charlton station.”The CST called for a review and said it looks forward to constructive dialogue with the force to ensure there is no repeat of the incident.In response, a spokesperson for the Met said that officers had acted after receiving intelligence indicating a risk of disorder towards Chelsea fans and said that the measures ensured safety. However, there was a commitment to an independent review with the UK Football Policing Unit.The Met said: “Officers policing theCharlton AthleticFC v Chelsea FC match on Saturday 10 January made the decision to temporarily hold fans on two separate occasions following the conclusion of the game.“These decisions were based on intelligence, which indicated a risk of disorder towards Chelsea fans. The measures implemented ensured supporters were kept safe.“The policing of football matches often requires dynamic decision-making in order to reduce the potential risk of disorder. Our primary focus is always the safety of supporters and the wider public.“A full and independent review has been commissioned with the UK Football Policing Unit, to ensure full transparency around decision-making and any learning is identified and adopted.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaCharlton AthleticnewsShareReuse this content"

That changed when Gareth Southgate transformed the culture and Tuchel is keen to build on his predecessor’s work, not least because thisWorld Cupfeatures 48 teams and will last more than five weeks.“When I speak to players who have been in World Cups, it has always made the difference when the connection was right, when the communication was right, between the players first of all,” Tuchel said.“When the players had the feeling that the right group is in camp, that they knew their role, why they are in camp, what is expected of them, and they had the feeling that the tournament could even go on for another four weeks and they would be happy to be together, then they were successful.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel and Harry Kane reunite in March for two friendlies before this summer’s World Cup in North America.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images“When they had the feeling after the round of 16 already: ‘Oh, when can we finally go home?’ and the energy was not right and they didn’t make it. This just tells me that we have to get the selection right. It will be very important that we don’t select just for talent, but also for what we need from a player. What the social skills are of a player, is he a good teammate? Can he support if his role is maybe the supporting role? So, this is where the focus is.”Tuchel’s message was that being a good tourist will count when it comes to making his squad. Southgate often selected backup players who could be trusted to train well and not complain about their lack of playing time.England, who host friendlies against Uruguay and Japan at Wembley in March, are expected to play warmup matches in Florida at the start of June. They do not play their first match in Group L until facing Croatia in Dallas on 17 June. They then face Ghana and Panama.Tuchel, speaking in a commercial interview released on Thursday but filmed last month, has not finalised England’s travel itinerary. A big consideration will be ensuring that his players deal with the demands of a tournament taking place in Canada, Mexico and the US.“It is a big tournament regarding distances, the time zones that you travel, the altitude – difference of altitude, difference of weather conditions,” Tuchel said. “It will be very hot. We will have a lot of players out there who hopefully play until May for international titles, they will play for national titles and we will demand a lot out of them.“Then we will be hopefully six to eight weeks together if we make it until the very end. It will demand a lot of our social skills, how we are together as a group and we need to get the nomination right.“We need to find the right balance in the team and take it as an opportunity and take it as a dream coming true to be part in a World Cup and to play, hopefully, a major role is nothing else than a dream.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

The 50-year-old Scot then took a tight decider, clearing the table from the final red to move one step closer to a third Masters title.“I was so lucky,” he told the BBC afterwards. “It was criminal … It’s tough out there. I’m delighted and so proud I’m still doing it.”Remarkably, it was the first match of the tournament not to finish 6-2, which was the scoreline inall eight first-round matches.View image in fullscreenJohn Higgins admitted he was ‘so lucky’ to come out on top against Zhao Xintong.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAHiggins will next face the world No 1, Judd Trump, after he battled past Mark Allen for another 6-2 victory in Thursday’s late session.After Allen came from behind to take the opening frame, Trump – who did not claim any silverware in 2025 – dug in to edge the next two before the Northern Irishman made a break of 76 to level things up at the mid-session interval.The momentum, though, turned in the fifth frame when Allen looked set on 68 only to miss a red, which let Trump, a two-time Masters champion, back in for steal with a well-crafted half-century. Further breaks of 70 and then 49 put Trump on the verge of the semi-finals, before a run of 68 left Allen to bravely fight on needing snookers. Trump eventually closed out a hard-earned victory on the colours.Explore more on these topicsSnookerJohn HigginsnewsShareReuse this content"

The reduced field meant fewer qualifying points were available and Uhlaender, who won the event, did not secure her place at this year’s Milano Cortina Games in Italy. Uhlaender claims Joe Cecchini, the head coach of Canada’s skeleton team, told her he had come up with the scheme.Canada’s ice hockey win over Trump’s America was her soft power laid bare | Colin HorganRead moreHowever, the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF) said it would take no action after investigating the allegations.“The current IBSF Rules allow national federations to withdraw athletes from competition at any time,” IBSF said in a statement on Thursday. “The IIU [Interim Integrity Unit] dismissed the complaints as the current IBSF rules and regulations did not give grounds for a breach of the international rules, the code of conduct, and respectively the code of ethics.”Quick GuideNorway ski jumping coaches hit with 18-month ban over suit tamperingShowThree officials for Norway’s men’s ski jumping team have been suspended for 18 months and fined by the ethics committee of the FIS – the sport's governing body – for manipulating competition suits at last year’s Nordic Ski World Championships in Trondheim.The case tarnished Norway’s hosting of the Nordic World Ski Championships last March and the country’s wider reputation for fair play.The head coach Magnus Brevik, former assistant coach Thomas Lobben and suit technician Adrian Livelten were sanctioned after an investigation into equipment tampering during the men’s large hill event in March 2025.The controversy erupted after Norway’s Olympic champions Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, along with the coaching staff, were charged over the use of altered suits. Lindvik initially finished second but was stripped of his silver medal after being disqualified, while Forfang, who placed fourth, was also disqualified after an equipment inspection.The Norwegian Ski Federation admitted after the competition that the team had manipulated the suits but said the ski jumpers were not at fault for the violations. The organisers found nothing untoward during the initial check, but after the race they discovered different material in the seams. Forfang and Lindvik accepted three-month bans in August and are back competing ahead of the Milan Cortina Olympics next month.In a statement, the FIS said Brevik, Lobben and Livelten would be ineligible for a period “of 18 months, commencing on the date of the decision (8 January 2026), less the period of provisional suspension already served since 12 March 2025”.The governing body added they would have to contribute 5,000 Swiss Franc (£4,650, $6,246) each to the costs of the proceedings and the investigation.In a statement to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK, the trio’s lawyers said the decision was “disproportionately strict”.“The grounds of the judgment expressly state that similar rule violations have not been sanctioned previously – or have only been met with a warning – and that this case is being used as an example to mark a new and stricter line in international ski jumping,” they added.AP and ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Coaches from the US, Denmark, Israel and Malta, whose athletes were all affected by the Canadian withdrawals, had expressed “serious concerns” about the qualification process. However, Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton defended the withdrawals, saying some of the athletes who were pulled from competition had already raced several times last week and needed to rest. It said the decision was “appropriate, transparent and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport”.Uhlaender, who is 41, has said the 2026 Olympics will be her last. She can still qualify for next month’s Games, but the US spots are likely to go to Kelly Curtis and Mystique Ro. Although Uhlaender won gold at the 2012 skeleton world championships, the closest she has come to an Olympic medal was when she finished fourth at the 2014 Games in Sochi.The incident comes after a number of heated sporting clashes between Canada and the US at a time when Donald Trump has threatened to make his neighbor a “51st state” and has raised tariffs on Canadian goods. Duringlast year’s 4 Nations Face-off, Canadian ice hockey fans booed the US national anthem and the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted: “You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game.” In last season’s World Series the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Toronto Blue Jays in athrilling seven-game series, although most of the tension was due to the action on the field.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026US sportsCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

Denmark also announced it would be increasing its military presence.‘Are they going to bring their violence here?’: Fear – but little preparation – as threat of invasion looms over GreenlandRead moreAs well as providing a show of political support, the European troops were said to be on a short scoping mission, according to one country involved.The aim was to establish what a more sustained ground deployment in Greenland could look like, partly to reassure the US that EuropeanNatomembers were serious about Arctic security.It comesafter a difficult meetingin Washington on Wednesday between the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, Vivian Motzfeldt and Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and the US vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio.The visit was intended to smooth relations between Denmark and Greenland and the US, but it did not appear to have had the desired effect. Afterwards,Trump reiteratedhis previous comments that the US “needs” Greenland for national security, adding that Denmark could not be relied on to protect the island and that “something will work out”.In a statement released on Thursday, Frederiksen said it had not been an easy meeting and that a working group was being set up to discuss how Arctic security could be improved.“However, that does not change the fact that there is a fundamental disagreement because the American ambition to take over Greenland is intact,” she said. “This is obviously serious and therefore we continue our efforts to prevent that scenario from becoming a reality.”There was, she said, agreement within Nato that “a strengthened presence in the Arctic is crucial for European and North American security”.She saidDenmarkhad “invested significantly in new Arctic capabilities”, while a number of allies were taking part in joint exercises in and around Greenland. “The defence and protection of Greenland is a common concern for the entire Nato alliance,” she said.2:37What do people in Greenland think of Trump’s threats? – videoGreenland: new shipping routes, hidden minerals – and a frontline between the US and Russia?Read moreGreenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the first meeting marked an important step, but that dialogue with the US was dependent on “respect for our constitutional position, for international law, and for our right to our own country”.Nielsen also reiterated several points including that Greenland was “not for sale”, would not be owned by, governed by or be part of the US, and was a “democratic society with self-government”, part of the kingdom of Denmark and, in turn, a member of Nato.The French president,Emmanuel Macron, announced on Wednesday that the first members of the French military were already en route and that others would follow. About 15 French soldiers from the mountain infantry unit were already in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, for a military exercise, French authorities said.Germany said on Thursday that it would deploy a reconnaissance team of 13 personnel. The Netherlands and the UK have also said they will take part in the joint exercises led by Denmark under the name Operation Arctic Endurance.It is a significant moment in terms of symbolism, but the total number of troops will be in the dozens and the duration of the deployment is unknown.Discussions are also being held within Nato about creating an air-policing mission for the Arctic, along the lines of the existing Eastern Sentry operation, on the alliance’s eastern flank.Though the talks go back to last year, when Trump first mooted acquiring Greenland as president, they have gained impetus in the past few days, a senior diplomat from a European Nato member said.“We have to keep Trump happy on Greenland,” they said.View image in fullscreenA Danish military plane on the runway at Nuuk, Greenland, on ThursdayPhotograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/APHere in Greenland we are scared, but certain of one thing: our home is not for sale | Malu RosingRead moreThe Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said on Thursday that he planned to establish a more permanent military presence on Greenland “with a larger Danish contribution”. Military personnel from various Nato countries would be in Greenland on a rotation system, he said.After the high-stakes meeting in Washington, Rasmussen said there continued to be a fundamental disagreement over the island, and that it remained “clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland”.Trump said: “We really need it … If we don’t go in, Russia is going to go in and China is going to go in. And there’s not a thing Denmark can do about it, but we can do everything about it.”Danish and Greenlandic politicians gathered in Copenhagen on Thursday to celebrate Greenlandic New Year’s Eve. Members of the Danish parliament and a Greenlandic committee will meet a delegation of members of the US Congress at the Danish parliament on Friday to talk about cooperation.A series of protests is planned across Denmark and in Nuuk on Saturday.A CNN poll found that three-quarters of Americans opposed the US trying to take control of Greenland, of whom 52% strongly oppose such a move.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandNatoDenmarkEuropean UnionDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are. And an appeal to Minnesotans: I know this is scary. We can – we must – speak out loudly, urgently but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That’s what he wants.”Trump’s warning that he might invoke the Insurrection Act came as, overnight, Walz urged people in Minneapolis to protest peacefully after it was reported on Wednesday evening that a federal officerhad shot a manin the leg during an immigration enforcement operation on the north side of the city.‘Renee Good, ICE bad’: Minneapolis protests – in photosRead moreThe incident sparked protests in Minneapolis.. The city remains on edge just one week after a federal immigration officer thereshot and killedRenee Nicole Good.“State investigators have been on the scene in North Minneapolis,” Walzwroteon X overnight. “I know you’re angry. I’m angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets. But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants.”The Guardianreportedthat several hundred protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting. At a news conference later, the Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said protesters had been “engaging in unlawful behavior” and urged people to leave the area.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said that the shooting occurred as “federal law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela”. The DHSalleged that the manresisted and attacked an officer, and said that two other individuals emerged from a “nearby apartment and also attacked” the officer, who, the department said “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”. The federal government’s account could not immediately be verified.The city ofMinneapolishas said that the man who was shot was taken to a local hospital with “apparent non-life-threatening injuries”.On Wednesday evening, Walzdelivered remarkson the federal presence in Minnesota, in which he said that “news reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities”.Walz said that between 2,000 and 3,000 armed federal agents had been deployed across the state and claimed that the ICE agents, whom he described as “armed”, “masked” and “undertrained”, were “going door to door ordering people to point out where their neighbors of color live”.“They’re pulling over people indiscriminately, including US citizens, and demanding to see their papers,” Walz said.“Just plain grabbing Minnesotans and shoving them into unmarked vans, kidnapping innocent people with no warning and no due process,” he added.“Let’s be very, very clear,” Walz said. “This long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement. Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”During his remarks, Walz called on Trump and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, to “end this occupation”.“You’ve done enough,” he said.On Thursday, Noem told reporters that she had “no plans to pull out of Minnesota” and describes the conditions on the ground in Minnesota “as violent, and a violation of the law in many places”.Noem also said she discussed the Insurrection Act with Trump, and that Trump “certainly has the constitutional authority to utilize that”.“If anything doesn’t change with Governor Walz, I don’t anticipate the streets getting any safer or more peaceful,” Noem added.Askedabout what it would take for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act during a White House press briefing, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said: “That’s only a question, frankly, the president can answer.” She added that Trump’s statement on Truth Social “spoke very loud and clear to Democrats across this country, elected officials who are using their platforms to encourage violence against federal law enforcement officers”.Earlier this week, multiple federal prosecutors in Minnesota and Washington DCresignedover the Trump administration’s handling of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Good. Six attorneys from the US attorney’s office in Minnesota quit, reportedly over the justice department’s reluctance to investigate the ICE agent who fatally shot Good. A justice department spokespersonconfirmedthe resignations in a statement to the Guardian but denied they were related to the Minneapolis shooting.The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesotaannouncedit had filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration on behalf of three community members, alleging that immigration agents violated their constitutional rights.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaDonald TrumpMinneapolisMinnesota ICE shootingICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US policingUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement to the Guardian, Iceland’s foreign ministry said it had contacted the US embassy for clarification. “The ministry for foreign affairs contacted the US embassy in Iceland to verify the veracity of the alleged comments,” it said.‘Like Maga disciples’: meet the Trump envoys raising eyebrows in EuropeRead moreIn a petition calling on Iceland’s foreign minister, Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, to reject Long as ambassador to the country, critics said: “These words, spoken by Billy Long, whom Donald Trump has nominated as ambassador to Iceland, may have been said in jest. Still, they are offensive to Iceland and the Icelandic people, who have had to fight for their freedom and have always been a friend to the United States,”the petition read.Within hours of its launch, more than 3,200 people had signed the petition, backing the call for the US to “nominate another person who shows greater respect for Iceland and the Icelandic people”.On Wednesday Long reportedly apologised for the remarks in an interview with Arctic Today, a news website that covers the region. The outlet quoted him as saying the comments had been made in jest as others were joking about Jeff Landry, Trump’s US special envoy toGreenland.“There was nothing serious about that, I was with some people, who I hadn’t met for three years, and they were kidding about Jeff Landry being governor of Greenland and they started joking about me and if anyone took offence to it, then I apologise,”the publication quoted Long as saying.Though Long said he could understand why the comments would have set off a reaction, he was adamant they were a joke and should not be taken seriously.“I apologise and that’s my only comment, I look forward to working with the people of Iceland and I apologise it was taken that way. I was with a group of friends and there was nothing serious about it,” he added.On Thursday, Sigmar Guðmundsson, an MP for Iceland whose centrist Liberal Reform party is part of the country’s governing coalition, described the remarks as “not a particularly funny joke” given the tensions over Greenland.“It goes without saying that this is extremely serious for a small country like Iceland,”he told the Icelandic newspaper Morgunblaðið.“We must realise that all the security arguments that the Americans cite regarding Greenland also apply to Iceland. This is about the location of these two islands.”He described the comments as a sign of the growing disrespect in the US towards the sovereignty of small states. “Icelanders also have to have the courage, despite our very friendly relations with the United States, not least through Nato, to discuss where and how our security interests are best served in this changing world.”Explore more on these topicsIcelandUS foreign policyGreenlandTrump administrationEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It published blurry, black-and-white aerial footage appearing to show service members descending on to the tanker’s deck from a helicopter.“[Forces] launched from USS Gerald R Ford (CVN 78) and apprehended Motor/Tanker Veronica without incident. The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump’s established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean, proving the effectiveness of Operation Southern Spear yet again,” the message said.It did not explain precisely where the operation took place, but according tomarinetraffic.comthe 815ft (249m) vessel’s last recorded position 12 days ago was off the coast of Venezuela.According to Reuters, citing shipping documents from state company PDVSA and monitoring service tankertrackers.com, it departed empty from Venezuelan waters in early January, but had not returned toVenezuelaas other ships have in recent days.It is the sixth known boarding and seizure by the US military of a foreign-flagged oil tanker in support of Trump’s clamping down on the Venezuelan oil industry since the capture of Maduro and his subsequent removal to the US earlier this month, an operation including air strikes on Caracas that Venezuelan officials say killed more than 100 military personnel and civilians.On Friday, Southern Command announced theboarding of a vessel named Olinain the Caribbean Sea near Trinidad, the fifth interdiction of such ships in recent weeks. That assault was also launched from the aircraft carrier the USS Gerald R Ford.Separately, there have been a series of strikes onsuspected drug boatsoff the coast of Venezuela since the autumn.TheTrump administrationhas moved to control the distribution of Venezuela’s oil products globally after ousting Maduro.“The Department of War is unwavering in its mission to crush illicit activity in the Western Hemisphere,” Southern Command said in its post on Thursday.The US has said Venezuela is using false-flag tankers to try to disguise its operations, or using vessels whose registrations were cancelled before they were intercepted. In the first and most prominent such action to date, US forcesboarded the Russian-flagged oil tanker Marinerain the Atlantic on 7 January.That ship, which was being shadowed by a Russian submarine, was pursued across the Atlantic from the Caribbean for more than two weeks. Britain’s Ministry of Defence confirmed it had assisted US forces in the operation to capture it.Trump announced last week an agreement with Venezuela’s interim leaders that he said would provide up to50m barrels of crude oilto the US. He also signed an executive order to “safeguard” Venezuelan oil revenues in US-controlled accounts.Politically, the president has largely sidelined Machado, instead recognizing Maduro’s former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, as Venezuela’s interim leader even as Trump insists the US will “run” the country.On the day of Maduro’s capture, the US president remarked that Machado was a “nice woman”, but claimed she lacked the “respect” needed to govern Venezuela.Venezuela’s ambassador to the UK, Félix Plasencia, an ally of Rodríguez, was also scheduled to be in Washington on Thursday to discuss with Trump administration officials the next steps of a plan for the country’s immediate future.Additional reporting by Lauren GambinoExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsVenezuelaOilnewsShareReuse this content"

He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind’s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.Norwegian company Equinor owns Empire Wind. Spokesperson David Schoetz said they welcomed the court’s decision and would continue to work in collaboration with authorities. It is the second developer to prevail in court against the administration this week.The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects on the east coast days before Christmas, citing national security concerns. Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House, most recently calling windfarms “losers” that lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.Developers and states sued seeking to block the order. Large, ocean-based windfarms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in east coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays.New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, applauded the court decision, telling reporters the projects had been “stopped under the bogus pretense of national security”.“When I heard this I said one thing: I’m the governor of New York, if there is a national security threat off the coast of New York, you need to tell me what it is. I want a briefing right now. Well, lo and behold, they had no answer,” she said.On Monday, a judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could resume its project to serve Rhode Island and Connecticut. Senior judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not sufficiently explain the need for a complete stop to construction. That windfarm, called Revolution Wind, is nearly complete. It is expected to meet roughly 20% of the electricity needs in Rhode Island, the smallest state, and about 5% of Connecticut’s electricity needs.Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York, with a hearing still to be set. DominionEnergyVirginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, plans to ask a judge on Friday to block the administration’s order so it can resume construction, too.Trump has also dismissed offshore wind developments as ugly, but the Empire project is about 14 miles (22.5km) offshore and the Sunrise project is about 30 miles offshore.The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind LLC, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, joined the rest of the developers in challenging the administration on Thursday. They filed a complaint in district court in Boston.In contrast to the halted action in the US, the global offshore wind market is growing, with China leading the world in new installations. Nearly all of the new electricity added to the grid in 2024 was renewable. The British government said on Wednesday it had secured a record 8.4 gigawatts of offshore wind in Europe’s largest offshore wind auction, enough clean electricity to power more than 12m homes.Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, said the Trump administration was right to stop construction on national security grounds. He urged officials to immediately appeal the adverse rulings and seek to halt all work pending appellate review. Opponents of offshore wind projects are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey.Empire Wind is 60% complete and designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Equinor said the project was in jeopardy due to the limited availability of specialized vessels, as well as heavy financial losses.During a hearing on Wednesday, Judge Nichols said the government’s main security concern seemed to be over operation of the wind turbines, not construction, although the government pushed back on that contention.In presenting the government’s case, associate attorney general Stanley Woodward Jr was skeptical of the perfect storm of horrible events that Empire Wind said would derail their entire project if construction did not resume. He disagreed with the contention that the government’s main concern was over operation.“I don’t see how you can make this distinction,” Woodward said. He likened it to a nuclear project being built that presented a national security risk. The government would oppose it being built, and it turning on.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpEnergyRenewable energyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Low doses of pesticides are widespread in the environment, so their effects should be studied and understood, the authors said.Researcher Kai Huang, who also worked on the study, combined field observations of more than 20,000 lake skygazer fish from lakes in China with persistent low levels of the common pesticide chlorpyrifos.The research found that fish from pesticide-affected lakes showed shortened telomeres, the caps at the end of chromosomes that are known as the biological clock for ageing.When they shorten, it is a sign of cellular ageing and a decline in the body’s regenerative capacity.The lake populations consisted of younger fish, indicating that the pesticides contributed to shortened lives. Laboratory experiments confirmed the findings and showed chronic low-dose exposure reduced fish survival and degraded telomeres. These effects were not seen with acute high-dose exposure.“Given the conserved mechanisms of telomere biology across vertebrates, chronic low-dose exposure to these chemicals may pose similar ageing-related risks in humans, potentially contributing to age-associated diseases,” the researchers write.Rohr said: “When we examined telomere length and deposition of lipofuscin in the livers of the fish – well-established biological markers of ageing – we found that fish of the same chronological age were ageing faster in the contaminated than clean lakes.”Chemical analysis showed chlorpyrifos, which is banned in the UK and the EU but used in the US and China, was the only compound found in the fish tissues that was consistently associated with signs of ageing. These included shortened telomeres and lipofuscin deposition – a buildup of insoluble proteins often described as cellular “junk”.The worrying ageing effects occurred at concentrations below current US freshwater safety standards, Rohr said, suggesting the effects of chemicals and pesticides could be occurring at low levels over the long term.He said: “Our results challenge the assumption that chemicals are safe if they do not cause immediate harm. Low-level exposures can silently accumulate damage over time by accelerating biological ageing, highlighting that chemical safety assessments must move beyond short-term toxicity tests to adequately protect environmental and human health.”While short-term exposure to high doses did not appear to cause these ageing issues – though it did cause high toxicity and death in fish – the researchers concluded that it was long-term exposure to low doses that drove the changes.The scientists added that reduced lifespan was particularly problematic because older fish often contribute disproportionately to reproduction, genetic diversity and population stability.Explore more on these topicsFishPesticidesPollutionWaterAgeingAgricultureBiologynewsShareReuse this content"

Then I heard a strange noise’ – This is climate breakdownRead more“This chilling effect can limit the advance of scientific knowledge and restrict public access to accurate and high‐quality information. In addition, the spread of conspiracy theories about climate control and weather manipulation directly affects the perception of the current climate alert. Denial that extreme weather events are a result of global warming finds support in these theories, undermining global efforts to mitigate and respond to climate change.”Anotherstudy from 2024found that climate emergency denialism was especially prevalent on X, with denialism identified in 49.1% of posts and climate-related hate speech in 17.6% of posts.Rubén del Campo, a spokesperson for Aemet,told El País: “Although I know that my job means I get a lot of exposure, when you see messages attacking you and using your photo – often for made-up stuff you’ve never said – you feel bad.”At the end of her letter, Aagesen told prosecutors that the ministry was prepared to “help them in any way they may deem appropriate”.X was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSpainClimate crisisMeteorologySocial mediaHate crimeDigital mediaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Even from the perspective of a single-engine ultralight aircraft, we are warned it will be hard to spot the last elephant in Badingilo national park, a protected area covering nearly 9,000 sq km (3,475 sq miles).Technology helps – the 20-year-old bull elephant wears a GPS collar that pings coordinates every hour. The animal’s behaviour patterns also help; Badingilo’s last elephant is so lonely that it moves with a herd of giraffes.Fifty years ago, life for elephants in this part ofAfricawas very different. In the early 1970s, an English ecologist called Dr Murray Watson crisscrossed the skies of Sudan in a bush plane to measure wildlife populations. While Watson’s methodology wasn’t as reliable as modern counts, he estimated there were about 133,500 elephants in what is now South Sudan.Today, the country’s known population of elephants is down to about 5% of what it was 50 years ago, says Mike Fay, a US conservationist who has spent 45 years documenting and securing wildlife populations in the Sahel and central Africa.View image in fullscreenThe last remaining elephant in Badingilo national park, South SudanMeanwhile, in southern Africa, the opposite problem exists. In parts of the Kavango Zambezi transfrontier conservation area, or Kaza – a contiguous protected landscape encompassing swathes of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia andZimbabwe(and part of Angola) – law enforcement and conservation work has been so successful that local people struggle with too many elephants, leading to an increase in human-wildlife conflict.The problem is especially pressing on Kaza’s eastern edge, where people and pachyderms are being squeezed into tighter land parcels without the ecological resources to sustain them. Governments, communities and conservationists debate whether the elephants should be culled for food, hunted to generate community income, fenced or translocated.To document the challenge in different parts of Africa, I teamed up with photographer Tom Parker to follow this story in the north – in South Sudan, Garamba national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gambella national park in Ethiopia – and in the south: Zimbabwe, Botswana and Zambia.View image in fullscreenA herd of elephants in Zakouma national park, Chad.

Fay is African Parks’ landscape coordinator for the Great Nile migration landscape. The NGO has a 10-year agreement with the government to manage 150,000 sq km of land – a region about the size of Nepal.“This is the greatest conservation opportunity on Earth, but also one of the greatest challenges that any conservation organisation has ever taken on,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe Great Nile Migration involves four species of antelope which move seasonally across the vast grasslands between South Sudan and into south-western EthiopiaOptimism about that potential has been boosted by the discovery in 2023 that this ecosystem hosts thelargest land mammal migrationleft on the planet, dominated by white-eared kob. The migration has endureddespite Africa’s longest-running civil war. But other fauna have not fared so well – including the region’s elephants.View image in fullscreenWildlife expert Mike Fay in the African Parks office in JubaA hunter in Boma’s Maruwa village says he last saw an elephant four years ago. The last one he killed was two years before that. “I was hungry,” he says.The hunter made some money from the ivory – $50 (£37) for each tusk, divided between five men. Our conversation draws in bystanders: occasional goldminers, ex-soldiers, a teacher who has not been paid for a year. “We don’t think [the elephants] are dead,” says one of the men, “but they’re going to faraway places.”The hunter says that if he encountered an elephant again, he’d kill it: “For food. We’re really poor. We have nothing. No one standing here has a job. All we can do is survive.”View image in fullscreenCattle herders belonging to the pastoralist Murle people in Boma, South Sudan, a region where elephants are now rarely sightedIn another village in Badingilo, African Parks’ community officer, David Liwaya – a refugee from the civil war who returned to South Sudan from Kenya to work in conservation – puts the debate into stark perspective: “It’s really difficult. Who cares about an elephant when you’re losing your brothers?” But giving up on the future isn’t an option, he says.At the end of 2025, 11 months after our visit, news comes from the African Parks team: Badingilo’s last elephant has been killed by suspected poachers along with one of its giraffe companions.Too many elephants?: ZimbabweView image in fullscreenAn artificially-filled watering hole in Hwange national park, where vultures gather around an elephant carcass while others come to drinkAbout 3,200 km (2,000 miles) away, outside Victoria Falls international airport in Zimbabwe, a road sign warns of elephants on the move. The road passes through a township called Mkhosana. Among the tightly packed homes, stories of human-wildlife conflict are ubiquitous – a situation aggravated by climate breakdown as elephants search for food and water in a worsening drought.View image in fullscreenFransica Sibanda, whose husband was killed by an elephantFransica Sibanda was recently widowed by an elephant, which trampled her husband yards from their home. “I now live in fear,” she says; “the park needs to put in a fence, or chase the elephants out.” A neighbour, Ireene Nyathi, describes watching a man being picked up by an elephant and crushed against her wall: “I think the elephant should be found and shot,” says Nyathi.“Tourists don’t see this,” says Miriam Esther, a local water development coordinator: “They just go to the hotels, see Vic Falls, photograph the animals.”Farther south, near Zimbabwe’s Hwange national park, a herd of 12 elephants has come into drink in front of the swimming pool of the lodge where we’re staying. To the right, another herd is heading towards the setting sun – a perfect marketing image for safari tourism. But this is a romantic version of reality. On an evening game drive, we encounter a juvenile elephant’s corpse, its grey skin lying in the dust like a castoff winter coat.

The landscape behind shows the damage that elephants inflict searching for foodHwange’s dense elephant population is the result of decades of conservation successes, but also an ecosystem out of balance. About 60,000 of Zimbabwe’s 100,000 elephants come through Hwange in the dry season, which is about twice the broader region’s capacity, says Zimbabwe-based safari guide and conservationist Rob Janisch.When Hwange was first created as a game reserve in 1928, colonial officials put in artificially pumped water holes in a naturally arid area – but because of this intervention, as well as expanding human settlements, the herds aren’t migrating enough for the ecosystem to replenish. “While this was seen as a conservation necessity at the time, hindsight would prove otherwise,” says Janisch.In late 2024,Zimbabwe and Namibian authoritiesannounced significant new elephant culls – often involving big-game hunters who bring much-needed revenue. Botswana floated reintroducing this strategy too, to global outcry. Many local people who don’t derive their incomes from the wildlife economy say outsiders don’t understand the pressures. Godwill Ruona, a taxidermist in Victoria Falls, calls elephants “the heartbeat of the bush”, but says there are too many of them. “You can’t sit in Paris and tell us what is happening in Zimbabwe.”View image in fullscreenThis elephant protection fence pictured at night at a farm in Botswana, is a combination of solar-powered electric fencing and ‘disco’ lights to deter elephants from crop-raidingSome solutions are having an effect. Deterrents include whips that sound like gunfire, bonfires,“chilli fences”(the pungent chemicals irritate elephants’ sense of smell). Communities such as Ngamo are investing in high-voltage rhino fencing to separate the park and villagers.While this helps on a local level, it doesn’t get around the fact elephants still need space to move. In some cases, relocation is possible – in 2016,African Parks moved 500 elephantshundreds of miles between two parks in Malawi, the biggest in-country elephant translocation ever undertaken – but with conservation NGO budgets being cut across the continent, doing so at scale is challenging.Ancient elephant migration routes are being blocked off – can anything stop the rising death toll?Read moreNone of this is to diminish the pockets of well-managed landscapes that have had remarkable successes, or the work of heroic grassroots conservationists chipping away to facilitate human-wildlife coexistence.Each of these victories matter. And while there is no single solution for Africa’s elephants, the vast differences between Kaza and South Sudan also share common ground – that in an age of mass extinction, failure isn’t an option.Travel for this reporting was supported by Michael Lorentz, Rob Janisch andthe Safarious FundFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionSouth SudanZimbabweNational parksAfricaWildlifeConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To date, we have not received any conduct referrals relating to individual officers or members of police staff.”They added: “We do have the ability to ‘call in’ matters using our powers of initiative, without waiting for a referral, if evidence appears to warrant an independent investigation. We are prepared to use that power if it would be appropriate to do so. It’s important we understand why the appropriate authorities haven’t made a referral before we take that step.”Under the laws governing policing, Guildford can only be ousted by Simon Foster, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands. Foster declined to say that he had confidence in his chief constable.Sources said the PCC was determined to wait for a public inquisition of Guildford by him on 27 January, a further report from Cooke, as well as one from MPs on the home affairs committee.If the PCC decides he wants Guildford gone, then a legal process must be followed. One issue is whether the report from Cooke, which he describes as interim and possibly subject to change, is enough grounds to require the chief constable’s resignation – and whether it would withstand legal challenge. Guildford has consulted lawyers and any action by the PCC could be judicially reviewed.Lisa Townsend, Surrey’s Conservative police and crime commissioner, said: “The responsibility of police and crime commissioners, both in statute and in elected mandate, is clear. We must hold our chief constables to account on behalf of the public.“In this case, a chief constable has admitted to misleading MPs. At that point I believe his position became untenable and in the absence of his resignation, he should be relieved of his duties.”Senior cabinet ministers have kept the pressure on Guildford to go.The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “Having watched West Midlands police contradict me, contradict this government and contradict their own evidence in public over recent months, and seeing all of that laid bare in a report that the home secretary brought to this house yesterday, I do want to say to him that I believe it is astonishing that the chief constable remains in post and I hope he will seriously reflect.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting,said it was “absolutely outrageous”Guildford had not yet gone: “I find it jaw-dropping, actually, that having misled parliament and misled the public, that the chief constable hasn’t resigned.“I find it even more extraordinary that having lost the confidence of the home secretary, who is also one of his local MPs and still not resign, I just find that absolutely outrageous.”Explore more on these topicsPolicePolice and crime commissionersWest MidlandsMaccabi Tel AvivIndependent Office for Police ConductnewsShareReuse this content"

Some experts say they could be viewed as “discretionary” spending that someone could cancel, and as a result may not have an impact on the amount a homebuyer can borrow.The number of people in the UK using weight loss drugs has soared, with the vast majority paying to get them privately. An estimated 1.6 million adults in England, Wales and Scotland used drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro to help lose weight between early 2024 and early 2025, according to a study by researchers at University College London (UCL)published this month.Wegovy and Mounjaro can be bought with a private prescription at supermarkets and chemists at a typical cost last year of £100 to £350 a month. These sums are likely to have risen in many cases afterprice hikesfor treatments such as Mounjaro, which have prompted some people to switch to cheaper jabs.As part of mortgage lenders’ affordability checks, they usually say they will want to see bank statements and payslips to check applicants can afford the repayments. They will want to know about personal expenses such as gym memberships and TV, music and games subscriptions – prompting many experts to advise would-be homebuyers to cut back on non-essential spending in the months before they apply for a mortgage.Many brokers argue, however, that most banks and building societies do not go through people’s bank statements nowadays, so such expenditure may not come to light.However, Aaron Strutt at the broker Trinity Financial said that if an applicant was spending several hundred pounds a month on weight loss drugs, “the lender is probably going to want to know about it”.Such payments could stop at any time so are technically not an ongoing credit commitment, but if the lender spotted them on your bank statements “they might ask questions”, he said.Alexander said that if regular weight loss jab payments showed up on someone’s bank statements, “lenders will treat them like any other committed bill – even if they never ask you about it. A regular £200 to £300 outgoing could reduce your spare income in affordability checks, so the maximum loan on offer shrinks”. It could particularly affect some first-time buyers or those on tighter budgets, he said.Alexander said a regular £250 monthly payment could knock £10,000 to £20,000 off the maximum loan offered to a first-time buyer on a modest salary.David Hollingworth of the broker L&C Mortgages said he had not heard of this issue “causing major problems”. He said this was largely likely to be seen as discretionary spending where, in theory, you could stop taking the treatment, so “it’s not something that’s likely to be picked up en masse”. But, he said, “there’s the possibility that an underwriter might raise it … It’s possible a lender could ask about it.”Similarly, Nicholas Mendes at the broker John Charcol said that if a lender was to look at someone’s bank statements, any outgoings that could be viewed as quite high were likely to prompt questions. However, he added: “It’s something that someone could cancel.”Explore more on these topicsMortgagesWeight-loss drugsPropertynewsShareReuse this content"

The work of six artists is being shown at five galleries dotted across Wales.View image in fullscreenAntonio Paucar worked as a beekeeper in the highlands of Peru before travelling to Berlin to study art.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianSpeaking to the Guardian in Cardiff before the prize ceremony, Paucar said: “I didn’t expect it. The journey of an artist is very difficult. For me this kind of recognition is very important for my region, my country, my culture. It gives me strength to continue developing new projects.”Paucar comes from the village of Aza, near Huancayo, in the Junín region of central Peru, where his family make traditional figures and masks. He worked as a beekeeper in the highlands of Peru before travelling to Berlin to study art.He now splits his time between making art aimed at highlighting environmental issues and helping to preserve his culture and language – and looking after bees. “I have a countryside kind of life: we keep hens and grow vegetables,” he said.View image in fullscreenIn the Andes, ‘life is not linear like the European way of thinking’, said Antonio Paucar.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianAmong Paucar’s work on display atNational Museum Cardiffis a spiral made out of black and white alpaca wool, La Energía Espiral del Ayni.Paucar said: “Ayniis a Quechua word. It represents an Andean concept, a way of thinking, the idea that everything is linked. It has allowed people in the Andes to maintain a balance with nature. If the mountains give us food and life, we also have to give them life. Life is not linear like the European way of thinking. It’s not that we are born here and die here. We are circular.”When he collected alpaca wool from the mountains, Paucar was surprised how difficult it was to find black wool. “I thought it was important to have black and white wool. It was easy to find white wool because in the textile industry there is a demand for white because it can be dyed. The black colour is disappearing.”View image in fullscreenPaucar wrote messages in his own blood to highlight the climate and pollution crises.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianAnother work, El Corazón de la Montaña , features a video of Paucar sitting at a desk in the mountains, writing with blood drawn from his body. The message he wrote highlights the climate and pollution crises: “The glaciers in the Andes are crying/With their mournful cry they melt forever.”One of his pieces on display at Mostyn, Llandudno, in north Wales, features the imprints of Paucar’s footprints on the wall. He tramped over the nearby limestone headland Y Gogarth (the Great Orme) in his bare feet and then performed a handstand back at the gallery. His feet came to rest on the wall, leaving a ghostly imprint.Paucar said he had seen parallels between Peru and Wales. “The Celtic culture was very linked to nature. That is also the case with the Andean culture. Maintaining the language is also important in Wales and where I am from.”Not all of his work has been universally well received. The Guardian’s art writer Jonathan Jones was no fan of a video shown at Mostyn of Paucar burying and burning a reproduction of Marcel Duchamp’s 1913 artwork Bicycle Wheel.Jones wrote: “A performance attacking an icon of western art only makes sense to those in the know.” Paucar said he respected Duchamp and the piece was a reference to a wheel he had played with as a child.View image in fullscreenArtes Mundi runs at the National Museum Cardiff (above), Mostyn, Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Chapter and the Glynn Vivian art gallery until 1 March.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianThe director of Artes Mundi, Nigel Prince, said as many as 150,000 people were expected to have seen the work of Paucar and the other artists by the time the exhibition ended.Prince said it was positive that parallels between Celtic western Europe and the Peruvian Andes had emerged. “We are really interested to focus on things that bring people together,” he said. “In today’s global context, where there often can be an emphasis on focusing on difference as a means to divide and rend apart, I actually think that opens up a sort of sharing and a dialogue.”Artes Mundi can be viewed at five galleries across Wales until 1 March 2026.Explore more on these topicsArtAwards and prizesWalesPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Disco, Occasionally will be released on 6 March. It was produced by Kid Harpoon, the British songwriter and producer who has worked on all of Styles’ previous albums. The artwork shows the 31-year-old pop star wearing sunglasses and ducking beneath a disco ball seemingly suspended from the night sky.The 12-song track list has not been shared – nor any music – but Styles’ web store offered packages including vinyl, cassettes, T-shirts, what appears to be an analogue camera and a bum bag. The site seemed to immediately crash on the announcement.The long-awaited album news followed Styles sending a voice note of him singing “we belong together” to fans who had signed up to a WhatsApp promo line earlier in the day.It has been reported that Styles will give a second residency at Madison Square Garden in New York after playing 15 sold-out shows at the venue in 2022. It is also rumoured that Styles will hold a residency at the Co-op Live in Manchester, in which he is an investor. He has been tipped by bookies as a potential headliner of Glastonbury 2027 after the festival takes a fallow year this summer.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Harry Styles’ album Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally.Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally comes four years after Harry’s House, which reached No 1 around the world and was certified triple platinum in the UK with more than 900,000 certified sales. It won the coveted album of the year at the 2023 Grammy awards in addition to two other categories. It was also named album of the year at the 2023 Brit awards and spawned the hit single As It Was, his most-streamed song on Spotify with 4.2bn streams.The last new music Styles released was Forever, Forever, an eight-and-a-half minute instrumental song played on piano that he previously performed on the final date of his 2023 tour. Each of Styles’ previous albums was co-produced by Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson.The album will be Styles’ first since the death of his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne in October 2024 at the age of 31. Payne fell from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aries. In a statement released at the time, Styles said that Payne’s “greatest joy was making other people happy, and it was an honour to be alongside him as he did it”. One Direction were active from 2010 to 2016 after being formed on The X Factor.Outside music, Styles has made headlines as a marathon runner. He finished the 2025 Tokyo marathon in three hours and 24 minutes in March, but blitzed his own time at the Berlin marathon in September, achieving a covetedsub-three-hour finishin two hours and 59 minutes. His lifestyle brand Pleasing also made the news last year when it launched a sex toy and lube, complementing the line’s apparel, accessories and beauty products.In May, he was, mysteriously, spotted in Rome awaiting the announcement of the new pope, Leo XIV, wearing a cap emblazoned with “techno is my boyfriend”. If his new record contains religious themes, he will be in good company, after Rosalía’s Lux: released in November, the Catalan star’s fourth album referenced numerous saints from across history.Styles has also backed Ed Sheeran’s call for the government to provide funding for music education, investing in schools, training for music teachers, grassroots venues, apprenticeships and a diverse curriculum.In 2022 he starred in the films My Policeman and Don’t Worry Darling. Styles has no future publicised movie appearances.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The drugs led them to three gangs, includinga Balkan cartel, who were working together to bring huge quantities of cocaine into Spain from Colombia.‘The cocaine superhighway’: how death and destruction mark drug’s path from South America to EuropeRead more“The gangs used the so-called ‘monkey’ technique to get the shipments of cocaine into maritime containers that were being transported on container ships,” the force said in a statement on Thursday.“The drug-trafficking technique involves using youngsters from poor backgrounds who are good swimmers to get the drugs on to ships while they’re at sea.“Members of the same organisation then headed toSpainin order to get to the containers by intercepting the ships carrying them before they reached the strait of Gibraltar.”One such attempt was thwarted in the middle of last year when a ship bound for the port of Cádiz informed the maritime rescue service that it had found stowaways on its deck, leading to the seizure of a container in which 1.4 tonnes of cocaine had been stashed. The stowaways turned out to be three men tasked with recovering the drugs, who then fled.Not long after, a ship passing through Portuguese waters reported armed stowaways on board. But the men managed to unload bundles of cocaine that had been hidden in a container and hand them to their accomplices before evading the authorities.In the autumn of last year, officer came across five men – three Colombians and two Spain-based members of the Balkan cartel – who were using speedboats andthe “drop-off” methodto collect their drugs.“This method involves throwing the merchandise from a merchant ship for collection by smaller vessels near the destination country, subduing the ship’s crew and extracting the drugs from inside the containers, using military techniques and weapons of war,” the statement added.The drugs were then hidden in towns and villages along the Gulf of Cádiz and later transported by road to other European countries.As well as confiscating 2,475kg of cocaine and various assault weapons during the operation, police seized boarding ladders, nautical equipment, eight high-end vehicles, more than €166,000 (£144,000) in cash and watches, and jewellery worth €100,000.On Monday the Policía Nacional announced itslargest-ever seizure of cocaine at seaafter officers found almost 10 tonnes of the drug hidden amid a cargo of salt on a merchant ship off the Canary Islands.Explore more on these topicsSpainDrugs tradeEuropeColombianewsShareReuse this content"

But it is concern over Israel’s war in Gaza that has prompted the most intense criticism, with the Irish broadcaster RTÉ citing “the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there” as a reason for its non-participation.Alongside RTÉ, broadcasters from Spain,Iceland, the Netherlands and Slovenia said in December they were pulling out, while the 2024 winner Nemoreturnedtheir trophy in protest.On Tuesday, Conchita Wurst, one of the contest’smost emblematic winners, announced she would not participate in any future Eurovision events, citing a “personal decision”.The Israeli broadcaster Kan has welcomed the decision to keep Israel in the contest, rejecting allegations of political interference. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has said Israel “deserves to be represented on every stage around the world”.Johannes Pietsch, known by the stage name JJ, the 2025 winner, last year called for an Austrian edition “without Israel” but then apologised for the uproar his proposal had caused in his country.Only 97,000 fans watched Monday’s semi-final draw on YouTube, down from more than 240,000 last year. But the EBU rejoiced over a “record sellout of tickets” for the upcoming edition, after the launch of online sales on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A museum’s success can collapse it, like the Louvre, with some rooms becoming oversaturated. The important thing is not to collapse.”View image in fullscreenDetail from The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516) in the Prado.Photograph: Album/AlamyFalomir said the museum had embarked on a new project, called Plan Host, to prioritise quality over quantity and to try to improve or at least maintain visitors’ museum experience.“It can’t be like catching the Metro at rush hour,” said the director, who has been in his post since 2017. “You can’t judge a museum on visitor numbers. The quantity isn’t as important as the quality; there should be a diverse and inclusive range of visitors.”View image in fullscreenSixty-five per cent of the Prado’s visitors last year were from overseas.Photograph: Alex Segre/AlamyGuggenheim scraps Basque Country expansion plan after local protestsRead moreFalomir said 65% of visitors last year were from overseas and he would like to see more Spaniards taking advantage of one of the country’s greatest cultural treasures. Among the plans for improving the quality of visits are optimising entrances to the museum, rethinking the size of visiting groups, and making sure people know they are not allowed to take photos in the galleries.The Louvre madenon-heist-related headlinesa year ago when its director said in a leaked memo that visiting the museum was“a physical ordeal”.

The payment, which was disclosed in the company’s annual report, is not performance-related, meaning that as long as he remains, Hinton will receive it whatever the company’s record on water supplies or pollution.South East Water has faced immense pressure after 30,000 households inKentand East and West Sussex endured days of water supply failures in November and again in January.The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, on Wednesday called on the regulator Ofwat toreview the company’s licence to operate. On Thursday, Ofwat confirmed it had launched an investigation into whether South East Water had “complied with its obligation to provide high standards of customer service and support for its customers”.The outage has forced many of the affected households in the Tunbridge Wells area to pick up bottled water from makeshift distribution centres andtravel out of the area to wash and use flushing toilets. On Thursday, the company said taps “should be flowing as normal” for 2,000 people in Tonbridge and surrounding villages.View image in fullscreenDavid Hinton appears before the environment, food and rural affairs committee on 6 January this year.Photograph: House of Commons/UK parliament/PAThe crisis has thrust Hinton – who has run the company since 2020 – into the spotlight, with several MPscalling for him to resignor refuse his bonus for this financial year. Hinton received £457,000 in the year to June 2025, including a £115,000 bonus.However, a 30% base salary increase, to £400,000, plus two new payments mean he is on track to receive more than that this year – even if he were to receive no performance-related bonus. He is in line for £565,000 in fixed pay this financial year if the service award is divided equally over the five-year period.A government source said that “if the company want to rebuild trust it could start by blocking bonuses for under-performance”.The first payment is a “service award”, worth another £400,000 if Hinton stays until July 2030 – a rate of £80,000 a year. If he is still in the job he will receive the first £80,000 in July 2028, the same the following July and another £240,000 in July 2030.In addition, South East Water awarded Hinton £50,000 in extra pay, described as a “cash allowance”, to compensate him for extra hours related to anappeal to the Competition and Markets Authorityto allow bills to be raise even higher. Other water companies that have appealed do not appear to have awarded extra pay for carrying out the appeal, which is often part of the standard process in the five-yearly reviews.Hinton would also be eligible for a performance-related long-term bonus of up to £600,000 over the five years.South East’s chief financial officer, Andrew Farmer, and other unnamed senior executives will be eligible for similar payments.Mike Martin, the Liberal Democrat MP for Tunbridge Wells, said: “Dave Hinton’s salary and bonuses are wild. He should be ashamed. Try giving us water first, then let’s talk about the money.”Martin added that all bonuses should be performance-related. “Obviously, bonuses should be related to performance otherwise they would be called salary,” the MP said.Gary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said: “It really adds insult to injury to reward the very person ultimately responsible for failing customers – whilst simultaneously increasing their bills. If David Hinton had a shred of decency, he would hand this money back.”Last week, before the latest outages,Hinton told MPson the environment, food and rural affairs committee that he did not want a focus on his bonus and pay during anearlier water crisis in December. He said that was why he had not done media interviews about the water shortages.He has also not given interviews as the latest crisis has unfolded, but the company said he was “absolutely working as hard as everybody else behind the scenes”.However, Hinton acknowledged that his performance-related bonus could be docked this year as a result of the water shortages. He said: “There are different elements to the bonus. For example, health and safety is one element, and a whole load of the elements are on water supply, and I do not expect to get a bonus on either of those elements.”Paddy Goffey, a researcher at the High Pay Centre campaign group said the extra payments appeared to be “a novel form of compensation package”.“Guaranteed service awards of this kind are not common, and executives are typically rewarded through base pay and performance-related incentives based on a range of metrics,” he said. The extra payments appeared to be “rewarding substandard performance and a poor quality of service for customers, while also removing accountability for this”, Goffey added.A spokesperson for the company said: “South East Water remains committed to a remuneration framework that supports a performance culture, and recognises success but does not reward poor performance.“The bonus scheme is evaluated by the company’s independent non-executive director-led remuneration committee. The executive directors are not part of this committee and have no say in their remuneration.“The bonus scheme is made up of multiple elements, including health and safety factors, an environment programme, and staff engagement. We can confirm that no bonus payment was made for operational performance for the year 2024-25.”Explore more on these topicsWater industryExecutive pay and bonusesUtilitiesWaterKentnewsShareReuse this content"

Gupta built up a collection of metals businesses around the world, and forged a close relationship with Greensill to finance them.The Greensill collapse caused severe problems for the GFG Alliance. In 2021 the UK’s Serious Fraud Office opened an investigation into suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering in relation to its financing from GCUK. Gupta has since lost control of several of his steel and aluminium businesses in the UK, Europe and Australia after the Greensill collapse prompted a desperate scramble to secure new financing.Lawyers for GBAG told a hearing on Thursday the government breached its contract with GCUK and acted “capriciously” by terminating the guarantees, and is seeking more than £331m in damages.The government is defending the claim, with its barristerssaying it “lawfully determined” GCUK had failed to act in accordance with the terms of the scheme guarantees by giving money to several businesses owned by Gupta.The hearing, presided over by Justice Robin Knowles, involved several procedural issues ahead of the trial, which is expected to begin in late 2027 and could last up to eight weeks.In written submissions for the hearing in London, Patrick Goodall KC, representing the DBT, said the case relates to the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) and the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme (CLBILS).The schemes helped prevent businesses from going bust in the early days of the pandemic lockdown by enabling accredited lenders to lend money to companies.While the loans were due to be repaid by the companies in full, the lending was backed by an 80% government guarantee through the British Business Bank.Goodall said the government agreed with GCUK in the summer of 2020 that it would guarantee its CBILS and CLBILS loans, but that the DBT was “entitled to terminate a scheme guarantee in certain specified circumstances”.He added that between September and October 2020 GCUK issued loans to three borrowers under CBILS, and eight others under CLBILS.But in April 2022, the government terminated the CLBILS guarantees as six of the eight borrowers were “ultimately owned” by Gupta.Goodall said this meant GCUK lent £300m to those companies when the sum “ought not to have exceeded £50m, given that the borrowers were part of the same group”.He said the DBT “lawfully determined that GCUK failed to act in good faith” by treating the six companies separately to “avoid the restrictions imposed” by the guarantee agreement on lending to groups of firms.Goodall also said GCUK had acted in a manner which could bring the government or the scheme “into disrepute” by “participating in arrangements for the corporate restructuring” of the six companies.In September 2023, the government also terminated its guarantees in relation to the CBILS scheme, claiming GCUK “did not exercise a level of care, control and diligence consistent with the standard required”.Tim Lord KC, representing GBAG, said in his written submissions that the six companies linked to Gupta were not “partner or linked enterprises”, and that GCUK “did not act in bad faith and there is no basis to suggest otherwise”.He said: “GBAG denies the DBTwas entitled to terminate the relevant scheme guarantees.“Alternatively, it claims the decision to terminate was a breach of a term requiring the DBT to act in a reasonable manner and/or not to act capriciously or in a way no reasonable guarantor would have done.”Lord also said the bank alleges there was “considerable political pressure” from the DBT to allow GCUK to be accredited to lend money to Gupta’s companies.In his response to the claim, Goodall said the bank’s pleaded case was “highly inadequate”.The former prime minister David Cameron found himself at the centre of an inquiry after he lobbied the government on Greensill’s behalf to secure state support during the pandemic.The inquiry later foundCameron’s actions had been within the rulesand he had not been required to register as a lobbyist.Greensill is also suing the DBT over alleged misuse of his private information.The department has separately issued disqualification proceedings against Greensill, which could see him barred from managing a UK company for 12 years.Additional reporting by Jasper JollyExplore more on these topicsGreensillCoronavirusBankingShareReuse this content"

As well as Harari and Rose, Bengio has appointed Maria Eitel, the founder of the Nike Foundation – a philanthropic wing of the multinational sports group – as the chair of his safety lab, LawZero, which launched last year.Bengio earned the “godfather of AI” moniker after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton,who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, a former chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.The former Swedish prime minister Stefan Löfven will be the first member of the NGO’s global advisory council. Harari, the author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, has been aprominent voice of caution on AI developmentand recentlypublished a book, Nexus, outlining his concerns.“It’s not only a technical discussion for companies building frontier AI systems,” said Bengio. “It also comes down to what choices are made about AI that we consider to be morally right.”Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, has secured $35m (£26m) of funding for LawZero. It is building a system called Scientist AI that will work alongside autonomous systems – knows as AI agents – and flag potentially harmful behaviour.“The whole construction of the board has been guided by the idea that we need a group of people who are extremely reliable in a moral sense, who can help us keep to LawZero’s mission of delivering technical solutions for trustworthy, highly capable, safe-by-design AI systems as a global public good,” said Bengio.Last month, Bengio warned against granting AI rights, saying it was showing signs of self-preservation – a key area of concern for AI safety campaigners – and humansshould not be impeded from pulling the plug on such systems.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Grok AIXElon MuskTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The average selling price for a private home increased by 5.1% to £374,000, from £356,000.Taylor Wimpey anticipates a lower operating profit margin of 11% for 2025 versus 12.2% in 2024, and expects an even lower margin in 2026, with a smaller order book at the start of the year.This week the housebuilder Persimmon reported stronger growth of 12% to 11,905 completions, while its average selling price increased by 4% to £278,000. However, it said it was “not expecting any material improvement in market conditions this year” despite positive signs since Boxing Day and recent reductions in mortgage rates.On Thursday,Foxtonsreported a 2% drop in like-for-like revenues for property sales last year, blaming a slowdown in the market leading up to the 26 November budget, alongside broader economic uncertainty.The London estate agent’s total revenues for 2025 rose by 5% to £172m, bolstered by lettings revenues and acquisitions such as the agent Cauldwell in Milton Keynes.Foxtons said its sales division had begun 2026 with a lower under-offer pipeline than in 2025 because of the “significant sales market disruption” around the budget and a very strong comparative period last year, when buyers rushed to take advantage of a tax break before its expiry at the end of March.Savills said market uncertainty would “remain elevated in 2026” but added that strong pipelines, improving investor and occupier sentiment would support recovery across its core markets.The company, which is now run by Simon Shaw, who replaced Mark Ridley as chief executive on 1 January, said the market recovery stalled between April and June and into the third quarter of last year as investors and occupiers digested the impact of US tariffs.The upmarket estate agent and property group added that in the UK, its largest market, heightened uncertainty around the budget had a similar dampening effect on the prime housing market.In mainland China, the market declined by more than 20% for a third year, prompting Savills to carry out further restructuring, also implemented in Germany, resulting in a charge of up to £30m for 2025.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ monthly survey showed activity remained weak in December but expectations for sales volumes and prices in 2026 rose.Its head of market research and analysis, Tarrant Parsons, said: “The UK residential market remains in a prolonged soft patch, with December’s survey recording a sixth consecutive month of negative momentum in buyer enquiries. That said, there are tentative signs of a shift in sentiment.”Daly said sheexpected further progresswith the Planning and Infrastructure Act 2025 now in place, which should streamline decision-making and speed up planning consents.Among the changes are new powers for ministers toprevent applications being rejectedby local councils and a more limited role for the advisory body Natural England in minor applications. The government has been struggling to achieve its ambitious target to build 1.5m homes in England by the end of the parliament.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketTaylor WimpeyConstruction industryReal estateFoxtonsSavillsnewsShareReuse this content"

Returning to university in Manchester in the mid-90s for a new term, she was attempting to put on an enormous rucksack full of books (she did English). As she managed to get the thing on, she experienced an error in balance, fell backwards and laid on the platform, wiggling her arms and legs like an inverted tortoise, unable to move.Along came Alan Rickman, clearly intending to board the same train. He stopped, pointed at her and laughed before striding off up the platform. She never felt it was unkind, more that she was playing a role in some impromptu station art performance.TerryHFS‘One of the all-time greatest and nastiest screen villains’He was one of the all-time greatest and nastiest screen villains inDie Hard, completely opposite of course to the real Alan Rickman off-screen, with perhaps the most extraordinary – and most deserved – death scene for any villain.At a tribute event some years later for Bruce Willis, Rickman turned up with a bandaged head, and crutches or similar to mockingly show his character had somehow survived (he must have landed on a cushion or something), summing up his good-natured sense of humour. He is still much missed.JFBridgeView image in fullscreen‘Extraordinary death scene’ … as Hans Gruber in Die Hard.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy‘He mastered silences on screen’One of the qualities I always felt Alan Rickman had was that whatever role he was playing, you could almost hear what his characters were thinking beyond the lines they were saying. He had mastered silences and stares on screen.gavernism‘A wonderful human’What a strange irony that such a wonderful human will be primarily remembered as a movie baddie, but I can’t think of another actor who relished those roles as much as he did. Most film stars want to be liked way too much to play them with the conviction Alan brought. He didn’t need our adoration – he clearly had enough of that from his friends.Keef08View image in fullscreenRickman with Lesley Manville in Les Liaisons Dangereuses at the Royal Shakespeare Company, 1985.Photograph: Donald Cooper/Alamy‘Incredibly knowledgable’I met him once. Not a humble brag. But it was an astonishing encounter with a wonderfully engaging man. I was a lowly arts council officer (as we were called then – this is 2003, I think). I was invited to an aftershow party at the Barbican after a Richard Maxwell play (I think it might have been Drummer Wanted). It wasn’t a starry do – just a few dozen theatre nerds excited to have witnessed another brilliant experiment in theatre.I remember standing on my own with a glass of wine when Alan Rickman introduced himself and asked what I thought of the play. For the next half an hour we chatted about our shared love of experimental theatre practices – Forced Entertainment, the Wooster Group, Lone Twin etc.He was passionate about all of it, incredibly knowledgable, eager to hear my thoughts, happy to learn, unhurried. It was just 30 minutes but I still remember it distinctly 25 years later. And that voice …theatredavid‘Keep the sssssstichesssss sssssmall!’I liked Alan Rickman ever since I saw him as the preposterous Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood. My sister and I (both young teenagers then) mimicked his lines in that film for ages (“and keep the sssssstichesssss sssssmall!”). Later I saw him in a few other things and always found him beautiful: a graceful man with a kind of sadness and intelligence in his expression. It’s wonderful to read how much he was loved by those who knew him personally.kastachicoryView image in fullscreen‘A graceful man’ … as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.Photograph: Warner Bros./Allstar‘Hard to believe Hans Gruber was his very first movie role’It’s still very hard to believe Hans Gruber was his very first movie role. Yes he had years of theatre experience but acting in a hoped-for blockbuster is very different. The elan with which he essays a role that is at times three roles at the same time – German thief pretending to be German terrorist pretending to be an American businessman – is impressive enough, but it’s the little details like the hyper-accurate way he makes a tiny grammatical mistake when explaining about watching his father make models.ChrisMRogers‘A true gent’I had the pleasure of working with Alan Rickman when he directed The Winter Guest at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. I was only a lowly assistant stage manager so there was no reason for him to get to know me, but he did and it was appreciated. After the show opened he came back just before it finished to see everyone and he found me setting up the show. “Hello Simon, how are you?” he said. My name is not Simon but ASMs are used to being forgotten so I didn’t correct him. He left me and then did one of the best double take re-entrances not captured on camera – “JON! Oh my God, I am so sorry!! I called you Simon!!” He was truly mortified! A month later – long after the show had moved to London – my first child arrived, followed swiftly by a bottle of champagne and a card from Alan. He’d asked the company manager to let him know when the baby came. He was a true gent and a pleasure to know, even for a short while.MelhenneyExplore more on these topicsFilmAlan RickmanDie HardRobin HoodTheatreShareReuse this content"

I’d been his boss and trained him, so kissing him would be highly inappropriate. However, if somebody is looking to see me kiss Mr Washington, please whisper that into his ear.I hear you’re a big fan of knitting. What’s been your greatest knitted creation?TopTrampThe knitting has been eclipsed by pottery the past three years. I go to a local pottery studio, do what I can on a wheel, and get my creativity out there. The knitting was a wonderful thing. I’d make simple squares without having to count stitches, then sew them all together. I must have made about a dozen blankets, most of which are still in a trunk upstairs. If I get another job in television – which I hope I do – that has you sitting around quite a bit, so knitting is a good mobile craft.You’re brilliant as both goodies and baddies – how do you choose?JolaferMy work chooses me. The mark of a really good actor is one that has a range and doesn’t just show up in the same role again and again. I’m happy to play what I’m offered – apart from afterThe Fighter, when all I was offered was older, nasty women. I don’t want to do that any more.View image in fullscreenPlaying Alice in The Fighter.Photograph: Paramount/Everett/ShutterstockYou’ve played lots of blue-collar characters. Do you get the urge to play somebody really posh and rich?PeteTheBeatAbsolutely! I amdyingto do that kind of work. I’ve been asking for years: “Please, may I play the princess? The glorious, kind, benevolent queen?” I want lovely fancy costumes, maybe from another period. Years ago, I made a film called A Time of Destiny, which was set in the 40s. Not all actors can fit in period pieces because they feel too modern, but I can play goodies and baddies – past, present and future.What was it like filming police drama Homicide: Life on the Street [the series ran from1993 to 1999], and did you get to hang out with the cast afterwards?Oberursel67The cast was almost all male, so that perhaps answers that question. Did they invite me to the bars with them – the single mother of a seven-year-old? No. It was a lot of years together, so I held a lot of those guys really close. But I don’t do what I do for the party afterwards. I’m more interested in the process.How did you get into the role of Alice Eklund-Ward in The Fighter?LeobatchI accepted because David [O Russell, director] really, really wanted me to be his Alice. Then I met the real Alice Ward, who came from a very different socioeconomic background than my mother’s mother, but there was something of my mother’s mother in her, so that’s where I found a path towards becoming her. I was no more than 10 years older than the majority of the nine people who played Alice’s children, but that’s movies for you.What goes through your mind when you stand up to receive an Oscar?MrSOBaldrickOne loses one’s mind. I had won a lot of prestigious awards for The Fighter that season, and sat in that great gigantic theatre thinking: “Well, it certainlyispossible.” Kirk Douglas came out to present the best supporting actress award, opened the envelope and called my name. I was so delighted to meet him – that was all I was thinking about. I turned to the house, which in most theatres, you can see by looking a little above your own eyesight. In the Dolby theatre, you have to raise your chin like you’re about to scale Mount Everest. Every single actor, director and producer you recognise, is staring you in the face. I then cursed, and I’m still sorry I cursed. I fucking curse all the time, but you cannot curse on network television. Thank God for the 10-second delay, which was introduced for fucking idiots like me. Having said that, winning an Oscar has not been good for me or my career. I didn’t dream of it, I never wanted it, and I had a much better career before I won.View image in fullscreen‘I cursed, and I’m still sorry I cursed’ … Leo accepting her Oscar.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyWhat are your memoriesof filming ABC Western series The Young Riders? I loved your character Emma – it was a shame she left early!Tahra_I agree. It was a total shame. I loved being Emma. I loved being out in Arizona with the horses. I love that people still have such an adoration of that show, 35 years later. Emma was a goodhearted, hardworking woman. I don’t know why I’m not seen as that more often. I’d grown up reading Little House on the Prairie and other Laura Ingalls Wilder books, so I loved going to live in that new west world with the costumes, the long dresses, the corsets and the hairdos.What are your memories of playing Holly in Denis Villeneuve’s 2013 film Prisoners?Sagarmatha1953Holly is so misunderstood. These days, people leave or switch over before the end of a movie. I beg you to watch until the end, because Holly makes her entire history clear in a single speech. You might think she’s a bad person, but she’s just protecting her child, which is an admirable thing.In Olympus Has Fallen, how do the North Koreans capture the White House, yet suddenly become soincompetent once Gerard Butler shows up?zerkaloThat’s exactly how it works. Gerry Butler doesn’t lose in the pictures.Which of your films are you the most proud of?SkillWizardI’ve made several films that nobody’s ever heard of which are very, very good. I cannot recommend seeing my new film The Knife more highly, in which I play a detective who is neither a goodie or a baddie. She’s a woman doing her job, which is of a lot of interest to me. I also have a smaller part in King Ivory, a fascinating, beautiful, painful and truthful portrait of the fentanyl crisis in the US. There’s a wonderful, fantastical small film I made many years ago called Racing Daylight, written and directed by Nicole Quinn, where I get to play a character from both present and past times. There’s another gentle, sweet, delicate film called Francine, where we meet a woman on the day that she’s been released from a long-term jail sentence and watch her try to integrate back in to society, which I’m very proud of.You’ve said that your best pick-me-up is a good nap. Where’s the weirdest place you’ve ever been caught sneaking in 40 winks?TurangaLeela2Oh, it’s not sneaky at all. If somebody finds me napping, I’m proud of myself because I’ve been able to do the thing any doctor will tell you: get more rest. Just don’t let me miss lunch. And don’t let me miss when you need me on set!The Knife is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsMelissa LeoThe FighterTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So the successor to Noomi Rapace, Rooney Mara and Claire Foy is bound to be brilliant – whoever they are …Stuart HeritageThu 15 Jan 2026 09.41 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 11.31 ESTShareThis week Sky announced that it will be remaking Stieg Larsson’s 2005 novel The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo as an eight-part television series. So far, all we know is that it will be set in the present day and will be written by Steve Lightfoot and Angela LaManna.What we don’t know is who will play Lisbeth Salander, the aforementioned girl with the dragon tattoo. And this will be a big deal, because previous screen adaptations of Larsson’s books have made stars of whoever was cast as Salander. In 2009’s Swedish adaptation, she was played by Noomi Rapace, who was nominated for a Bafta. In David Fincher’s 2011 remake, she was played by Rooney Mara, who was nominated for an Oscar. And in 2018’s The Girl in the Spider’s Web adaptation, she was played by Claire Foy, who wasn’t nominated for a Bafta or an Oscar, but was still very good.Sky’s series is going into production this spring, so it is almost certain that it has cast its Salander. But let’s not allow that to stop us indulging in a little mindless casting speculation. Here’s who should play her.Emma CorrinView image in fullscreenOtherworldly intensity … Emma Corrin as Diana, Princess of Wales in The Crown.Photograph: Des Willie/NetflixFar and away the best pick for the role, Corrin shares a strange, otherworldly intensity with Salander. They are magnetic and unpredictable, and have a clear talent for challenging characters. They are also very obviously unafraid of playing characters so well known that they run the risk of lapsing into caricature; anyone who dares to playDiana, Princess of Waleswill make mincemeat of Salander. Plus – and it’s a big plus – Sky’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is going to be made by Left Bank Pictures, which also made The Crown. Look at it from a certain angle and you could almost convince yourself that it made The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo only because it had a relationship with Corrin.Jodie ComerView image in fullscreenNot a bad sociopath … Jodie Comer in Killing Eve.Photograph: Anika Molnar/APThis is mainly because Comer is excellent in everything, so it stands to reason that she would be excellent in this. She plays troubled very well (see28 Years Later). She plays capable very well (seeHelp) and she is not a bad sociopath, either (seeKilling Eve). The last also shows that she knows her way around an accent which, since the series is filming in Lithuania, might also be useful. If you want a familiar face who can disappear into a role, she would be the one to pick.Anya Taylor-JoyView image in fullscreenTerrifying … Anya Taylor-Joy in The Queen's Gambit.Photograph: Charlie Gray/APAlthough she has largely left television for film, Taylor-Joy’s biggest star-making vehicle to date is still the Netflix miniseriesThe Queen’s Gambit. She is at her best when she is given time to fully interrogate a role, rather than skate along the surface of a movie as a pretty supporting character, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo would allow her to do exactly that. Also, she would be terrifying, which works in her favour.Alba AugustView image in fullscreenGeographically more authentic … Alba August in The Rain.Photograph: Per Arnesen/NetflixWe shouldn’t forget that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a Swedish book, and therefore it might be better if the series cast someone more geographically authentic. If that’s the case, August, a Danish-Swedish actor, might be a good shout. She has been good in everything she has done – she was fantastic inNetflix’s post-apocalyptic series The Rain– and it feels as if she has been waiting a long time for an English-language breakthrough. This would certainly be that.Noomi RapaceView image in fullscreenAnd repeat … why not bring back Noomi Rapace, seen here with Nils Bjurman, in 2009’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo?Photograph: Nordisk Film/Sportsphoto/AllstarOr how about this? Sky’s announcement made mention of the fact that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo would be set in the present, so perhaps its gimmick is that all the characters are 20 years older than they were when the book was published. If that’s the case, then recasting Rapace in her breakout role would be a no-brainer. Rapace is now 46. Wouldn’t it be interesting to see what Lisbeth would be like in middle age? Has she softened over time, or has she become angrier than ever? The new series probably isn’t going down this route at all, but it would be a fascinating experiment.To the person who has already been cast as Salander, if they are reading this and getting progressively angrier that I haven’t named them as the obvious choice for the role, sorry. You are obviously going to be much better than any of the people I have listed. It’s my fault. I’m just not very imaginative. Unless Corrin has been cast, in which case I told you so.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStieg LarssonThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (US)ThrillersJodie ComerAnya Taylor-JoyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In recent years, the adaptations have been infused with the grief and instability of the postwar backdrop against which they all exist, and been given rich, dark, adult inflections by Sarah Phelps for the BBC.The latest, however, is for Netflix by Chris Chibnall and we are back in the world of period costume, clipped vowels and dialogue infused with nothing but plot, designed to get the puzzle pieces recited into the right position for the next bit then the next bit then the solving – this time at the end of three very hour-long episodes.We open with Iain Glen getting gored to death by a bull in Ronda, 1920. A note with a clock printed on it is delivered to him just before evisceration – because this is Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials and clocks are bloody everywhere.We then cut to a party in a grand house being held by northern industrialists, the Cootes, who have rented the house from Lady Caterham (Helena Bonham Carter) because she has class but no cash and they have cash but no class. You get the idea. If you don’t, there’s a scene where Lady Coote cheats at bridge, so we all know where we stand. But I do have to say this: if you’re going to have posh people snotting all over others, you should make sure they’re not spouting grammatical errors everywhere, unless it’s deliberate and ironically intended. If not, you need to know that it’s “the difference between you and me” not “the difference between you and I” and assorted other points. Is this the smallest hill I will die on? Yes.View image in fullscreenHelena Bonham Carter as Lady Caterham in Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials.Photograph: NetflixThe daughter of the house, Lady Eileen “Bundle” Brent (Mia McKenna-Bruce) is having a pretty good time at the party. Gerry Wade (Corey Mylchreest), the best friend of her late brother, killed in the war (“Life is far too short. We’ve all learned that the hard way”), asks her to dinner and makes it clear he plans to propose. Unfortunately, he is found dead in his bed the next morning, apparently after a sleeping draught overdose. But he was a notoriously sound sleeper, who never had need of a sleeping draught! That fact was so well known that his two prankster pals had hidden eight alarm clocks (ordials) around the room to wake him up that morning. But why are they now all on the mantelpiece? And why is one of them missing (makingseven)? And why is the missing one later found broken on the lawn?After a butterfingered working-class policeman breaks everything he touches at the potential crime scene, Bundle decides to investigate the matter herself. The Cootes leave in a rush, only stopping to make one of the servants cry and for Sir Oswald to gesture at the Caterham pile and announce “I can access this world whenever I flourish my chequebook. They say you can’t buy class but it’s the cheapest, most readily available purchase in all of England!” I know it’s early days but if I hear a more monkey-typed speech this year I’ll be surprised, and horrified.View image in fullscreen‘Life is too short’ … Mia McKenna-Bruce as ‘Bundle’ Brent and Corey Mylchreest as Gerry Wade.Photograph: NetflixBy this stage of proceedings, I realise this is Agatha Christie by way of Enid Blyton, made for an international market that thinks Downton Abbey is real and that Paddington Bear is holding the queen’s hand in heaven. Otherwise it was commissioned to teach complainers about remakes a lesson. “Alright – you’ll learn the hard way why some of Agatha’s back catalogue remains undeveloped and next time we give you another Poirot, you’ll take your Belgian lumps and like it.”On we go, through the motions, somehow watching a production more dated than a Joan Hickson Marple would be, as Bundle looks at telltale stains on furniture and interviews crying maids, anonymous notes arrive, letters mentioning “seven dials” but not what it means are discovered, trips to London are undertaken, the identity of Iain Glen is revealed and the prankster helping her (the entirely wasted Nabhaan Rizwan) is shot (“You’ve been shot!” cries Bundle as she cradles the dying man who is presumably both aware of this fact and unlikely to want to be reminded). At last Martin Freeman arrives as real detective Supt Battle. As Battle brings order to the investigation, so Freeman brings some credibility to the televisual proceedings, pulling the thing together and up by virtue of his presence and an instinctive feel for how wholeheartedly and firmly these things need to be played. It’s a relief, but whether it’s enough to get you through all three uninspired, pedestrian hours of a supposed espionage thriller is up to you. Retro without flair and full of modern concerns about everyone’s emotional wellbeing is a mix that doesn’t work for me.Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAgatha ChristiereviewsShareReuse this content"

It was only a matter of time before the venerable sci-fi franchise used a school as a setting. ButStarfleet Academy, the latest streaming series, is not some random cosmic polytechnic for aliens to study humanities or vice versa. This is the oft-referenced San Francisco space campus sited right next to the Golden Gate Bridge. WithJames T KirkandJean-Luc Picardon the alumni list, it is basically Hogwarts for wannabe starship captains.Or at least it used to be. As this newest Trek opens we are in the 32nd century: as far into the future as the franchise has ever gone, boldly or otherwise. (The original 1966 five-year mission for Kirk and co took place in the 23rd century.) The universe is still recovering from the Burn, an all-encompassing cataclysm from 2020’sseason three of Star Trek: Discoverythat put the kibosh on faster-than-light warp travel. After an extended period of intergalactic isolationism, Starfleet Academy is about to receive its first new intake for over a century. Mega-fan Stephen Colbert is already on board as the school’s PA announcer. All it needs is a new chancellor.The best candidate is clearly Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter), an ex-Starfleet captain whose half-Lanthanite heritage means she has been around long enough to remember the good old pre-Burn days of 120 years ago. But a fraught opening flashback reveals why the long-lived Ake resigned from her position. Starfleet protocol forced her to separate a young kid called Caleb from his desperate mother (a brief but effective cameo from Tatiana Maslany) because their starving family had fallen in with a bristly gangster called Braka.This alien ne’er-do-well is played byPaul Giamatti, who has apparently stolen every one of Johnny Depp’s finger rings and then some. His performance is a jangling, spittle-flecked lesson in scenery-chewing that feels like a tribute to the heightened acting of the original 1960s Trek. You immediately crave Braka’s return just so you can work out what exactly is happening with his complicated coiffure, which seems to involve a game of noughts-and-crosses played with hair clippers.Flash-forward 15 years and Ake is ready to be the new chair of Starfleet Academy, but only if she can do right by Caleb (Sandro Rosta), now a troubled teen who has grown up in various penal institutions. She brings him aboard the USS Athena, a gigantic campus-cum-starship designed to offer both field trip “teachable moments” and breakout spaces for fresh-faced Starfleet cadets.The feature-length opening episode is a thrilling space voyage where the USS Athena is threatened by a vengeful Braka, forcing Caleb and a grab-bag of self-conscious students – including a young pacifist Klingon (Karim Diané) and an even younger sentient hologram (Kerrice Brooks) – to team up to save the day. It is great fun, not least because Hunter’s free-spirited Ake is unlike any other Trek captain. She casually goes barefoot, favours old-school Two Ronnies specs, and has a habit of folding her legs up into the captain’s chair in a way that feels genuinely transgressive.Episode two of the opening double-bill is more indicative of how the show will unfold, with the USS Athena parked up in San Francisco so the semester can properly start. Despite being set in the 32nd century, Starfleet Academy cannot resist sending up US campus cliches from countless teen movies. There are stinky male dorms, jocks playing hacky-sack in the quad and vaguely futuristic letterman jackets that wouldn’t seem out of place in an episode of Happy Days.But in the year of the franchise’s 60th anniversary, Starfleet Academy can be forgiven for celebrating the past. The return ofRobert Picardofrom 1990s offshoot Star Trek: Voyager as the Doctor – an opera-loving, autonomous hologram turned grumpy teacher – is a haughty delight, and the educational setting, coupled with luxurious episode running times, creates plenty of space for some literal Star Trek history lessons. The result is earnest, formulaic and a little cheesy. In other words: classic Trek.What differentiates Starfleet Academy is that the headstrong Caleb and his cohort are far more impulsive – and indeed hornier – than the usual Trek crew. The Grange-Hill-with-phasers vibe of a gang of kids testing their boundaries is surprisingly moreish. Clearly the big bad Braka will return later in the season to cause more galactic strife. But in the meantime it’s enough to hope our unvarnished young heroes win a laser tag battle against their uppity rivals at the military college.Starfleet Academy airs on Paramount+, with new episodes on ThursdaysExplore more on these topicsStar TrekTV reviewTelevisionHolly HunterPaul GiamattiUS televisionScience fiction TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The results struck some contemporary listeners as austere, but there’s a self-effacing purity and beauty about this complex, intellectually probing music that deserves a wider audience than hitherto. Kudos, then, to conductor Daniel Reuss, whose precise yet vital interpretations teem with colour and light.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Igor Stravinsky: Late Works.Photograph: PentatoneThere are four main works here. In Memoriam Dylan Thomas from 1954 is an extended, impassioned setting for solo tenor of Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Threni, a spiny, multifaceted jewel from 1958, sets words from the Book of Lamentations. The haunting Introitus and bristling Requiem Canticles, from 1965 and 1966 respectively, complete the set, interspersed with briefer pieces including an unpretentious Lord’s Prayer and the severely cerebral two-minute Elegy for JFK.The playing of theNoord Nederlands Orkestis fearlessly crisp and clean, but it’s the characterful vocals ofCappella Amsterdamthat really draw the ear, bringing this spellbinding music to life.

Showered with awards, the book was a runaway hit and sparked a literary trend for shared transformative encounters with animals including cats, dogs, magpies and hares.This month, H Is for Hawk comes to the big screen in a new adaptation starring Claire Foy. But there is still time to get to know the source material, which tells of the sudden death of the author’s father and how Macdonald, an experienced falconer who had previously trained kestrels and peregrines, took delivery of a temperamental young goshawk named Mabel with the aim of taming her and teaching her to hunt. Macdonald, who is non-binary, is the audiobook’s narrator. Their reading is characterised by introspection, curiosity and flashes of humour as they observe this “spooky, pale-eyed psychopath” who, as well as feeding and flying, likes to play ball with scrunched-up bits of paper.H Is for Hawk intersperses the author’s adventures with their companion with biographical excerpts on writer TH White whose book, The Goshawk, chronicled his own attempts to train a bird in the 1930s using ancient and cruel methods. Unsurprisingly, Macdonald does a better job and their account of their relationship with the goshawk, which helps to alleviate a grief that feels close to insanity, is deeply affecting. Though the sections on White are diverting, it’s when conjuring the life and character of this extraordinary bird of prey that Macdonald’s prose truly soars.Available via Penguin Audio, 11hr 5minFurther listeningThe Let Them Theory: A Life-Changing Tool That Millions of People Can’t Stop Talking AboutMel Robbins, Audible Studios, 10hr 38minRobbins, a writer, podcaster and motivational speaker, reads her bestselling self-help book advocating confidence, serenity and letting go of the desire to influence other people and their opinions.A History of England in 25 PoemsCatherine Clarke, Penguin Audio, 12hr 48minAn eclectic series of poems connecting the English to their past, from the jingoist Agincourt Carol (1415) to John of Gaunt’s This England speech in Shakespeare’s Richard II to Adlestrop, Edward Thomas’s wartime paean to the countryside, as viewed from a train.Explore more on these topicsBooksAudiobook of the weekAudiobooksBirdsWildlifereviewsShareReuse this content"

The shock this time was the voice: not a nasal mature Cumbrian but a smoother, deeper, younger north Oxford tone. This was Misha Glenny’s debut, having replaced Melvyn Bragg as host of the university of the airwaves, In Our Time.Next week’s edition is a deep dive into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific, the world’s deepest oceanic depression, formed by the forced layering of tectonic plates. That subject might have been a good place for Glenny to begin, as he’s said that it was a 2008 edition on tectonic geology in the Bragg era that fired his fascination with the format and a desire to fill the seat if it became free.But the BBC might have feared the metaphorical implications – with Glenny navigating the Bragg Trench, Radio 4’s deepest chasm, following the polymath’s retirement last year after his 27-year stint.So there was logic in beginning instead with John Stuart Mill’s 1859 philosophical treatise, On Liberty. As a journalist and broadcaster, Glenny has reported on the rises and falls of authoritarian regimes, especially in eastern Europe. The lines between freedom and tyranny are a topical subject in the Putin and Trump ascendancies, with the US president also now de facto commander-in-chief of Venezuela and eyeing the governance of Greenland, Canada and Cuba.Brawls, blackmail and Judi Dench: 75 staggering moments from 75 years of The ArchersRead moreListeners, though, may have sensed buttock-clenching on the management floors of Broadcasting House when the conversation steered close to actual liberties taken by politicians. Glenny did not want to begin his In Our Time career by bringing the BBC a second$10bn lawsuitfrom the 45th/47th president.The show’s second incumbency began with a chaotic trail on the Today programme at 8.45am, in which Nick Robinson asked Glenny how the first show had gone. That seemed to throw his interviewee, whose mumbled response implied that he couldn’t say yet as it hadn’t gone out. (Radio 4 confirmed that the episode was pre-recorded.)The new host’s first academic triangle was Helen McCabe (University of Nottingham), Mark Philp (Warwick) and Piers Norris Turner (Ohio), the inclusion of an American suggesting a greater desire to reach out to the series’ big international audience.Beyond the identity of the presenter, nothing much had changed – the safest and probably most sensible approach with a broadcasting franchise transition. It was a thoughtful 42 minutes, especially revealing on the increasing belief that Mill’s wife, Harriet Taylor Mill, was a substantial co-author. A possible omission was real-life application and parallels. Although there were occasional references to a notional “despot” or “government” and “bigoted” thought, no names or places were mentioned. It is impossible to know if the focus would have been the same before a litigious occupant of the White House.With younger academics often up against a senior questioner, In Our Time has always resembled a varsity seminar. Bragg’s persona veered between testy professor and enthusiastic student, depending on the proximity of the topic to his own knowledge.On his first outing, Glenny sometimes sounded like a junior don taking over the class of a celebrated Emeritus, but this showed a proper humility about the magnitude of the challenge.Bragg developed various catchphrases – from “could you unpack that for us?” to an occasional, “yes, I’m not actually thick” when the unpacking of ideas became too Ikea. Glenny was scrupulously polite, coming closest to disagreement with a chuckling “that’s a different issue!”.Next week: tectonic plates. And, as whoever is now running the BBC will be well aware, the In Our Time succession comes at a time when the supportive layers beneath the corporation are bucking and perhaps buckling. A new director general and head of news are needed after the resignations ofTim Davie and Deborah Turnessover thePanorama editingthat triggered Trump’s litigation. The keystone TV series, Strictly Come Dancing, has no hosts at the moment and the signature radio franchise has just got a new one.It’s certain that In Our Time will be mentioned during the current negotiations with the government over a new BBC charter. The Glenny incumbency certainly can’t be accused of dumbing down – the biggest risk during BBC funding renewal – but he needs to access greater registers of approval and disapproval before he can claim bragging rights.In Our Time aired on BBC Radio Four and is available on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsRadioreviewsShareReuse this content"

As late as 2022, the Times’scolumnist Matthew Parris published acolumnheadlined “Fat shaming is the only way to beat the obesity crisis” in which he attributed Britain’s “losing battle with fat” to society’s failure to goad and stigmatise the overweight into finally, shamefacedly, eating less. The tendency to equate excess weight with poor character (and thinness with grit and self-control) treats obesity as a moral as well as physical failing – less a disease than a lifestyle choice.One of the great strengths of Reuters journalist Aimee Donnellan’s first book is its insistence on framing the discovery of the new weight-loss drugs within the fraught social and cultural context of beauty norms, body image and health. For those who need them, weekly injections of Ozempic, Wegovy or Mounjaro can be revolutionary. Yet for every person with diabetes or obesity taking the drugs to improve their health, others – neither obese nor diabetic – are obtaining them to get “beach-body” ready, fit into smaller dresses, or attain the slender aesthetic social media demands of them. Small wonder some commentators have likened the injections to “an eating disorder in a pen”.Like all great tales of scientific discovery, the weight loss saga is rich in serendipity, rivalry and obsessionDonnellan opens the book with a case in point, a poignant interview with “Sarah”, a 34-year-old marketing executive from Michigan. She recounts a summer of unprecedented success at work – suddenly being included in important meetings, being assigned new management responsibilities and receiving a raise. Yet nothing had changed about her behaviour at work. It was her appearance – after six months on Ozempic – that had undergone a metamorphosis. In the eyes of her employers, shedding five stone (32kg) of weight had transformed her worth: Sarah mattered more because she weighed less.Like all great tales of scientific discovery, the weight loss saga is rich in serendipity, rivalry and obsession – all of which Donnellan recounts with relish. Wonderfully, it includes a starring role for the only venomous lizard in the US, the Gila monster, though I will refrain from spoilers here. Another key protagonist is Svetlana Mojsov, a young Macedonian immigrant to the US who arrived at New York’s Rockefeller University in 1972 to do post-grad chemistry. (Today, one imagines, ICE would probably deport her.) At this time, the causes of obesity were seen as self-evident – eating too much and exercising too little – and therefore unfit for serious scientific inquiry. Mojsov disagreed. She was fascinated by why some people seemed to feel sated earlier than others, or metabolised food more quickly. Her research – for which she is tipped to win a future Nobel prize – successfully engineered a synthetic version of a natural hormone, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), which helps control blood sugar.Scientists at Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk seized on GLP-1 as a potential new treatment for diabetes. Decades of effort at last culminated in a drug, semaglutide, that people with diabetes could administer once weekly, unlike multiple daily injections of insulin. But the drug trials revealed something unprecedented. Not only did semaglutide control blood sugar beautifully, it caused participants to lose up to 20% of their body weight, seemingly without even trying. Novo Nordisk had stumbled across the holy grail – a safe chemical treatment for obesity that worked to astonishing effect. As word of the miracle jab leaked, celebrities began to seek it out. When a newly svelte Oprah Winfrey told her podcast fans that taking the drug was the cause, suddenly everyone was clamouring for Ozempic. That this had occurred in her lifetime, said Winfrey, “felt like relief, like redemption, like a gift”. It was certainly a gift to Novo Nordisk, whose market value is now, thanks to Ozempic, bigger than the entire GDP of Norway.Commendably, Donnellan is careful not to treat the GLP-1 drugs an unalloyed good. She addresses their side-effects, such as severe nausea, and their use by non-obese people to the potential detriment of their health. The one omission is that she doesn’t dig into what is surely the most intriguing aspect of weight-loss drugs: incredibly, scientists simply don’t know why they excel at treating obesity, beyond the fact that GLP-1 receptors are present in the brain. It appears that saturating the brain with abnormally high levels of the hormone dials down people’s craving for food. A lifetime of incessant chatter about eating is dampened. Restraint becomes easy, effortless. Does this mean drugs like Ozempic will be licensed in the future to treat drug, alcohol, gambling and sex addiction? What would that do to our concept of free will? Ozempic is a miracle drug, a rebuke to a century of condemnation of those who are obese, and a profound challenge to the very definition of what it means to be human.

The Commodore 64 Ultimate, a new version of the legendary 8-bit computer, comes in a box designed to resemble the original packaging – a photo of the machine itself on a background of deep blue fading into a series of white stripes. Then when you open it, you find an uncannily accurate replica of what fans lovingly referred to as the breadbox – the chunky, sloped Commodore 64, in hues of brown and beige, the red LED in one corner above the row of fawn-coloured function keys. It’s like 1982 all over again.My dad bought us a C64 in late 1983. It was our second computer after the ZX81 and it felt like an enormous leap into the future with its detailed colour graphics, advanced sound chip and proper grown-up keyboard. We unpacked it on our dinner table, plugging it into a small portable TV and loading the one game we had, a very basic Donkey Kong clone named Crazy Kong. My life would never be the same again. This contraption was my obsession for the next four years – my friendships and free-time would revolve around games such as Bruce Lee, Paradroid and Hyper Sports. To this day, I treasure the memories of playing golf sim Leaderboard with my dad. The sound effects, speech samples and graphics conjured by that computer have lived rent free in my head for, god, almost 40 years.View image in fullscreenAn array of classic and modern inputs … Commodore 64 UltimatePhotograph: CommodoreCommodore was a huge success for a decade. It followed the 64 (which sold somewhere between 12-30m units) with the Amiga, another great gaming machine. But with the rise of the PC came a long painful decline – the company eventually filing for bankruptcy in 1994, the brand kept semi-alive for years afterwards by a series of intellectual property buyouts. In August 2025, however, retro YouTuber Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson, backed by a board of Commodore veterans, bought the brand and promised to reinvigorate it.The result is the Ultimate, a faithful reproduction, not just in looks (although you can opt for a Starlight edition with lots of LED lights and a transparent case), but in tech specs. Instead of running a software emulation of the C64, it’s built around an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) – an integrated circuit programmed to simulate the actual hardware. You can plug in an original C64 Datasette or disk drive and it will run original software (a wonderful touch is that if you’re running a disk file, the computer simulates the noise of a disk drive complete with whirs, tics and bleeps). It even has a cartridge port that will run old game carts such as International Soccer. To complete the scene, you can plug your old Quick Shot II into one of the two joystick ports. Then simply load up a copy of Daley Thompson’s Decathlon and immediately break it.View image in fullscreenBreaking joysticks as well as Olympic records … Daley Thompson’s Decathlon gamePhotograph: Ocean/MobyGamesBut it’s not just a machine for playing old games. Turn it on using the authentic power switch on the side and it boots into the original Commodore 64 start screen, complete with the words, “Commodore 64 Basic V2, 64K Ram system, 38911 Basic Bytes free. Ready.” And the flashing cursor. You can programme it just as you could back then, using Basic or, if you’re feeling advanced, assembly language. Obviously I tried everyone’s first program in the 1980s:10 print “keith is cool”;20 goto 10It worked. After that, I dug out an old program listing from Computer & VideoGamesmagazine and have been typing it in – although it’s a challenge as the print is small, faint and smudged after 30 years in my attic. On top of this, you can click the power button upwards and it switches to an alternate menu crammed with new options. You can plug in a USB thumb drive and load C64 games and apps that you’ve acquired online. The computer also comes with a sample USB drive (shaped like a cassette tape) that is filled with demos and games to try. Even better, it’s easy to connect it the internet via a wired or wireless connection, which gives you access to a community archive of games, as well as old school bulletin board systems, basically the 1980s equivalents of Reddit forums.What I love about the machine is this seamless integration of modern tech into a retro environment. You can plug it into a modern monitor via HDMI, but the menus and inputs are all redolent of the 1980s era – lists of text, Ascii art, cursor keys or W, A, S, D for navigation. The memories of interacting with this ancient hardware came flooding back. Everything you did on the C64 required some effort and expertise, whether that was loading a game or writing little programs – there was no drag-and-drop, no plug-and-play; you were a computer user not a platform consumer. In its press release announcing the product, Commodore referred to itself as “the Digital Detox Brand – a bold stand against today’s toxic tech”. And while that’s a little polemical and self-aggrandising, there’s some truth in it. Exploring the C64 these last few weeks has given me more pleasure than downloading an app on to my phone ever has.Set to be priced at £260.50 ($349.99/AU$524), it’s not cheap and begs the question – is there value to this machine beyond its appeal to original owners? I think there is. In a more accessible way thanthe incredible PDP-10 replicaI wrote about last year, it’s a living historical relic, a way to reconnect with the original concept of a desktop home computer – as something we learned and coded for. The excellent user’s guide it ships with is filled with useful information on how to get it to make music and display graphics; I sincerely hope that an alternative indie gaming scene thrives here as a result. There is intrinsic value in understanding computers at a fundamental level beyond slick user interfaces; there is value in developing a knowledge of how programs work, however simple.And even the machine’s nostalgic impact has worth. It has been fun to show my sons this fossilised contraption – no curated walls of games to buy, no ads, no pop-ups, no social media notifications. Meanwhile, playing those old games again has proven the value of great design and clever programming over hype and visual impact. It’s a lesson we could all afford to learn.Commodore 64 Ultimate is available from March, £260.50/$349.99/AU$524Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

She is helping Salmon prepare to challenge Lincoln in the 1864 elections­ – managing alliances and optics, and planning a party to announce his campaign, plus a lucrative marriage to finance it, despite her deep connection with Lincoln’s secretary, John Hay.But while this production from Brooklyn-based companythe american vicariousraises interesting questions about female power, ambition and the psychological fallout of an emotionally distant father, it struggles to answer them fully or with enough heft.Thomas Klingenstein’s script too often strays into the expositional weeds of the civil war. (Amajor Republican donor, Klingenstein believes the US is in a “cold civil war” with the “woke regime”, though he keeps things historical here.) In a production directed by Christopher McElroen, there is little badinage to lift the dense dialogue, a missed trick given Kate’s intellect, and her political manoeuvrings are confined to the house. As she mines Hay for information, primes military commander George B McClellan (Haydn Hoskins) and prods Salmon’s love interest Carlotta (Christy Meyer), you long to witness her prowess in the wild – or at least at her own party.

Occasionally, an actor turns unnecessarily upstage and the frame shows a live feed of them – a technical flourish that simply robs us of watching characters face-to-face. The enormous table further hamstrings connection, as the cast skirt around it, although this works for Kate and Hay’s flirtatious sparring.Their relationship is the play’s most successful element, and the pair are the strongest of the cast of five. Tom Victor’s sensitive Hay stokes sparks of vulnerability in Wallis Currie-Wood’s steely Kate, which later ignite a bonfire of repressed pain. Darrell Brockis is suitably impassive as Salmon, though his accent is distractingly patchy.In the end, the play’s biggest challenge becomes managing both Kate’s fictional motivations and real-world actions.

As a new stage work revisits his life, its director asks if art can be separated from artistBill BarclayThu 15 Jan 2026 11.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 13.51 ESTShareCarlo Gesualdo wrote some of the most darkly sublime music of the late Renaissance. He also savagely murdered his wife and her lover in their bed. Now be honest: which would you like to discuss first?The art will always be secondary to the atrocity, however magnificent the madrigals and sacred music. Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa, had been cuckolded by the Duke of Andria in a long-running tryst that had become the scuttlebutt at court. The premeditated double murder of 1590 was a truly grisly affair, concluding in the public display of their mutilated bodies on the steps of the palazzo for several days.Gesualdo’s biography is often reduced to this act, yet his own end, too, was harrowing. Twenty years on, the prince had retreated to his estate to indulge in a life of ritualistic agony, reportedly employing servants to beat him thrice daily to ease sleep and constipation. This domestic nightmare included the presence of two concubines accused by his second wife of witchcraft against him. Their ghoulish testimonies, elicited under torture, suggest a household that had descended into a gothic psychosis.View image in fullscreenCarlo Gesualdo da Venosa (1566 - 1613), painted by Francesco Mancini.Photograph: DEA/A. DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty ImagesThe composer’s sheer repugnance is so colourful that I was surprised to be approached by St Martin-in-the-Fields, who asked if I might create a piece of music theatre about his life. This year marks the central London church’s 300th anniversary, and next week my new work, Death of Gesualdo, opens as a tribute to the venue’s bold artistic independence. It features the phenomenal ensemble the Gesualdo Six, who long ago adopted the troubled prince as their namesake (the first piece the group sang was the composer’sTenebrae Responsoria). And so we have all now become enmeshed in the handling of his dark materials, and must confront the sticky relationship between the creator and the crime.Gesualdo wrote madrigals, but not the sunny pastoral ones that defined his English contemporary Thomas Morley (Now Is the Month of Maying, It Was a Lover and His Lass). Were those kind of compositions his, we might successfully disentangle the art from the artist. Yet Gesualdo was a musician whose sombre works (Ahi, disperata vita – ah desperate life; Moro, lasso, al mio duolo – I die, alas, in my suffering) could easily score a film of his own sordid life. The music and the man easily form a singular, haunting synthesis – the aural diary of a degenerate.View image in fullscreenTaraash Mehrotra, Markus Weinfurter, David Tarkenter, Imogen Frances and Sian Williams rehearsing Death of Gesualdo at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAt this juncture I was forced into a moment of moral pause. Is it appropriate to half-valorise a murderer whose music and stature would be obliterated online today?For me, the art is almost always separate from the artist, odious or not. We can’t locate antisemitism in Wagner’s actual scores. To eliminate Guernica from the canon because of Picasso’s abuse of women is a punishment unbefitting of the crime. To take a less extreme example, if I’m upset by JK Rowling’s stance on trans issues, banning her books from my daughter’s bedroom only closes a door for both of us. We know way too much about artists today – we are swimming in their private biographical details – and are thereby unwittingly complicit in this contamination of their art. To make matters worse, the facts and the fictions are increasingly blurred – an artist who is young and famous today will be forced to consider that someone may have already created deepfake pornographic material of them.Allow me to present myself as an example. In my production, I attempt to tackle these issues by mapping Gesualdo’s tortured harmonies on to the painful episodes of his life, connecting his musical hallucinations with his descent into psychosis. Patterns are fun to find and dots thrilling to join. Of course, I vainly hope this reveals something new and valuable about him.But high art at best is a Rorschach test – an ink blot. It isn’t meant to reveal the artist, it is meant to reveal us. A staging of Hamlet tells us little about Shakespeare, frankly. It hardly tells us much about Hamlet. If it’s an excellent production, it might remind me that it’s been 17 years since I’ve lost my dad, and I really, really miss him.This is what makes Gesualdo such a valuable case study in 2026: here was that rare artist before celebrity culture taught us how to obsess. Centuries before the internet, this great-nephew of Pope Pius IV was born into a life of transparency. His second wife was Eleonora d’Este of the prestigious northern Court of Ferrara, a “Music City”, and a cultural nexus of 16th-century Europe. All murders aside, his nobility, wealth and role as a leading composer made him the subject of constant gossip – about his sexuality, intelligence and more – for his entire life.The homicides were a festering scandal, yet perhaps more shocking is they were perfectly legal; for an Italian prince of his day, an “honour” killing was an expected rite of restoration. This is why he evaded punishment and formed a second strategic alliance with the Court of Ferrara. But there the whispers intensified, and perhaps as a result, he devoted himself to the solitude of composition. His later years were marked by another retreat – this time by a fixation that he was being hunted by the families of his victims.In my work, Death of Gesualdo,the composer’s fragile psyche forms a toxic alchemy with the public glare that fuels his psychosis even as it yields astonishing music. His final years culminated in the Tenebrae Responsoria of 1611 – an apparent self-requiem that conflates Christ’s suffering entirely with his own. One hears guilt, atonement and isolation in the sublime dissonances of this haunting masterpiece. He died two years later, a man broken by the very status that had protected him.View image in fullscreen‘Erasing art is the wrong lesson from the 2020s’ … artistic director Bill Barclay rehearses with  Imogen Frances.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut are any of these connections true?Truth be told, Gesualdo’s chosen forms – the madrigal – were quite typical for his day. He was not among the avant garde in Florence, nor was he inventing opera with Monteverdi in Mantua, he was writing mannerist madrigals, a late form on its way out. Mannerism relied on artificiality, complexity, chromaticism and dissonance. No one understood that assignment better than our dark prince. A musicologist must be honest that “psychopathic composer” is an irresponsible elision. But we have allowed his bloodlust to define his music, haven’t we, and that is the problem and the opportunity.In travelling my own road through this commission, I have concluded that punishing odiousness in artists by erasing their art is the wrong lesson from the 2020s. Artists must realise there is a sharp danger of their work becoming contaminated with their reputation. Audiences must realise that double-clicking on another’s suffering is a step too far. As for Death of Gesualdo, it may reveal nothing about him. It could reveal something about me. If it’s any good, neither should matter, because it will reveal something truly important about you.Bill Barclay is the writer and director ofDeath of Gesualdo at St Martin-in-the-Fields16-17 January;York National Centre for Early Music18-19 January; andSt John the Divine, New York, 13 February.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sting’s legal team have countered that previous agreements between him and his bandmates regarding their royalties from the song do not include streaming revenue – and argued in pre-trial documents that the pair may have been “substantially overpaid”. In the hearing’s opening day, it was revealed that since the lawsuit was filed, Sting has paid them $870,000 (£647,000) to redress what his lawyer called “certain admitted historic underpayments”. But there are still plenty of future potential earnings up for debate.The dispute is not over some dusty forgotten hit, with the band members looking merely to redistribute old earnings – any interpretation of the agreements between the bandmates will have huge and ongoing financial impact. As the hearings open, Every Breath You Take sits in the Top 10 of the most-streamed songs daily worldwide on Spotify, racking up about 3.5m plays on that platform alone each day: more than some of the most popular songs of recent times such as Billie Eilish’s Birds of a Feather and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars’s Die With a Smile. On Spotify, streams jumped by 89% in 2024 and have just kept going up, growing another 36% last year, with particular popularity in the Americas: the US, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and the UK are the song’s biggest markets.That makes Every Breath You Take a hugely industrious engine for publishing (ie songwriting) royalties, currently being funnelled mostly to Sting (he is the sole credited songwriter, though Copeland and Summers receive 15% of the publishing via an agreement dating back to 1977). Every Breath You Take has benefited from being included on the Stranger Things soundtrack, appearing in seasons two and four, and, like so many other songs as fans rewatch the whole sci-fi/fantasy saga, earned a boost on streaming – but it has also been huge on TikTok outside the show.It went to No 1 in the charts in the UK and US when it was originally released in 1983. And the 1997 song I’ll Be Missing You, Puff Daddy and Faith Evans’ posthumous tribute to the Notorious BIG which heavily interpolated the song, was a global chart-topper. But Every Breath You Take’s eternal success belies the various forms of conflict at its heart.View image in fullscreen‘Sting and Stewart hated each other’ … publicity shot of the Police for Synchronicity in 1983.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamySting has said he set out to write a “romantic, kind of seductive” song and acknowledged it is “not in the least bit original; it has a standard chord sequence which is probably nicked off Stand By Me” by Ben E King. (He has also ascribed inspiration from Paul Simon’s Slip Slidin’ Away – all interesting detail around a court hearing centred on songwriting.) It’s so classic that researchers at Aarhus University in Denmark found it to be the most universally appealing song in terms of fitting into the rhythms of daily life: “a very pleasant, perhaps even a bit bland song”, as the study’s lead researcher had it in 2021.But Every Breath You Take derives its power from the infernal trick it plays on the listener. Sting kept it as a tender ballad with a soothingly simple and classic structure, filled with promises of eternal love and support. It’s just about possible to take those words at face value, and Faith Evans didn’t need to change much to make it into a pure song of devotion to her dead husband. It gets played, seemingly without irony, at weddings. But Sting added what he called “a compulsion behind it, to the point of obsession, where it becomes kind of sinister” – making this earnest declaration of love the words of a stalker who can’t let go.There’s something close to demonic in its calm, determined manipulation, and Sting – who called it “a nasty little song, really rather evil” – even felt compelled to undo the hex with the 1985 single that kicked off his solo career in earnest, If You Love Someone Set Them Free. “I had to write the antidote,” he said, “after I’d poisoned people with this horrible thing.”Every Breath You Take was also nightmarish to make, as was the whole of the massively popular album, Synchronicity, on which it appeared. “By the time of Synchronicity, they were sick of each other,” the album’s producer Hugh Padgham has said. “Sting and Stewart hated each other, and although Andy didn’t show as much venom, he could be quite grumpy – and there were both verbal and physical fights in the studio.” It was Every Breath You Take that almost brought them to breaking point, with Copeland feeling restricted by the song’s very tight, straight drum pattern. Padgham remembered: “Stewart would say, ‘I want to fucking put my drum part on it!’ and Sting would say, ‘I don’t want you to put your fucking drum part on it! I want you to put what I want you to put on it!’ and it would go on like that. It was really difficult … I also remember quite clearly working full-on for 10 days … and having nothing on tape that was playable.”View image in fullscreen‘We tore each other’s throats out in the studio’ … (from left): Andy Summers, Sting and Stewart Copeland in a recording studio in 1981.Photograph: Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesIf Copeland felt constrained by Sting’s vision for the song, Summers has claimed he had a more profound influence on it: “It was crap until I played on it,” he said in 2016. Responding to a demo version played by Sting over organ chords, Summers came up with the arpeggiated guitar riff, he said later, as a way of “keeping those other bastards happy. That song was going to be thrown out. Sting and Stewart could not agree on how the bass and drums were going to go. We were in the middle of Synchronicity and Sting says, ‘Well, go on then, go in there and make it your own. And I did it in one take. They all stood up and clapped.”Physical fights continued on the Synchronicity tour, with Copeland breaking one of Sting’s ribs. Copeland later waved this off as “play-fighting”, but the rifts proved too deep. Sting wanted to explore music-making with others and the Police split up at the height of their success, earning their legend as one of the most fractious rock bands in history.Responding to a Guardian reader’s question in 2024,Copeland said that reputation wasn’t totally fair. “We tore each other’s throats out in the studio but those two motherfuckers came up with incredible stuff and we got on really well on stage, in the van, on the plane. To this day we still send each other dumb Instagram clips. It’s a myth that Sting and I fought all the time.”Another of the band’s running jokes centres on Every Breath You Take. As Copeland said in 2018: “One of our favourite in-band riffs is that, when Puff Daddy sampled Every Breath You Take on I’ll Be Missing You, he sampled Andy’s guitar figure, not the melody or the lyrics. Me and Andy go, ‘Go on Sting, pay Andy his royalties,’ and Sting will say, ‘OK Andy, here you are …’ Not reaching anywhere near his wallet.”But that jokey argument has now become very real, and with Every Breath You Take as popular as it ever was, relations in the Police may well be as bad as they were when they recorded it.Explore more on these topicsMusicStingPop and rockMusic streaminganalysisShareReuse this content"

So why keep dragging dead artists into today’s culture wars?Critics and curators are reframing great artists, from Gentileschi to Soutine, to fit with modern ethical narratives. But this ignores the glorious ambivalence of their creationsRosanna McLaughlinThu 15 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTShareOne rainy afternoon last winter, sitting under a blanket with a cup of tea, I found myself Googling paintings by Chaïm Soutine. It’s a pastime I’ve indulged ever since visiting an exhibition of his portraits of hotel staff on the French Riviera during the 1920s – paintings that combine such a mixture of tenderness and debasement that it’s as if his brush is kissing and beating his subjects at the same time.I flicked through images of hopelessly innocent cooks and bellboys, with complexions the colour of raw sausage and ears that look as if they have been brutally yanked. And as I did, I came across a review of the very show where I had first encountered Soutine’s works. Ah, I thought, looking forward to luxuriating in literature about his particular genius for kindly sadism.Yet my plans to float away on Soutine’s twisted dreams came to an abrupt halt. For as I read, I realised that the tangled emotions and gnarly moral complexities that make his paintings so intoxicating had been erased from the picture. In their place was a sanitised vision of an artist with a “profoundly compassionate and humane eye” that “sympathetically drifted to the underclass”, who made paintings that celebrated “the richness of these otherwise forgotten lives”.View image in fullscreenChaïm Soutine’s Still Life With Rayfish, 1923.Illustration: SJArt/AlamyWhy on earth, I wondered, would anyone want to reframe Soutine as a saintly advocate for social justice? (While little is known of his life, existing material paints a picture of a complex and difficult man with a profound disdain for the shtetl in modern-day Belarus where he grew up.) After all, this was the very same artist whose skill as a painter-cum-butcher inspired Francis Bacon’s magnificently nightmarish visions.Like so many great artists throughout history – from Hieronymus Bosch’s holy perversions to Paula Rego’s knotty psychological dramas – it is precisely by channelling ambivalent emotions that Soutine is able to speak to the dark and complicated nature of being human. What makes his paintings of hotel staff so powerful, so moving, is that they mix brutality with affection – and in doing so, invite us to contemplate our own discordant drives and emotions. Few of us are outright psychopaths, after all, but all of us must reckon with the fine line between desire and exploitation.I soon realised that the review itself was entirely unremarkable, insofar that it was typical of a way of discussing art that has become culturally ubiquitous. For the past decade, we have been living through an era in which art is required to conform to a moral code. Dead or alive, artists are increasingly expected to model righteousness and empathy, and their work asked to promote values that are feminist, anti-racist, anti-homophobic and committed to accessibility and inclusion.View image in fullscreenPaula Rego’s Cast of Characters from Snow White, 1996.Illustration: Andrew Lalchan/AlamyThis “moral turn” is behind the tendency for exhibitions, reviews and books to edit artists’ biographies, retroactively framing them as social justice advocates and exemplars of community spirit. It can also be seen in the panic that ensues when institutions fear an exhibition may fail to explicitly promote these values, in some cases leading to their postponement or the removal of works.Take, for example, Tate Modern’sAndy Warhol showin 2020, where the great vampire of the New York scene – a man who fetishised electric chairs, filmed fame-seekers high on drugs, and made art from an image of a young woman falling to her death – was described in an exhibition wall text as an artist who “provided a safe-space for queer culture”.Then there is the baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, whose work has come into vogue in recent years. Her most famous work, Judith Slaying Holofernes (c 1620), which depicts the biblical heroine cutting off the head of an Assyrian general, is now widely interpreted as an autobiographical response to her own rape by the painter Agostino Tassi. When an exhibition of Gentileschi’s work was shown at theNational Galleryin 2020, documents from Tassi’s trial for rape were placed in the opening rooms, positioning her assault as a key to understanding her work.Learning to engage with complexity is surely a necessary skill if we are ever to drag ourselves out of the puerile swamp of the culture warsWho does this kind of historical revisionism serve? Not Warhol, whose art remains so charismatic precisely because of its amorality. Not “queer culture”, whose leading lights are reduced to moralistic teaching aids. Not female artists, whose works are seen as indivisible from their private lives. (The primary evidence for Gentileschi’s painting being autobiographical is that the artist appears to have based the figure of Judith on herself. Yet she often did this, because of the prohibitive cost of hiring models and the social conventions against women doing so.) And most of all, not audiences.Because yes, the principles that underpin art’s moral turn are absolutely worth insisting upon in our personal and professional lives, and fighting for in political governance. But if we apply these same principles to evaluating all art, we compromise our ability to think critically and to engage with it on its own terms, in all its glorious ambivalence. Most of all, we lose the ability to be genuinely challenged and transformed by it.Ambivalence, after all, has its political uses: being plunged into discomfort can push us to question our assumptions and sharpen our thinking. Take the paintings Philip Guston made during the 1960s of Ku Klux Klansmen: cartoon-like dreamscapes in which hooded figures – painted pig-pink in Guston’s childish style – are depicted smoking cigarettes, making art and driving. While Guston was a politically active figure, his paintings do not preach any obvious lesson or convey a clear moral message. Rather than letting viewers off the hook by instructing them what to think or feel, they immerse you in the deeply uncomfortable reality that racism is unexceptional, as much a part of the everyday as cars, cartoons and fags. “We never know what is in their minds,” said his daughter, Musa Mayer, of the images; “but it is clear that they are us. Our denial, our concealment.”View image in fullscreenArtemisia Gentileschi’s Judith Beheading Holofernes, c 1620.Illustration: Carlo Bollo/AlamyYet such is the intolerance to anything approaching ambivalence that a touring show of Guston’s work across the US and UK was postponed in 2020. After Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd, the organisers decided to delay the exhibition until Guston’s “message of social and racial justice” could be “more clearly interpreted”.When the show eventually opened in Boston in 2022, then travelled toTate Modern in 2023, efforts were made to position Guston’s work in the lineage of social justice movements. This hand-holding of audiences, as Paul Keegan noted in the London Review of Books, is indicative of an era in which “paintings and the public can no longer be left alone in a room together”.Some on the political left may feel queasy about sticking the knife into a cultural model that shares many of their political principles. This is understandable, given that mocking lefty values has proved fruitful in the culture wars, and given the global rise of anti-trans and anti-immigrant views. In such a climate, patronising and reductive interpretations of artworks may seem a worthwhile price to pay for spreading political messages.But what happens when the shoe is on the other foot? Across the world, the resurgent right is making inroads into the arts. Giorgia Meloni has appointed arightwing presidentof the Venice Biennale. The Trump administration has placed allies in senior roles at arts institutions, attempted to block grants to arts organisations deemed to promote “gender ideology”, andtaken aim at museumsexhibiting work focused on the legacy of slavery. If we insist that art functions as a tool for promoting a limited set of political principles, what happens when an ideology that doesn’t share our values sweeps into power?Learning to engage with complexity is a necessary skill if we are ever to drag ourselves out of the puerile swamp of the culture wars. But if we continue to reduce art to moralistic soundbites, we will only succeed in stripping it of its capacity to transform us, which would be a huge loss.Artcan help us to better understand ourselves, and the world we live in, by expressing those things that words cannot. It exposes us to a vast range of experiences, and asks us to sit with the fundamental ambivalences, moral complexities and conflicting emotions that are a part and parcel of being human.If only we are encouraged to look, we can often find these qualities in the art that is right in front of our noses – in the psychological chiaroscuro of Gentileschi, the profound voyeurism of Warhol, the troubling dreamscapes of Guston, the tender brutality of Soutine. Now is the time to argue for an art that can help us to feel more, think more, know more: if we don’t, we risk reducing art to mere exemplars of pre-approved ideas, and forfeiting our cultural intelligence.Rosanna McLaughlin is the author of Against Morality (Floating Opera Press).Explore more on these topicsArtAndy WarholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The festival board that made this dreadful decision have been replaced, and a full apology has been accepted by Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, who has been invited to appear next year.“Given this new and welcome development we feel able, in good conscience, to honour our invitation to perform in Adelaide on 27 February. We hope that our free concert will be an opportunity for different communities to come together in peace and harmony.”On his Instagram feed, the band’s lead singer, Jarvis Cocker, said Pulp had initially pulled out because of the “dreadful situation” with Abdel-Fattah.But he was happy that the band was now “prepared to perform at the music festival once more”.“This will be a free concert, open to anyone who respects the freedom of all voices to be heard.

She is quite shortsighted when it comes to disagreements and can’t see my perspective a lot of the time.Recently, my partner, Bill, and I dropped her off at the airport for a holiday. She’d stayed at ours the night before, as we live near the airport. The next day, Bill said he’d drop her off at the airport, and we used her car for the journey since it could fit all her luggage in. It was a favour to her, and she was very grateful.However, when she got home three weeks later, she called to tell us that she had a parking ticket at home, because we didn’t pay the airport’s drop-off charge when we arrived. I said: “Oh, that’s terrible, but you should have paid the fee.” And Georgia said: “I don’t even know what that is.”I was annoyed at the insinuation that I was to blame, and now Georgia is asking me for money to go towards paying the fine. However, when Georgia was away, Bill and I cleaned her car ourselves, so we’ve already done her plenty of favours.She said it was our job to look after the drop-off fee as we were the ones driving herBill isn’t her biological parent; he and Georgia get on quite well, but she would never ask him for money. I also don’t want to bother Bill with the news that he incurred a fine when driving. But Georgia was quite stroppy with me, and I don’t think it’s strictly our fault, as we were doing her a favour.Georgia is appealing against the fine so we are at a stalemate until the verdict comes out, but I have offered to foot half the bill and she doesn’t think that’s good enough. She said it was our job to look after the drop-off fee as we were the ones driving her. I understand that, but we didn’t really have to drop her in the first place.I believe I am in the right because, as a mother, I’ve done my fair share for Georgia over the years, but she gets very heated over minor details like this. I suppose kids don’t ever see the bigger picture. Georgia is 32 and single, so she doesn’t yet have kids of her own. Maybe when she does, she will understand my perspective a little more.The defence: GeorgiaI didn’t know you had to pay for drop-off. Mum knew and didn’t tell me, so she should help payIf someone offers to do you a favour and they mean it, you should expect them to do it to the best of their ability. But my mum has a habit of doing half-arsed favours, and then getting annoyed when I call her out.She says, “You should be grateful that we dropped you off at the airport.” But she didn’t follow through with everything and forgot to pay the drop-off fee. How is that my fault?As her partner Bill was driving my car instead of theirs, the fine is now in my name. I have done my research, and don’t think I will have to pay the fine as the car park can’t prove who was driving. But the whole thing is still a hassle.It wasn’t nice to come back to two letters about this fine straight after my holiday, and it’s already doubled. When I told my mum, her immediate reaction was to blame me. Instead of admitting that she forgot the drop-off fee, she said, “Oh, but you should have paid that.” I don’t even know what it is, as I’ve never driven to the airport before.If this was a friend or another family member, I would expect them to foot the entire fee and not just blame it on meBill and Mum have driven there many times, and usually take their own car. They always remember the rules then. But the one time they took my car, they forgot. Funny, that. I don’t know if Bill knows he is responsible for the fine – maybe my mum hasn’t told him. She seems to be blaming me to preserve their relationship.I understand that they were both doing me a favour. I was grateful at the time and have thanked them many times. But the fact they helped me out doesn’t make me liable for the fine. If they had driven me there in their car, they would have just paid the fee, so why am I stressing about this? The fine is in my name as it’s my car, but legally I don’t think I am liable. I put that in my appeal.I am waiting for the result of the appeal, but I will accept half of the fine from Mum if we don’t win. I also don’t want to cause problems between her and Bill. But if this had happened with a friend or another family member, I would expect them to foot the entire bill and not just blame it on me.The juryof Guardian readersShouldGeorgia foot at least some of the bill?There’s nothing more annoying than someone offering to do you a favour and then making a pig’s ear of it, creating more hassle than you had to begin with. Margaret and Bill made a mistake, and it’s unfair to pin that on Georgia.Henry, 29Georgia should accept her mum’s offer to split the fine. They did her a favour, and there was a misunderstanding over the drop-off. It was Georgia’s holiday and car. A fine isn’t worth a fight. At 32, she should stop the pettiness, pay half or all of it, and move on.Tania, 37Margaret is doing all the favours here, and any thanks Georgia offers her are grudging. Margaret’s offer to pay half of the fine seems generous in the circumstances. Perhaps Georgia should take a taxi to the airport next time.Ian, 81It’s the driver’s responsibility to keep an eye out for charges, and the mistake was Bill’s. However, Georgia should pay the full fine because Bill and her mum took time out of their day to take her to the airport.Pauliina, 53They’ve all messed up, but the buck stops with Georgia as it’s her car, driven on her behalf. The drop-off fee is common knowledge, and Georgia should have researched it beforehand. She’s lucky Margaret is offering to go halves.Kate, 63Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: should Georgia cough up?The poll closes on Wednesday 21 January at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherMaya should stop wearing shoes in the house.80%of you said yes –Maya is guilty20%of you said no –Maya is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why?From postcode pricing to falling wholesale costs, the price you pay at the pump depends less on petrol itself than on where – and when – you fill upHilary OsborneThu 15 Jan 2026 07.24 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 07.26 ESTShareWhy do petrol prices vary so much between filling stations? On the same road I’ve seen a 5p-a-litre difference on what must be an identical product, while the same chains charge differently from town to town.Weird, isn’t it? Of all the things we buy, the price of petrol is probably the most transparently disclosed before we enter the retailer’s premises, and yet this only serves to leave us wondering why how much we pay can come down to where we live, or even on which side of the road we are driving.Earlier this week, in Horsham, Sussex, you could pay anything between 136.9p and 140.9p a litre, according to figures from the UK motoring group the AA, while about 10 miles away in Crawley, prices were between 128.9p and 131.9p. There are Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Shell garages in both places, and all were charging less in Crawley. Sainsbury’s, for example, was charging 8p less – a difference of £4.40 on a typical 55-litre tank.Luke Bosdet, the AA’s spokesperson on fuel pricing, says there are two primary problems that its members complain about: “The pump-price postcode lottery between neighbouring towns and communities, and the difficulty in locating bargain-priced fuel.”As you note, the product is the same, and retailers all buy the same raw product. According to the motorists’ group the RAC, the wholesale price currently makes up about 23% of the cost of a litre of petrol. It is influenced by two things: “the oil price and the exchange rate”, says Simon Williams, the head of policy at the RAC. Oil, petrol and diesel are traded in US dollars, so in the UK “we need the pound to be as strong as possible against the dollar to pay a good price at the pumps”.View image in fullscreen‘The range of fuel prices shows that competition is working’ … M6, West Midlands.Photograph: Visionary Language/Getty Images/iStockphotoThewholesale price is always changingand the fluctuations are passed on to consumers. This means the price you pay will, in part, depend on when the retailer bought the petrol, as well as the contract it has with its supplier. Counterintuitively,smaller retailers can be morecompetitive than the big chains, since they are more nimble, and able to buy when prices are temporarily lower.The biggest retailers will probably pay less for delivery because they are buying more, says Williams, but this is a small part of the equation. On top of the cost of the product and delivery, there is VAT and fuel duty. In the UK, these currently account for 56% of the price, according to the RAC. Then there are the operators’ costs, plus their profit margin.The UK’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has been keeping an eye on petrol retailers and atthe end of last year it published a report on the industry, which it plans to repeat annually. It found that in the first half of 2025, supermarkets’ fuel margins averaged 8.4% while the other petrol retailers’ margins averaged 9.8%.The supermarkets are important in the petrol market – they own about a fifth of UK forecourts, but sell about 40% of our petrol and diesel. Steve Walker from the website Auto Express says supermarkets see petrol prices as a way to get people into their stores and can use fuel as a loss leader. “The fuel companies don’t have [that] luxury,” he says.So there are lots of factors explaining why prices vary from retailer to retailer, but what’s odd about petrol is that prices are not being set on a national level.Walker says many of the big brands, such as Shell and BP, are run as franchises, “like McDonald’s. But unlike McDonald’s they don’t set the prices. The franchisee will go into a battle with the garage up the road.”View image in fullscreenCompetitive … supermarket fuel margins averaged 8.4% in 2025.Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty ImagesDespite being owned centrally, other retailers are behaving in the same way. Sainsbury’s referred me to the Petrol Retailers Association trade body when I asked it about its pricing, as did the Motor Fuel Group, which runs about 1,200 forecourts under a range of different brands, including Morrisons.However,the Sainsbury’s website does addressthe issue of different prices at different locations. “We want to ensure our petrol stations remain competitive within their local area, offering customers a fair price wherever they live,” it says. “We therefore adjust the price at each station using locally gathered pricing information.”Price variation is not a bad thing, but the motoring groups say customers are losing out. Bosdet says localised price matching “on the face of it sounds fair, until the matched prices become artificially high when compared to nearby areas. Essentially, price matching gives local retailers permission to charge more than they could because there is another more expensive retailer nearby (whose circumstances may mean their fuel is always dearer) setting the level.”Wholesale petrol prices have been falling since late November, but costs on the forecourt have not come down so quickly – motorists frequently allege “rocket and feather” pricing – prices shoot up when the cost of the raw product increases, but drop much more slowly when it is coming down.The decision by some supermarkets to not compete as aggressively on petrol prices has been bad news for consumers. The CMA’s report found that in 2017, supermarket retailers’ margins averaged 4% – less than half the level in 2025, while non-supermarkets made 6.4%.In future, it will monitor prices and be able to recommend action if competition weakens. It has pushed for a government-run price comparison tool so that drivers will be able to see exactly how much the filling stations in their local area are charging – that will go live this year.Dan Turnbull, the senior director of markets at the CMA, says: “Drivers could see lower prices if competition between businesses was stronger. The main issue is that motorists can’t easily compare a wide range of prices in real time.“That’s why the fuel-finder scheme matters – it will make it easier to shop around and encourage petrol stations to compete harder for business. This could help reduce the disparities between neighbouring petrol stations and towns that we currently see.”The Petrol Retailers Association says members are pricing fuel “competitively and fairly”. It adds: “The range of fuel prices shows that competition is working and to help motorists find the best deals in their area, we encourage them to download the free PetrolPrices.com app.”Other price comparison tools exist, and the price you will pay is there to see before you drive on to the forecourt. If the price is higher than down the road, the RAC’s Williams says: “People should be voting with their right foot and driving on.”Explore more on these topicsPetrol pricesThe price of everythingFuel dutyMotoringTaxSupermarketsRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You get one-off pieces while making an environmentally conscious fashion choice. From party dresses to jeans, some pieces are even better – and much more affordable – vintage. A well-made, brand-new leather jacket could set you back anywhere between £150 and £700, but you could pick up a secondhand one for £50 or less.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But it can be daunting when you first start. Knowingwhatyou’re looking for andwhereyou can find it is key. Consider where to shop:Vintedis good for a high-street steal, whileVestiaire Collectivecould get you discount designer (and it’s great for shoes; see below). Don’t overlook your local charity shop, either: some of my most satisfying secondhand buys have come from Oxfam or Crisis.We don’t all have time to trawl through shops and sites, so here are some tips and tricks on the best pieces to buy vintage, how to shop for them, and what to avoid.The best clothes and accessories to buy secondhandLeather jacketsView image in fullscreenVintage Danierjacket£140 at RokitLeather really can last a lifetimewhen cared for correctly, so a leather jacket – whether a bomber or a biker – is the perfect vintage grab. Secondhand leather has a lived-in look that brand new just can’t replicate, even when manufacturers try to reproduce it through purposeful distressing.Shop in person, where possible, to get a sense of the quality, weight and feel of the jacket. Look for no-gos such as cracks, dehydration and musky odours (which often stick around with leather). Cracks can be a sign of dry rot, which can be common if pieces haven’t had the love they deserve. A full-grain or top-grain jacket – distinguished by its natural texture and imperfection – is best.Rokit has an impressive collection ofvintage leather: it lists details on what condition it’s in, what era it’s from, and in-depth measurements to give you a clear idea of how the jacket would fit. Similarly, online vintage marketplaceThriftedhas a smaller, but equally considered selection, including vintage varsity jackets. Or tryWe Are Cow, which specialises in upcycling and reworking and has stores around the country.For more, read our guide onhow to look after leatherParty/occasion dressesView image in fullscreen£50 at EtsyA vintage dress has a distinctive quality that a store-bought modern dress can’t replicate. If you love vintage, as I do, you’ll understand how a 2020s-does-1960s dress can look inauthentic. Many vintage dresses are handmade, so signs of hand stitching are a great way to tell reproduction from authentic vintage.Etsy is a goldminefor anything from 80s minis to classic 50s cocktail silhouettes. Avoid listings that are unspecific about era: often this means it’s vintage-style rather than true vintage. Look out for bold patterns, striking silhouettes and statement sleeves, because if you’re going to go all-out, a party is the ultimate playground.Avoid heavily sequined, feathered, silk or satin dresses secondhand, as any imperfections tend to show more on these fabrics.If you’re not ready to commit, you could rent a dress for a special occasion. AtBy Rotation, you can borrow a dress for anywhere from three days to more than 30 days,depending on availability; all you have to do is return it after. Expect to see brands such as Zimmermann, Rixo and Self-Portrait available from £3a day. Many listings even offer a purchase option, in case you want to buy it after you have tried it.Designer heelsView image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker teal satin T-strap pumps£94 at Vestiaire CollectiveView image in fullscreenManoloBlahnik Hangisi silk heels£288 at Vestiaire Collective£800 for a new pair of Manolo Blahniks? I prefer £80. If you want to inject a bit of Emily in Paris into your wardrobe,look at Vestiaire. The luxury fashion resale site has gained a well-earned reputation for having an enormous collection of secondhand designer heels. With thousands of Manolo Blahnik-heel listings at the time of writing, some for less than £100, it seems rude not to bag a pair of vintage kitten heels on the cheap. Also, buying these secondhand means you get the pick of everything, from the sought-after archive pieces to the practically new.Button-up shirtsView image in fullscreenBeaufort & Blake blue check shirt£44 at CrisisA classic button-up shirt is one of those wardrobe staples everyone needs, and you don’t have to spend big to win big. Almost every charity shop I’ve ever stepped inside,including Crisis, has an overwhelming selection of designer button-ups on display, often overflowing with brands such as Ralph Lauren for not much more than you’d spend on your morning coffee. Make sure it’s not too sheer – an unintentionally see-through shirt signals low quality.For quality and longevity, 100% cotton or linen is your best bet. The natural fibres of linen are wrapped tightly, meaning it’s exceptionally strong and even stronger when wet, so ideal for pieces that are washed frequently. Cotton, especially Egyptian, has a little more stretch than linen, providing extra comfort and strength for longevity.Vintage suedeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fiordaliso/Getty ImagesOne of my favourite things to buy vintage is suede: it’s durable, affordable, high-quality and tops faux suede any day, which is usually composed of polyester and can quickly deteriorate after minimal wear. Look for telltale signs of ageing, discoloration, loss of shape or permanent creases. Check the finish, too: faux suede will have a subtle glossy coating, whereas real suede should be matt and non-reflective.Try jackets, skirts, shirts or boots.A trick for Vinted: make sure you’re searching specifically for real suede, as sometimes this isn’t too clear in the listings. And check the condition tag – if it’s labelled “satisfactory”, I’d avoid.BootsView image in fullscreen£74.20 at DepopBuying secondhand boots is a small but meaningful act that saves money, cuts carbon emissionsand extends the lifespan of well-made shoes.According to Depop, buying boots secondhand can save 3,500 glasses of water and more than 86kgCO2e, on average, equivalent to driving more than 300 miles by car.No one likes wearing in a new pair of heavy-duty leather boots, so why not let someone else do it for you?Try Depop for a huge selectionof styles, sizes and prices, from a pair ofnew Dr Martens for under £50toevery style of knee-high bootyou could imagine.One more thing: check the soles. This is the part of the boots that you really need to be in good condition for them to last. Most Depop sellers tend to include comprehensive images and details with their listings, but if not, don’t be shy to ask. Well-made boots have a long lifespan if you know how to care for them, so if you do shop them secondhand, don’t scrimp on care.JeansView image in fullscreenLevi’s 511 jeans£35 at Beyond RetroSecondhand jeans stand out for their durability, comfort and the simple fact that they don’t demand thousands of litres of water to be produced. Always try vintage jeans before you buy. That’s why finding a true treasure trove is important.Beyond Retro’s storesin London, Brighton and Bristol are just that, with a denim-heavy focus and a thoughtfully curated collection of every style, size and wash you could want.One tip: vintage jeans often run smaller, and I find you have to size up at least one or two times, so it’s much harder to know what size you’ll need (not that regular jean shopping is easy).Designer bagsView image in fullscreenCoach Swagger bag£190 at the Handbag ClinicA true “it bag” can last a lifetime, and more. With newer bags flying into popularity and falling just as fast, staple vintage styles – the Chloé Paddington, the Balenciaga Le City or the Fendi Baguette – can be passed down the generations.Buying designer secondhand handbags can still be expensive, but there are places where you can find a steal.The Handbag Clinicis a trusty destination if you’re looking for an investment piece. I found everything fromJimmy ChootoCoachandMulberryfor less than £200. Itsin-house authentication systemshould leave you in safe hands, and if your bag gets a bit grubby from wear, itsrestoration servicecan look at anything from discoloration and scuffs to dirt and general wear and tear.What to avoidSome pieces are just better new. Avoid buying trainers secondhand, especially running trainers, as an intact sole is important for supporting your feet as well as protecting your joints. Secondhand underwear and swimwear are a no-go for me for hygiene reasons. White is often a tricky colour secondhand too, so check for visible stains. And longer-lasting natural fabrics, such as leather, suede, cotton and wool, are usually better than synthetics generally, secondhand or otherwise.What’s your favourite secondhand fashion hunting ground?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Are you a lover of oaky rioja, or maybe zingy Kiwi sauvignon blanc, and looking to find a non-alcoholic lookalike? To put it bluntly, I’m afraid you’re out of luck.Alcoholdoes much more than make you tipsy; it is the magic ingredient that gives so much of wine’s wondrous complexity, character and charm. Not only does it carry volatile compounds that make up wine’s endlessly fascinating combinations of scents and tastes, along with a sensation of warmth, it also creates that viscous body and texture – what’s rather grossly known in the trade as “mouthfeel” – of the liquid in your mouth, and the overall balance of all these factors in the wine.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When the base wine is dealcoholised, however, all that character goes with it. Compared with beer’s relatively low-alcohol content, wine’s usual 11%-15% ABV means that, when the alcohol has gone, you feel its absence more, which is partly whynolo beers are generally more successful than nolo wine. That said, there are some wine substitutes that are worth trying, but, to avoid disappointment, my advice is to see them as drinks thataren’twine because, well, they’re simply not.Some compounds can be reintroduced after dealcoholisation, or added, usually with unfermented grape juice, to replicate wine-like aromas and flavours. Hi-tech processes are improving all the time, but it’s still nigh-on impossible to mimic effectively the weight and balance of wine. Sugar is often used to give some body and/or to counteract excessive tartness, but that means many such drinks are unattractively sweet and cloying.Fizz fares the best. Bubbles give a layer of refreshing spritz, as well as that pleasingly celebratory pop of the cork, while chilling helps to crisp up the flavours and tone down sweetness. Feel free to add cocktail-ish flourishes to up the interest factor: a dash of crème de cassis, say, or elderflower cordial. A black velvet made 50:50 with 0.0% Guinness also works well.Sparkling fermented teas can be a good wine alternative, the tea providing a little welcome tannic structure (try the Real naturally alcohol-free range, which is widely available and£10 at Waitrose), while kombucha’s natural acidity lends an appetising, tangy kick to the palate and comes with probiotic and antioxidant benefits to boot.I’d also serve nolo reds a bit cool. They’re the trickiest to copy, so need all the help they can get to stop them being jammy, and they’re certainly no match for a real red wine, but the best can just about cut the mustard with a steak or tomato-based pasta, and they also respond well to mulling, if that’s your thing. White wine fans would do best with drinks made from aromatic grapes such as muscat, whose floral sweetness can make a pleasing match with gently spiced food, as well as a humble sweet chilli crisp.Four nolo wine alternatives to tickle your tastebudsLyre’s Classico Rosé£14.99 (75cl) Lyre’s, 0%.

While it’s not something I do explicitly, I do like to cut back a bit at the beginning of the year. The marathon that is Christmas socialising can be fun but relentless, and I imagine there are many others in the same boat. When it comes to wine, at least, the problem with cutting back is what to do with the rest of the bottle. Sure, I’ll have a glass or two if I fancy it one evening, but it’s pretty much a wasted bottle if you don’t finish the rest within a few days. Fear not – I have a plethora of recipes that will ensure you never need to waste a drop – enjoy a glass or two, then use the rest in the dish of your choice. Winner, winner,chicken Marbella dinner(one of my all-time effortless favourites – scroll the link for the recipe).There are lots of excellent suggestions in thiswonderful featureon how to incorporate wine into everything from pasta to pudding. In particular, the braised short ribs from James Ramsden immediately caught my attention, as this is precisely the kind of food I want to be making and eating right now. Preferably with a pan of oozy,buttery polentaon the side. Another dish that is ticking all the cold, winter boxes is Tom Hunt’smeat stew, an all-round great braising method. If you are more of a white wine drinker, then Italian classicchicken cacciatoreis equally comforting and would also be perfect with creamy polenta ormash. And let’s not forget about rosé – whoever says you can only drink it in the summer has clearly not readFiona Beckett’s strong casefor this delicate pink drink being enjoyed year-round. While the recipe for theseprawns with garlic and chillicalls for white wine, I am confident you could happily switch for rosé.View image in fullscreenBoozy goodness … Nigel Slater’s spiced pears with red wine and dark chocolate.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverIf meat is not your bag, then there are also plenty of vegetarian ways to cook with wine. When I was growing up, my mum always used red wine in her pasta sauces, often with slow-cooked, sweet onions and aubergine. Rachel Roddy’s recipe forspaghetti with red wine and onionsisn’t a million miles away from that nostalgic sauce, and the same goes for Joe Trivelli’spici in red wine(with the added bonus of hardy, bitter radicchio). Meera Sodha also likes to pair full-bodied wine with radicchio, in the form of a heartyrisotto, which is surely the ultimate bowl of winter food. I will take portions of them all, thank you.And, just because it is January, let’s not forget pudding. In fact, I make more of a beeline for it during the colder months because my days deserve all the added joy they can find right now. While thesecherries in red wineare a simple summer treat, I also love them in the depths of winter, made with what I consider a freezer essential – frozen pitted cherries. Make a batch, leave them in the fridge and enjoy whenever you need a sweet fix (I top them with whipped cream and crumbled amaretti). And while Nigel Slater’s recipe forspiced pears in red wine and chocolatecalls for a whole bottle of red, rather than a leftover amount, I think it is worthy and brings all the good things to the winter table – a spectacular pudding, whether you are being abstemious or not.My week in drinksView image in fullscreenOld-school … Mr Fitzpatrick’s Temperance Bar.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianPosh pop|Mr Fitzpatrick’s Temperance Barin Rawtenstall, Lancashire, is one of my favourite pit stops when I am in the north-west.

My friend Mark’s dad’s boat, along with all the others, would be stacked high with sacks ofqueeniesthat they’d dredged up only hours before, and Mark’s mum would pack us off to school with a tub each of queen scallop meat doused inSarson’s vinegarand white pepper, to eat later as a playground snack. At the time, I thought nothing of it, but, looking back now, I realise quite what a luxurious schoolday treat this was.These days, however, our local scallop fishermen don’t fish for queenies much any more, because the time it takes to shuck and clean them is more or less the same as that for larger king scallops, so they’re no longer financially viable; also, instead of all those trawlers that Lyme Bay had in the past, it’s now mostly divers who fish more sustainably for kingscallops, without demolishing the sea bed in the process. There are two main dive boats that fish out of Lyme Regis nowadays, operated by Jon Shuker and Ali Day, and they’ve pretty much cornered the local market. They recently started experimenting with so-called “disco scallops”, which are caught in pots fitted with flashing lights that lure them in, which is much more efficient, crew-wise, than diving, because a boat with one diver is legally required to have a crew of four, comprising the working diver, a standby diver, a supervisor and a driver. Crazy, eh?That’s why scallops come with a pretty hefty price tag. And while those pot-caught disco scallops are more economical for staffing costs, they’re less so catch-wise, because the yield is nowhere near as good. Let’s wait and see how the experiment goes, but in principle I wholeheartedly support this kind of new commercial fishing idea; the disco scallop fishing method alsowon the innovation award atthe BBC Food & Farming awards a few months ago, as a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to harvest scallops.Party starters: Jacob Kenedy’s Italian Christmas canapes – recipesRead moreYou may well have watched the David Attenborough documentaryOcean, which featured some shocking footage of the damage that dredging does to the seabed. My 13-year-old daughter, Isla, and I both ended up in tears, and it left so powerful an impression on me that I think the series should be compulsory viewing in schools. If this kind of thing were on the curriculum, our kids wouldn’t grow up thinking that food comes only from the supermarket.Scallops were never off the menu at my formerLyme Regis restaurantHix Oyster & Fish House – or at least not unless the weather was so bad that the divers were unable to get out to sea – and I’ve served them in just about every which way possible – with black pudding or chorizo; cooked, chopped and added to a big mix of roast local shellfish; and raw in the form of ceviche and the like. In the West Country, we don’t get those huge scallops that Scottish divers catch, but the flipside of that is ours cost about a fifth of the price. In a restaurant, you can pay upwards of 25 quid for just one fat Scottish scallop, while for the same price you could probably get a plate of five Lyme Bay ones.This week’s recipe is perhaps my favourite way to cook scallops at home. It’sveryeasy, too – though if you wanted to titivate it a little, you could maybe crumble some black pudding into the crust, or some chopped and fried chorizo, or a little grated lemon zest, or sprinkle on a splash of white vermouth or pastis (Tarquin’s make a great local one down in Cornwall) at the end.Baked scallops with herb crustServes412 scallops, cleaned and on the half-shellFlaky sea salt and black pepper80g butter2 medium shallots, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and grated100g fresh white breadcrumbs3 tbsp chopped soft herbs– parsley, chives, tarragon or chervil, or a mixtureHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the scallops on a baking tray and season. Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat, then sweat the chopped shallots and grated garlic for a couple of minutes, until soft but not coloured. Take off the heat, stir in the white breadcrumbs and chopped soft herbs, and season. Spoon the herby breadcrumbs evenly over the top of the scallops, pop the tray in the oven and bake for six to eight minutes, until golden. Serve immediately, ideally with a glass of something crisp and white.Mark Hix is a restaurateur and writer based in Dorset.

It was only slightly behind the proportion who had PGD after the death of a grandparent (8.3%), a sibling (8.9%) or even a partner (9.1%).Only those who had lost parents or children had the disorder in significantly higher rates, at 11.2% and 21.3%.About a fifth of people who had experienced a pet and human loss said the former was worse, despite previous studies finding that people often feel shame, embarrassment and isolation for expressing grief over a dead pet.The study estimated that one in 12 cases of PGD in the UK were caused by the death of a pet, due to the fact that about half of adults have pets and those pets’ lifespans tend to be considerably shorter than humans’.The study’s author, Philip Hyland, a professor of psychology at Maynooth University in Ireland, said the research also showed that the symptoms of this severe grief for a pet matched identically with that for a human, and there was no difference in how people experienced those losses.He said the research presented “consistent and compelling evidence” that grief over a pet was no less legitimate, and he called for guidelines for diagnosing PGD to be expanded.Hyland said diagnostic guidelines “do not allow for PGD to be diagnosed following the death of a pet, but these results demonstrate that people can experience clinically relevant levels of grief after the death of a pet, and at rates that are comparable to human losses that are considered ‘legitimate’ risk factors for PGD”.He said that if the research could be replicated, it would mean a person “can satisfy all symptom and impairment requirements for PGD yet be ineligible for diagnosis solely because the deceased was not a member of the homo sapiens species”.“From both psychological and evolutionary standpoints, this would be an extraordinarily difficult position to defend,” Hyland said. “The decision to exclude pet loss from the bereavement criterion for PGD can be viewed as not only scientifically misguided but also as callous.”Explore more on these topicsPetsPsychologyAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

My first day brought many hard lessonsRead more summer essentialsMike HohnenThu 15 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 20.10 ESTShareAt first, I didn’t notice it. When it became too big to not notice, I ignored it. In my ignorance, I even mocked it. It wasn’t until it had completely subsumed my inner circle that I was forced to accept reality: my friends can climb up walls like mountain goats.Bouldering is the art of ascending short “climbs” using time-tested techniques. As much a problem-solving exercise as it is a physical one, it pleases parts of the brain left dormant for millennia. What began as a way to train rock climbers has blossomed into its own culture replete with specialised gear, terminology, community and Italian brain rot memes.If I wanted to join my friends in “the way of the wall”, I’d be starting from zero – but after my GP’s requests that I engage in more physical activity turned to impassioned pleas – and, fine, a tinge of peer pressure – I found myself outside BlocHaus climbing gym in Sydney.Mike bouldering‘Climbing in your 30s without stretching first teaches something that can be learned no other way’Climbing gyms have become truethird places. Many have coffee, snacks, free wifi, lounge areas and even non-bouldering activities that make them genuinely comfortable places to spend time. Many have weekly events, open early and close late.My rookie era: I wanted to think about something that wasn’t grim, so I enrolled in gardening schoolRead moreI knew none of this on my first day. I wandered in with my partner, who incredibly agreed to start too so I didn’t have to do it alone. We were met with a hectic maze of sloped walls and impossibly small “holds”. Although we were told these climbs had varying difficulty levels, everyone, even small children, seemed to move like Cirque du Soleil performers. Then there was us. Starting with the easiest level – blue – we got down to business.I approached the wall with the confidence of someone who’d watched at least five to seven tutorial videos the night prior, but by the time hand met hold, all had been forgotten. The nerves kicked in. Surely these rental shoes were too big? (They were). Surely I had used too much chalk? (I had). But neither of these prevented me from completing my first climb and the rush that came after. I soon fell afoul of the golden rule of climbing: move slow. Time spent off the wall is just as valuable as time spent on. Within 30 minutes, I could hardly move.That first day had many hard lessons. Climbing in your 30s without stretching first teaches something that can be learned no other way.My own decisions aside, the learning process in bouldering isn’t all that steep. As a beginner, it’s clear where your focus is meant to be, what you’re meant to do – and you receive plenty of nonjudgmental help from others on the way up. It can take weeks to develop the skills to tackle the next difficulty level, and months to progress from there, but as colours highlight your next achievement, or “projects” in the parlance, learning never becomes a grind.View image in fullscreen‘Within two weeks of climbing, my upper body and core strength had noticeably improved.’Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianI committed to going twice a week and bought a membership to maintain a healthy level of accountability. The benefits were immediate. Within two weeks of climbing, my upper body and core strength had noticeably improved; by week three so had my posture and sleep. More importantly, I had progressed to purple. It would be another few weeks before I successfully finished any climbs, but they no longer felt impossible.I now crave the moments of mindfulness the wall provides – it’s hard to sweat the small stuff when brain and body are so locked in. Social pressure may have driven me up the wall, but the opportunity to carve quiet moments in my week has kept me there.Three months later, many climbs still remain out of reach. I haven’t quite pinned down the lingo, or a position on whether liquid or powder chalk is better, but I’m in. Bouldering has a grip on me. Besides, I already bought the shoes.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleMy rookie eraHealth & wellbeingHobbiesFitnessRock climbingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This jacket was here before the British arrived in Calcutta and it’s gone through a very fluid evolution since then.”View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi’s government has pledged to free India from the legacy of more than 100 years of Britain’s colonial rule.Photograph: Altaf Hussain/ReutersFor Rathore, whose fashion label has focused on the traditional cultures and craft of thebandhgala, it remains a distinctively Indian garment that encompasses layers of history.The now-ubiquitous closed neckline, the fitted and tailored torso and shaped shoulders of the jacket first emerged in the courts of Mughal emperor Akbar in the 16th century.As the design evolved into a waist-length fitted jacket, it was then adopted in the courts of the Rajput warrior rulers and maharajas of Jodhpur, in what is now Rajasthan state, where it underwent further transformation and adaptation. The high neck was seen as particularly favourable for the chilly conditions of north India during the winter.By the 19th century, the jacket had been further modified by the Jodhpur royal family to make it suitable as an outfit for riding horses and playing polo, to be matched with tight breeches now known more commonly as jodhpurs. It was as a polo uniform that thebandhgalajacketbecame popularised in the west by the early 20th century.Far from being a western imposition, the adoption of thebandhgalajacket by Indian Railways in the late 19th century saw it replace more European-style frocks and tunics.Rathore acknowledged there was some colonial influence on the evolution of the jacket during the time of the Raj. Elements were copied from British military uniform jackets, such as certain trims and tailoring, and other paraphernalia that were added to the designs. But “the jacket itself always remained Indian”, he emphasised.Thebandhgalais not the only relic to face the ire of the Hindu nationalist government of prime ministerNarendra Modi, as it has pledged to free India from the legacy of more than 100 years of Britain’s cruel and exploitative colonial rule, which only ended in 1947. “The goal of a developed India is to remove any trace of the colonial mindset,” Modi said last year.After Indian independence, thebandhgalawas reclaimed as a nationalistic garment, and kept on as a formal part of the railways uniform. While Rathore conceded it was not always the most practical item for those working on the railways – particularly in the high summer temperatures – he questioned what might be brought in to replace it.“There is much curiosity over what they will choose,” he said. “The hope is it’s not just an ordinary western suit.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaColonialismNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

Stars are already appearing in the inky mid-afternoon sky.Life-changing moments are easy to spot in retrospect, but at the time they can feel so ordinary. I didn’t know then that my wintry swim would lead to a year of adventures. I was a hair’s breadth from wimping out, but then I was in. The water was so cold it burned. I gasped for breath. The bones in my feet ached with cold as I trod water, legs frantic under the dark surface. It lasted under a minute and then we were out.As we warmed up, hands around mugs of hot chocolate, skin zinging from the experience, more and more women arrived at the cafe, hair wet from the sea. As stars spread across the early evening sky, we chatted about swimming and how it made us feel. I’d been looking for something to pick me up ever since I had left my job on the verge of burnout. I said to my friend: “I’m going to spend a year doing this. I’ve finally found what makes me feel alive. I’m going to spend a year swimming in the Nordic countries.”View image in fullscreenAllas Pool in Helsinki.Photograph: Subodh Agnihotri/AlamyThere are some delightful generalisations to make about Nordic people. Finns, they say, are born in the sauna. Norwegians are said to be born on skis. But if you ask me, all Nordic people are born with saltwater in their veins: that’s how much they love the sea. In Iceland it’s so ingrained that people see water as a cure-all. If you need time to think, if you need perspective, they say you should lay your head in water. It became my mantra for the year.I swam in a harbour pool all by myself, as if I owned it, with views of the Oslofjord’s rocky pine-covered islands stippling the horizonI decided to swim once a week wherever I was. After my experience in Bergen, I returned to my home in Copenhagen and started to plot a route around the region. Where would I swim if I could swim anywhere? I could take a dip in the harbour outside my flat – that was easy. But what about Sweden, 35 minutes away by train? What about the Arctic – could I do that? Maybe I’d swim inAllas Pool, the heated floating swimming pool in Helsinki harbour I’d seen on Instagram.As a journalist covering Scandinavia, the travel side was easy; all I had to do was pack my kit wherever I went on assignment. I only needed a swimming costume, two towels, one for my feet and one for my body, and an S hook to hang my bag from. That last tip came from a lady I swam with one pitch-black morning in central Copenhagen: you don’t want to inadvertently leave your bag in a puddle, after all.View image in fullscreenLaura at Copenhagen’s Kastrup sea pool.Photograph: Laura HallI reached out to other Scandinavian swimmers on Instagram to ask if I could join them for a dip if I was in town. I looked up places with saunas, natural spas and simple stretches of beach where other people regularly swam. Serendipitously, things started to happen. I went to write about a tiny hotel on a remote archipelago in Arctic Norway and I found myself packing a swimming costume. I landed in a snowstorm and the next day picked my way down an icy path fromthe Arctic Hideaway’s sauna to the quay in my flip-flops. Looking down, I could make out the dark purple spiny sea urchins moving on the seafloor. And then I was in, head under the water, in a sea where an orca had been seen just days before.I’ve learned that doing things that make you feel alive is intoxicating. Sinking into nature on a regular basis makes you feel part of itAt the Arctic Hideaway I met Siri, a champion freediver, and a few months later I went to meet her in Oslo. I swam in aharbour poolall by myself, as if I owned it, with views of the Oslofjord’s rocky pine-covered islands stippling the horizon. At lunch, Siri told me how she had dived with orca in northern Norway and seen a huge bull orca spot her, turn and swim towards her. He had appraised her with one of his black eyes before calmly swimming away. I was in awe of what you can find in the sea if you go looking.As the year went on, my swimming confidence grew. I met dippers dressed as mermaids, whirlpool swimmers, lighthouse swimmers and a lot of naked swimmers. I met people setting themselves big swimming challenges, and those who make a daily practice of submerging themselves in the water for their health and for fun. It has been a life-changing adventure.View image in fullscreenLaura even swam at Uunartoq in Greenland.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyI knew I had really changed when I found myself swimming in Greenland. On a tiny island calledUunartoqin the south of the country, I stripped down to my black swimming costume. Just off shore, two icebergs, each the size of a three-bedroom detached house, floated beneath stern black mountains. Up the hill, there was a natural hot pool with gently simmering water. But all I wanted to do was get in the sea.Travels in Moominland: summer in Tove Jansson’s FinlandRead moreMy feet sank into the feather-soft sand of the beach as I ran and threw my body into the waves. Little pieces of seaweed drifted in the water and I could see all the way to the bottom. I was out quickly, unable to take the cold for long. But I ran up and down the beach to warm up so I could go in again, this time for longer. Then I climbed the hill and sank into the 38C waters of the island’s hot spring, watching tiny bubbles percolate up from the silty floor.After a year of swimming in some of the world’s coldest seas, I’ve learned a lot about my ability to do hard things. I’ve learned that doing things that make you feel alive, with other people who feel the same, is intoxicating. I’ve found that sinking into nature on a regular basis makes you feel part of it. I’d started the year feeling burnt out and depressed, not sure if I could find a future for myself in this part of the world. But I learned that while I will always be English, it’s still possible to get a little saltwater in your veins.The Year I Lay My Headin Water: Swimming Scandinavia in Search of a Better Lifeby Laura Hallis published by Icon at £18.99.

To my mind, they were where white blokes got lagered-up before rolling out on to the streets to abuse people who looked like me. None of my mates were big drinkers; we were much more interested in music (rare groove and hip-hop) and trying to meet girls. Rooms full of aggressive-looking men held no attraction for any of us.Our early adult years were about dancing and house parties, and it was only after enrolling at the achingly trendy Richmond College that we were introduced to pubs and bars as meeting places, rather than spaces to get your head kicked in. Ironically, the most popular meeting spot by far, the Dome, was less than a mile away from the council estate where we grew up. That 15-minute walk across Battersea bridge and down Beaufort Street was like walking through a portal into another universe.It was a dark, unspectacular place with a central bar and seating all around. It wasn’t even officially called the Dome until the early 1990s, but it had a striking domed roof and I never once heard this traditional pub (allegedly a meeting spot for the Sex Pistols in the 1970s) referred to by its actual name back then,the Roebuck.To me and my friends, the Dome seemed the very height of Thatcherite hedonism. The coolest kids from our estate would go there and mingle with the wild children of the wealthy to flirt and hear about the night’s parties. To me, it felt like Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory, but for attractive women. The Dome was my gateway to a world of middle-class people and it changed my outlook on life completely.The youth culture on our estates at the time could be roughly divided between “raggas” and “trendies”. Raggas were tougher: they were more influenced by Jamaican culture and listened to sound systems. Trendies, or “freaks” (my group), thought of ourselves as more fashionable, less aggressive and more into jazz-funk and rare groove. The line between these groups was very vague, and often crossed family lines and overlapped when it came to soul and hip-hop.On our estates we were not the hard kids: our flamboyant clothes, relaxed hair and attempts to appear sophisticated would often be a target of ridicule from the estate’s raggas. Stepping across the border from Battersea to Chelsea, we went from being the weird “freaky” boys, too soft to bother with, to being the “edgy cool Black guys from across the road”.Seeing the wealthy up close in the Dome not only widened my horizons, it also helped to break down some of the other mental barriers I had constructed. I’m still friends with lots of the people I met at that time. They were wonderful, interesting and insecure. Realising that “successful” people are every bit as flawed as me and my mates were back then has served me very well ever since.Maurice Mcleod is a social commentator, Labour councillor and CEO of Olmec, an anti-racist community development charityExplore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meLondonBlack British culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

So we are glad that at this point the study is being cancelled,” Boum said. The study was halted because it raised critical questions on the ethics of the trial, he said, adding: “The way the study was designed was a big challenge.”Officials inGuinea-Bissausay the trial will still happen, according to one journalist on the press call. But Africa CDC officials said the trial would only move forward once it has been redesigned to address ethical issues. There were “still some conversations happening” between Guinea-Bissau officials and the US on how to conduct a trial like this ethically, and Africa CDC, which is not affiliated with the HHS, had assembled a team to make sure Guinea-Bissau officials “receive the adequate support to ensure that this study, if it has to happen, will also fit the ethical regulations”, Boum said.Health secretary RFK Jr appoints two vaccine skeptics to CDC advisory panelRead moreThe design of the study has not been made public by the researchers or by health officials, but a leaked version was published by Inside Medicine on Thursday. An HHS official told the Guardian after publication that the protocol is now being updated and the leaked version is not finalized. That would mean the trial would not proceed as it has been described so far.The official did not offer a timeline for when the study would be finalized, but said the US was trying to move as quickly as possible before vaccines roll out to all Guinea-Bissau newborns in 2027. “This study is going to proceed as planned,” the official said.Guinea-Bissau, which underwent a coup in November, appears to have replaced all top officials, including at the ministry of health. Previous officials did not respond to media inquiries, and the number and email address for the health ministry appear to be disconnected.“The good guys won,” said Paul Offit, an infectious diseases physician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a former member of the vaccines and related biological products advisory committee for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The cancellation news was “extremely heartening”, he said, adding that except for the birth of his children, he had “never been happier”.“This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable,” Offit said. “You can’t treat children like this, you can’t treat people like this. We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”The news could represent a turning point for Guinea-Bissau and other countries where researchers are conducting work that critics say is unethical. It shows that “the institutions are getting stronger” by pushing back on unethical and exploitative studies in Africa, said Boghuma Titanji, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University who is studying vaccine misinformation in Africa.The halt was “a win for advocacy and upholding the ethics of research”, said Titanji, who called the trial as it seems to be designed a “damaging study”. “It can lead to damage that lasts for several decades after the study has been completed,” said Titanji.The researchersarguedthat the trial would make the vaccine available to 7,000 newborns when they would “not otherwise receive it”. But that means the other 7,000 children in the trial would not have access to the vaccine “due to the flip of a coin”, which would “knowingly deprive 7,000 children of a vaccine that could save their lives”, Offit said. Instead, he said, “take the $1.6m and vaccinate as many children as you can at birth”.About 18% of adults and about 11% of children under the age of one in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B. Children are much more likely to develop long-term effects, such as liver cirrhosis, which can lead to cancer and death if they catch the virus when they are very young.Guinea-Bissau currently recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all babies at six weeks of age because of issues accessing the vaccine, but that recommendation will change to all newborns at birth in 2027, when more doses are available.Offit likened the trial to the Tuskegee experiment, in which US researchers knowingly withheld an effective antibiotic from African American men suffering from syphilis.The Danish researchers conducting the trial have also been criticized for not publishing the results of a study on the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, potentially because it contradicted their belief that the vaccine is dangerous,accordingto the Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård.The protocols for the study have not been made public by the researchers or health officials, but a leaked version was published byInside Medicine. Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer, one of the Danish researchers, also shared somedetailson social media. Titanji didn’t find his argument compelling. “It actually just raises even more concerns in my mind,” she said.The researchers argue that some types of vaccines may bring nonspecific effects – improving overall health, not just against the disease the vaccine is targeting. But, they say, adding other kinds of vaccines, such as that for hepatitis B, could interfere with these possible effects. Yet the evidence to support possible overall health effects is based upon the researchers’ prior research, which has been called into question.Other Danish researchers analyzed these studies and found no statistically significant effects, according to their newpreprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed or published yet. One of the researchers on that study, Anders Hviid,saidon LinkedIn that these findings were especially important given recent decisions in the US to limit several vaccines for children.The Danish researchers also argued that trials should be done in Africa in order to study their effects on African children.Titanji agreed that there needed to be more randomized controlled trials done in Africa on Africans, but said that they should be led by African scientists and powered by questions from Africans. Projects like the Danish study “basically exploit the scarcity of a proven beneficial vaccine in a context where that vaccine is needed”, Titanji said. The study, as it is currently designed, would be “exploiting a window where the government is not able to provide that intervention to its citizens”, Titanji added. “You are not solving the problem. You’re actually being part of the problem.”The trial was slated to begin on 5 January. When asked last week about whether the trial had begun, the lead researchers, Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, disputed the Guardian’sprevious storythat cited ethical concerns.“That article was totally wrong,” Aaby said. “The report had virtually no evidence-based content about vaccines to transmit to the readers, only a lot of ethical condemnations from those who might potentially be questioned by the future results of the study.”Aaby and other researchers on the project did not respond to further inquiries about the project’s cancellation.Aaby and Stabell Benn, who are Danish researchers, have close ties with Trump administration health officials. Stabell Benn hosted apodcastwith Tracy Beth Høeg, now an FDA official who has worked tofind deaths after Covid vaccinationand advocated for the US toslash vaccine recommendationsto align with Denmark’s schedule.On Joe Rogan’spodcastin 2023, Kennedy praised Aaby as a “very famous” researcher whose work showed the DTP vaccine was deadly, he said – research Kennedy also cited when he ended funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. But he didn’t mention that the year before, in 2022, the researchers found completely different results when they conducted the same trial.Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationGuinea-BissauRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationInfectious diseasesAfricaHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Massive ballot stuffing reported everywhere. Our leaders … arrested. Many of our polling agents and supervisors abducted, and others chased off polling stations. RISE TO THE OCCASION AND REJECT THE CRIMINAL REGIME.”Voting in the election, which is expected to result in PresidentYoweri Museveniextending his nearly four-decade grip on power, was delayed in many parts of the country because of technical and logistical issues.View image in fullscreenBobi Wine casts his vote in the general election. He accused the government of arresting and abducting his party’s officials as the country went to the polls.Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/ReutersSome polling stations in the capital, Kampala, and the eastern city of Jinja remained closed several hours after voting was supposed to start. According to local reports, in some instance ballot papers had not been delivered and biometric machines used to check voters’ identities were not working. Anxious crowds at polling stations spoke of their concerns about the delay.David Lewis Rubongoya, the secretary general of Wine’s National Unity Platform, (NUP) said no voting took place in the morning across much of Kampala. “Everything they are doing is a sham and it is deliberate,” he said of the government.Museveni acknowledged that even he had experienced challenges in voting and promised to investigate the matter.In the run-up to the vote, security forces – over which Museveni has total control – frequently broke up Wine’s campaign events using teargas and gunshots and by bludgeoning his supporters. At least one person was killed and hundreds were arrested.Civil society members were also arrested and rights groups suspended. On Tuesday, access to the internet was shut down and mobile phone services were limited.Observers said the heightened repression could indicate that the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) was concerned about waning support. It has also prompted fears of a violent crackdown on dissent in the aftermath of the vote, as happenedin neighbouring Tanzaniaafter its election in October.Museveni is seeking his seventh term. Most Ugandans have not lived under another president. Younger people in particular have connected with 43-year-old Wine and say they are concerned about their futures.Museveni became Uganda’s ninth president in 1986 after leading rebels in a five-year civil war. He led the country to economic growth and democratic change after years of political decay by autocratic governments.But hopes of enduring change dwindled amid accusations of corruption, authoritarianism, repression and curtailment of judicial independence. Critics have also condemned his extended stay in office, achieved by using tactics to lengthen his term indefinitely, including by twice changing the constitution.View image in fullscreenMuseveni speaks during a press conference after casting his ballot on Thursday.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesMwambutsya Ndebesa, a political historian, said: “[Wine’s] challenge has brought to the surface the character of the regime in terms of tolerating political alternatives or dissent. The political class is getting more and more politically polarised. And that threatens the stability of the country.”In December, police detained Sarah Bireete, a rights activist and government critic who had raised concerns about discrepancies in the registry of voters. On Tuesday, the government ordered several rights groups that had denounced violations during the campaign to stop their work.Areport by the UNhuman rights office last week accused Ugandan authorities of using laws enacted or amended since 2021 to entrench repression and restrict rights before the election, which it said would take place in an environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation.The government has said the actions of the security forces are in response to what it termed lawless conduct by opposition supporters. In a televised address on New Year’s Eve, Museveni advised security forces to use more teargas to break up the crowds of “the criminal opposition”.View image in fullscreenA voter casts her ballot with a friend at a polling station in Kampala.Photograph: Luis Tato/AFP/Getty ImagesEron Kiiza, a human rights lawyer, said at a briefing last week: “Everything is done to frustrate and annoy,” referring to disruption of opposition events by security agencies. Kiiza was allegedlytortured and detained without triallast year while representing the jailed opposition politician Kizza Besigye, who has been in prison for 14 months over what critics say are politically motivated charges, and Besigye’s aide Hajj Obeid Lutale.Museveni, 81, often credits NRM with bringing peace and development to Uganda. Under the slogan “protecting the gains”, he promised wealth and job creation and to grow the economy partly through value addition for agricultural exports andoil production, which is expected to start this year.Festus Kezire, an NRM supporter in Serere district in eastern Uganda, said Museveni’s introduction of free primary and secondary education was one of the reasons he would vote for him. He said: “He has restored peace and stability in Uganda and this has helped end many years of civil strife.”Wine’s manifesto promised “a complete reset of Uganda”, including by upholding human rights and ending corruption.Florence Naluyiba, an NUP supporter in Wakiso district in central Uganda, said she would vote for Wine because “Uganda needs change”. “Our dream is to have a president who will prioritise social service delivery.Bobi Winehas taken the risk to stand up for Ugandans at the expense of his freedom,” she said.Ndebesa, the historian, said the incumbent’s stranglehold on state power, resources and infrastructure gave him organisational advantages over Wine. “The winning [of Museveni] in Uganda is almost a given,” he said.Observers are keen to see what the election will say about Museveni’s eventual succession. He has long been thought to be grooming his son,Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as his successor, although he has denied this.Additional reporting bySamuel Okirorand Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUgandaYoweri MuseveniBobi WineAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The work of six artists is being shown at five galleries dotted across Wales.View image in fullscreenAntonio Paucar worked as a beekeeper in the highlands of Peru before travelling to Berlin to study art.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianSpeaking to the Guardian in Cardiff before the prize ceremony, Paucar said: “I didn’t expect it. The journey of an artist is very difficult. For me this kind of recognition is very important for my region, my country, my culture. It gives me strength to continue developing new projects.”Paucar comes from the village of Aza, near Huancayo, in the Junín region of central Peru, where his family make traditional figures and masks. He worked as a beekeeper in the highlands of Peru before travelling to Berlin to study art.He now splits his time between making art aimed at highlighting environmental issues and helping to preserve his culture and language – and looking after bees. “I have a countryside kind of life: we keep hens and grow vegetables,” he said.View image in fullscreenIn the Andes, ‘life is not linear like the European way of thinking’, said Antonio Paucar.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianAmong Paucar’s work on display atNational Museum Cardiffis a spiral made out of black and white alpaca wool, La Energía Espiral del Ayni.Paucar said: “Ayniis a Quechua word. It represents an Andean concept, a way of thinking, the idea that everything is linked. It has allowed people in the Andes to maintain a balance with nature. If the mountains give us food and life, we also have to give them life. Life is not linear like the European way of thinking. It’s not that we are born here and die here. We are circular.”When he collected alpaca wool from the mountains, Paucar was surprised how difficult it was to find black wool. “I thought it was important to have black and white wool. It was easy to find white wool because in the textile industry there is a demand for white because it can be dyed. The black colour is disappearing.”View image in fullscreenPaucar wrote messages in his own blood to highlight the climate and pollution crises.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianAnother work, El Corazón de la Montaña , features a video of Paucar sitting at a desk in the mountains, writing with blood drawn from his body. The message he wrote highlights the climate and pollution crises: “The glaciers in the Andes are crying/With their mournful cry they melt forever.”One of his pieces on display at Mostyn, Llandudno, in north Wales, features the imprints of Paucar’s footprints on the wall. He tramped over the nearby limestone headland Y Gogarth (the Great Orme) in his bare feet and then performed a handstand back at the gallery. His feet came to rest on the wall, leaving a ghostly imprint.Paucar said he had seen parallels between Peru and Wales. “The Celtic culture was very linked to nature. That is also the case with the Andean culture. Maintaining the language is also important in Wales and where I am from.”Not all of his work has been universally well received. The Guardian’s art writer Jonathan Jones was no fan of a video shown at Mostyn of Paucar burying and burning a reproduction of Marcel Duchamp’s 1913 artwork Bicycle Wheel.Jones wrote: “A performance attacking an icon of western art only makes sense to those in the know.” Paucar said he respected Duchamp and the piece was a reference to a wheel he had played with as a child.View image in fullscreenArtes Mundi runs at the National Museum Cardiff (above), Mostyn, Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Chapter and the Glynn Vivian art gallery until 1 March.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianThe director of Artes Mundi, Nigel Prince, said as many as 150,000 people were expected to have seen the work of Paucar and the other artists by the time the exhibition ended.Prince said it was positive that parallels between Celtic western Europe and the Peruvian Andes had emerged. “We are really interested to focus on things that bring people together,” he said. “In today’s global context, where there often can be an emphasis on focusing on difference as a means to divide and rend apart, I actually think that opens up a sort of sharing and a dialogue.”Artes Mundi can be viewed at five galleries across Wales until 1 March 2026.Explore more on these topicsArtAwards and prizesWalesPeruAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

That official visit – the first in years – wasreportedlypartly designed to pave the way for the reopening of the Venezuelan embassy.Nobel Institute rejects María Corina Machado’s offer to share peace prize with TrumpRead moreMachado, a 58-year-old former legislator, won a primary to run against Maduro in 2024 but wasblocked by the governmentfrom running. Her replacement, the retired diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia, was recognized by Washington as the legitimate winner of the presidential election after the opposition presented strong evidence that Maduro had lost the race by a wide margin.Trump has sent mixed signals about Machado’s role in Venezuela’s transition, publicly questioning her domestic standing. On the day of Maduro’s capture, he remarked that Machado was a “nice woman”, but claimed she lacked the “respect” needed to govern Venezuela.But whether Machado can persuade Trump otherwise may depend less on her vision for Venezuela than the gold medal she was awarded for her work promoting democracy and human rights.In an interview with Fox News last week, Machado said that she wanted to “share” the award with Trump – an idea rebuffed by theorganizers of the Nobel prize, who clarified that the prize was non-transferable. Still, Trump told reporters it would be a “great honor” to accept the prize.Trump has frequently expressed frustration at being overlooked for the Nobel prize, and it has been reported that Machado’s acceptance of the prize – despite dedicating it in part to Trump – hurt her standing with the administration. “If she had turned it down and said: ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ she’d be the president of Venezuela today,” a source close to the White Housetoldthe Washington Post.Trump has meanwhile forged a working relationship with Rodríguez, the acting president. Last week, Trump announced an agreement with Venezuela’s interim leaders that he said would provide up to50m barrels of crude oilto the US. He also signed an executive order to “safeguard” Venezuelan oil revenues in US-controlled accounts.After initially condemning the capture of Maduro – an operation Venezuelan officials say killed at least 100 military personnel and civilians – Rodríguez has pivoted to working closely with the Trump administration to assert control over the country’s government and its oil reserves. In the day’s since Maduro’s seizure and rendition, officials in Venezuela have begun releasing political prisoners, including multiple US citizens, in what Rodríguezdescribedas an “opening up to a new political moment”. NGOs monitoring political detentions say the process has been slow and estimate that that as many as 1,000 remain detained.DoJ deemed it ‘unnecessary’ to conclude whether seizing Maduro violated international law, memo revealsRead moreFollowing their first phone call on Wednesday, which Trump touted on Truth Social as a “tremendous” step toward a “spectacular” partnership and Rodríguez described on Twitter/X as a “courteous” discussion on a bilateral agenda, Trump told reporters the interim leader was a “terrific person” with whom the US has “worked very well”.Since Trump’s election, Machado has repeatedly praised him, calling him a “champion of freedom”. In the interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity, Machado insisted her movement was prepared to win a free election in Venezuela andthanked Trumpfor toppling Maduro.“I do want to say today, on behalf of the Venezuelan people, how grateful we are for his courageous vision, the actions – historical actions – he has taken against this narco-terrorist regime, to start dismantling this structure and bringing Maduro to justice,” she told the network, speaking from an undisclosed location.In a separate interview with CBS last week, Machadonotedthat Rodríguez remains sanctioned by the US and argued the acting president is in a “very critical position because nobody trusts her”.When asked if she should be Venezuela’s next leader, Machado said: “Absolutely, yes.”“We are ready and willing to serve our people,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpVenezuelaMaría Corina MachadoNicolás MaduroAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

As the midterm elections approach, he has becomeconcerned about unemployment. Deeply imprinted memories of scarcity during the oil crises of the 1970s may prime his belief that cheap oil cures it all.The US president may also consider Venezuelan oil as an easy source of cash, either for the US government – to add to the tariff bonanza that he implausibly claims isbeing paid by foreigners– or for his own personal stash, which he may want to diversify away from crypto.My guess is he’s dreaming: dreams built fromUpton Sinclair talesof wildcatters striking it rich at the turn of the 20th century, mixed in with ingrained images fromthe Beverly Hillbillies, which debuted on CBS when Trump was 16, and visions ofgold-plated palaces, so common in the oil fiefdoms of the Middle East. A child’s lust for buried treasure.None of this makes any sense.The world is awash in oil, much of it fracked from shale in the US. Prices are at their lowest since 2021, when the global economy was recovering from the Covid pandemic. The US took out the president ofVenezuela, sitting atop the world’s largest oil reserves. Street protests raged across Iran, another large producer. The price of oil barely blipped.A line chart showing daily price of oilThe price of oil is so low, in fact, that pulling more of the sticky, heavy Venezuelan crude out of the ground in the Orinoco belt has become uneconomical.According to Wood MacKenzie, Brent crude would have to cost at least $80 a barrel to justify greenfield investment in Venezuelan wells. The last time it hit that number was a year ago. Over the last month it has hovered between $58.7 and $62.3.For all its vaunted oil reserves, without further major investment to restore its decrepit infrastructure, Venezuela can’t produce much oil. Last year it produced 880,000 barrels a day, 1% of world oil production. That amounts to only 4.3% of what the US pumped that year.Even if there was oil for Trump to snatch, getting hold of it will be no walk in the park.As notes Emily Meierding, of the Institute for Regional and International Security at the Naval Postgraduate Shool in California, “crude oil is not a quickly or easily lootable resource.”Trump promises oil companies ‘total safety’ in Venezuela as he urges them to invest billionsRead moreWhat oil company would invest billions in Venezuela based on a contract with Trump or the puppet regime put together in Caracas from the pieces left behind by PresidentNicolás Maduro? Chances are the contract would be abrogated once a new government took over. That’s if the facilities weren’t bombed first.This is probably why George W Bush didn’t seize Iraq’s oil resources for good during the US occupation of Iraq, but returned the oil infrastructure to the Iraqi government. It’s probably related to why the ExxonMobil CEO, Darren Woods, told Trump that Venezuela was, at the moment, “uninvestable”.The economic case for Venezuelan oil is even weaker, as theUS economyhas become gradually and consistently less dependent on it.Some economists posit that oil shocks have imposed, at worst, onlya modest dragon the economy. They argue that even the poor economy, from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, had little to do with the sharp increase in oil prices. In any event, the economy has become much less reliant on oil since then.The US produces aboutthree times as much GDPper unit of energy consumed than it did at the turn of the century, as the energy efficiency of industry has increased and, critically, industry’s share of the economy has shrunk asservices have grown dramatically in importance. Oil, moreover, plays a smaller role inthe US’s energy mix, accounting for 38% of energy use, down from 40% in the year 2000 and 50% in the mid 1970s.Gains in energy efficiency, alongside the increase in domestic oil production, have driven a two-decade decline in the country’s reliance on foreign oil.The US has a long history of meddling in other countries’ business tosecure access to oil. In 1953, American intelligence services had their hands all over the ouster of the prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, who had nationalized Iran’s oil reserves, to install Shah Reza Pahlavi in power.In 1957,President Dwight D Eisenhower askedCongress to offer economic and military support to any effort to prevent the Middle East from aligning on the Soviet side of the cold war. As oil prices soared during the war between Iran and Iraq, the Reagan administration pushed anational security directiveto increase the US military presence in the Gulf – facilities that came in handy whenGeorge HW Bushejected Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1990.Multinational oil companies have been swift to close in on oil assets on the heels of regime change. Western oil concernspiled into Russiaafter the demise of the Soviet Union. They rushed to bid onIraq’s oil assetsduring auctions in 2008 and 2009.Venezuela may seem to offer a similar opportunity. And yet, Iraq may prove to be a relevant precedent. By now western oil firmshave largely left– pushed away by production disruptions amid political turmoil, as well as payment arrears from the cash-strapped government.While Trump is sure there is treasure to be snatched under the Venezuelan soil, it’s probably safer, easier and cheaper for US companies to procure whatever oil the US economy needs at home.Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS economyVenezuelaDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now I’m going to let them go through it with their board and give them time,” he said.Taiwanese firms building new US chip operations will also be treated more favorably when it comes to future duties on semiconductors, the commerce department added.“The objective is to bring 40% of Taiwan’s entire supply chain and production, to domestically bring it into America,” Lutnick said.“We’re going to bring it all over, so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors,” he added.The agreement comes after months of negotiations.The Taiwanese president, Lai Ching-te, had pledged to boost investments in the United States and increase defense spending as his government tried to lower US duties, and avoid a toll on its semiconductor chip exports.Taiwan is a powerhouse in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips, which are the lifeblood of the global economy, as well as other electronics.But Trump previously accused Taiwan of stealing the US chip industry, and his administration had made clear it wants more of the critical technology made on American soil.Taiwan’s trade surplus in goods with the US was about $74bn in 2024. More than half of its exports to US are information and communications technology products – including semiconductors.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTaiwanTariffsUS economyEconomicsAsia PacificDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the next 24 hours he had worsening hallucinations, and tried to escape the hospital.Doctors eventually discovered the man was on a daily diet of sodium bromide, an inorganic salt mainly used for industrial and laboratory purposes including cleaning and water treatment.He bought it over the internetafter ChatGPT told him he could use it in place of table saltbecause he was worried about the health impacts of salt in his diet. Sodium bromide can accumulate in the body causing a condition called bromism, with symptoms including hallucinations, stupor and impaired coordination.It is cases like this that have Alex Ruani, a doctoral researcher in health misinformation with the University College in London, concerned about the launch ofChatGPTHealth in Australia.A limited number of Australian users can already access the artificial intelligence platform which allows them to “securely connect medical records and wellness apps” to generate responses “more relevant and useful to you”. ChatGPT users in Australia can join a waitlist for access.“ChatGPTHealthis being presented as an interface that can help people make sense of health information and test results or receive diet advice, while not replacing a clinician,” Ruani said.“The challenge is that, for many users, it’s not obvious where general information ends and medical advice begins, especially when the responses sound confident and personalised, even if they mislead.”Specialist doctor fees are forcing Australians into ‘impossible choices’. Advocates say urgent change is neededRead moreRuani said there had been too many“horrifying” examplesof ChatGPT “leaving out key safety details like side effects, contraindications, allergy warnings, or risks around supplements, foods, diets, or certain practices”.“What worries me is that there are no published studies specifically testing the safety of ChatGPT Health,” Ruani said. “Which user prompts, integration paths, or data sources could lead to misguidance or harmful misinformation?”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailChatGPT is developed by OpenAI, which used the tool HealthBench to develop ChatGPT Health. HealthBench employs doctors to test and evaluate how well AI models perform when responding to health questions.Ruani said the full methodology used by HealthBench, and its evaluations, are “mostly undisclosed, rather than outlined in independent peer-reviewed studies”.“ChatGPT Health is not regulated as a medical device or diagnostic tool. So there are no mandatory safety controls, no risk reporting, no post-market surveillance, and no requirement to publish testing data.”An OpenAI spokesperson told Guardian Australia that the company had worked in partnership with more than 200 physicians from 60 countries “to advise and improve the models powering ChatGPT Health”.“ChatGPT Health is a dedicated space where health conversations stay separate from the rest of your chats, with strong privacy protections by default,” the spokesperson said.ChatGPT Health data is encrypted and subject to privacy protections by default.Sharing with third parties will happen with user consent, or in limited circumstances outlined in OpenAI’sprivacy policy.The chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, Dr Elizabeth Deveny, said rising out-of-pocket medical costsand long wait times to see doctorswere driving people to AI.She said ChatGPT Health could be useful in helping people manage well-known chronic conditions, and to research ways to stay well. AI’s ability to give answers in different languages “provides a real benefit to people who don’t have English proficiency”, she said.Deveny is concerned that people will take advice given by ChatGPT Health at face value, and that “large global tech companies are moving faster than governments”, setting their own rules around privacy, transparency and data collection.“This is not a small not-for-profit experimenting in good faith. It’s one of the largest technology companies in the world.“When commercial platforms define the norms, the benefits tend to flow to people who already have resources, education, and system knowledge. The risks fall on those who do not.”She said a failure of governments to act had left health consumers to navigate the social transformation brought by AI largely alone.“We need clear guardrails, transparency and consumer education so people can make informed choices about if and how they use AI for their health,” she said.“This isn’t about stopping AI. It’s about acting before mistakes, bias, and misinformation are replicated at speed and scale, in ways that are almost impossible to unwind.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Health (Australia news)ChatGPTHealth (Society)newsShareReuse this content"

The festival board that made this dreadful decision have been replaced, and a full apology has been accepted by Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, who has been invited to appear next year.“Given this new and welcome development we feel able, in good conscience, to honour our invitation to perform in Adelaide on 27 February. We hope that our free concert will be an opportunity for different communities to come together in peace and harmony.”On his Instagram feed, the band’s lead singer, Jarvis Cocker, said Pulp had initially pulled out because of the “dreadful situation” with Abdel-Fattah.But he was happy that the band was now “prepared to perform at the music festival once more”.“This will be a free concert, open to anyone who respects the freedom of all voices to be heard.

But these early signs show it’s important we’ve acted to make this change.”The communications minister, Anika Wells, said eSafety would examine the data to see what it showed about the compliance of individual platforms.“We’ve said from the beginning that we weren’t expecting perfection straight away – but early figures are showing this law is making a real, meaningful difference.”The federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.“Many under-16 accounts have not been deactivated, while others that were initially removed have since become active again,” said the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh.“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting.”McIntosh said children who lost access had migrated to other platforms such as Yope and Lemon8, arguing they were not included in the ban.The ban requires all platforms to self-assess as to whether the ban should apply to them, and the government indicated itwould approach other platforms to seek compliance should teens migrate to those platforms.Some platforms such as the X alternative Bluesky implemented age-assurance despite not being initially named in the list released by the government.Whilethe UKand other countries are considering following Australia’s lead, anew study on Wednesdaytracking 11- to 14-year-olds in the UK found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression.It found social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had no detrimental impact on their mental health the following year.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banAnthony AlbaneseFacebookInstagramSnapchatMetaSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

There are so many things to be thought about here.”A motion, passed unanimously by councillors, determined that council staff would prepare a report to determine the “cost, timetable and approvals process for a replacement and/or restoration of both heritage-listed pedestrian bridges”.Councillors agreed the state government would lead discussions about a permanent memorial with the families of victims, the council and the Jewish community, with a timetable yet to be determined.In the meantime, they passed a motion for the establishment of a number of dedicated mural panels to be displayed for a year along the Bondi beach promenade.On 5 January, the council relocated a menorah in Dover Heights, created by Jewish artist Joel Adler, to Archer park in Bondi to act as a temporary memorial to the victims of the terror attack.In a tribute to first responders, councillors also agreed to make nominations to the prime minister’s special honours list to posthumously acknowledgeBoris and Sofia Gurmanand Reuven Morrison for their “bravery in risking and sacrificing their lives” to stop the alleged gunmen. They also agreed thatAhmed al-Ahmed, Gefen Bitton and Leibel Lazaroff should be granted the “keys of the city” for their actions.A number of community speakers prior to the council meeting called for the bridge to remain standing.Two Jewish people living in the area, Carolyn Saul and Adrienne Kern, said they saw the bridge as “integral to the Bondi landscape” and suggested covering it in mosaic tiles with messages of “light, compassion and healing” as a reminder of the community’s strength.Nicolette Boaz, a member of Friends of Bondi Pavilion, warned against “rushed decisions” to knock anything down and destroy heritage.They echoed the views of co-CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Alex Ryvchin, who said on social media that the bridge should remain standing and “become something the killers would have hated – a tribute to our dead and to the story of Channukah”.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackSydneyBondi beachNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The drugs led them to three gangs, includinga Balkan cartel, who were working together to bring huge quantities of cocaine into Spain from Colombia.‘The cocaine superhighway’: how death and destruction mark drug’s path from South America to EuropeRead more“The gangs used the so-called ‘monkey’ technique to get the shipments of cocaine into maritime containers that were being transported on container ships,” the force said in a statement on Thursday.“The drug-trafficking technique involves using youngsters from poor backgrounds who are good swimmers to get the drugs on to ships while they’re at sea.“Members of the same organisation then headed toSpainin order to get to the containers by intercepting the ships carrying them before they reached the strait of Gibraltar.”One such attempt was thwarted in the middle of last year when a ship bound for the port of Cádiz informed the maritime rescue service that it had found stowaways on its deck, leading to the seizure of a container in which 1.4 tonnes of cocaine had been stashed. The stowaways turned out to be three men tasked with recovering the drugs, who then fled.Not long after, a ship passing through Portuguese waters reported armed stowaways on board. But the men managed to unload bundles of cocaine that had been hidden in a container and hand them to their accomplices before evading the authorities.In the autumn of last year, officer came across five men – three Colombians and two Spain-based members of the Balkan cartel – who were using speedboats andthe “drop-off” methodto collect their drugs.“This method involves throwing the merchandise from a merchant ship for collection by smaller vessels near the destination country, subduing the ship’s crew and extracting the drugs from inside the containers, using military techniques and weapons of war,” the statement added.The drugs were then hidden in towns and villages along the Gulf of Cádiz and later transported by road to other European countries.As well as confiscating 2,475kg of cocaine and various assault weapons during the operation, police seized boarding ladders, nautical equipment, eight high-end vehicles, more than €166,000 (£144,000) in cash and watches, and jewellery worth €100,000.On Monday the Policía Nacional announced itslargest-ever seizure of cocaine at seaafter officers found almost 10 tonnes of the drug hidden amid a cargo of salt on a merchant ship off the Canary Islands.Explore more on these topicsSpainDrugs tradeEuropeColombianewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement to the Guardian, Iceland’s foreign ministry said it had contacted the US embassy for clarification. “The ministry for foreign affairs contacted the US embassy in Iceland to verify the veracity of the alleged comments,” it said.‘Like Maga disciples’: meet the Trump envoys raising eyebrows in EuropeRead moreIn a petition calling on Iceland’s foreign minister, Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, to reject Long as ambassador to the country, critics said: “These words, spoken by Billy Long, whom Donald Trump has nominated as ambassador to Iceland, may have been said in jest. Still, they are offensive to Iceland and the Icelandic people, who have had to fight for their freedom and have always been a friend to the United States,”the petition read.Within hours of its launch, more than 3,200 people had signed the petition, backing the call for the US to “nominate another person who shows greater respect for Iceland and the Icelandic people”.On Wednesday Long reportedly apologised for the remarks in an interview with Arctic Today, a news website that covers the region. The outlet quoted him as saying the comments had been made in jest as others were joking about Jeff Landry, Trump’s US special envoy toGreenland.“There was nothing serious about that, I was with some people, who I hadn’t met for three years, and they were kidding about Jeff Landry being governor of Greenland and they started joking about me and if anyone took offence to it, then I apologise,”the publication quoted Long as saying.Though Long said he could understand why the comments would have set off a reaction, he was adamant they were a joke and should not be taken seriously.“I apologise and that’s my only comment, I look forward to working with the people of Iceland and I apologise it was taken that way. I was with a group of friends and there was nothing serious about it,” he added.On Thursday, Sigmar Guðmundsson, an MP for Iceland whose centrist Liberal Reform party is part of the country’s governing coalition, described the remarks as “not a particularly funny joke” given the tensions over Greenland.“It goes without saying that this is extremely serious for a small country like Iceland,”he told the Icelandic newspaper Morgunblaðið.“We must realise that all the security arguments that the Americans cite regarding Greenland also apply to Iceland. This is about the location of these two islands.”He described the comments as a sign of the growing disrespect in the US towards the sovereignty of small states. “Icelanders also have to have the courage, despite our very friendly relations with the United States, not least through Nato, to discuss where and how our security interests are best served in this changing world.”Explore more on these topicsIcelandUS foreign policyGreenlandTrump administrationEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But it is concern over Israel’s war in Gaza that has prompted the most intense criticism, with the Irish broadcaster RTÉ citing “the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there” as a reason for its non-participation.Alongside RTÉ, broadcasters from Spain,Iceland, the Netherlands and Slovenia said in December they were pulling out, while the 2024 winner Nemoreturnedtheir trophy in protest.On Tuesday, Conchita Wurst, one of the contest’smost emblematic winners, announced she would not participate in any future Eurovision events, citing a “personal decision”.The Israeli broadcaster Kan has welcomed the decision to keep Israel in the contest, rejecting allegations of political interference. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has said Israel “deserves to be represented on every stage around the world”.Johannes Pietsch, known by the stage name JJ, the 2025 winner, last year called for an Austrian edition “without Israel” but then apologised for the uproar his proposal had caused in his country.Only 97,000 fans watched Monday’s semi-final draw on YouTube, down from more than 240,000 last year. But the EBU rejoiced over a “record sellout of tickets” for the upcoming edition, after the launch of online sales on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

A museum’s success can collapse it, like the Louvre, with some rooms becoming oversaturated. The important thing is not to collapse.”View image in fullscreenDetail from The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516) in the Prado.Photograph: Album/AlamyFalomir said the museum had embarked on a new project, called Plan Host, to prioritise quality over quantity and to try to improve or at least maintain visitors’ museum experience.“It can’t be like catching the Metro at rush hour,” said the director, who has been in his post since 2017. “You can’t judge a museum on visitor numbers. The quantity isn’t as important as the quality; there should be a diverse and inclusive range of visitors.”View image in fullscreenSixty-five per cent of the Prado’s visitors last year were from overseas.Photograph: Alex Segre/AlamyGuggenheim scraps Basque Country expansion plan after local protestsRead moreFalomir said 65% of visitors last year were from overseas and he would like to see more Spaniards taking advantage of one of the country’s greatest cultural treasures. Among the plans for improving the quality of visits are optimising entrances to the museum, rethinking the size of visiting groups, and making sure people know they are not allowed to take photos in the galleries.The Louvre madenon-heist-related headlinesa year ago when its director said in a leaked memo that visiting the museum was“a physical ordeal”. Laurence des Cars said: “Visitors have no space to take a break. The food options and restroom facilities are insufficient in volume, falling below international standards. The signage needs to be completely redesigned.”The Louvre received 8.7 million visitors in 2024, the Vatican museums 6.8 million, the British Museum in London 6.5 million, and the Metropolitan Museum ofArtin New York 5.7 million.Explore more on these topicsSpainOvertourismMuseumsArtEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In the case of Saudi Arabia, its reticence led it to deny the US use of its airspace to mount any attacks.Continuing discussions, the Saudi Arabian foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, conferred by phone with his counterparts from Iran, Oman andTurkeyon Thursday.Iran remains politically apart from the Gulf states, partly owing to its continued support for its weakened network of regional proxies, known as the axis of resistance, and its refusal to back a two state-solution for Palestine as well as disputes over three islands in the Gulf claimed by the United Arab Emirates, a claim backed by the Gulf Cooperation Council.But Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, has also undertaken a series of visits to Arab capitals that are said to have improved relations. Last year, for instance, he visited Bahrain, the first Iranian minister to do since 2010. He also visited Cairo four times last year in an effort to improve relations. The two sides had severed diplomatic relations in 2016.The Saudi-Iranian relationship, once the most fraught in the Middle East, has been on a recovery path for three years. Araghchi makes a point of being photographed sampling local cuisine in the Arab capitals he visits.All the Gulf states are further aware of the disruption Iran could cause to maritime traffic in the Gulf.Araghchi has recently been trying to persuade the Gulf states than Iran is less of a risk to global stability than Israel, a case made more plausible after Israel bombed Doha last September with the intent to kill the Hamas negotiators that have lived in the Qatari capital for nearly a decade. The Israelis failed to hit their primary targets, but reportedly killed five lower-ranking members of the group.The US, not informed of the strikes in advance, apologised directly to Qatar’s emir and offered new security guarantees for Doha designed to protect Qatar from further Israeli attacks. At the time, Qatar accused Israel of trying to sabotage every opportunity for peace in the region.The US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is a supporter of the Qatari state’s self-appointed but often effective role as a global mediator.The US al-Udeid airbase, its largest in the region, is in Qatar, and as tensions mounted on Wednesday the US withdrew key personnel from the base.The withdrawal, after Tehran’s open threats to hit US bases in the region if attacked, underscores how static American land and naval bases in the region designed to project US power could also be a source of vulnerability. Iran persistently claims that the US ordered Israel to end its 12-day assault in the summer on Iran’s leadership and nuclear programme after Iran struck the US base.Araghchi has also managed to exploit the political capital he has invested in diplomatic outreach by ringing Arab leaders to explain Tehran’s rationale for the crackdown.Many of the states deeply resent the interference of Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. Yet by the same measure, few of them would welcome the example of an authoritarian regime being toppled by street protests riled by falling living standards, and leading to a new democratic transition, or even the fragmentation of a unified Iranian state.Saudi Arabia for instance has recently put down a rebellion in the south of Yemen that would have broken up the country. The Egyptian military leadership dedicates much its energy to suppressing calls for human rights reforms.The spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, Majed al-Ansari, told reporters on Tuesday: “The big challenges in the region – and we are talking about internal and external challenges in different countries – require all of us to return to the negotiating table.”The Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, has called for dialogue. “Hopefully, the United States and Iran will resolve this issue among themselves – whether through mediators, other actors, or direct dialogue. We are closely following these developments.”Explore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyTrump administrationSaudi ArabiaOmanTurkeyQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution, or execution – so I’ve been told that on good authority.” He offered no details and said the US had yet to verify the claims.Trump had repeatedlytalked in recent daysabout coming to the help of the Iranian people, saying the US was “locked and loaded” if Iran started to shoot at the protesters.Why western diplomats are wary of predicting end days for Iran’s regimeRead moreBut despite reports that as many as 3,428 Iranians had been killed and that executions as punishment were imminent, Trump made no announcement on military action. It is understood he had reviewed the full range of options to strike Iran but was unconvinced any single action would lead to a decisive change.Trump has pulled off misleading feints with Iran in the past, suggesting in June his officials were fully engaged in negotiations with their Iranian counterparts over its nuclear programme when in reality he was preparing the strikes for the 12-day war last summer.He said he had received assurances from “very important sources on the other side” that Tehran had stopped the use of lethal force on protesters and that executions would not go ahead.“There were supposed to be a lot of executions today,” Trump said, adding that “the executions won’t take place – and we’re going to find out”. He gave no estimate of the number killed, a figure he had said on Tuesday he was about to be be given by his officials. Estimates vary between under 2,000 to more than 12,000.mapTrump had been strenuously lobbied by leaders in the Middle East not to go ahead with strikes that would be certain to lead to Iranian counterstrikes on US bases.Israeli and Arab officials had told the US administration in recent days that the Iranian regime was not yet weak enough for American strikes to topple it, NBCreported on Tuesday.From Wednesday afternoon and through the night, Israel braced for a possible Trump move against Iran. Israeli officials remained largely silent, conscious that any visible role could allow Tehran to portray the protest movement as foreign-backed. Benjamin Netanyahu is aware that Israeli intervention would risk discrediting protesters and give Iran’s leadership justification to escalate militarily against Israel.On Wednesday evening, according to reports citing Haaretz and the Washington Post, Israeli officials conveyed to Iran, via Russia, that Israel would not strike first if Iran did not, with Iran reportedly reciprocating this understanding.Protestunrest, however, casts uncertainty on the status of this informal understanding.According to the New York Times, after Trump’s remarks on Wednesday afternoon, the Pentagon was preparing to stand down forces and allow troops to return to base, with a senior US military official describing the president’s comments as “an off-ramp”. Long-range bombers in the US had been placed on alert for potential secondary strikes, the paper reported, but that posture was quietly paused by late afternoon.In recent weeks, Trump’s rhetoric and actions have swung sharply between threats of military strikes and sudden pauses, leaving analysts to debate whether this apparent unpredictability is strategic, chaotic or a blend of both.Some strategists argue that such signals are meant to deter further Iranian repression and potentially force Tehran toward concessions without an actual strike.Earlier, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told Fox News “there is no plan” by Iran to execute people in retaliation for the anti-government protests. “Hanging is out of the question,” he said.In a video posted on Wednesday by Tasnim, a news agency close to the Revolutionary Guards, the judiciary chief, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje’i, said: “If we want to do something, we have to do it quickly, do it at the right time.”Erfan Soltani, the first Iranian protester sentenced to death since the unrest began, was widely expected to be executed on Wednesday, but his family have since been toldit has been postponed.On Thursday, the Iranian judiciary said Soltani had “not been sentenced to death” and if he was convicted, “the punishment, according to the law, will be imprisonment, as the death penalty does not exist for such charges”.chartThe government’s internet blackout has entered its eighth day although calls can be made inside the country.Before Trump’s statement, Iran closed its airspace to almost all flights early on Thursday, and airlines, including Lufthansa, said their flights would avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice.Some personnel at a key US military base in Qatar were advised to evacuate, and the US embassy in Kuwait ordered its personnel to temporarily stop going to the numerous military bases in the small Gulf Arab country. The US embassy in Saudi Arabia also urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations. The UK said it was evacuating staff from Tehran.A senior Iranian official said Tehran had told regional countries hosting US bases, such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, that it would attack those targets in the event of a US strike. In June,Iran struck al-Udeid baseafter the US hit nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran, though the strike was telegraphed and largely symbolic.In his Fox News interview, Araghchi toned down the rhetoric, urging the US to find a solution through negotiation. Asked what he would say to Trump, Araghchi said: “My message is: between war and diplomacy, diplomacy is a better way, although we don’t have any positive experience from the United States. But still diplomacy is much better than war.”There is no sign of a backroom breakthrough in the issues that divide Washington and Tehran over its insistence on enriching uranium domestically and its stockpile of the product.Iran executed more than 1,500 prisoners last year and Amnesty International urged the international community to act decisively to bring its systematic human rights abuses to an end.The latest comments from Trump prompted a 3% drop in oil prices as concerns over possible disruption to global supplies lessened. Gold and silver also dipped on the news. Crude prices had surged in recent days as Trump talked about coming to the aid of Iranian protesters.In a Reuters interview on Wednesday night, Trump expressed uncertainty over whether the exiled opposition figure Reza Pahlavi would be able to muster enough support within Iran to challenge the regime. “He seems very nice, but I don’t know how he’d play within his own country,” Trump said. “And we really aren’t up to that point yet. I don’t know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me.”Early on Thursday, the UN security council scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss the protests at the request of the US.Foreign ministers from the G7 group said they were “prepared to impose additional restrictive measures” on Iran over its handling of the protests, and the “deliberate use of violence, the killing of protesters, arbitrary detention and intimidation tactics”.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

This wascrossed by Chennai in India in summer 2019and is now threatening Mashhad, Tabriz and Tehran, where taps in the city’s southern districts had already run dry by early December.Nightly “pressure cuts”, in which the water supply is halted to whole districts in the capital, have become the norm. Protesters demanding“Water, electricity, life – our basic right” over the summer were already risking a clampdown.According to the Middle East expert Juan Cole, the head of the regional water company reported in early November that the five main water supply dams to Tehran, the capital, were only 11% full, and criticised the government for its inaction.Tehran, home to 10 million people, has been threatened with the most drastic measure of all – evacuation. “If it does not rain in Tehran by December we should ration water; if it still does not rain, we must empty Tehran,”the country’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said back in November.View image in fullscreenThe Shah of Iran and the Islamic Republic have overseen the abandonment of Iran’s ancientqanatunderground aquifer system.Photograph: Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen the biggest demonstrations in Iran in years erupted a few weeks later, followed by abrutal government crackdown, the fundamental insecurity induced by a lack of water was a crucial – but under-reported – background to the upheavals that may yet topple the 47-year-old Islamic Republic itself.The immediate causes of the protestswere a combination of worsening government austerity and a dramatic currency crisis, the falling value of the rial pushing domestic inflation up even beyond the 40% it had reached earlier in the year. But that shock has to be understood as the final break after decades of cumulative failure.For Iran, the evidence strongly suggests that climate breakdown is the deep cause of its water shortages: average temperatures in its cities between 1990 and 2022 have risen about twice as fast as the global rate, according toresearch from Iran referenced by Cole.The impact of those rising temperatures has been amplified by the mismanagement of Iran’s water supplies, in a decades-long failure under successive governments that long predates the 1979 revolution.‘We must change’: how drought and overextraction of water has run Iran dryRead moreSpurred on by visions of national modernisation and self-reliance, both the Shah of Iran and the Islamic Republic have overseen the “abandonment” of Iran’s ancientqanataquifer system. Consisting of about 70,000 tunnels dug into hillsides across the country to access underground water, most of Iran’s 250,000 miles ofqanattunnels are about 2,500 years old – supplying its cities and agriculture with fresh water for millennia.Iran instead became one of the top three dam builders in the world over the second half of the 20th century.From 1962, under the shah,58 dams were constructed, holding around a quarter of the country’s total water resource, with the primary aim of increasing its agricultural output.But by putting major dams on rivers too small to sustain them, the authorities brought short-term relief at the cost of longer-term water loss: evaporation from reservoirs increased while upland areas were deprived of water, now trapped behind the dams. After the revolution, and the overthrow of the shah,the attempted shift to economic self-sufficiency saw efforts to maximise domestic water extraction, primarily through the increased use of groundwater pumps, with no serious attention paid to sustainability.There is a critical international dimension to the shortages. Long-delayed by the country’s insurgency, Afghanistan’s Taliban regime finally oversaw the completion of the Pashdan Dam on the Harirud River, where construction had originally begun in 2011. The Harirud flows from Afghanistan into eastern Iran, but the operation of the dam places the Taliban in control of 80% of the flow down the river, meaning they could decide the water supplies to major cities including Mashhad, Iran’s second largest.View image in fullscreenIranian women pray for rain in Tehran in November 2025.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesArmed clashes between Iran and Afghanistan broke out over access to the Helmand River in summer 2023, with casualties on both sides before a negotiated truce. The Harirud, unlike the Helmand, notionally governed by a 1973 treaty, has no formal agreement over water use in place, and rhetoric over access to it has ratcheted up over the past year and more as the dam approached completion.Meanwhile, Iran’s groundwater supplies have been squeezed almost dry over the past 40 years.More than 1m groundwater pumps have been installed, 90% for use by Iran’s agricultural sector, particularly when surface conditions have been arid. The ancientqanatsystem has been pumped dry, with most of the tunnels falling into disrepair –causing severe subsidencein Isfahan, a city that once relied on the tunnel system for its water. The result is a disastrous depletion of Iran’s slow-replenishing underground water supplies,with most pumped dryover the first two decades of this century.Faced with soaring inflation, costly sanctions, and the hefty costs of administering a complex system of “preferential exchange rate” subsidies for imported essentials, rising to $18bn over the last year, Iran’s rulers have attempted some familiar versions of “reform”, including dramatic spending cuts.It was pressure on government finances that pushed it to try to end the preferential exchange rate system in early December, along with concern the system had become thoroughly corrupt, with relatively few well-connected importers enjoying massive benefits that most consumers never saw. The intention was to replace this subsidy for importers by boosting the existing system of direct payments, which is almost a form of basic income, starting from March next year.View image in fullscreenThe Amir-Kabir dam running at low capacity. By putting major dams on rivers too small to sustain them, Iran’s authorities brought short-term relief at the cost of longer-term water loss.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPABut ending the preferential rates systemthreatened to raise the domestic prices of essentials, including food imports, further increasing inflation, which was already running at over 40%, and 72% for food.Inflation is one version of the chronic scarcity that is making daily life in Iran unbearable.Watershortages, where basic systems do not work and access to water becomes a privilege for those who can afford bottled supplies, is another.In a world without climate breakdown, Iran’s decades of water mismanagement may not have mattered quite so intensely. But coupled with the grinding impact of sanctions, the entire system has been tipped into what could be a terminal crisis.We should expect more such climate unrest. One study from scientists at Pusan National University, South Korea, published at the end of 2025,forecaststhat three-quarters of the world’s most drought-prone regions will be at risk of “day zero” by the end of the century, and a third of them will be hit before 2030. The failure of Iran’s water supplies is only the most dramatic example we have to date of how the climate crisis is threatening our most essential systems – and with them, political stability. It is unlikely to be the last.James Meadway is the host of the Macrodose podcast.Explore more on these topicsIranWaterDroughtClimate crisisMiddle East and north AfricaProtestanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Tory leader appointed the West Suffolk MP Nick Timothy as shadow justice secretary after Jenrick’s sacking.His dismissal appeared to have caught both him and Farage off-guard. The Reform leader called it the “latest Christmas present I’ve ever had” and said it was still “60/40” if Jenrick would defect until Badenoch forced his hand.However, Jenrick later admitted that he had already resolved to defect by the morning of his sacking, and that it would probably have happened in the coming days.Jenrick arrived on stage – after a lengthy and awkward delay – with a savage denunciation of his former party and its time in government. “What’s the truth? Both Labour and the Conservatives broke Britain. Both parties are committed to a set of ideas that have failed Britain,” he said.View image in fullscreenJenrick (left) with Nigel Farage and the Reform deputy leader, Richard Tice, in Westminster on Thursday.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockA senior Reform source said: “He’s the No 1 Tory we have all wanted to come over. He’s been a lone warrior in his party ever since Kemi won [the leadership].”Jenrick said discussions had started with Reform in September, understood to have been facilitated by the former Tory adviser Tim Montgomerie, who joined Farage’s party in December 2024. He also confirmed that he would not call a byelection in his Newark constituency.But Jenrick added that there had not been discussions about a defection, but about the state of the country.“Nothing has been offered, I’m proud to join and work with a set of people I have come to know over a very long time … who have built this party from nothing and I’m just here to play my part,” he said.Jenrick said that some around the shadow cabinet table had said behind closed doors they knew the UK was broken but could not admit it “because it was us who broke it”.He singled out the shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, and the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, for direct criticism. Stride, he said, was the work and pensions secretary who “oversaw the explosion of the welfare bill and blocked the reforms needed”.He said that Patel as home secretary had overseen the surge in legal migration.The former immigration minister admitted he had not intended to leave the Tories on Thursday but said he had resolved to leave soon.“I didn’t know I was going to leave today, but I had resolved to leave the party, and that was, as I said, something I had given a great deal of thought to over a very long time, and the fact that it’s happened a little bit sooner … so what?”Farage said that after the 7 May local elections there would be no more Tory defections, and Reform would reject more seeking to join. He said Jenrick was “in sackcloth and ashes” about decisions made during his time in the Tory government.Over the course of the next few weeks, Reform would begin to allocate jobs and responsibilities to key people, Farage said. Jenrick is understood to have discussed party’s economic policies with Farage, but any appointment as its economic spokesperson could cause tensions with the party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, and Zia Yusuf, the head of policy, who are also potential contenders.Farage said he knew the party had to have some experienced people if it was to enter government. “We need the experience, I think that’s absolutely vital.”Jenrick denied he was interested in becoming the leader of Reform. “No one joins Reform unless they believeNigel Farageis the best person to lead this country … that’s why I’ve put aside my personal ambition.”Both men brushed off their previous criticisms of each other, saying it was the way of politics, despite Farage having described Jenrick as a “fraud” who cannot be trusted as recently as last summer.Westminster sources said Badenoch had been monitoring Jenrick’s activities for some time because of suspicions he was working to undermine the party, and she believed his defection was imminent.It later emerged one of Jenrick’s own inner circle had discovered his draft resignation speech and sent it to the leader’s office, parts of which were released by the Conservative party on Thursday. One person from Jenrick’s wing of the party said they believed the MP had defected after realising he did not have enough support in the party to launch a challenge to Badenoch with guaranteed success after the May elections – especially with rising star Katie Lam building a support base.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch during a visit to Edinburgh on Thursday. ‘Robert Jenrick is not my problem any more. He’s Nigel Farage’s problem now,’ she said.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSpeaking to journalists on a visit to Edinburgh ahead of May’s Holyrood elections, where polls suggest the Scottish party will incur heavy losses at the hands of Reform, Badenoch denied this was “a very bad day”. She said defections to Reform were evidence that “a lot of people have gone into politics for the wrong reasons”.“People who go into politics because they think it’s a gravy train, or because they think it’s a way to get on TV, are finding out that the Conservative party is not the party for them,” she said.“And they’re going to the party that is for people like that. Robert Jenrick is not my problem any more. He’s Nigel Farage’s problem now.”The Tory leader said more details on the “irrefutable evidence” that prompted her to sack Jenrick on Thursday morning would come “in due course”.“Every time we have a press conference, we have announcements, we have ideas of how to improve the country,” Badenoch said. “When Reform has press conferences, it’s just: here’s another defection.”Badenoch told Sky News that Jenrick was planning to “torch the Conservative party by putting out comments and allegations that would have been very, very bad”.Shortly before the news broke on Thursday, Jenrick had posted on X: “It’s time for the truth.”Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickReform UKNigel FarageKemi BadenochConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s cruel but increasingly widespread.“We’re seeing ICBs curb patients’ access to ADHD assessment without telling GPs or patients that they are doing this, and without having made any assessment of the consequences.“The NHS should be ashamed of itself for such secrecy and hiding the fact that they are depriving people of this vital type of care.”Adults and children awaiting an ADHD assessment in many parts of Englandalready faced long delays– on average eight years – in getting an appointment. Limiting access to assessments will force affected people to wait even longer, Shelford said.The government’s ADHD taskforcewarned in a reportin November that people with ADHD who have not been assessed can be left struggling to work or attend school. The lack of support costs £17bn a year as a result of crime, educational underachievement, drug misuse, suicide and mental ill-health, it said.“People with suspected ADHD desperately need to have a full assessment as soon as possible so they can get treatment and get on with their lives,” Shelford said.“And family doctors need to know whether a patient on their waiting list, desperate to know if they have ADHD or not, is going to be assessed or not. If they don’t know what’s going on, how can they properly advise and care for their patients?”North Central London ICB confirmed in its FoI response to ADHD UK that it had introduced indicative activity plans (IAPs) – which cap the number of appointments it will pay for – for both ADHD and autism assessments.While it had undertaken an impact assessment, it had not drawn up any communications to either GPs or patients explaining the move. In all, 8,583 people across the five London boroughs it covers were waiting to be assessed for ADHD and 1,306 for autism at the time it responded last October.‘He tried so hard to get help’: the tragic results of NHS right-to-choose for ADHD patientsRead moreHowever, 10 ICBs said they had informed family doctors and affected patients.Other ICBs – regional NHS bodies – that have curbed access but not told GPs or patients include those in Kent and Medway, Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes.The Guardianrevealed on Mondaythat the NHS spending on ADHD services is over budget by £164m this year amid record demand for assessments.NHS England said people seeking an ADHD assessment could still join the waiting list, despite the widespread use of IAPs.A spokesperson said: “The claims that the payment scheme proposals are designed to restrict patient choice and access to ADHD services are incorrect, and GPs can continue to make referrals when it is clinically appropriate to do so.“As we work to put ADHD services on a more sustainable footing, these proposals are designed to the right to choose for patients, improve consistency and quality of care, and ultimately deliver fully funded and effective pathways for all patients across England.”The reasons behind the rise in recent years in diagnoses of ADHD, autism and mental illness will beexamined in a reviewordered last month by Wes Streeting, the health secretary.Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderNHSHealthGPsnewsShareReuse this content"

Addiction is a tricky business. What starts as fun inevitably, insidiously, tears away the soul. And there are signs that Nigel Farage’s press conference habit is getting out of control. He started off at one a week. Then his narcissistic need craved more and more attention. So he upped it to two or three a week. Each time the buzz got less. He was mainlining more and more just to try to stand still. To keep the withdrawals at bay. Still not enough. So on Thursday, Nige upped the dose to two inside a day. This can only end in a spell in rehab. Followed by meetings of PA. Pressers Anonymous.Boom. The best laid plans etc. Nige was just six minutes into his first press conference of the day – the unveiling of the latest Tory defector, the meg-rich Malcolm Offord, whose lifetime achievements amount to buying yachts, as the leader of Reform Scotland – when it all kicked off. Malc had just signed a card renouncing his peerage, when every journalist in the room started looking at their phones. There was breaking news. Kemi Badenoch had announced she was sackingRobert Jenrickfrom the shadow cabinet and the Tory party.Here was a story of our times. One that had it all. Treachery and stupidity. The Tory party at its very best. Kemi’s message was simple. “I never loved you anyway. I’m dumping you before you get the chance to dump me. So there.”She had irrefutable evidence that Honest Bob was planning to imminently defect in a way that would cause maximum damage to theConservatives. Well, hello, Kemi. What kept you so long? It was an open secret Jenrick had been on defection watch for months. The man who believed in nothing except his own dishonourable career – never forget Bob began life on the liberal wing of the Tory party before selling what passed for his soul to the populist right – had made no secret he had been in talks with Nige.The tipping point for Kemi turned out to be his resignation speech, which had apparently been found face up on his desk and handed over to Tory HQ. Imagine being so quarter-witted you leave evidence of your treachery in plain sight. Even when you know you are under suspicion. But then Honest Bob has always been one to keep his dealings in plain sight. As a junior housing minister, he had been happy to wave through a planning permission that saved the erstwhile Tory donor and pornographer turned property developer Richard Desmond £50m.That was effectively the end of Nige’s first press conference as planned. Poor old Malc. Yet again relegated to a walk-on part in his own life story. He would go as he had come. Largely forgotten. Instead of questions about the May elections, all anyone really wanted to know was whether Farage and Jenrick had made a deal. Was that the announcement Nige had intended to make at the later presser? If so, how had the deal been made? What promises had been made?It’s not often that Farage looks wrongfooted. He is a grifter who is used to winging it. But even he seemed rather taken aback. No, he hadn’t been planning to unveil Honest Bob in London later that day. The news had come as much of a shock to him as it had to everyone else. Yes, of course he had been having talks with him,but he’d been having talks with lots of Tories. But he always kept his conversations confidential. Up until the point when he chose to share them with a few friendly journalists.Soon, though, Nige could see the upside. The Tory party in complete disarray. Again. Where Honest Bob took the lead, other sheep may follow. Plus there was an upside to Jenrick’s sacking. Bob would have far fewer bargaining chips in the defection negotiations. Perhaps Nige wouldn’t have to offer him the job as chancellor after all. Time to sound as if he was playing hardball. “We don’t take every disaffected Tory,” he sniffed. Really? You tookZahawi. And any other number of deadbeats. Just imagine how useless you would need to be to get rejected. Take a bow, Liz Truss.An expulsion, a smirking leader and now a defection: it’s episode one, series one of the Farage/Jenrick show | Zoe WilliamsRead moreCue later that afternoon. The second press conference on the cancellation of local elections to be replaced by a third. Nige was in dreamland. Rushing on his run. The cold turkey tomorrow could look after itself. “Thank you, thank you Kemi,” he gushed. Before this morning he had been nowhere near to securing a deal with the man whom he had described less than five months ago as a liar and a fraud. But he has never been one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Honest Bob had been signed on a free transfer.It took Jenrick more than a minute to find his way into the room. Maybe he was having last-minute second thoughts. Or maybe he still hasn’t quite learned how to open a door. With a bit of assistance from his carer, Honest Bob made his way to the podium to give the speech that only he and the entire shadow cabinet had previously seen. One in which he would discover new lows even for him. Words as vomit.“Britain is horrible,” he said. Everything was as bad as it could be. It took him a while to realise that he had actually been part of the Tory government that had broken the country. This wasn’t about him. Gushing fake sincerity. It was about his patriotic duty. It turned out that what was in the national interest was also in Honest Bob’s self-interest. Uncanny that.A touch of self-laceration. Though not too much. Jenrick was more sinned against than sinner. He was ashamed of himself. Good. We’re all ashamed of you, too. There should never be another minister quite as bad as me, he continued. And that’s why he had to join Reform. To resist the temptation of being quite so hopeless as before. To save us all. He didn’t want to badmouth his former colleagues. But Mel Stride, Priti Patel and Kemi … Give him a break.Honest Bob fell to the floor. “I love you, I love you Nige,” he sobbed, clutching Farage by the leg. Nige patted him on the head affectionately. “The best people are often failures,” Farage observed kindly. It had been that kind of day. A meeting of two untrustworthy minds. Both with an eye on the main chance. Nige has got to keep feeding that habit.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickThe politics sketchReform UKConservativesNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

He was previously sacked as housing secretary by Boris Johnson not long after the government had to admit his decisionto grant planning consentto the Tory donor Richard Desmond was unlawful.One former Tory adviser from the right of the party said Farage would not be bothered by Jenrick’s political baggage as he had shown himself willing to accept such a long string of former Conservative MPs with mixed records.“Farage is as desperate for defections as a junkie for his fix – hence why he’ll take people like Jake [Berry], Nadine [Dorries] and Nadhim [Zahawi] – so this one will be sucked up willingly too,” he said.Farage himself appeared to rewrite history in relation to his previous criticism of Jenrick, saying the moment he knew the man could be trusted was his resignation from Sunak’s cabinet in 2024.“There is no question that Jenrick and I are on exactly the same page today, if not always in the past,” he said, claiming that members were prepared to forgive and forget Tories who have apologised.Speaking alongside him, Jenrick took 23 minutes of his speech before mentioning Farage or Reform, after taking aim at the incompetence of many of his former Tory colleagues.But he belatedly struck a note of newfound loyalty, saying he had put aside his personal ambition to be Tory leader and wanted Farage to be prime minister: “I am convinced Nigel and Reform will deliver the real change we need.”Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickReform UKNigel FarageConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

She and Musk are the parents of a son born in 2024.She is being represented by Carrie Goldberg, a victims’ rights lawyer who specialises in holding tech companies accountable and has previously represented women who were victims of sexual harassment and abuse.Goldberg told the Guardian: “xAI is not a reasonably safe product and is a public nuisance. Nobody has born the brunt more than Ashley St Clair. Ashley filed suit because Grok was harassing her by creating and distributing nonconsensual, abusive, and degrading images of her and publishing them onX.“This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm. We intend to hold Grok accountable and to help establish clear legal boundaries for the entire public’s benefit to prevent AI from being weaponised for abuse.”The filing alleges the social media company “retaliated against her, demonetising her X account and generating multitudes more images of her, including unlawful images of her in sex positions, covered in semen, virtually nude, and images of her as a child naked”.Images generated by Grok, according to the filing, include one of her as a 14-year-old stripped into a string bikini plus sexualised content of St Clair as an adult, including a request to “put the girl in a bikini made out of floss”.Not only were the images de facto nonconsensual, the filing states, but “Grok and xAI also had explicit knowledge that St Clair was not consenting to the creation or dissemination of these images because of her requests for removal”.Grok also responded to user requests to add tattoos on to St Clair’s body – including the words “Elon’s whore”, the filing said.St Clair, who is Jewish, alleges Grok digitally dressed her in a bikini decorated with swastikas.The lawsuit states that X “financially benefited from the creation and dissemination of nonconsensual, realistic, sexualised deepfake content depicting Plaintiff as a minor and adult”.The filing states that “xAI is directly liable for the harassment and explicit images created by its own chatbot, Grok”.Musk has posted on X that the users of his app are responsible for the images they create. He said recently: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”He added: “Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests.”X said on Thursday it had “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content”.The company has filed a countersuit claiming that according to the terms of service of X, St Clair cannot sue the company in New York but has to do so in Texas.St Clairpreviously told the Guardianthat she felt “horrified and violated”, adding: “It’s another tool of harassment. Consent is the whole issue.”Acolytes of Musk had disliked her since she went public about his desire to build a “legion” of children, she said. Musk is the father of13 other children, with three other women.X has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXAI (artificial intelligence)Elon MuskDeepfakeInternet safetyInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

He pointed to statistics showing that last year 32 peopledied in ICE custodyand 170 US citizens weredetained by ICE, before noting that Good was “shot in the head and killed by an ICE agent”.“How does that equate to them doing everything correctly?” he asked Leavitt.White House says it will decide which news outlets cover TrumpRead more“Why was Renee Good unfortunately and tragically killed?” Leavitt asked. Stanage asked whether Leavitt was asking him his opinion, to which she said: “Yeah.”“Because an ICE agent acted recklessly and killed her unjustifiably,” Stanage replied.Leavitt then shot back: “OK, so you’re a biased reporter with a leftwing opinion … Because you’re a leftwing hack. You’re not a reporter, posing in this room as a journalist. And it’s so clear by the premise of your question. And you and the people of the media who have such biases but fake like you’re a journalist, you shouldn’t even be sitting in that seat.”She went on: “But you’re pretending like you’re a journalist, but you’re a leftwing activist. And the question that you just raised and your answer proves you’re biased. You should be reporting on the facts. You should be reporting on the cases.”Leavitt told him he should be more focused on how many American citizens were killed by “illegal” immigrants.“I bet you didn’t even read up on those stories,” she said. “I bet you never even read about Laken Riley or Jocelyn Nungaray or all of the innocent Americans who were killed at the hand of illegal aliens in this country and the brave men and women of ICE are doing everything in their power to remove those heinous individuals and make our communities safer. And shame on people like you in the media who have a crooked view and have a biased view and pretend like you’re a real, honest journalist.”Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis during a federal immigration enforcement raid on 7 January. Her killing has sparked impassioned protests and condemnation across the country, as well as ongoing political debate over the basic facts of the incident, which wascaptured on video.Federal agent shoots man in Minneapolis as tensions in city run highRead moreTheTrump administrationhas staunchly defended the agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, claiming that he fired multiple shots at Good in self-defense as she tried to ram him and other officers with her car. The FBI has only just begun investigating the incident.Trump falsely said in aninterview with the New York Timesthat Good “ran him over”, while Noem accused Goodof “domestic terrorism”. JD Vancewrote on Xthat Ross was “defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over”. US officials have also alleged that Ross suffered internal bleeding when he was hit by her vehicle.However, video reconstruction of the eventby the New York Times seems toindicate that the car did not strike Ross and that Good was attempting to flee the area rather than run officers over.With thousands of federal immigration agents still in Minneapolis after Good’s killing, the city erupted in protests once again following the shooting of a man in the leg during an enforcement operation in a northern neighborhood on Wednesday, prompting Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, to call on Trump to “turn the temperature down”.In a statement, he asked the president to “stop this campaign of retribution” and urged demonstrating Minnesotans to “speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Minnesota ICE shootingnewsShareReuse this content"

He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind’s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.Norwegian company Equinor owns Empire Wind. Spokesperson David Schoetz said they welcomed the court’s decision and would continue to work in collaboration with authorities. It is the second developer to prevail in court against the administration this week.The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects on the east coast days before Christmas, citing national security concerns. Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House, most recently calling windfarms “losers” that lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.Developers and states sued seeking to block the order. Large, ocean-based windfarms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in east coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays.New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, applauded the court decision, telling reporters the projects had been “stopped under the bogus pretense of national security”.“When I heard this I said one thing: I’m the governor of New York, if there is a national security threat off the coast of New York, you need to tell me what it is. I want a briefing right now. Well, lo and behold, they had no answer,” she said.On Monday, a judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could resume its project to serve Rhode Island and Connecticut. Senior judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not sufficiently explain the need for a complete stop to construction. That windfarm, called Revolution Wind, is nearly complete. It is expected to meet roughly 20% of the electricity needs in Rhode Island, the smallest state, and about 5% of Connecticut’s electricity needs.Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York, with a hearing still to be set. DominionEnergyVirginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, plans to ask a judge on Friday to block the administration’s order so it can resume construction, too.Trump has also dismissed offshore wind developments as ugly, but the Empire project is about 14 miles (22.5km) offshore and the Sunrise project is about 30 miles offshore.The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind LLC, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, joined the rest of the developers in challenging the administration on Thursday. They filed a complaint in district court in Boston.In contrast to the halted action in the US, the global offshore wind market is growing, with China leading the world in new installations. Nearly all of the new electricity added to the grid in 2024 was renewable. The British government said on Wednesday it had secured a record 8.4 gigawatts of offshore wind in Europe’s largest offshore wind auction, enough clean electricity to power more than 12m homes.Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, said the Trump administration was right to stop construction on national security grounds. He urged officials to immediately appeal the adverse rulings and seek to halt all work pending appellate review. Opponents of offshore wind projects are particularly vocal and well-organized in New Jersey.Empire Wind is 60% complete and designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Equinor said the project was in jeopardy due to the limited availability of specialized vessels, as well as heavy financial losses.During a hearing on Wednesday, Judge Nichols said the government’s main security concern seemed to be over operation of the wind turbines, not construction, although the government pushed back on that contention.In presenting the government’s case, associate attorney general Stanley Woodward Jr was skeptical of the perfect storm of horrible events that Empire Wind said would derail their entire project if construction did not resume. He disagreed with the contention that the government’s main concern was over operation.“I don’t see how you can make this distinction,” Woodward said. He likened it to a nuclear project being built that presented a national security risk. The government would oppose it being built, and it turning on.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpEnergyRenewable energyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In his first week in office, New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani,announceda program offering free childcare to all of the city’s two-year-olds, alongside a program led by Governor Kathy Hochul to invest in offering universal childcare to all children under age five in the state by August of 2028.In November,New Mexico became the first state in the nationto offer free childcare to all its residents.While many cities calculate eligibility for benefits based on national federal poverty guidelines, San Francisco generally uses area median income to calculate the cost of living. In 2025, thefederal poverty levelnationwide was $32,150 for a family of four, while thearea median incomefor a family of four in San Francisco was $155,850.San Francisco’s measure will make childcare free for a family of four making less than $230,000 a year, or 150% of the area median income, and offer a 50% subsidy to families earning less than $310,000 a year, or 200% of the area median income. Previously, free childcare was available to families earning less than 110% of the area median income.The Children’s Council of San Franciscoestimatesthat the average cost of childcare in the city is between $20,000 and $30,000 per child each year. Andthe Economic Policy Instituteranks California fourth out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for most expensive infant care. According to the Institute, infant care for one child would take up more than 18% of a median family’s income in California; and care for two children could take up close to 30% of a family’s income.According to US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, childcare is only considered “affordable” if it takes upless than7%of a family’s income. Even for families earning six-figure salaries in the Bay Area, that goal is far out of reach. The mayor’s new childcare proposal brings that 7% just within reach, even for families earning what would be an extravagant salary elsewhere in the country.San Francisco will use unspent tax dollars collected after voters approved Proposition C, or “Baby Prop C”, in 2018, which was delayed by an ultimately unsuccessful court challenge. The unspent funds amount to more than $550m. Families will be able to access free or reduced-cost childcare from more than500 providerscitywide.“Affordable, high-quality childcare is essential for families to stay in San Francisco, but the cost can make it really challenging,” said Ingrid X Mezquita, the director of the city’s department of early childhood. “This is a big step toward making San Francisco a place where families can thrive.”Explore more on these topicsSan FranciscoCaliforniaUS healthcareWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

As the midterm elections approach, he has becomeconcerned about unemployment. Deeply imprinted memories of scarcity during the oil crises of the 1970s may prime his belief that cheap oil cures it all.The US president may also consider Venezuelan oil as an easy source of cash, either for the US government – to add to the tariff bonanza that he implausibly claims isbeing paid by foreigners– or for his own personal stash, which he may want to diversify away from crypto.My guess is he’s dreaming: dreams built fromUpton Sinclair talesof wildcatters striking it rich at the turn of the 20th century, mixed in with ingrained images fromthe Beverly Hillbillies, which debuted on CBS when Trump was 16, and visions ofgold-plated palaces, so common in the oil fiefdoms of the Middle East. A child’s lust for buried treasure.None of this makes any sense.The world is awash in oil, much of it fracked from shale in the US. Prices are at their lowest since 2021, when the global economy was recovering from the Covid pandemic. The US took out the president ofVenezuela, sitting atop the world’s largest oil reserves. Street protests raged across Iran, another large producer. The price of oil barely blipped.A line chart showing daily price of oilThe price of oil is so low, in fact, that pulling more of the sticky, heavy Venezuelan crude out of the ground in the Orinoco belt has become uneconomical.According to Wood MacKenzie, Brent crude would have to cost at least $80 a barrel to justify greenfield investment in Venezuelan wells. The last time it hit that number was a year ago. Over the last month it has hovered between $58.7 and $62.3.For all its vaunted oil reserves, without further major investment to restore its decrepit infrastructure, Venezuela can’t produce much oil. Last year it produced 880,000 barrels a day, 1% of world oil production. That amounts to only 4.3% of what the US pumped that year.Even if there was oil for Trump to snatch, getting hold of it will be no walk in the park.As notes Emily Meierding, of the Institute for Regional and International Security at the Naval Postgraduate Shool in California, “crude oil is not a quickly or easily lootable resource.”Trump promises oil companies ‘total safety’ in Venezuela as he urges them to invest billionsRead moreWhat oil company would invest billions in Venezuela based on a contract with Trump or the puppet regime put together in Caracas from the pieces left behind by PresidentNicolás Maduro? Chances are the contract would be abrogated once a new government took over. That’s if the facilities weren’t bombed first.This is probably why George W Bush didn’t seize Iraq’s oil resources for good during the US occupation of Iraq, but returned the oil infrastructure to the Iraqi government. It’s probably related to why the ExxonMobil CEO, Darren Woods, told Trump that Venezuela was, at the moment, “uninvestable”.The economic case for Venezuelan oil is even weaker, as theUS economyhas become gradually and consistently less dependent on it.Some economists posit that oil shocks have imposed, at worst, onlya modest dragon the economy. They argue that even the poor economy, from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, had little to do with the sharp increase in oil prices. In any event, the economy has become much less reliant on oil since then.The US produces aboutthree times as much GDPper unit of energy consumed than it did at the turn of the century, as the energy efficiency of industry has increased and, critically, industry’s share of the economy has shrunk asservices have grown dramatically in importance. Oil, moreover, plays a smaller role inthe US’s energy mix, accounting for 38% of energy use, down from 40% in the year 2000 and 50% in the mid 1970s.Gains in energy efficiency, alongside the increase in domestic oil production, have driven a two-decade decline in the country’s reliance on foreign oil.The US has a long history of meddling in other countries’ business tosecure access to oil. In 1953, American intelligence services had their hands all over the ouster of the prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, who had nationalized Iran’s oil reserves, to install Shah Reza Pahlavi in power.In 1957,President Dwight D Eisenhower askedCongress to offer economic and military support to any effort to prevent the Middle East from aligning on the Soviet side of the cold war. As oil prices soared during the war between Iran and Iraq, the Reagan administration pushed anational security directiveto increase the US military presence in the Gulf – facilities that came in handy whenGeorge HW Bushejected Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1990.Multinational oil companies have been swift to close in on oil assets on the heels of regime change. Western oil concernspiled into Russiaafter the demise of the Soviet Union. They rushed to bid onIraq’s oil assetsduring auctions in 2008 and 2009.Venezuela may seem to offer a similar opportunity. And yet, Iraq may prove to be a relevant precedent. By now western oil firmshave largely left– pushed away by production disruptions amid political turmoil, as well as payment arrears from the cash-strapped government.While Trump is sure there is treasure to be snatched under the Venezuelan soil, it’s probably safer, easier and cheaper for US companies to procure whatever oil the US economy needs at home.Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS economyVenezuelaDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Tourists from all over the world come to gawk at all the glitter, lace, ruffles and bows.Saks’s Fifth Avenue location, so iconic that it’s embedded in the brand’s name, is usually dressed top to bottom during the holidays. In 2023, the store partnered with Christian Dior to display a giant zodiac calendar. As part of the light show, fireworks were released from the top of the store to the oohs and aahs of spectators.But in 2024, the show went dark. Saks Fifth Avenue was without its extravagant lights throughout the holiday season, for the first time since the show debuted in 2004.Money was tight that year. The company had just announced a $2.7bn deal to acquire competitor Neiman Marcus. To fund the deal, Saks borrowed $2.2bn.It was a “challenging year for luxury”, Sakstoldthe New York Post at the time, but the company voiced optimism for the new year. After the acquisition, the newly created Saks Global company would oversee three luxury department store brands: Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.But just over a year after this new luxury behemoth was formed, Saks Global on Wednesday announced that it hadfiledfor chapter 11 bankruptcy, amid problems paying off its debts. While filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy doesn’t force a company into liquidation, it’s a major hit to a brand that was once among the most prestigious in retail.The bankruptcy appears to mark the latest in a string of once-quintessential American retail giants now struggling to pay their bills. Many companies that rely on bricks-and-mortar stores have struggled to compete with online retailers. Saks is no exception.But that’s just part of the story. The changing retail environment has shaken many companies, but some – even department stores – are learning to survive. Saks competitors Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom both reportedrevenue growthlast year.So what happened to Saks? To those who have been following the company over the last year, bankruptcy almost seemed inevitable. Not because of retail’s shifting reality – though that hasn’t helped the company – but because of a string of decisions made by company executives over the last few years.Saks is the third department store firm owned by former parent company Hudson’s Bay that has filed for bankruptcy. Hudson’s Bay spun off Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus into a separate company, Saks Global, in 2024.Hudson’s Bay acquired Lord & Taylor in 2006, and while the company held strong for years, it eventually sold the chain’s flagship Fifth Avenue store to WeWork, and the entire brand in 2019. The company closed its remaining stores in 2020.Last year, Hudson’s Bay – the Canadian department store that gave its namesake to its parent company – liquidated all of its stores after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing struggles to pay back its lenders and suppliers.Analysts agree that Saks made a huge bet buying Neiman Marcus, especially with $2.2bn of borrowed funds. “As soon as you put debt into the equation in this kind of environment, it just crunches your ability to operate,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData Retail.This is especially true for department stores that rely on relationships with vendors to stock their stores. With everything imaginable available online, the draw of a bricks-and-mortar store is the curated selection they can offer consumers.But after the Neiman Marcus deal, Saks Global struggled to pay back its vendors. In its bankruptcy petition, the company listed luxury firms including Chanel and Kering, owner of Gucci, as some of their creditors, with the company owing them tens of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices. In a recent note to investors, analysts at S&P Global said Saks had experienced “significant inventory challenges” over the last three years.Dwindling stock in stores hit on Saks’s bottom line last year. In the second quarter, the company’s revenue dropped 13%.Come the turn of the year, things started to look dire. Saks Global’s CEO, Marc Metrick, a longtime executive with nearly 30 years at the company, abruptly announced his departure. It emerged soon after that the company had missed a multimillion-dollar interest payment on its loans at the end of 2025.To some industry observers, that’s the catch. What may seem like a retail company on the surface is probably serving another purpose for company executives.“They certainly will talk about the intention to be a global retailer, but they also see a group that has very large real estate assets. It owns some of the properties that it trades from in very prime locations,” Saunders said. “And they will say, look, if we can’t make the retail bit work, does it really matter?”Saunders pointed to the longtime Sears CEO Eddie Lampert, who oversaw the liquidation of the company’s store while still maintaining control of its real estate holdings through a separate company, which he owned.“Their mindset is deal-making, it’s asset monetization,” said Saunders. “It’s not, hey, here are a couple of retail brands that we need to protect, cherish and grow.”When announcing its chapter 11 filing, Saks Global also said that its executive chair, Richard Baker, would step away from the company. Baker is also the longtime CEO of Hudson’s Bay, and of the leading real estate and investment company NRDC Equity Partners.It’s a sign Saks Global is planning to pivot back into its retail origins. Geoffroy van Raemdonck, Neiman Marcus CEO from 2018 to 2024, has taken Baker’s place.“Richard Baker is all about real estate,” said Shelley Kohan, a former Saks executive. “He’s not about retail. He’s never been a retailer.“For a high-end luxury company, you need a merchant running [the business] and a merchant that has a deep connection with a vendor community, that understands at the end of the day [that] a department store like Saks is all about product,” added Kohan, a professor of fashion business management at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “The merchandising and vendor relations makes it what it is for the consumer.”Baker, through Saks Global, did not respond to a request for comment.Experts point to Macy’s CEO, Tony Spring, as a retail leader who is considered a “merchant”. Under him, Bloomingdale’s – which is owned by Macy’s – has been expanding through stores with a smaller physical footprint than the typical multifloor department store, a strategy also taken on by competitor Nordstrom.“His view is, I want to grow it over time, and protect it,” Saunders said. “It’s a very, very different mindset [from Baker]. Neither of them are completely wrong, but they come from very different positions.”In its announcement on Wednesday, Saks Global said incoming CEO Van Raemdonck would be “appointing industry veterans and former Neiman Marcus Group leaders” to join him as Saks executives.Saks’s bankruptcy is not the end of the company, but a fork in the road for the luxury department store brand.“I think there’s a lot of opportunity for Saks to more consistently put their business decisions in the eyes of the customer,” Kohan said, adding that she’s a “firm believer” in physical retail: “The consumers are still out there.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And it originated from a longtime friend of the president who would go on to acquire business interests in the Danish territory.The businessman, Bolton learned, was Ronald Lauder. Heir to a makeup fortune – the global cosmetics brand Estée Lauder – he had known Trump, a fellow wealthy New Yorker, for more than 60 years.Bolton said he discussed theGreenland propositionwith Lauder. After the billionaire’s intervention, a White House team began to explore ways to increase US sway in the vast Arctic territory controlled by Denmark.Trump’s renewed pursuit of Lauder’s idea during his second term is typical of how the president operates, Bolton said. “Bits of information that he hears from friends, he takes them as truth and you can’t shake his opinion.”The proposal seems to have stirred Trump’s imperialist ambitions: eight years on, he is mulling not just buyingGreenlandbut perhaps taking it by force.Like many of those around the president, Lauder’s policy suggestions appear to intersect with his business interests. As Trump has ratcheted up his threats to seize Greenland, Lauder has acquired commercial holdings there. Lauder is also part of the consortium whose desire to access Ukrainian minerals appears to have spurred Trump to demand a share of the war-torn country’s resources.Lauder has said he met Trump in the 1960s when they went to the same prestigious business school. After working for the family cosmetics business, Lauder served under Ronald Reagan at the Pentagon, then as ambassador to Austria, before running unsuccessfully for mayor of New York in 1989.Quick GuideContact Tom Burgis about this storyShowIf you have something to share on this subject you can contact Tom  using one of the following methods.Email (not secure)If you don't need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email  tom.burgis@theguardian.com.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

When Trump’s sanity was questioned in 2018, Lauder called him “a man of incredible insight and intelligence”.That same year, Laudersaid he was assistingTrump with “some of the most complex diplomatic challenges imaginable”. This seems to have included sowing the idea of Arctic expansion. The following year, the Wall Street JournalrevealedTrump’s interest in Greenland. Denmark’s rulers expressed outrage. Trump responded by tweeting animageof a golden Trump Tower looming over a village, beside the caption: “I promise not to do this to Greenland!”I promise not to do this to Greenland!pic.twitter.com/03DdyVU6HA— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)August 20, 2019‘A treasure trove of rare-earth elements’View image in fullscreen‘Trump’s Greenland concept was never absurd – it was strategic,’ Lauder wrote.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesTrump’s fixation with Greenland endured, as did Lauder’s. Last February, shortly after Trump returned to the White House, Lauder leapt to his defence when the president publicly contemplated a military takeover of the world’s largest island.“Trump’s Greenland concept was never absurd – it was strategic,” Lauderwrotein the New York Post. He went on: “Beneath its ice and rock lies a treasure trove of rare-earth elements essential for AI, advanced weaponry and modern technology. As ice recedes, new maritime routes are emerging, reshaping global trade and security.”With Greenland at “the epicentre of great-power competition”, Lauder argued, the US should seek a “strategic partnership”. He added: “I have worked closely with Greenland’s business and government leaders for years to develop strategic investments there.”Since Lauder steered Trump’s attention to Greenland in 2018, as firstreportedby the US journalists Peter Baker and Susan Glasser in their book The Divider, the cosmetics billionaire seems to have ploughed lots of his own money into the Arctic territory.Danish corporate records show that a company with a New York address and unnamed owners has in recent months bought into Greenland.One of its ventures is exporting “luxury” springwater from an island in Baffin Bay. When aDanish newspaperreported in December that Lauder was among the investors, it quoted a Greenlandic businessman involved in the endeavour. “Lauder and his colleagues in the investor group have a very good understanding of and access to the luxury market,” he said.This group of investors is also reportedly seeking to generate hydroelectric power from Greenland’s biggest lake for an aluminium smelter.It is unclear what effect a US takeover of Greenland – by invasion, purchase or persuasion – might have on Lauder’s commercial interests there.Following Trump’s comments – in the aftermath of sending troops to capture the ruler of Venezuela – that the US needed Greenland “very badly”, Denmark’s prime ministerwarnedthat military action by one Nato member against another would break the alliance.Trump appears unmoved. “We’re going to be doing something with Greenland,” he said last week, “either the nice way or the more difficult way.” After a White House meeting on Wednesday, the Danish foreign minster, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said: “We didn’t manage to change the American position. It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering Greenland.”A deal to exploit Ukraine’s mineralsView image in fullscreenDonald Trump in a heated exchange with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February 2025.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockLauder’s apparent involvement in shaping US policy adds to mounting questions about conflicts of interest during Trump’s second term and the apparent self-enrichment of those close to the president. Trump’s two elder sons, Don Jr and Eric, have been on a globalmoneymaking campaignfrom Vietnam toGibraltar.They insist there is a “huge wall” between their business activities and their father’s position as the most powerful man alive. Trump’s spokesperson has said: “Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.” But foreign rulers have facilitated the enrichment of the first family, while sometimes seemingly securing the president’s favour.Lauder, though, appeared for a time to havebrokenwith his old friend.In 2022, while he was out of office, Trump hosted the far-right agitator Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago club. Lauder, who heads the World Jewish Congress, joined the condemnation. “Nick Fuentes is a virulent antisemite and Holocaust denier plain and simple,” hesaid. “It is inconceivable that anyone would associate with him.”But once Trump regained the White House, Lauder resumed financial support. In March 2025 he gave $5m to Maga Inc, afundraising operationfor Trump’s movement. The following month, Lauder was reportedly among the guests at an exclusivecandlelit dinnerwith the president. Tickets were $1m each, payable to Maga Inc.By then, Lauder’s business interests once again appeared to be overlapping withTrump administrationpolicy.A leaked November 2023lettersent by the head of TechMet, a mining company, to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, named Lauder as part of a consortium hoping to exploit a lithium deposit in the war-torn country.Lauder said at the time that he had not discussed Ukrainian minerals with Trump himself but had “raised the issue with stakeholders in the US andUkrainefor many years up to the present day”. Leading Republicans joined a campaign for the US to gain a hold on Ukraine’s prodigious resources. Trump became its loudest proponent.Weeks after Lauder’s Maga Inc donations, Washington and Kyiv signed a deal to jointly exploit Ukraine’s minerals. It went some way to preserving Trump’s support for Ukraine following his televised Oval Office tirade against Zelenskyy for what he deemed insufficient gratitude for US backing.The lithium deposit was the first to be tendered under the minerals deal. This month, the Lauder consortium reportedlywon it. TechMet, the company leading the consortium, declined to comment, as did Lauder. His Greenland business partners and the White House did not respond when contacted by the Guardian.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsGreenlandUS foreign policyUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

We’re not telling anyone how they should behave, what they should believe in, where they should donate their money, absolutely not.“But imagine you’re a baker who works at this company, and you’re witnessing videos that are coming out of Gaza that are really difficult to bear, and then your boss tells you that you’re going to be making a new specialty bread item that’s sold special and discounted as a fundraiser for a country that’s doing a genocide.“We’re just asking that workers have the decision about whether or not they can make those.”Breads Bakery uses profits to “materially support the Israeli occupation” of Gaza, the union claimed. The bakery chain hassix locationsin Manhattan, and was co-founded by Danish–Israeli baker Uri Scheft.The bakery has hired union avoidance consultants, according to the worker, who claimed they had been meeting one-on-one with staff in office meetings, in a effort to deter support for the union.“My location makes around $15,000 to $20,000 a day on average. We’re a bread bakery. We sell a lot of bread. We have several shelves of bread,” the worker said. “And for almost around a year now, we have not been able to use equipment that we really need to function.“Our three demands are for equitable pay, respect, and safety for workers. I joined this unionization effort, because after long enough at Breads, I started noticing these sort of patterns. We have a very high turnover rate. Most people are only there, on average, maybe around three or four months, and I really think a lot of that can be attributed to the disrespect that is shown to workers by management.”The union is calling for pay increases across the board; holiday and busy season pay, including Jewish holidays; overtime pay; automatic raises over a set period of time; premium pay for late-shift and overnight work; replacement of broken equipment; proper uniforms for workers doing outdoor work; guaranteed hours every week; a free meal each shift; and at least three days’ notice of each shift schedule.A spokesperson for Breads Bakery did not comment on the hiring of union avoidance consultants, or the criticism of the bakery supporting Israeli fundraisers.“Breads Bakery is built on love and genuine care for our team,” the spokesperson said. “We celebrate peace and embrace people of all cultures and beliefs. We’ve always been a workplace where people of all backgrounds and viewpoints can come together around a common purpose, sharing in the joy and love of a bakery, and we find it troubling that divisive political issues are being introduced into our workplace.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessShareReuse this content"

The action is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places such as Taiwan.“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains,” the proclamation said, adding that the reliance was a “significant economic and national ‌security risk”.The White House said in a fact sheet that the tariffs would be narrowly focused and would not apply ​to chips and derivative devices imported for US datacenters – a huge consumer of AI chips – startups, non-datacenter consumer applications, non-datacenter civil industrial applications and US public sector applications.Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, has broad discretion to apply further exemptions, according to the proclamation.Shares ofNvidia, AMD and Qualcomm traded slightly lower in after-hours trading.Trump ‍in December said he would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports over Beijing’s “unreasonable” pursuit of chip industry dominance, but delayed the action until June 2027.That move followed a year-long “Section 301”unfair trade practices investigationinto China’s exports of “legacy”, or older-technology chips to the US, launched by former president Joe Biden’s administration.Questions had swirled about the universe of products containing chips that would be ⁠hit by the tariffs, the tariff rates, and whether any countries, products or companies would be exempt. Wednesday’s announcement, coupled with the news from December, suggests a ‍light touch from the administration on chip imports, for now.Trump last year announcedhe would allow Nvidia to sell H200 chipsto China in exchange for a cut of the sales of ‌those chips.Legal ‌experts questionedwhether such an arrangement would violate the US constitution’s ban on taxing exports.The Trump administrationthis week requiredthat China-bound chips make a detour from Taiwan, where they are made, through the United States for testing by a third-party lab. When the chips enter the United States, they are subject to the 25% tariff announced on Wednesday.Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We comply with all US export control laws and policies,” AMD said in a statement.Trump has deployed an ⁠array of tariffs aimed at bolstering ⁠US manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping ​new import tariffs, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm.In April, theTrump administrationannounced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of an effort to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.While US companies ‍like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips, most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Semiconductor Industry Association also could not immediately be reached.Trump, in the near future, may also impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products to incentivize domestic manufacturing, according ​to the fact sheet.An annex to the order clarifies that any 25% tariff imposed on semiconductors ‍under the order would not be stacked on top of the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under other section 232 orders. They would be exempt from duties on copper, aluminum and steel, auto ​and truck parts.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAI (artificial intelligence)TariffsComputingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The better-than-expected data will be good news for the chancellor, who hopes an economic turnaround will help Labour’s fortunes.Economic output earlier in 2025 was hit by thecyber-attack on the carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which depressed vehicle production. The company’s recovery appears to have contributed to November’s growth, with a 25.5% improvement in motor vehicle manufacture during the month.The services sector grew by 0.3% in November, while production grew by 1.1%, the ONS said. However, construction fell by 1.3%, underlining fears that the government’s hoped-for building boom is failing to materialise.Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said the data suggested the economy had “found its footing” in November.“Despite the uncertainty ahead of the budget, economic activity accelerated in November. With the worst of the uncertainty behind businesses, we expect growth momentum to continue over the coming months,” she said, adding that there were “tentative signs of a pick-up in household spending”.Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the data pointed to growth of 1.4% for 2025 as a whole – stronger than the previous year.Ben Caswell, a senior economist at NIESR, said: “Against this backdrop, the chancellor more than doubled her fiscal headroom at the budget in an effort to bolster economic confidence. While it is too early to see the full effect of this, the move appears to have eased speculation over future tax policy and the uncertainty that came with it.”The UK’s borrowing costsdropped to their lowest level in more than a year on Wednesdayamid hopes of more interest rate cuts from the Bank of England.The ONS said that over the three months to November – a period it said gave a better snapshot of the economy’s health – gross domestic product grew by 0.1%, dampened by the JLR shutdown.The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said: “This morning’s news that growth is flat-lining is more evidence of Labour’s economic mismanagement. Because Labour made the wrong choices, their budget is unravelling day by day.“Despite Labour’s U-turns on the family farms tax and business rates, their budget will still leave working people worse off and our economy weaker, with higher taxes stifling growth and fuelling inflation.”Further evidence on the state of the economy will come in the next week, with inflation and unemployment data due to be released. Reeves is keen to see more rate cuts as part of the government’s drive to cut the cost of living.Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: “This return to growth probably won’t trigger a sustained economic revival with softer consumer spending amid an intensifying tax burden and higher unemployment likely to mean noticeably weaker growth for 2026, despite a boost from lower inflation.“These figures make a February interest rate cut less likely by giving those rate-setters still concerned over inflation with sufficient comfort over economic conditions to delay voting to ease policy again.”The chancellor delivered her secondtax-raising budgeton 25 November, after a febrile period of speculation. The flurry of on-off tax rumours was blamed by business groups for deterring investment and consumer spending.In a hint that the unusual level of speculation in the run-up to Reeves budget may have been good business for some, the ONS said the largest contribution to service sector growth came from “professional, scientific and technical activities” – noting in particular strong growth in accounting, bookkeeping, auditing and tax consultancy.Reeves is expected toannounce additional supportfor the hospitality industry in the coming days after a backlash over changes to the business rates regime.Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsRachel ReevesJaguar Land RovernewsShareReuse this content"

He had a little stall at Kinshasa Central Market in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Decades later, the 57-year-old entrepreneur is redeveloping the historic marketplace that gave him his start in business to be an award-winning city landmark.Bakarani hopes to see the market, known as Zando, flourish again and reopen in February after a five-year hiatus. The design has already been recognised internationally; in December, the architects responsible for it won aHolcim Foundation award for sustainable design.“I started out getting vegetables from Goma and selling them in this market. I never expected to be the one rebuilding it decades later,” says Bakarani.“We have built a market with local people, especially our mothers and sisters, in mind. We have kept the concept of the old one but have enlarged it, and it is more functional.”It was a nightmare … imagine what it was like for our mothers or sisters selling there exposed to the sun from morning till eveningDieudonné BakaraniInaugurated in January 1944 under Belgian colonial rule, Zando was demolished and rebuilt in 1968, with space for 3,500 traders. By the time it was closed in January 2021, it was attractingabout a million shoppers a dayand there were issues around safety, overcrowding, sanitation and waste disposal.View image in fullscreenKinshasa Central Market after reconstruction in 1968.Photograph: Cavan Images/AlamyThe closure affected approximately 20,000 vendors, who were relocated to surrounding markets, sparkingprotests in front of city hall.“It was in a very bad state,” says Bakarani. “It wasn’t clean; it was overcrowded. There were nine toilets for the whole market.”View image in fullscreenPolice try to stop market traders from marching in January 2021 after it was announced the market would close.Photograph: Arsene Mpiana/AFP/Getty ImagesThe market produced up to nine tonnes of waste a day, often amid searing temperatures.“It was a nightmare working there during the day,” says Bakarani. “It was extremely hot. You can only imagine what it was like for our mothers or sisters selling there, exposed to the sun from morning till evening.”The new market feels like it has air conditioning, he says, as it was built with perforated brick facades to ensure ventilation and shade.“We really wanted to keep the quality and characteristics of the African market,” says Marine de la Guerrande, part of the team from Think TankArchitecturePaysage Urbanisme, the Paris-based practice behind the market’s redesign. “The market has been built with concrete and locally produced terracotta bricks, supporting regional craftsmanship and economies.”Spread across 92,000 sq metres (23 acres), the new market will house 10,000 stalls, 630 shops, 40 cold rooms, 272 toilets and 22 units for banks. There are two food courts, a fire station, CCTV, high-speed wifi and TV screens for advertising.View image in fullscreenThe new market will feature rainwater harvesting and landscaped courtyards.Photograph: Ville Kinshasa & SZTC/Think Tank ArchitectureThe building will be accessible, while rainwater harvesting and landscaped courtyards with trees aim to boost biodiversity, improve fire safety and promote cleanliness.So many solutions we get are always western imports because our education tells us this is the only way things can be doneTosin OshinowoTosin Oshinowo, a Nigerian architect and judge for the Holcim Foundation awards, says the design is fascinating because it has recreated a traditional African market, and the way of life that goes with it, but modernised it.“So many solutions we get on the continent are always western imports because our education also tells us that this is the only way things can be done,” she says.Markets are vital across the continent, she says. “Most people in Africa today will still go to the market because it’s cheaper but it’s also [interwoven into culture],” says Oshinowo. “What you have across the continent is a very specific way of trading … So these markets – economically, socially and politically – are very sustainable.”The project has been made possible by a public-private partnership between city authorities and Bakarani’s company, Sogema(Société de gestion des marchés Africains). With French architects, construction was outsourced to the Chinese company SZTC, overseen by the French engineering firm Egis.View image in fullscreenConstructed from concrete and local terracotta bricks, the market’s design has been recognised internationally.Photograph: Martin Argyroglo/Think Tank ArchitectureThe development has cost about £56m and was financed by a loan from SofiBanque, based in the DRC. The operating contract grants Sogema control of the market for 25 years, after which the government will take over.Bakarani says he faced accusations of corruption, and criticism, when people feared the design would be like a western shopping centre and not in keeping with local culture.In May 2024, a report bytwo DRCanti-corruption organisations, the Public Expenditure Observatory (Odep) and the Congolese League Against Corruption (Licoco), said there wereinconsistencies in the contractthat “stem, on the one hand, from the incompetence of public authorities … and on the other hand, from a lack of transparency justified by the culture of corruption and easy enrichment that has taken root in the mindset of the Congolese political class”. Provincial authorities havedefended the deal.“I’m not saying there won’t be problems in the future. But at least the infrastructure is there,” says Bakarani, who denies the allegations of corruption.Last throw of the boule for Addis Ababa’s historic pétanque club as developers turn city into hi-tech hubRead moreBakarani hopes the market will be a blueprint for similar projects across the continent. “It has been built [to the highest standards], recognised internationally,” he says. “We’ve respected the environment and improved what was there.”He also hopes the new market will help change the country’s image. Referring tolong-running armed conflictswith rebels, especially the Rwandan-backed M23, which have displaced huge numbers of people and fuelled human rights abuses, he says: “I hope we can attract international partners to come and see that in DRC, regardless ofthe situation in the east, which I am not underestimating in any way, there are opportunities that can be explored.“People are still dreaming here and as entrepreneurs, we are driven. It’s not that we are not sensitive to what is happening, but it’s our country. It’s our duty to build it.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentArchitectureDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaSustainable developmentCities and developmentSanitationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump? How the game can stand strong in a fractured worldThe 2026 World Cup is set to be a polarising event but, even if it will not be the first to be politically contentious, it will expose a growing uneasePaul MacInnesThu 15 Jan 2026 14.56 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareFive months out from the World Cup the politics are impossible to avoid. There are concerns relating to one of the host countries, the US, with armed immigration officials roaming through its cities and visa restrictionsstepped up against foreign visitors. One qualifying nation, Iran, is experiencing a public uprising against its leadership, with the regime attacking its citizens in response. Among other qualifiers there are concerns over democratic backsliding in Tunisia, ecological crimes in Ecuador and , in the future host country Saudi Arabia. And that’s just for starters.It sometimes feels as if this summer’s tournament, the one Gianni Infantino recently described as “the greatest show ever on planet Earth”, will serve as an inescapable reminder of the depressing state of the world in 2026. It could yet be an event that goes down in infamy. But it is hardly the only tournament to have prompted ethical concerns and serves as a reminder that the issue of how global sport should engage with such issues has remained largely unresolved.In 1978, theWorld Cupwas held in Argentina, which two years earlier had been taken over by a military dictatorship. It prompted a response from Amnesty International, which ran what is understood to be the organisation’s first campaign focused on a major sporting event. Under a slogan devised by its West German branch, Amnesty made an appeal for “Fussball ja – Folter nein” or “Football yes – torture no”. The campaign played a part in generating a debate over the ethics of participation in the tournament and West Germany’s Paul Breitner refused to play. The final ended with the dictator, Jorge Videla, handing the World Cup trophy to Argentina’s captain Daniel Passarella.View image in fullscreenA demonstration in Paris in May 1978 against Argentina’s hosting of the World Cup.Photograph: Michel Clement/AFP/Getty Images“It wasn’t a push to boycott the World Cup,” says Steve Cockburn, Amnesty’s head of sports and human rights, of the Argentina campaign. “It was a push to raise the issues with some very specific demands.” These demands related to gaining access to prisons and transparency about those who had been arrested or disappeared, but Amnesty also made demands of other countries to place greater diplomatic pressure on Argentina. “It would have been opportunistic in the sense of trying to generate attention and make change on issues in Argentina, using the World Cup as a hook,” Cockburn says. “My guess is that this was also coinciding with a time when the World Cup was reaching more and more people via television.”View image in fullscreenThe Argentina president, Jorge Videla, after the hosts’ victory over the Netherlands in the final.Photograph: Mirrorpix/AlamyWhat it didn’t do was make demands ofFifa. “We didn’t necessarily frame this as arguing that a sports body like Fifa has a particular human rights responsibility legally in the way that we do now,” Cockburn says. That changed much later, after the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the events of 2010, when Fifa awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar amid accusations of corruption and human rights neglect. This period, says Cockburn, coincided “with a broader movement in the human rights sector which was about trying to define the responsibilities of organisations. You had the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, which Fifa adopted [in 2016]. That led to an acceptance within sports bodies that they have human rights responsibilities, I think partly as a result of pressure, but also out of a desire to protect their autonomy and avoid regulation.”In the years since, Fifa has protected its autonomy, grown its influence and found itself increasingly the focus for criticism over human rights. Campaigns to influence Fifa’s behaviour in Qatar, or to prevent it handing the World Cup to Saudi Arabia, or for it to suspend Israel from its competitions have not been successful. Fifa is accused of neglecting its direct responsibilities but also of failing to stand up for values that many believe should be intrinsic to the sport. Fifa’s statutes, however, remain clear: “Fifa remains neutral in matters of politics and religion.”As the world’s most popular sport, “football will always have very significant social, cultural, political and economic significance”, says Nick McGeehan, co-director ofFairSquare, which works to achieve “systemic change” in the relation between sport and human rights. “So rather than repeating the nonsense about keeping sport and politics separate we need to recognise its power and look to use that power appropriately and effectively,” he says. “A big problem that we have is that neither Fifa nor the IOC [International Olympic Committee] – to take the two biggest and most influential organisations – have any rules on how to deal with serious geopolitical developments.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi is dressed in a Qatari bisht by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, at the 2022 World Cup medal presentation.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe biggest political intervention by sporting bodies in recent years highlights this point. A decision toban Russia from international footballwas made jointly by Fifa and Uefa after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It came about after political pressure, including from the UK government, but Fifa justified the ban on sporting grounds. It claimed that the threat of boycott by European teams scheduled to play Russia had endangered Fifa’s obligation to “guarantee the smooth running of its flagship competition”. It was, Fifa said, “imperative that this calendar is not disrupted” and so action had to be taken.Dr Antoine Duval is a researcher at the Asser International Sports Law Centre in the Netherlands. He is scathing of the past 15 years of avowed commitment to human rights. “I would say this entire sequence has been rather a lesson in pessimism,” he says. “China didn’t become more democratic after the Olympics, it became more autocratic. Russia became even more aggressive as a state after the two mega sporting events [the World Cup and Winter Olympics in Sochi]. Qatar didn’t really reform kafala,didn’t really improve the life of migrant workers, didn’t really became a democracy because of the 2022 World Cup.”He is also, however, understanding of the approach by Fifa and the IOC to ensure any decisions are grounded in their rulebooks. It may be possible, Duval says, to create a system whereby Fifa or the IOC would act as an “arbiter of compliance” for international law, expected to take action against countries that are the subject of adverse rulings by the International Court of Justice or resolutions by the UN General Assembly, for example. But it would come with real risks. “Proper, in-depth reform is difficult to trigger,” he says. “You need to have proper rules in place to determine which country is to be excluded and which is not. If not, you risk ending up having, in practice, double standards.”Duval says a more useful focus could be on ensuring governing bodies enforce the rules they have. “My own impression is that we should not overplay the capacity of Fifa or the international Olympic movement to actually achieve democratisation or spread human rights,” he says. “We should be prudent in what we hope to achieve.” Instead Duval believes the best thing to be hoped is that the Olympics and World Cup fulfil the expectation billions of people around the world place on them: namely that they showcase the best in human endeavour. And that this should extend to the conditions in which the tournament is played out.View image in fullscreenChina’s hosting of the 2008 Olympics drew protests such as this in Brussels, over its treatment of Tibet.Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters“You can see the World Cup or Olympics as a circus that comes to a country every four years,” Duval says. “My suggestion would be to consider it not only a circus that is about the commercial interest of Fifa and the IOC and the security of those events, but also that those events are moments where we ensure radical non-discrimination. Where the rights of people exceed those within the host country, where we ensure free expression and that the fundamental rights of those that participate are fully protected in that particular space.”Duval admits that the power of a World Cup such as the one described above would be largely symbolic, but it would at least be a symbol that inspires hope. Until then many football fans, some perhaps still pondering whether to travel to the World Cup this summer, or whether they will be allowed in, will still be experiencing something of a disconnect. “It feels like people want sport to be this beautiful escape from everything else but it’s just as affected by power struggles and human failings as any other industry,” Cockburn says. “There’s a mismatch between what you’re seeing and what’s happening around it in terms of power, politics, business, abuse. There’s probably a better word for it, but to me it’s jarring.”Explore more on these topicsFootballFootball politicsWorld CupWorld Cup 2026FifaUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they also have weaknesses that could send them crashing out of the postseasonOliver ConnollyThu 15 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 05.01 ESTShareBuffalo Bills: Run defenseDefending the run has long been a sore spot for the Bills – they finished the season 25th in defensive rush success rate. Inside, they lack mass, and are too easily pushed around by teams committed to a smashmouth approach. Outside, they struggle with discipline and technique.Against Jacksonville last weekend, both fell apart. The Jaguars rushed for 154 yards, with 119 of those yards coming on outside runs. It was the Jags’ highest total on outside runs this season. This weekend, against a Broncos offense that is happy to punch anyone in the mouth, that could put the Bills in a lot of trouble.But Sean McDermott is a defensive mastermind. And his answer to the run game woes has been, effectively, to give up. McDermott has stopped trying to load the box or reinforce the front. He is happy, it seems, to concede steady yards on the ground if the Bills do not cough up an explosive run (10-plus yards). And by not adding extra bodies to the box, he’s been able to maintain schematic flexibility in the secondary. McDermott has now centered his defense around disguises on the back-end secondary, betting that, eventually, opposing offenses will want to throw the ball even on run-obvious downs. Blurring the coverage, without superstar talent, is the best way for a coach to induce mistakes.McDermott put on a clinic against the Jaguars, baiting Trevor Lawrence into errant throws that forced Jacksonville off the field. Sticking with that plan moving forward is the Bills’ best way out of the mess.Brilliant, battered and unkillable: Josh Allen lurches towards the Super BowlRead moreChicago Bears: Creating pressureThe Bears are living a charmed life on offense. They have a water-tight scheme. They hammer people with the run. And with Caleb Williams, they have a quarterback capable of creating something out of nothing.Defensively, however, they are more limited. They have lived on turnovers this season, leading the league in takeaways. In the playoffs, that doesn’t cut it. You’re facing the best of the best – and they’re the best precisely because theydon’tturn the ball over. All season long, Chicago have worked around their lack of a pass rush. They finished last in the league in the regular season in pressure rate with a four-man rush (a necessity in the playoffs) and in time to pressure from those four-man looks. Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen, a true warlock of a coach, has counteracted that by going hog-wild with blitzes. He has pressured creatively and relentlessly. But coaching can only cover up so much. Even the Bears’ blitz package has been ineffective, generating pressure at the lowest rate among the remaining playoff field.Some coaches blitz selectively, and that’s key in the playoffs when the best quarterbacks can pick apart defenses that send extra rushers. No quarterback has been as potent against the blitz this year as the Rams Matthew Stafford, who the Bears faces this weekend. Allen hasn’t been able to be selective. He needsto fire extra bodies into the line of scrimmage to make the quarterback uncomfortable. Against the Rams, he’ll likely roll the dice again, hoping thatenoughpressure gets home that Stafford panics or is moved off his spot, where he is less effective. From there, the Bears will have a chance to snag the turnovers that have kept their head above water all season. It will be a gamble, but it’s Allen’s only path forward.View image in fullscreenBo Nix’s Broncos are No 1 seeds in the AFC.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APDenver Broncos: Bo NixNix is the great unanswered question of the playoffs. Is he a needle mover at quarterback? Or is he surviving in a solid scheme, supported by an outstanding defense?Everything else is in place for the Broncos. They have the best offensive line in the postseason, the top pass-rush and a future Hall of Fame coach. They also have enough firepower at wide receiver to go toe-to-toe with anyone in the AFC, from the reliable Courtland Sutton to the explosive threats of Troy Franklin, Pat Bryant and Marvin Mims. Even with that cast, at some point Nix will need to make big throws on third-and-long.Nix has already debunked many ideas about his game. He isn’t a game manager; he takes risks down the field. He isn’t a point guard; he can scramble around and extend plays. According to PFF, he ranked behind only Stafford and Dak Prescott in big-time throws this season. Where Nix has struggled is taking the easy openings and moving on with the game. But he has been able to offset some poor decision-making by avoiding sacks and turnovers. The Broncos won’t ask him to be anything else during the playoffs. And if he can hit those difficult third-and-longs, he could put together the kind of playoff hot streak we’ve seen from Joe Flacco and Nick Foles.Houston Texans: Passing gameThe Texans’ performanceagainst the Steelers on Mondaywas an outlier. They were able to run the ball and sustain a long drive. For much of the season, they’ve been reliant on a brittle passing game and the odd explosive play to launch them down the field. Even when in scoring position, their performance in the redzone has been brutal.It was Houston’s defense that kept them alive against Pittsburgh. Without a dominant performance, it would have been a game characterized by CJ Stroud’s unusual mid-game meltdown. The Texans cannot afford a repeat performance from their quarterback. Given the lack of talent along the offensive line, they’re unlikely to repeat their success on the ground. It will need to be Stroud who puts them over the top. He has the talent – and he’s done it in the postseason before. The problem, however, is that the passing game has been inconsistent. The Texans have to workhardfor their yards. There are few easy buckets. It’s a system reliant on receivers making tough, contested catches or Stroud creating out of structure. That’s a thin tightrope to walk, especially when the team’s No 1 receiver, Nico Collins,is out with a concussion.Los Angeles Rams: Special teamsThe Rams having a punt blocked against the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs was no anomaly. They’ve had a special teams blunder in three of their five losses this season.It’s not just a season-long issue, either. It’s institutional. Over the last five years, the Rams rank 32nd in special teams EPA, and there is a chasm between the Rams and the second-worst team over that spell. In successive postseasons, they’ve flirted with disaster, only to be bailed out by their offense and defense. This year’s errors led Sean McVay to a first: firing a coach during the season. But the change in coordinator hasn’t had the desired effect. The Rams have become more effective at limiting kick returns, which has helped their starting field position on defense. But they remain just as prone to bone-headed lapses when they’re kicking the ball themselves.As they move into the final eight, there is no margin for error. The Rams have all the ingredients of a championship team: they can win in any way on offense, their defense creates havoc in the pocket and they have the quarterback. But they have ignored the third phase of the game for too long. So far, they’ve been able to outrun it. But if they fall apart between now and the Super Bowl, it will probably come down to another untimely kicking mistake.New England Patriots: Pass protectionLike the 49ers and Bears, the Patriots’ defense does not create a ton of pressure on defense. But they do have a pair of one-on-one winners – Milton Williams and Harold Landry – who could flip a game on their own. The concern is with their own protection.Late in the season, New England discovered their run game. After struggling for much of the year to move the ball on the ground, the Patriots have a 46% rushing success rate since week 12. That’s helped support a bombs away passing attack that has been the bedrock of theleague’s leading offense. But even with the return of first-round left tackle Will Campbell, they allow too much pressure on quarterback Drake Maye. They finished the regular season with a 38.7% pressure rate conceded, which puts them 28th in the league. And the Patriots don’t just concede pressure; they give it upquicklyand often unblocked.It makes what Maye has done this season more of a minor miracle.Maye, for all his brilliance, is prone to taking drive-killing sacks. But against the Texans this weekend, the Pats line could be in big trouble. They struggle with power-based pass-rushers, and Houston have the best duo in the league: Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter. Squeak past the Texans, and the Broncos could be on deck, a team who pressure and sack quarterbacks at the highest rate in the league.The Patriots need to be able to run the ball to mitigate the risk, and then hope Maye can deliver some flashes of brilliance under duress.View image in fullscreenRobert Saleh’s defense will be in the spotlight this weekend.Photograph: Brooke Sutton/Getty ImagesSan Francisco 49ers: Pass rushRobert Saleh deserves credit for dragging the Niners’ defense this far. He has been able to keep a no-name defense competitive throughout the year, despite a battery of injuries and a lack of a pass-rush.Against the Eagles on Sunday, Saleh loaded the box to stop the run and dared Jalen Hurts and Philly to throw. Against ahigh-school caliberoffense, it was effective. Against tougher opposition, though, it will be tough to make up for.Saleh, for all his brilliance, runs a fairly simple scheme. He doesn’t disguise coverages. The Niners led the league this season in their use of zone coverage, and those coverages fall into just three buckets. He’s not a blitzer, either, relying on four players to detonate the pocket and attack opposing quarterbacks. It’s difficult to navigate through the playoffs with such a static, predictable schemewithoutunrelenting pressure. Across the season, the Niners finished with a 22% pressure rate with a four-man pass-rush, 31st in the league and almost half the typical threshold for Super Bowl winners. Against the Eagles’ offense, with all its faults, that figure fell to 11%. That won’t cut it against the Rams, Seahawks or whoever comes out of the AFC, unless Saleh has a late-season curveball he can throw.Seattle Seahawks: Sam DarnoldDarnold put together a magical first half of the season.He was a front-runner for MVP, driving the ball to all areas of the field, creating plays with his legs and adding newfound refinement to his game. He was hitting difficult, tight-window throwsdeepdown the field at a historic clip. But much of that has dried up in the second half of the year. As Seattle’s defense has risen to match the league’s best and the team’s run-game has come alive, Darnold’s game has soured – at least by his early-season standards.Since Week 11, Darnold ranks 22nd in the league among eligible starters in the RBSDM composite, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for the value. That’s the lowest of any remaining quarterback in the playoffs. His turnovers are up, and the deep ball has withered.The rest of Seattle’s roster is good enough to cover up for Darnold. Facing the Niners in the divisional round could also prove to be a get-right game, given San Francisco’s defensive frailties. But Darnold has never been to the final eight before, and the Seahawks offense isn’t playing with great rhythm. No single player serves as a bigger pivot point of the postseason. If Darnold limits turnovers, the Seahawks are the front-runners. If he can tap back into his early-season form, they will be the runaway favorites. But if he has a repeat performance of last season’s playoff outing for Minnesota, the Seahawks will be heading home early.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsChicago BearsDenver BroncosHouston TexansLos Angeles RamsNew England PatriotsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fonseca is 19 and he makes that succinct list of his goals sound almost as casual as a few fun things a more ordinary teenager might aim to do this weekend. But Fonseca is different.He is a generational talent who, in recent years, has been spoken of as a future superstar amid predictions that he might have the best chance ofdenting the dominant hold that Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinnerexert over men’s tennis. But, as time in Fonseca’s company proves, he is remarkably grounded and mature for his age. Those attributes underline his credentials far more effectively than the hype that has trailed him.“I’ve got a long way to go,” Fonseca says with healthy realism, “because it’s a very long and difficult dream. But, at the same time, I think it’s possible and I’m doing the best things I can to achieve it.”This time last year Fonseca was ranked No 145 in the world and he had to win three qualifying matches to reach the first round of theAustralian Open. He smiles ruefully as he relives the excruciating tension of the qualifiers. Hungry players are desperate to scrap their way into the main draw where large amounts of money and ranking points can be earned. “I remember my first match was against an Argentinian guy, [Federico Agustín] Gómez. It was super tense because it was only my third slam and I was nervous. I played really tight in the beginning and then, after that, I played good.”View image in fullscreenFonseca celebrates a point during his second-round victory against Lorenzo Sonego at last year’s Australian Open.Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty ImagesFonseca won 6-4, 6-0 and he was more convincing in his second match as he dropped only three games. “But I was tense in the third qualifier because I had lost in the third quali of the US Open in 2024. So it was another tough match because I wanted to win so much and make my first main draw.”Another Argentinian, Thiago Agustín Tirante, was ranked much higher than Fonseca but was beaten 6-4, 6-1. Fonseca had made his first grand slam tournament and his reward was a formidable challenge against the thenworld No 9, Andrey Rublev, who had spent 255 consecutive weeks in the top 10 and reached 10 grand slam quarter-finals.But Rublev was crushed after a blistering and seemingly nerveless display from Fonseca who won in straight sets to announce his arrival on the world stage. “Playing well and beating Rublev was just amazing for me and a great achievement,” he says. “I was playing good and I was confident I could win the biggest match I’d ever played at that time. As the underdog, I had no pressure. I just played my game because I knew he would feel the pressure against an 18-year-old. I was just there to enjoy it and I played amazing tennis.”Even though he lost a five-setter in the second round against Lorenzo Sonego, last year’s Australian Open heightened the already intense expectations of Fonseca. “My life changed a little bit,” he says. “Not on the interior, with my personality, but the exterior changed a lot – with many more people following me and so many more people knowing me. My ranking went up and my level [of play] gave me more confidence. When my parents got home they said: ‘You don’t know what it’s like in Brazil now. People know you.’ But it was part of the goal to achieve a lot and become No 1. That’s my dream. So it was a great step in my career.”View image in fullscreenJoão Fonseca in action against Jack Draper during the third round of last year’s French Open.Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty ImagesEven more impressively, Fonsecawon his first ATP title a month laterin Buenos Aires, beating four Argentinian players in front of a vociferous crowd. He describes that championship as his sweetest moment of 2025. “It was my first title and the highlight of last year. I could also say Basel, but the first time just means a lot.”Fonseca won his second ATP title in Basel in October when he defeated Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-3, 6-4 in the final of the Swiss Masters. Davidovich Fokina praised Fonseca’s “unbelievable tennis” anddescribed him as the next Novak Djokovic. “You are the person of this sport,” Davidovich Fokina told Fonseca after losing in straight sets. “You are, for sure, going to be the next Nole [Djokovic] to beat Carlos [Alcaraz] and Jannik [Sinner].”While admitting that “it’s a pleasure hearing those kind words”, Fonseca responded by saying: “Actually, I am not a fan of the comparisons. I’m going to make my own history.”View image in fullscreenFonseca poses with the trophy after winning the Swiss Indoors in Basel in October last year.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesFonseca rose to world No 24 after that victory but he is acutely aware of the gulf that separates Alcaraz and Sinner, who have won the last eight majors between them, from the rest of the pack. He watched their past three grand slam finals at the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. He picks outthe unforgettable final in Pariswhen Alcaraz produced a miraculous comeback from two sets down after it looked as if Sinner had an iron grip on the title.“It was brilliant tennis and I watched the full match at home. The level was unbelievable. It’s difficult to say I can play that level. But I’m practising hard and working 100% every day so at least one day I can play at this level, against these guys in finals.”He needs to improve in many ways to reach such a sustained peak: “It is a lot of things. Consistency, responsibility, mentality. The most important thing is your mentality – because that gives you the responsibility and consistency to keep working hard every day. And the right mentality on court is the most important thing for you to be a great tennis player, to become a legend of the sport. At our level all the players are really good. But the amazing players, the top-flight players, know how to play the important points and how to deal with pressure and nerves.”Courage is also vital. Against Rublev last year, Fonseca was often brave in his choice of shot at crucial points. “It’s more to do with confidence. I practise those shots a lot but sometimes it’s normal to think: ‘What do I do now?’ You don’t want to miss the important points. At the same time I just think: ‘I want to do what I have practised so hard. Just go for the shot.’ Sometimes I’m going to miss, but I did the right thing. I try to be brave. Sometimes I go crazy when I miss an important point. But I have the courage and I just go for the shots and it’s great.”View image in fullscreenFonseca faces a serve from Carlos Alcaraz during an invitation match in Miami in December.Photograph: MediaPunch Inc/AlamyIt will be hard for Fonseca to go deep in the Australian Open this month as he has been struggling with a back injury and chose to miss recent tournaments in Brisbane and Adelaide as a precaution. He has been drawn with world No 89 Eliot Spizzirri of the US in round one and could face Sinner in the third round.Fonseca says: “Every day I’m feeling better. Hopefully I can be near 100% [when the tournament starts on Sunday]. I need to respect my body and take the right decision because I have a long career ahead of me. I want to play 15 more years. So you need to take care of your body and understand that sometimes you have to wait. But hopefully I can play well these next weeks. If I don’t, well, it doesn’t matter. It’s part of the process.”Fonseca has yet to play Sinner or Alcaraz in a competitive match – but he faced the Spaniardin an exhibition in Miami last month. Alcaraz won the first set 7-5, Fonseca took the second 6-2 and the third was a tie-break which the world No 1 shaded 10-8.“I’d already practised with him two or three times,” Fonseca says of Alcaraz. “But it was great to see how he deals with the important points. I played a good match and almost got him in the tie-break. We talked a little about life and his career before the match. He’s a great guy, very humble, and an inspiration for the next generation.”Fonseca thinks carefully when I ask him which player, from this next generation, might challenge Alcaraz and Sinner first. “I’m going to say [Jakub] Mensik. I really like his game. He’s a very complete guy, very confident and also young [at 20]. He’s already won a masters and he can do great things. He’s a great friend as well.”View image in fullscreenJoão Fonseca is flattered by comparisons to Gustavo Kuerten and describes his fellow Brazilian as ‘an idol’.Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/ATP/Getty Images for the GuardianMensik has the game to rise to the top but the Czech will do so without the fervour surrounding Fonseca who is already a phenomenon in Brazil. Comparisons are being made with Gustavo Kuerten – his countryman who was world No 1 and won three French Opens between 1997 and 2001. “Guga is not only the idol of Brazilian people that follow tennis,” Fonseca says. “He’s an idol for the whole nation because of his charisma and the way he represented Brazil.”Almost every Fonseca match is played against a sea of Brazilian colour and noise with his fans kicking up an almighty racket of passionate support. It’s compelling, of course, but how does Fonseca deal with their expectations, and those of so many others who have made grand predictions about his future? “My parents and my coach help me a lot and I know you can’t control the expectations. You can’t control what people are going to say. You just need to focus on your routine and what you need to do to become a better player and a better person.”Fonseca pauses and then, maintaining eye contact, the impressive teenager says: “I know what people are saying. I can hear it, I can read it: ‘Is he going to be the next Sinner or Alcaraz?’ We don’t know the future. It’s unpredictable. But I’m working very hard towards it and I’m just thinking what I need to do to achieve it.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2025Australian OpenTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Premier League proves that’s untrueLeander SchaerlaeckensThere are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balancedThu 15 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 06.01 ESTShareDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.Current commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silversaid thenin his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”Pitch Points: Alonso’s future and Wrexham’s Premier League dreamsRead moreNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”When the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfredacknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”For decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.Yet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won thePremier Leaguejust about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.Concerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double ashandy instruments to write off taxesfor billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.Lately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.They can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.Sam Coffey’s Man City move is another blow for a hamstrung NWSLRead moreThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rulesnow tweakedto merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.Meanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.More tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)Certainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.At least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.That’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

On Thursday night all host cities were illuminated by yellow beams in recognition of them staging the Tour.Simon Morton, UK Sport’s director of events, said that the ambition was “to host a massive sporting event that would genuinely thread together the countries, cities, and communities of Great Britain.“The route details do just that, enabling us to reach, unite, and inspire people right across the country – providing moments of joy for millions, bringing communities together, and delivering lasting benefits beyond race day.”View image in fullscreenThe routes of the 2027 Grands Départs will thrill cycling fans across Britain.Composite: Getty ImagesThe Tour’s last British Grand Départ, in 2014, followed Tour wins by Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome and was a resounding success that drew an estimated 3.5 million people to the roadsides and fuelled £128m of economic benefit. Jon Dutton, chief executive of BritishCycling, said that they expected to see 10 million people at the roadside in 2027.The double-headed Grand Départ is far more ambitious than 2014 and will be easily the biggest logistical undertaking in the history of the Tour. It is also the first time that men’s and women’s Grands Départs have been hosted by the same country, outside France.View image in fullscreenThe Beatles statues adorned with yellow scarves at the Pier Head on Liverpool’s waterfront.“The UK has always welcomed the Tour with passion and pride, and the route details reflect the beauty and diversity of Britain’s terrain,” said Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour. “Bringing both Grands Départs here is a testament to the strength of our partnership with British Cycling and the enthusiasm of the UK.”The two Tour visits will be the cornerstones of a summer of cycling that will traverse Britain from north to south. The men’s race starts in Edinburgh on Friday 2 July with a first stage through the Scottish Borders to Carlisle.Stage two takes the peloton from Keswick to Liverpool, while the third stage starts in Welshpool and finishes in Cardiff, after a long stage through the Welsh Valleys that takes in eight climbs in the final 50 miles.View image in fullscreenTour de France general director Christian Prudhomme and Geraint Thomas during a press conference in Cardiff to announce the Welsh stage of the 2027 Grand Départ.Photograph: Alex Whitehead/SWpix.com/Shutterstock“Wales is proud to host a stage of the Tour for the first time, which will be a fantastic opportunity to showcase our stunning landscapes,” said Eluned Morgan, the first minister ofWales. “Hosting the final UK stage of the men’s race will raise Wales’ profile as a world-class destination for cyclists and other visitors, while inspiring more people to get active and deliver lasting benefits for Wales.”Four weeks on, the Tour de France Femmes starts in Leeds on 30 July with a first stage to Manchester and a second stage through the Peak District to Sheffield. The final day of Tour racing is in London on 1 August, although exact route details are yet to be specified.“Racing the Tour de France Femmes has been one of the highlights of my career, and seeing the women’s edition go from strength to strength has been genuinely inspiring,” the former world champion Lizzie Deignan said. “This is a huge moment for the sport and an opportunity that will inspire countless women and girls to get on their bikes.”View image in fullscreenFormer world champion Lizzie Deignan says seeing the growth of the Tour de France Femmes has been ‘truly inspiring’.Photograph: Procycling Magazine/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesBritish Cycling is also expecting the two Grands Départs to have wider and long-lasting benefits. “This is a once‐in‐a‐generation chance to build a healthier, more active and more connected nation,” Dutton said. “It shows the power of major events when they’re done right, to help deliver a legacy that will be felt long after the peloton has left UK shores.”Explore more on these topicsTour de FranceCyclingWalesEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The fixers then placed large bets against those players’ teams, defrauding sportsbooks and other bettors, according to the indictment unsealed on Thursday.‘It’s an addiction’: NBA’s ties to gambling trouble players past and presentRead moreFixers started with two games in the Chinese Basketball Association in 2023 and, after being successful there, moved on to fixNCAAgames as recently as January 2025, authorities say. The “bribe payments” to players ranged from $10,000 to $30,000 per game, authorities said.Four of the players charged – Simeon Cottle, Carlos Hart, Oumar Koureissi and Camian Shell – played for their current teams in the last few days, although the allegations against them do not involve this season.Calling the scheme an “international criminal conspiracy,” US Attorney David Metcalf told reporters in Philadelphia that the case represents a “significant corruption of the integrity of sports.”Concerns about gambling and college sports have grown since 2018, when the US supreme courtstruck down a federal banon the practice, leading some states to legalize betting to varying degrees. The NCAA does not allow athletes or staff to bet on college games, but it briefly allowed student-athletes to bet on professional sports last year before rescinding that decision in November. Of the defendants, 15 played basketball for Division I NCAA schools during the 2024-25 season, prosecutors say. Several of them are playing this season.Five others last played in the NCAA in the 2023-24 season while another, former NBA player Antonio Blakeney, played in the Chinese Basketball Association in the 2022-23 season.The other five defendants were described by authorities as fixers. They include two men who prosecutors say worked in the training and development of basketball players. Another was a trainer and former coach, one was a former NCAA player and two were described as gamblers, influencers and sports handicappers.In many instances, the defendants’ wagers on the fixed games were successful. The sportsbooks paid out the winnings, and took losses, authorities say.“The sportsbooks would not have paid out those wagers had they known that the defendants fixed those games,” the indictment said.Meanwhile, other bettors unaware of the scheme lost money on their bets and would not have placed those bets had they known about it, authorities say.The charges, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, include bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy.“Protecting competition integrity is of the utmost importance for the NCAA. We are thankful for law enforcement agencies working to detect and combat integrity issues and match manipulation in college sports,” said NCAA president Charlie Baker in a statement on Thursday.“The pattern of college basketball game integrity conduct revealed by law enforcement today is not entirely new information to the NCAA. Through helpful collaboration and with industry regulators, we have finished or have open investigations into almost all of the teams in today’s indictment.”One betting scandal after another has rocked the sports world, where gambling revenue topped $11bn for the first three-quarters of last year in the US, according to the American Gaming Association. That’s up more than 13% from the prior year, the group said.The indictment follows a series of NCAA investigations that led to at least 10 players receiving lifetime bans for bets that sometimes involved their own teams and their own performances. And the NCAA has said that at least 30 players have been investigated over gambling allegations.More than 30 peoplewere also charged in last year’s sprawling federal takedown of illegal gambling operations linked to professional basketball.Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsCollege basketballNCAAGamblingUS sportsBasketballnewsShareReuse this content"

The reduced field meant fewer qualifying points were available and Uhlaender, who won the event, did not secure her place at this year’s Milano Cortina Games in Italy. Uhlaender claims Joe Cecchini, the head coach of Canada’s skeleton team, told her he had come up with the scheme.Canada’s ice hockey win over Trump’s America was her soft power laid bare | Colin HorganRead moreHowever, the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF) said it would take no action after investigating the allegations.“The current IBSF Rules allow national federations to withdraw athletes from competition at any time,” IBSF said in a statement on Thursday. “The IIU [Interim Integrity Unit] dismissed the complaints as the current IBSF rules and regulations did not give grounds for a breach of the international rules, the code of conduct, and respectively the code of ethics.”Quick GuideNorway ski jumping coaches hit with 18-month ban over suit tamperingShowThree officials for Norway’s men’s ski jumping team have been suspended for 18 months and fined by the ethics committee of the FIS – the sport's governing body – for manipulating competition suits at last year’s Nordic Ski World Championships in Trondheim.The case tarnished Norway’s hosting of the Nordic World Ski Championships last March and the country’s wider reputation for fair play.The head coach Magnus Brevik, former assistant coach Thomas Lobben and suit technician Adrian Livelten were sanctioned after an investigation into equipment tampering during the men’s large hill event in March 2025.The controversy erupted after Norway’s Olympic champions Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, along with the coaching staff, were charged over the use of altered suits. Lindvik initially finished second but was stripped of his silver medal after being disqualified, while Forfang, who placed fourth, was also disqualified after an equipment inspection.The Norwegian Ski Federation admitted after the competition that the team had manipulated the suits but said the ski jumpers were not at fault for the violations. The organisers found nothing untoward during the initial check, but after the race they discovered different material in the seams. Forfang and Lindvik accepted three-month bans in August and are back competing ahead of the Milan Cortina Olympics next month.In a statement, the FIS said Brevik, Lobben and Livelten would be ineligible for a period “of 18 months, commencing on the date of the decision (8 January 2026), less the period of provisional suspension already served since 12 March 2025”.The governing body added they would have to contribute 5,000 Swiss Franc (£4,650, $6,246) each to the costs of the proceedings and the investigation.In a statement to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK, the trio’s lawyers said the decision was “disproportionately strict”.“The grounds of the judgment expressly state that similar rule violations have not been sanctioned previously – or have only been met with a warning – and that this case is being used as an example to mark a new and stricter line in international ski jumping,” they added.AP and ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Coaches from the US, Denmark, Israel and Malta, whose athletes were all affected by the Canadian withdrawals, had expressed “serious concerns” about the qualification process. However, Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton defended the withdrawals, saying some of the athletes who were pulled from competition had already raced several times last week and needed to rest. It said the decision was “appropriate, transparent and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport”.Uhlaender, who is 41, has said the 2026 Olympics will be her last. She can still qualify for next month’s Games, but the US spots are likely to go to Kelly Curtis and Mystique Ro. Although Uhlaender won gold at the 2012 skeleton world championships, the closest she has come to an Olympic medal was when she finished fourth at the 2014 Games in Sochi.The incident comes after a number of heated sporting clashes between Canada and the US at a time when Donald Trump has threatened to make his neighbor a “51st state” and has raised tariffs on Canadian goods. Duringlast year’s 4 Nations Face-off, Canadian ice hockey fans booed the US national anthem and the former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted: “You can’t take our country – and you can’t take our game.” In last season’s World Series the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Toronto Blue Jays in athrilling seven-game series, although most of the tension was due to the action on the field.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsUSA Olympic teamWinter Olympics 2026US sportsCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

It added that “visible distress” was caused by fans being directed towards a confined space for almost 30 minutes before being allowed to leave.“No advance communication was provided to supporters regarding the possibility of a post-match holdback, leaving thousands unprepared for what followed,” Dominic Rosso, the CST chair, wrote. “While operational challenges are understood, clearer communication is essential for maintaining trust and reducing frustration in high-pressure situations.“As supporters exited via the red gates on to Valley Grove, a visible police block of three police vans on the right-hand side led many to assume that the correct route was to the left. This directed hundreds of supporters into a poorly lit and hazardous dead-end residential area. Freezing conditions meant muddy ground quickly turned to ice, resulting in people slipping, falling and navigating low walls in darkness. The absence of clear direction, signage or a stewarding presence in this area significantly increased confusion and unnecessary risk.”Chelsea were given an allocation of 3,065 tickets for the third-round tie. The CST sought feedback from its members and said the action by police was “deeply disappointing” and evoked “uncomfortable comparisons with policing approaches more commonly associated with past decades”.View image in fullscreenPedro Neto scores Chelsea’s fourth goal against Charlton in their FA Cup win at the Valley.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“When the holdback was eventually lifted, supporters were released through an opening of approximately two metres,” Rosso said. “This immediately caused a forward surge, with people being pushed towards a narrow and poorly lit path bordered by a raised ledge. Several supporters stumbled and fell, while others stepped into private gardens in an effort to avoid injury. In addition, a further hold of approximately 15 minutes took place adjacent to Charlton station.”The CST called for a review and said it looks forward to constructive dialogue with the force to ensure there is no repeat of the incident.In response, a spokesperson for the Met said that officers had acted after receiving intelligence indicating a risk of disorder towards Chelsea fans and said that the measures ensured safety. However, there was a commitment to an independent review with the UK Football Policing Unit.The Met said: “Officers policing theCharlton AthleticFC v Chelsea FC match on Saturday 10 January made the decision to temporarily hold fans on two separate occasions following the conclusion of the game.“These decisions were based on intelligence, which indicated a risk of disorder towards Chelsea fans. The measures implemented ensured supporters were kept safe.“The policing of football matches often requires dynamic decision-making in order to reduce the potential risk of disorder. Our primary focus is always the safety of supporters and the wider public.“A full and independent review has been commissioned with the UK Football Policing Unit, to ensure full transparency around decision-making and any learning is identified and adopted.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaCharlton AthleticnewsShareReuse this content"

That changed when Gareth Southgate transformed the culture and Tuchel is keen to build on his predecessor’s work, not least because thisWorld Cupfeatures 48 teams and will last more than five weeks.“When I speak to players who have been in World Cups, it has always made the difference when the connection was right, when the communication was right, between the players first of all,” Tuchel said.“When the players had the feeling that the right group is in camp, that they knew their role, why they are in camp, what is expected of them, and they had the feeling that the tournament could even go on for another four weeks and they would be happy to be together, then they were successful.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel and Harry Kane reunite in March for two friendlies before this summer’s World Cup in North America.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images“When they had the feeling after the round of 16 already: ‘Oh, when can we finally go home?’ and the energy was not right and they didn’t make it. This just tells me that we have to get the selection right. It will be very important that we don’t select just for talent, but also for what we need from a player. What the social skills are of a player, is he a good teammate? Can he support if his role is maybe the supporting role? So, this is where the focus is.”Tuchel’s message was that being a good tourist will count when it comes to making his squad. Southgate often selected backup players who could be trusted to train well and not complain about their lack of playing time.England, who host friendlies against Uruguay and Japan at Wembley in March, are expected to play warmup matches in Florida at the start of June. They do not play their first match in Group L until facing Croatia in Dallas on 17 June. They then face Ghana and Panama.Tuchel, speaking in a commercial interview released on Thursday but filmed last month, has not finalised England’s travel itinerary. A big consideration will be ensuring that his players deal with the demands of a tournament taking place in Canada, Mexico and the US.“It is a big tournament regarding distances, the time zones that you travel, the altitude – difference of altitude, difference of weather conditions,” Tuchel said. “It will be very hot. We will have a lot of players out there who hopefully play until May for international titles, they will play for national titles and we will demand a lot out of them.“Then we will be hopefully six to eight weeks together if we make it until the very end. It will demand a lot of our social skills, how we are together as a group and we need to get the nomination right.“We need to find the right balance in the team and take it as an opportunity and take it as a dream coming true to be part in a World Cup and to play, hopefully, a major role is nothing else than a dream.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026World CupnewsShareReuse this content"

He has been asked whether, after a decade frozen out of the game, its lustre has vanished for him. “Millions who share the ideas that I have. But in the end, it’s big business.”It is an industry whose peaks Platini scaled before, in one of football’s biggest falls from grace, it spat him out. He maintains he would have become Fifa president if he had not been banned from football over an alleged unlawful payment made to him in 2011, when he was running Uefa, by Sepp Blatter. The scandal led to a criminal case but bothmen were acquitted for a second time, definitively so, bya Swiss appeals court last year. Nothing hangs over Platini any more, bar a conviction that he was cheated.The Coupe de France was short of magic – and then Paris FC beat PSGRead more“It’s a strange feeling,” he says. “The last 10 years have been very complicated because of what my family suffered: they see what’s in the papers, what people say about you, the global discussion. But I was never preoccupied about the final decision because I knew I was not guilty, knew that at the end there would be nothing. I always felt fine in myself.”Now that is a matter of public record and the question is whether, at 70, Platini has more to give at football’s elite level. The sport has moved on and his nine years asUefapresident feel a lifetime ago. He was the triple Ballon d’Or winner who leapt into the snakepit of football governance and emerged with his reputation sullied.Platini once compared himself with Icarus and, however one views the events that brought him down, there is little doubt he skirted the sun. His demise came when, nine years later, he called in a £1.35m payment for work carried out as Blatter’s technical adviser between 1999 and 2002. Both men said the deal had been made verbally and that there was an innocent reason for the delay. When it came to light in September 2015, Blatter had agreed to step down from a scandal-hitFifaand Platini was expected to succeed him.“I was destined to become president of Fifa,” he says. “Everything happened because they didn’t want that. The ban was a big injustice and overall it was political. A group of people decided to kill me.”View image in fullscreenSepp Blatter, the former Fifa president, was acquitted of fraud alongside Michel Platini.Photograph: Urs Flüeler/APBut who? That has never been explicit, although he thinks Blatter, raging against the dying of the light, “wanted to die in that job”. Platini believes this, along with his own standing as a former player with a new broom, set events in motion. “It created an atmosphere against me,” he says, speaking from his home in the south of France. “This administration, people who I did not know, didn’t want a different president. The soup was very good, they could earn a lot of money, and they didn’t want me in case I changed many things. They were afraid of me.”He does not includeGianni Infantino, back then a competent and fiercely ambitious Uefa general secretary, among those who knifed him even though Platini filed a complaint against his former colleague in 2021 accusing him of influence-peddling in the corruption case. That case was closed last October after special prosecutors cleared Infantino. It was Infantino, not Platini, who succeeded Blatter in February 2016. “No, he profited from the situation but was not one of the instigators,” he says. “Infantino wanted to be president of Uefa, which meant he was pushing me towards Fifa.”The soup was very good, they could earn a lot of money, and they didn’t want me in case I changed many things. They were afraid of meMention of Infantino leads to a discourse on modern-day football governance. Some ongoing controversies, such asFifa’s peace prize award to Donald Trumpand the political ingratiation tied up in it, almost seem quaint in comparison with the Blatter era.“He was a good No 2, but is not a good No 1,” Platini says of Infantino. “He worked very well at Uefa but he has one problem: he likes the rich and powerful people, the ones with money. It’s his character. He was like that as a No 2, but back then he was not the boss.”Despite the numerous scandals that eventually engulfed Fifa under Blatter, his friend turned adversary, Platini believes the organisation has turned further away from its values. “Unfortunately Infantino has become more of an autocrat since the pandemic,” he says. “I think he lost the game. There is less democracy than in Blatter’s time. You can say what you want about Blatter, but his main problem is that he wanted to continue at Fifa for life. He was a good person for football.“The administrators in football now, they are just doing their job. You find many who wouldn’t care whether it’s football or basketball. It’s not always a case of loving football if you work at Uefa or Fifa.”View image in fullscreenMichel Platini says of Gianni Infantino (left): ‘He has one problem: he likes the rich and powerful people, the ones with money. It’s his character.’Photograph: Valéry Hache/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat, then, ofAleksander Ceferin? The Slovenian succeeded Platini, banned by then, at the Uefa helm in September 2016 and there is no denying the pair are starkly different. A statesman of the game, a winner of almost everything, had been replaced by a lawyer with relatively brief high-level experience in football.Platini is careful not to criticise Ceferin, save for observing that the eternal to and fro between Uefa and Fifa needs tighter management. A group of Uefadelegates walked out of the Fifa Congressin Asuncion last May in protest at the “private political interests” that led Infantino to arrive late but, publicly at least, the flashpoint was quickly smoothed over.“Ceferin has to be more present in Fifa,” he says. “Uefa was always something important: it was a counterbalance to the silly things done by Fifa. You have to be more energetic in defending the values of football. I have no contact with him and don’t want to interfere, but I think it is the only way to stop Infantino doing some stupid things.”He believes the role of Uefa president will become “more complicated”. That owes largely to the increased power wielded by leading clubs. In his time Platini was forced to make regular compromises to keep members of the European Club Association, in whose establishment he was influential, from following through on threats to break away. In practice it largely meant allowing bigger clubs a greater share of the Champions League pot and he was sometimes accused of being too hands-off. Relaunched glossily in October as European Football Clubs and hugely expanded, the ECA’s heft in shaping the sport has never been greater.“They always wanted to organise their own competition from the beginning but I didn’t let them, I fought against that for many years,” he says of the body then headed up by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Ceferin was leading Uefa when a fully-fledgedEuropean Super Leagueattempt fell apart in 2021, but Platini senses the threat has not remotely abated.“It’s been a problem for a long, long time and it will become more and more important,” he says. “It would be like a league of 18 clubs, the rich and the big. What happened with the Club World Cup last summer may be the tip of the iceberg. I have no idea what it will do for the future of the game, but I think there could be a big change in professional football in Europe.”A central theme for Platini is the notion that football has been taken away from those who understand the sport. He contrasts Rummenigge, his old sparring partner, with the EFC chair,Nasser al-Khelaifi, extolling the benefits of talking issues through with “someone who knew what football is”. Infantino has twice been re-elected at Fifa unopposed; there is no obvious candidate either to run against Ceferin next year, assuming he ends a prolonged tease by deciding to seek another term.“My best hope is that more and more ex-players will come into football governance so that they can organise these institutions and take care of the game internationally,” he says. “It’s what I am, and it’s what I did.“It’s not an easy job so there aren’t many who want to do it. You have to campaign tirelessly and it costs a lot of money. But for democracy it would be better if there was good competition with new ideas. It’s not always a question of football, it’s a question of the people involved.”Does he feel his own race is run? At the conclusion of his football ban in 2021 he was linked strongly with a role at Fifpro, the global players’ union. In the past year there have been murmurings on the European circuit that Platini, if not preparing his own Uefa comeback, would happily play a role in supporting fresh blood.He becomes coy. “I don’t feel so bad, I have 10 years to do something. I have some ideas, some big things that will be complicated, so if I create something important I will need some time. If I have a good opportunity to advise someone or something, why not? But not anymore in the administration of football. I’ve been public-facing for 50 years so it’s time to be in the background.”Despite the intense frustration of a derailed career, and the lengths to which he has been to clear his name, he does not consider the previous decade to have been lost. “No, no, I’ve enjoyed my life and enjoyed this time. Mentally I was calm. I travelled a lot, discovered new things and people, spent more time with friends and family. I didn’t lose anything.”That includes the support of most people inside football, he believes. “I was treated very well by the fans, by football people, but not by ones who were afraid I would come back and take their seats,” he says. “Everyone else understood from the beginning that it was a plot that I would not become Fifa president.View image in fullscreen‘I was treated very well by the fans, by football people, but not by ones who were afraid I would come back and take their seats,’ says Michel Platini.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images“With the media it was different because they need Fifa, they don’t need me, and there was a big lobbying system of lawyers and other people. That world was against me and they didn’t want me to come back.”In November Platini filed a lawsuit in Paris against three unnamed Fifa officials, and an unnamed member of a Swiss judicial institution, accusing them of defamation over statements made while he fought his case. From the outside he looks caught between moving on and settling old scores.“I won’t give in to those who made bad things, lies and false accusations against me,” he says. “This will not be revenge: it is a fight for truth against those who did these things; there is always energy to battle injustice. I don’t want someone else to have the same problems as me one day.”How would a Fifa run by Platini have looked? “It would have become an organisation that cares about football, not making politics,” he says. Surely he should know better than most that immersion in one tends to mean deep involvement in the other. “I think romanticism can help the pragmatics, but pragmatism does not help the romantics.”It is a riddle nobody, not least Platini, has yet been able to solve.Explore more on these topicsMichel PlatiniUefaFifaGianni InfantinoSepp BlatterFootball politicsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

And for large portions ofArsenal’s 3-2 win at Chelseain the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday, it certainly was not. But for Mikel Arteta and his players there was a beauty in the physicality, the remorseless levels of aggression.Arsenal won because of what they did without the ball. Yes, there were nice moments from them in possession, most obviously Martín Zubimendi’s goal for 3-1. His gliding run from right to left inside the penalty area, especially the fake-to-shoot move that removed the Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana from the equation, the composure amid the maelstrom, before the execution, was jaw-dropping.Sánchez nightmare suggests Rosenior will soon have to show his ruthless side | Jacob SteinbergRead moreYet the biggest takeaway was that maelstrom, the sense that Arsenal had expected a scrap and refused to countenance anything other than winning it. There was a chest-out power from them, evident in the duels but more than that, in the battle to close the spaces, to mass men around any opposition player who got on the ball.When Chelsea, bravely, tried to play out from the back, each pass felt fraught in the face of the pressure; they had to be perfect to avoid dangerous turnovers. In fairness, they showed plenty of skill and personality in this regard. But still, getting out was precarious, draining.It was also easy to fixate on the moment when Estêvão Willian blasted clear of a posse of red shirts in central midfield on 37 minutes. When the Chelsea winger went right, trying to make something happen, he saw no teammates in support, only more red, Arsenal players swarming around him. Eventually he lost the ball for a goal-kick.View image in fullscreenBen White watches his header find the Chelsea net as Arsenal once again scored from a set piece.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThe overall impression was of an intimidation factor, which Arteta has long wanted to bring. And that is before we get to the set pieces, particularly the inswinging corners, which Arsenal have turned into an exercise in chaos; an example of their desire to unsettle with brute force. They scored the opening goal at Stamford Bridge when the Chelsea goalkeeper, Robert Sánchez, was boxed in on a Declan Rice corner, Ben White heading home.When Arsenal had their last Premier League title-winning team, one of the Invincibles, Gilberto Silva, commented that rival players got the losing feeling before a ball was kicked. “When we got into that Highbury tunnel, we knew we were going to win,” he said.It is a feeling that Arteta remembers from his days as a visiting Everton player, most notably when he was on the wrong end ofa 7-0 mauling in May 2005. “I have been in the tunnel playing with a different shirt,” he said in 2024. “Looking at the Invincibles, I had that feeling … tonight is going to be really tough. Hopefully we can create that.”William Saliba is one of the symbols of Arsenal’s strength and the defender believes his team are intimidating their opponents on a physical level. “Yes, I think so,” he said. “We are a good team and we are all connected. We need to keep going like this. Always when we play against Chelsea, it is a big fight and we want to win every duel. I think we dominated them.”Saliba was asked whether he saw the beauty in the approach. “Yes,” he replied. “It’s good. We want to be like this. We want to be strong everywhere – in defence and attack.”The frustration for Arsenal was that they did not put the tie to bed. After Zubimendi’s moment of magic, they had two clear chances for 4-1 before being pegged back by Alejandro Garnacho’s goal, the substitute’s second of the game. Both of them were soft concessions from an Arsenal point of view. The overriding feeling, though, was that this was a statement of intent. Suffocating defence is the hallmark of trophy winners.Explore more on these topicsArsenalanalysisShareReuse this content"

Paquetá has made clear to West Ham that he wants to return to Brazil but it is understood Flamengo are not minded to loan him back, reasoning that they can wait and buy him more cheaply in the summer.Andy Robertson admits Liverpool future unclear with contract expiring in summerRead moreWest Ham are locked in a fight to stay in the Premier League and fear that losing Paquetá would condemn them to relegation. The Brazil international has grown disillusioned with life in England after facing allegations of spot-fixing.Paquetá was cleared of the chargeslast year but the episode cost him a move to Manchester City in 2023 and is said to have affected him emotionally.The Brazilian transfer window shuts in March, giving Flamengo time to make a decision.West Ham, who are seven points below 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, have not seen the best of Paquetá since the Football Association’s investigation came to light in August 2023. The former Lyon midfielder, who joined West Ham for £51m in 2022, has struggled to maintain focus and said after a red card against Liverpool this season that the FA had not provided him with psychological support.The dilemma for West Ham is whether holding on to Paquetá makes sense. Sources say the Brazil internationalasked to be left outof last Sunday’s victory over Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup. Paquetá has been at the club’s training ground this week but has reported a minor knock and is a doubt to face Tottenham on Saturday.Selling Paquetá would boost West Ham’s budget as they look for defensive reinforcements. They have not kept a clean sheet since August but have cooled their interest in the Toulouse centre-back Charlie Cresswell, who is wanted by Borussia Dortmund and Wolsfburg. West Ham have confirmed that Paco Jémez has joined Nuno’s backroom staff.Nuno Espirito Santo, West Ham’s manager, admits the club need to “solve” the situation with Paquetá quickly. “I think it’s a situation that we have to solve, all of us at the club have to solve,” said the Portuguese coach. “We always want our best players to be involved and Lucas is one of our best players, so let’s try to solve the situation. “It’s a solution that we have to find. Us as a club, the player, myself.“My job is to prepare the team and to prepare the team with the best players that we have. Lucas is one of the best players. My job is to try and take the best out of all of them.”Leeds have signed Facundo Buonanotte on loan after the Brighton forward’s season’s loan atChelseawas cut short. The 21-year-old joined Chelsea last summer but has had little playing time.It is unclear whether Chelsea intend to sign a replacement for Buonanotte. They are also expected to bring the Ecuadorian attacker Kendry Paez back from his loan at Strasbourg and find a new slot for him at a Championship club.

The Richarlison setback has compounded matters; the forward was forced off during theFA Cup loss to Aston Villaon Saturday.Frank, who was unusually specific about the anticipated length of the layoff, has just welcomed back Dominic Solanke from a long-term ankle injury. His other options in attack, as he prepares for Saturday’s Premier League game at home to West Ham, are Xavi Simons, Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel and Wilson Odobert.

It can’t only be for the next four months. We need to think bigger picture as well. But, of course, we know that we are a few offensive players down.”Frank was asked whether it felt as though any progress made – such as the£34m signing of the midfielder Conor Gallagher, who is in contention to start against West Ham – was immediately offset by another problem, in this case the Richarlison injury.“It’s not a straightforward road, let me put it that way,” Frank said. “I think we are probably one inch on Micky van de Ven’s head away from a 3-2 winner against Bournemouth [last Wednesday] and we would then have eight points in four games, a bit more momentum. [Instead they lost 3-2].“It seems like when we get a fit player back, then another one gets injured. That’s football sometimes. We need just to get through the tough spells. There’s only one way forward, that’s keep walking. So be calm, carry on.”View image in fullscreenJohn Heitinga was an assistant to Arne Slot at Liverpool last season.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAFrank has welcomed John Heitinga on to his coaching staff as the replacement for Matt Wells, who left to become the head coach of Colorado Rapids.

Frank said that he and the sporting directors, Johan Lange and Fabio Paratici, the latter of whom willleave for Fiorentina in February, had driven Heitinga’s appointment.“It was a process we did together,” Frank said. “Of course, I was a big part of it. He was a standout candidate with everything he’s experienced.”Spurs have confirmed that Rafi Moersen will join them as their first director of football operations.

The 50-year-old Scot then took a tight decider, clearing the table from the final red to move one step closer to a third Masters title.“I was so lucky,” he told the BBC afterwards. “It was criminal … It’s tough out there. I’m delighted and so proud I’m still doing it.”Remarkably, it was the first match of the tournament not to finish 6-2, which was the scoreline inall eight first-round matches.View image in fullscreenJohn Higgins admitted he was ‘so lucky’ to come out on top against Zhao Xintong.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAHiggins will next face the world No 1, Judd Trump, after he battled past Mark Allen for another 6-2 victory in Thursday’s late session.After Allen came from behind to take the opening frame, Trump – who did not claim any silverware in 2025 – dug in to edge the next two before the Northern Irishman made a break of 76 to level things up at the mid-session interval.The momentum, though, turned in the fifth frame when Allen looked set on 68 only to miss a red, which let Trump, a two-time Masters champion, back in for steal with a well-crafted half-century. Further breaks of 70 and then 49 put Trump on the verge of the semi-finals, before a run of 68 left Allen to bravely fight on needing snookers.

Instead, the challenging rainy conditions were seemingly all it took to unsettle the Briton, who put in a dismal performance on Thursday evening. Her defeat against Preston, the WTA No 204, is her fourth-worst defeat by ranking since 2021.Roger Federer hails Alcaraz and Sinner’s ‘great’ rivalry amid Australian Open returnRead moreOn a day of frustrating rain delays, the players were only on court for about 10 minutes before they had to return to the locker room with Raducanu trailing 1-2. Upon the restart, the 23-year-old was in awful form, spraying careless unforced errors from all parts of the court. Despite playing so passively, Preston was able to dictate many of the baseline exchanges.Raducanu improved slightly in set two, cutting out sloppy errors and at least forcing Preston to take control and beat her, but she simply did not look as if she had the patience or willpower to fight sufficiently. Throughout the second set she was at the mercy of the bolder, more committed Preston, who generated more pace from the baseline and swung freely at the end faced with minimal resistance in the decisive moments.Despite Raducanu’s unimpressive effort, this result was also the consequence of a good performance from Preston, a talented youngster who is making her way towards the WTA Tour after a top-10 junior career. She showed her talent throughout with her clean, bold shotmaking, outhitting Raducanu for most of the encounter. Even as Raducanu led by a break in the second set, Preston continued to trust her attacking instincts as she searched for a way to take control again, which guided her to the best victory of her young career.View image in fullscreenTaylah Preston, a former top 10 junior, enjoyed the best victory of her nascent senior career over Raducanu.Photograph: Steve Bell/Getty ImagesRaducanu will now head to ­Melbourne for the Australian Open where she must make significant improvements if she is to win even a couple of rounds. She will face Thailand’s Mananchaya Sawangkaew in the first round, but another match-up with one of the best players in the world looms. Raducanu, the 28th seed in Melbourne, will potentially face the two-time champion and world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in round three.Raducanu is one of four British players in the women’s draw. Sonay Kartal will begin with a difficult first round match against the 31st seed, Anna Kalinskaya, and Francesca Jones will start against the 21-year-old Polish qualifier Linda Klimovicova in her first grand slam main draw appearance as a direct entrant. Katie Boulter, who snuck into the main draw after a couple of late retirements, will meet Belinda Bencic, the 10th seed and one of the most in-form players in the tournament, in round one.Three British players are in the men’s draw, with the 26th seed Cameron Norrie facing Benjamin Bonzi in round one and potentially meeting Alexander Zverev in round three. Jacob Fearnley, meanwhile, will face Kamil Majchrzak in round one. On Thursday afternoon, they were joined by the 23-year-old Arthur Fery, who qualified for the main draw in his first appearance, defeating the 14th qualifying seed Dino Prizmic 6-4, 6-1 to seal his place without dropping a set all week.Fery will play Flavio Cobolli, the 20th seed, in his Australian Open main draw debut.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

In comparison a Yield Sec report on the US market for 2024 identified 4.2bn streams of sports events in a far bigger country, with the prevalence of illegal streaming around four times bigger in the UK.The report argues that sports streaming is being deliberately used to take illegal gambling into the mainstream, having been developed initially to target heavy loss-making punters and vulnerable individuals excluded by the regulated industry.“Unlicensed gambling is by far the largest and most prevalent ‘media partner’ to the criminal business of illegal streaming of sports events,” said Ismail Vali, founder of Yield Sec.“For the first time, illegal gambling’s focus upon two core audiences in Great Britain – the underage and self-excluded gamblers on the GamStop scheme – looks set to shift into mainstream audiences via the gateway of illegal streaming of sports events.“When illegal gambling becomes the commercial engine behind the theft of premium sports content, the explanation is clear: it is because crime can make money from it. What does crime do with all of the money it takes by stealing from sports rights holders? It makes more crime.”In the budget last autumn Rachel Reeves, the chancellor,announced £26m in fundingfor the Gambling Commission to help combat the black market, but CFG argues the regulator has underestimated the extent of the problem. There are also concerns within the industry that tax changes to be introduced in April, specifically the increase of online gaming duty from 21% to 40%, will further fuel the growth of unlicensed operators.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves announced £26m in funding for the Gambling Commission in last autumn’s budget.Photograph: Tejas Sandhu/SOPA Images/Shutterstock“Britain is becoming a soft touch,” said Derek Webb, a multimillionaire former professional poker player and Labour donor who founded and funds the CFG. “We have allowed the global soft power of sport to be infected by organised criminality. Online gambling operators were irrationally permitted to stay offshore under the flawed 2005 Gambling Act, and this acceptance of offshoring enabled the theoretical excuse to justify black-market operations.“The Gambling Commission and the Betting and Gaming Council both ignored advice concerning the black market for many years. The Treasury has now provided funding to the Gambling Commission to enforce against illegal operators, but their understanding is insufficient.”As well as being the country’s most valuable competition, with around £12bn in TV rights deals globally of which £6.7bn is from the UK, Premier League clubs also have lucrative partnerships with licensed gambling companies so are hit by piracy on both fronts.During the 2024-25 season the Premier League’s anti-piracy team succeeded in removing more than 230,000 live streams from social media platforms and more than 430,000 copyright-infringing links from Google, but the new report shows the scale of the problem it is facing.Explore more on these topicsSportSport TVSport bettingGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

Much of the discussion centred on therevamped mixed doubles tournament, which had dominated the tennis discourse for days. With a smile, Allaster explained the amount of work that had gone into the event and cited the final attendance numbers for the week it was held. The US Open, she asserted, is now a three-week event.For many years, the traditional grand slam fortnight was preceded by a nondescript week of preparation. While lower-ranked players quietly worked through the qualifying draw in front of vacant stands, the top players finished their preparation to minimal fanfare. Access to the tournament grounds at theAustralian Open, French Open and US Open were free for qualifying. Still, few people came. To most hardcore fans, grand slam qualifying was an oasis for tennis hipsters, the sport’s best-kept secret.‘Smiling assassin’ Jordan Smith basks in spotlight after hitting $1m tennis jackpotRead moreThe secret is out. Over the past decade, the grand slams have gradually come to understand the great potential of their qualifying weeks and they have transformed them into true extensions of the tournament. These initiatives have been led by the Australian Open and the US Open, which at times seem to be in the middle of an arms race to build the most spectacular lead-in week possible.While the US Open branded its qualifying week as “Fan Week”, the Australian Open settled on “Opening Week”. The concepts are very similar, attempting to attract tens of thousands of fresh spectators, enticed by the promise of watching top players practise and other professionals compete for a fraction of the price of entry to the subsequent two weeks. A grounds pass ticket to the Australian Open’s Opening Week is good value at A$20 (£10), but at the US Open entry to the tournament grounds during Fan Week is free.Each day at the Australian Open this week, the tournament organisers have published comically large attendance records, with tens of thousands of spectators streaming through the gates of Melbourne Park each day. On Monday the 29,261 attendance eviscerated the previous record of 7,543 and on Thursday the figure was 35,805, with a total attendance of 136,248 in the first four days. Some have argued thatTennisAustralia’s marketing is actually too good, with a number of spectators complaining on social media after arriving on the grounds this week expecting to see main draw matches.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner signs autographs for fans who have turned out in force for a practice session during Opening Week at the Australian Open.Photograph: Andy Cheung/Getty ImagesThese days, the event is more akin to a festival than a tennis tournament. The grand slam oval, a large separate space filled with food venues and hundreds of seats, is located at the southern point of the grounds. The oval is built to host the masses of spectators that will enter the grounds once the main draw begins, but even on a Tuesday afternoon in Melbourne the seats are about 70% full. A stage sits at the centre and hosts a variety of trivia games, musical performances and player appearances.Beyond the exorbitant food and drink prices, these weeks also serve a positive purpose. They provide a platform to drive grassroots participation, with multiple mini-tennis courts around the grounds and a Kids’ Tennis Day on Saturday. Outside John Cain Arena, hundreds of parents have queued up each day to receive free rackets as part of Tennis Australia’s drive to give away a total of 5,000.View image in fullscreenThe revamped US Open mixed doubles led to some high-profile pairs taking part, such as Casper Ruud and Iga Swiatek (pictured), Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper, and Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/APDuring the open daytime practices this week, only the bottom half of the 15,000-seated Rod Laver Arena is open to spectators, yet Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz have filled out the entire second half of the bowl.

It feels fitting. The AELTC’s attempts to convert the private golf course directly across the road into an extension of the club, which would allow Wimbledon to hold its qualifying event on site, has been mired by various legal challenges. The proposals include converting some of the private space into a public park, along with 38 new grass courts and a new show court.While the other grand slam tournaments continue to expand at a dramatic pace, Wimbledon, which once towered above all others, is being left behind. The qualifying tournament is essentially held on a basic field in Roehampton. Between its relatively tiny grounds and the delicate nature of the grass surface – meaning it would be inadvisable to host pre-tournament events on Centre Court or Court No 1 – the All England Club’s current facilities are simply not compatible with the initiatives demonstrated at the other majors. Wimbledon is the last two-week grand slam tournament left.Explore more on these topicsAustralian OpenUS Open tennisTennisAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s kind of what we have done with mobile phones.”Starmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web. Buton Mondayhe told Labour MPs he would consider all options in curbing young people’s access to social media.Joe Ryrie, a co-founder and director of Smartphone Free Childhood, said every MP had been contacted about the issue, with some receiving more than 1,000 emails from constituents.“It has gone absolutely wild and it’s still growing really quickly,” Ryrie said. “Families from every part of the country are just saying the same thing: that children need strong protections from these global platforms built to maximise attention and profit.”Pressure continues to mount on the government to ban social media for under-16s after a fortnight of controversy about Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool being used todigitally remove the clothesof women and children.When Australiaintroduced a social media banfor under-16s last month, more than 4.7m social media accounts believed to be held by young people were removed in the first days of the law coming into force.In the UK the issue could come to a head next week when the House of Lords is due to vote on an amendment to thechildren’s wellbeing and schools billthat would prevent under-16s from accessing social media. If passed, the House of Commons would have to hold a binding vote on the issue in the next few months.Politicians across the political spectrum have called for restrictions on social media access for children and the NASUWT, one of the UK’s biggest teaching unions, hascalled for a ban.However, the youth mental health charity the Molly Rose Foundation has said a social media ban is “not the answer” and “penalises children for tech firms’ and successive governments’ failures to act”.A spokesperson from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said the Online Safety Act had taken bold steps to keep children safe. “A social media ban is not our current policy but we keep all options under review based on the evidence,” they said. “We are striking the right balance: protecting children from harm while ensuring they can benefit safely from the digital world.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaInternet safetyChildrenKeir StarmerWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

It did not specify whether people would still be able to create such images on the standalone Grok app.The prime minister, Keir Starmer, called X’s earlier decision to continue allowing the tool to be used by paid subscribers “horrific”. He also called the situation “disgusting” and “shameful” in parliament on Wednesday. Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, called it “a further insult to victims, effectively monetising this horrific crime”.Ofcom, the UK media regulator, on Mondaylaunched a formal investigationinto Musk’s platform after what it called “deeply concerning” reports of Grok being used to create and share illegal nonconsensualintimate images and child sexual abuse material on X.An Ofcom spokesperson said: “X has said it’s implemented measures to prevent the Grok account from being used to create intimate images of people. This is a welcome development. However, our formal investigation remains ongoing. We are working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what’s being done to fix it.”Kendall welcomed the latest move by X but said she expected Ofcom’s investigation to “robustly establish the facts”.Scrutiny of Grok has intensified globally after it emerged some people were using it to digitally undress women and children without their consent and posting those images to X. Thousands of these sexualised AI images have appeared X over the last few weeks. xAI, which makes Grok, also owns X, and both are run by Musk.The changes to the X and Grok systems came hours after the billionaire posted on his site: “I [sic] not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.”Musk’s xAI and X have faced growing backlash globally, including aninvestigation by California’s attorney generaland calls by lawmakers and advocacy groups for Apple and Google to drop Grok from their app stores. Countries including Malaysia and Indonesia have instigated bans or legal action.X said in a statement: “We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking child sexual exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”Use of AI to harm women has only just begun, experts warnRead moreMusk has said that Grok was programmed to refuse illegal requests and must comply with the laws of any given country or state. “Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user requests,” Musk said on Wednesday.Musk has said earlier on X that anyone using Grok to make illegal content would suffer the same consequences as if they uploaded illegal content.Three Democratic US senators last week called on Apple and Alphabet’s Google to remove X and its built-in AI tool Grok from their app stores, citing the spread of nonconsensual sexual images of women and minors on the platform. A coalition of women’s groups, tech watchdogs and progressive activists also made similar appeals to the tech companies.Last week, X curtailed Grok’s ability to generate or edit images publicly for users who were not paying subscribers. But industry experts and watchdogs said that Grok was still able to produce sexually explicit images, and that restrictions, such as paywalling certain features, may not fully block access to deeper AI image tools.In the UK, the law is changing this week to criminalise the creation of such images, and Starmer said on Wednesday that X was working to comply with the new rules.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsXElon MuskGrok AIAI (artificial intelligence)newsShareReuse this content"

The action is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places such as Taiwan.“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains,” the proclamation said, adding that the reliance was a “significant economic and national ‌security risk”.The White House said in a fact sheet that the tariffs would be narrowly focused and would not apply ​to chips and derivative devices imported for US datacenters – a huge consumer of AI chips – startups, non-datacenter consumer applications, non-datacenter civil industrial applications and US public sector applications.Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, has broad discretion to apply further exemptions, according to the proclamation.Shares ofNvidia, AMD and Qualcomm traded slightly lower in after-hours trading.Trump ‍in December said he would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports over Beijing’s “unreasonable” pursuit of chip industry dominance, but delayed the action until June 2027.That move followed a year-long “Section 301”unfair trade practices investigationinto China’s exports of “legacy”, or older-technology chips to the US, launched by former president Joe Biden’s administration.Questions had swirled about the universe of products containing chips that would be ⁠hit by the tariffs, the tariff rates, and whether any countries, products or companies would be exempt. Wednesday’s announcement, coupled with the news from December, suggests a ‍light touch from the administration on chip imports, for now.Trump last year announcedhe would allow Nvidia to sell H200 chipsto China in exchange for a cut of the sales of ‌those chips.Legal ‌experts questionedwhether such an arrangement would violate the US constitution’s ban on taxing exports.The Trump administrationthis week requiredthat China-bound chips make a detour from Taiwan, where they are made, through the United States for testing by a third-party lab. When the chips enter the United States, they are subject to the 25% tariff announced on Wednesday.Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We comply with all US export control laws and policies,” AMD said in a statement.Trump has deployed an ⁠array of tariffs aimed at bolstering ⁠US manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping ​new import tariffs, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm.In April, theTrump administrationannounced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of an effort to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.While US companies ‍like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips, most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Semiconductor Industry Association also could not immediately be reached.Trump, in the near future, may also impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products to incentivize domestic manufacturing, according ​to the fact sheet.An annex to the order clarifies that any 25% tariff imposed on semiconductors ‍under the order would not be stacked on top of the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under other section 232 orders. They would be exempt from duties on copper, aluminum and steel, auto ​and truck parts.Explore more on these topicsNvidiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAI (artificial intelligence)TariffsComputingUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Setting goals is hard; keeping them is harder – and failurecan bring abouticky feelings about yourself.This year, in an effort to game the system and tilt the scales toward success, somepeopleusedAIfor their 2026 resolutions. It’s the latest step in an ongoing trend: in September 2025, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, releasedfindingsshowing that using the AI chatbot for personal guidance is very common.The company’sinterpretationof this was that “people value ChatGPT most as an adviser rather than only for task completion.”But just because you can ask AI for life advice, should you? And is there an art to it? Here’s what experts say are the dos and don’ts.Lamar wants to have children with his girlfriend. The problem? She’s entirely AIRead moreThe pros and cons of chatbot guidanceAI-driven goal-setting isn’t inherently good or bad, explains Zainab Iftikhar, a Brown University PhD candidate, whoseresearchexamines artificial intelligence and users’ wellbeing. Artificial intelligence can lower the barrier to self-reflection and be genuinely empowering for some, she explains. For people who feel stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure of where to begin, prompts “can act as a scaffold” for expressing and understanding your ideas, says Iftikhar.If the AI has access to information you’ve either shared or asked it to generate, it’s also an efficient tool at synthesizing that information, explains Ziang Xiao, an assistant professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. The compilation and interpretation of your previous data could help you efficiently organize the thoughts that initiate your goals.But there are also drawbacks to using AI for goal-setting, says Iftikhar. Navigating the potential harms can come down to how well you know yourself – and how well you can navigate bad AI advice.The risks of using AI for personal growthBecause large language models (LLMs), the type of AI that drives these systems, are trained on large-scale human-generated data, they can reproduce assumptions about success, self-improvement and relationships, Iftikhar explains. LLMs are also predominantlytrainedon English text and tend toexhibit a biastoward western values.AI-suggested goals risk being over-generic, reinforcing “dominant cultural narratives, rather than what is meaningful for a specific individual”, says Iftikhar.It can be very difficult to detect this bias. AI chatbots can be persuasive in a way that individuals may have difficulty detecting if they are being nudged toward mismatched goals, says Xiao. These tools may “inappropriately affirm goals that may not actually be a great fit for you”, he says.Even if you use a chatbot frequently and request that it specifically base its responses on previous conversations, there’s still a chance that the chatbot’s replies will incorporate insights that have nothing to do with the information you’ve already shared, he explains.During her research, Iftikhar noticed that the people who are routinely correcting or ignoring bad AI responses are at an advantage in using AI itself. Those who are not, for a variety of reasons, including technical expertise, are “more likely to suffer from incorrect or harmful responses”, she explains.AI can also reflect the bias of the user asking it for guidance. In a 2024study, Xiao and colleagues observed that LLM users were more likely to become trapped in an echo chamber, compared with those who use traditional web searches.AI chatbots are designed to make us happy, explains Xiao. In a 2025paperpublished in the journal npj Digital Medicine, researchers show LLMs often prioritize agreement over accuracy. These tools are typicallyoptimizedwith human feedback that rewards agreeableness and flattery.In turn, chatbots engage in sycophancy, or excessive agreement, with users. (In May 2025, OpenAIannouncedit was rolling back an update that made ChatGPT too sycophantic.)How to be better at goal-setting with AIIftikhar says it’s worth being wary of tools that skip self-reflection or emotional processing in favor of tidy action plans.That said, AI can help brainstorm the actionable goals we want to set for ourselves, says Emily Balcetis, an associate professor of psychology at New York University. She recommends prompting AI to consider what obstacles you might face as you attempt to accomplish these goals, as well as back-up plans you might need.“Have it be a collaborator in how you’ll track your progress and monitor performance along the way,” says Balcetis.Xiao recommends critically analyzing the chatbot’s responses – and then giving it feedback. Does this plan actually fit with your life? Is it aligned with your priorities and hopes?“Try to give informative, quality feedback to the AI just as you would give feedback to another person,” says Xiao. “This process will help AI generate a more personable, realistic goal and help you consider the things that you really want.”Are you taking supplements correctly? Here’s a guide on their dosage limitsRead moreGood goal-setting also includes a review of why you haven’t pursued these goals already, explains EJ Masicampo, an associate professor of psychology at Wake Forest University.“When it feels like we’re failing at a goal, it’s often that we’ve just prioritized the other things we’re trying to do,” says Masicampo. Multiple goals are difficult to juggle, he explains. It can be more productive to examine one ambition and what’s obstructing your motivation to achieve it.Ultimately, chatbots may work best as reflective partners, albeit partners that don’t actually care about your success.“These tools sound very human-like, but by design, they can’t take responsibility for your actions,” says Xiao.For better or for worse, that is up to you.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAI (artificial intelligence)ChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Commodore 64 Ultimate, a new version of the legendary 8-bit computer, comes in a box designed to resemble the original packaging – a photo of the machine itself on a background of deep blue fading into a series of white stripes. Then when you open it, you find an uncannily accurate replica of what fans lovingly referred to as the breadbox – the chunky, sloped Commodore 64, in hues of brown and beige, the red LED in one corner above the row of fawn-coloured function keys. It’s like 1982 all over again.My dad bought us a C64 in late 1983. It was our second computer after the ZX81 and it felt like an enormous leap into the future with its detailed colour graphics, advanced sound chip and proper grown-up keyboard. We unpacked it on our dinner table, plugging it into a small portable TV and loading the one game we had, a very basic Donkey Kong clone named Crazy Kong. My life would never be the same again. This contraption was my obsession for the next four years – my friendships and free-time would revolve around games such as Bruce Lee, Paradroid and Hyper Sports. To this day, I treasure the memories of playing golf sim Leaderboard with my dad. The sound effects, speech samples and graphics conjured by that computer have lived rent free in my head for, god, almost 40 years.View image in fullscreenAn array of classic and modern inputs … Commodore 64 UltimatePhotograph: CommodoreCommodore was a huge success for a decade. It followed the 64 (which sold somewhere between 12-30m units) with the Amiga, another great gaming machine. But with the rise of the PC came a long painful decline – the company eventually filing for bankruptcy in 1994, the brand kept semi-alive for years afterwards by a series of intellectual property buyouts. In August 2025, however, retro YouTuber Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson, backed by a board of Commodore veterans, bought the brand and promised to reinvigorate it.The result is the Ultimate, a faithful reproduction, not just in looks (although you can opt for a Starlight edition with lots of LED lights and a transparent case), but in tech specs. Instead of running a software emulation of the C64, it’s built around an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) – an integrated circuit programmed to simulate the actual hardware. You can plug in an original C64 Datasette or disk drive and it will run original software (a wonderful touch is that if you’re running a disk file, the computer simulates the noise of a disk drive complete with whirs, tics and bleeps). It even has a cartridge port that will run old game carts such as International Soccer. To complete the scene, you can plug your old Quick Shot II into one of the two joystick ports. Then simply load up a copy of Daley Thompson’s Decathlon and immediately break it.View image in fullscreenBreaking joysticks as well as Olympic records … Daley Thompson’s Decathlon gamePhotograph: Ocean/MobyGamesBut it’s not just a machine for playing old games. Turn it on using the authentic power switch on the side and it boots into the original Commodore 64 start screen, complete with the words, “Commodore 64 Basic V2, 64K Ram system, 38911 Basic Bytes free. Ready.” And the flashing cursor. You can programme it just as you could back then, using Basic or, if you’re feeling advanced, assembly language. Obviously I tried everyone’s first program in the 1980s:10 print “keith is cool”;20 goto 10It worked. After that, I dug out an old program listing from Computer & VideoGamesmagazine and have been typing it in – although it’s a challenge as the print is small, faint and smudged after 30 years in my attic. On top of this, you can click the power button upwards and it switches to an alternate menu crammed with new options. You can plug in a USB thumb drive and load C64 games and apps that you’ve acquired online. The computer also comes with a sample USB drive (shaped like a cassette tape) that is filled with demos and games to try. Even better, it’s easy to connect it the internet via a wired or wireless connection, which gives you access to a community archive of games, as well as old school bulletin board systems, basically the 1980s equivalents of Reddit forums.What I love about the machine is this seamless integration of modern tech into a retro environment. You can plug it into a modern monitor via HDMI, but the menus and inputs are all redolent of the 1980s era – lists of text, Ascii art, cursor keys or W, A, S, D for navigation. The memories of interacting with this ancient hardware came flooding back. Everything you did on the C64 required some effort and expertise, whether that was loading a game or writing little programs – there was no drag-and-drop, no plug-and-play; you were a computer user not a platform consumer. In its press release announcing the product, Commodore referred to itself as “the Digital Detox Brand – a bold stand against today’s toxic tech”. And while that’s a little polemical and self-aggrandising, there’s some truth in it. Exploring the C64 these last few weeks has given me more pleasure than downloading an app on to my phone ever has.Set to be priced at £260.50 ($349.99/AU$524), it’s not cheap and begs the question – is there value to this machine beyond its appeal to original owners? I think there is. In a more accessible way thanthe incredible PDP-10 replicaI wrote about last year, it’s a living historical relic, a way to reconnect with the original concept of a desktop home computer – as something we learned and coded for. The excellent user’s guide it ships with is filled with useful information on how to get it to make music and display graphics; I sincerely hope that an alternative indie gaming scene thrives here as a result. There is intrinsic value in understanding computers at a fundamental level beyond slick user interfaces; there is value in developing a knowledge of how programs work, however simple.And even the machine’s nostalgic impact has worth. It has been fun to show my sons this fossilised contraption – no curated walls of games to buy, no ads, no pop-ups, no social media notifications. Meanwhile, playing those old games again has proven the value of great design and clever programming over hype and visual impact. It’s a lesson we could all afford to learn.Commodore 64 Ultimate is available from March, £260.50/$349.99/AU$524Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Like many people, Daisy (Lili Reinhart) works a desk job using a computer. Unlike most people, fainting at work is a rite of passage; she moderates videos on social media that have been reported for violating the terms of service. That means watching everything from horrible porn to horrible politics to horrible accidents and everything in between, a non-stop diet of videos with titles such as “fetus in blender” or “strangulation but she doesn’t die”.Her boss takes her to task for deleting a graphic video showing a suicide, which supposedly has news value and should have been left up. But the tipping point for Daisy is a really nasty video titled “nailed it”, which shows violence and cruelty that she believes is real and non-consensual. So begins a low-key quest to track down the perpetrator, though she is far from sure what she will do when she finds them. Nor is she altogether sure why it is this particular video, of all the trash and hatred washing over her, day in, day out, that has inspired her obsession. Her colleagues and boss shrug off her concerns: this video is nothing special.At its best, there’s a kind of gen Z Blow-Up dynamic at play here: much as inAntonioni’s swinging 60s classic, our protagonist may have stumbled across evidence of a serious crime in the course of doing her job, but is initially unsure what that might mean for her. Clickbait is just as interested in who Daisy is as a person and how she exists in modern society as it is in functioning as a procedural drama. Directed by Uta Briesewitz (Severance), this is a modest film, but an effective and thoughtful one.Clickbait is on digital platforms from 19 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSocial mediaDigital mediareviewsShareReuse this content"

But his short-term victories have profound long-term costs for his country and the worldThu 15 Jan 2026 14.09 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareThe Middle East was braced on Wednesday night, but the anxious petitioning of Gulf states and Iran’s attempts to appease the US president appeared to win out – at least for the moment. No bombs fell on Tehran. After all his threats, and with military options under discussion in Washington, Donald Trumpstepped back, announcing that “the killing [of protesters] has stopped”.Despite the telecommunications blackout, it seems clear that a ruthless regime has shed still more blood than in previous protest crackdowns. Rights groups say that thousands have been killed and vast numbers arrested; one official spoke of 2,000 deaths. Witnesses compared the streets to a war zone. If thelarge-scale killingshave indeed ebbed, that is probably because Iranians have been terrified out of the streets – for now, at least. Iran’s foreign minister chose Fox News to insist no hangings were imminent, in case the identity of the message’s one-man audience was in any doubt. But while retributionmay have been postponed, it will not be cancelled as it should be: the calls for the regime’s downfall are seen as an existential threat. The Iranian authorities can wait. Mr Trump will move on.Even as the threat of reckless military intervention in Iran receded, if only for the moment, the dangers facingGreenlandwere underscored as European troops flew in on Thursday. Meetings in Washington had failed to bridge the “fundamental disagreement” over its future, with Mr Trump reiterating that the US “needs” Greenland and Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, warning that the president is still set on “conquering” Greenland.Venezuelais on the back burner for now, after Mr Trump took his lap of victory for illegally snatchingNicolás Maduro. But he has already warned Cuba, Colombia and Mexico that they could be next. Alarmingly, the former anti-interventionist has concluded that foreign adventures have fewer costs than he anticipated and more gains. He hopes that menace, spectacle and diversion can work abroad as well as domestically.Richard Nixon’s “madman theory” was that presenting him as uncontrollable and volatile would keep adversaries in line. But Nixon had a clear strategic framework and aims. While the same cannot be said of Mr Trump, it would be wrong to see him as irrational. Despitegrandiose threats, he has often been cautious in military action. He does not need to follow through every time; he just needs people to know that he might. But his causes (resource grabs, imperial splendour, vengeance, “civilisational” supremacy and self-glorification) are alarming, his idea of victory is short-termist and egocentric, and caprice rules his court. He revels in unsettling his inner circle too.As a leading analyst of Irannoted this week, policymaking has shifted from a clear, deliberative, strategic process to bureaucracy mobilising in response to off-the-cuff presidential comments. Post-Maduro, Mr Trump is emboldened – and more likely to miscalculate. It’s telling that Iran’s regional rivals were key in holding him back from a strike, fearing the destabilisation of the region, the strengthening of Israel or perhaps the emergence of a still more hardline regime in Tehran.Addressing the French army in his annual speech on Thursday,Emmanuel Macronspoke of a brutal world “where destabilising forces have awakened”, with “competitors [Europe] never thought it would see”. He did not need to name names. Permacrisis is not just the cause and result of Trump – it’s his method too.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And they are in line with Trump’s willingness to use the national security state as a weapon against the press, which is a serious threat to our democracy. But those weapons were not invented by Trump nor did he pioneer their use against free press.The raid of Hannah Natanson, is a shocking escalation, not a rupture. The United States has been backsliding to this point – at both the federal and local levels – for quite some time.Following the publication of the Pentagon Papers, the Nixon administration turned to the first world war-era Espionage Act to prosecute whistleblowerDaniel Ellsberg. Nixon’s illicit campaign against Ellsberg, modelled after techniques like break-ins then routinely used by the FBI and CIA, tanked the prosecution. But the Espionage Act sat as a loaded gun against both journalists and their sources. It went largely unfired until the Obama administration.The former constitutional law professor had promised the most transparent administration in history. Instead, his administration normalized the archaic Espionage Act as the go-to weapons for prosecuting journalists’ sources. Whistleblowers, such asChelsea Manning,Edward Snowden,Thomas DrakeandJohn Kiriakou,who helped journalists inform the public about war crimes, torture and unconstitutional surveillance, were transformed into criminals.Targeting journalists’ sources is an affront to press freedom. It also quickly leads to targeting journalists. The Obama administration attempted to compel the national security reporter James Risen to name his source about a botched CIA covert action, threatening him with jail if he refused to name names.While the Department of Justicebackedoff on incarcerating the prestigious journalist, they put his alleged source, Jeffrey Sterling, on trial. Although Sterling maintains his innocence, he was convicted in partbasedon metadata that showed he had called or emailed Risen.Surveillingjournalists is key to building cases against their sources.As bad as these prosecutions were, the government’spursuitof WikiLeaks took the threat to press freedom to a whole new level. WikiLeaks source Manning was subjected totorturousconditions of confinement and a then unprecedented prison sentence. But the government was not satisfied with persecuting the source alone. From the beginning, there was anattemptto pursue publisher Julian Assange, as well.Manyspeculatedthat the harsh treatment of Manning was an attempt to turn her into a witness against Assange. During Trump’s first term, the moribund case against the WikiLeaks founder was resurrected in the form of an unprecedented Espionage Act indictment. Some of those counts dealt with pure publishing; the vast majority alleged the journalist-source relationship constituted a criminal offense. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Justiceextracteda plea deal from Assange.According to the plea deal, Assange, by receiving and publishing newsworthy information from Manning about US war crimes, backroom dealings, and abuses of power, was guilty of conspiring with her to violate the Espionage Act.Routinely prosecuting whistleblowers under the Espionage Act, surveilling journalists to enable the prosecution of their sources, and ultimately prosecuting a journalist himself under the Espionage Act all created the condition Trump needs to go after the press – not just legally, but in the court of public opinion.As we saw last week with the bipartisancongressional subpoenaof journalist Seth Harp, Americans and their representatives in Congress have been primed to accept the administration’s nonsensical claims that reporting government secrets is illegal “leaking” and that naming government officials driving the world’s biggest news stories is illegal “doxing”.It wasn’t always so easy to sell lawmakers on criminalizing routine journalism. Congress passed thePrivacy Protection Act of 1980in response to a raid of the Stanford Daily to find evidence against student demonstrators. The Daily, like Natanson, wasn’t accused of a crime.The US supreme court rejected the Daily’s lawsuit challenging the search, but Congress stepped in, recognizing the dangers of allowing law enforcement to commandeer newsrooms whenever journalists might have evidence they want. Lawmakers may have also foreseen how pretextual raids and seizures could be used to intimidate journalists, or to stop their reporting in its tracks by seizing their drafts, communications and research.The PPA was supposed to put an end to that. But the law is relatively toothless – victims can sue, but government officials can assert a good faith defense that essentially amounts to saying “my bad”. The law does not expressly bar admission of illegally seized evidence. That means its efficacy largely depends on police, prosecutors and judges taking it seriously.Too often, they don’t. The 2023 raid of theMarion County Record– based on a bizarre claim that reporters violated identity theft laws by pursuing a tip about a local restaurateur’s driving record – became the most famous example after the paper’s co-owner Joan Meyer died from shock the next day.Reached by email, her son, Record publisher Eric Meyer, expressed alarm at the Natanson raid. “Have law enforcement officials lost the ability to read?” he asked, noting the repeated disregard for the PPA’s protections. “The whole idea of searches and seizures isn’t about actually finding information. It’s about intimidating journalists and incriminating them in the eyes of the public.”Also in 2023, the Florida journalist Tim Burke’s home newsroom was ransacked by the FBI over Burke’s alleged violation of computer crime laws to find outtakes of Tucker Carlson’s Fox News interview with Ye where the musician went on an antisemitic rant. Many of the government’s tenuous legal theories have beendismissed(an appeal is pending) but the impact on Burke’s journalism can’t be undone. As Burke’s lawyer, Mark Rasch, explained, during newsroom raids “the government invariably seizes materials wholly unrelated to whatever they are investigating. That act alone has a chilling effect on freedom of the press.”There have been other examples. Police in San Francisco raided the home and office of the independent journalist Bryan Carmody in May 2019. The case against Carmody, like theMarionone, eventually fell apart and led to a lawsuit andsettlement. But the initial raids are what get the publicity, not the repercussions that bad actors may or may not later face.Case in point, San Francisco police again issuedanotherunlawful warrant to an independent news outlet just five years after the Carmody debacle. And Kansas cops ignored the lessons of the Marion case andsoughtan illegal warrant for a newspaper last year.The normalization of invading newsrooms, in violation of federal law and based on the flimsiest of pretexts, has now spread to the highest levels of the federal government (assuming prosecutors followed their ownguidelines, the Natanson raid should have been approved by Pam Bondi, the attorney general, herself).Combined with the decades-long attack on whistleblowers and national security journalists under a law that treats them no different from enemy spies, it’s a deadly weapon to be wielded against the free press, especially by a president who muses about journalists beingbeaten,jailed, and evenraped in prison.Seth Stern is the director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation and a first amendment lawyerChip Gibbons is the policy director ofDefending Rights & Dissent.

The US president has once again threatened to take control of the world’s biggest island, just like he didback in 2019and in2024/25. Yet it feels different this time.This time it seems as if there are more concrete plans being shaped within the Trump administration to annex Greenland. Trump wants to “take” it“whether they like it or not”, as he stated at a recent White House press conference. And the only option he seems to be offering currently is to do it “either the nice way or the more difficult way” – whatever that means. These are obviously plans for the forceful theft of Indigenous land and a self-governing territory; they are loud threats against our democracy – threats that are coming directly from the US president, again and again, through the media. That is scary. And the Greenlandic people do not feel safe.A diplomatic conversation finally took placeon Wednesday. The foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, Vivian Motzfeldt and Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, met in Washington DC, with the US vice-president, JD Vance, as host. That’s the same JD Vance who tried to set up an official visit to Greenland with his wife in March last year, but wasturned away by Kalaallitand ended up only visiting the US military base atPituffik. The one who has been veryvocal about his dissatisfactionwith the EU and Denmark’s efforts in the Arctic. As you can imagine, this became the basis for a great deal of unease for Kalaallit, and everyone seemed to be holding their breath while waiting for some kind of clarity on what was in store for the future of Greenland as this historic meeting was happening.After about an hour at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where the meeting was being held, the Greenlandic and Danish foreign ministers came out, lit a cigarette each, and had a chat before returning to the Danish embassy. It was an unexpected and surprisingly calming reaction that was noticed across the Kingdom of Denmark.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and Greenland’s foreign minister, Vivian Motzfeldt, speak to the media in Washington DC after a meeting with US senators, 14 January 2025.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersLater came the Greenlandic/Danish press conference, where Motzfeldt and Rasmussen announced that the US position hadn’t changed and that they had agreed to disagree. It was not a very satisfying statement. However, they also said that it had been agreed to establish a high-level working group to try to find a solution and accommodate some of the concerns the US president had expressed, regarding Arctic security. They added that they had also seized this opportunity to go against the untrue narratives about the Kingdom ofDenmarkthat the US has been pushing lately, and Motzfeldt had once again stated that Greenland does not want to become part of the US, but that this was a good opportunity to strengthen cooperation as allies. And I think most importantly she reported that the meeting had been characterised by a sense of mutual respect and a willingness to agree to meet further down the diplomatic road.Wednesday’s developments have created a brief moment to take a deep breath. But it is far from over. During the meeting, the White Houseposted a picture on X, showing two Greenlandic dog sleds having to make a choice between the sunny US or the stormy China and Russia (it also riffs on the “Which way western man?” meme, which is prominent infar-right subcultures). And Donald Trump stated, once again, that the US needed to take control of Greenland for security reasons. This unpredictability is scaring a lot of people – some are starting to prep in case of a US invasion; others are starting to consider emigrating. But for now, everyday life goes on.There is much speculation as to why Trump wants Greenland so much. Some say it is to get free access to therare earth minerals, as Greenland has very strict laws on mining and extraction. Others claim that it is for national and international security. However, the US already has a military base in Greenland and would be able to expand its military presence through the 1951 Greenland Defence Agreement if it wanted to. Plus, Denmark has recently increased its spending on security in the Arctic and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte finally revealed earlier this week that the alliance is working onstrengthening securityin the Arctic. Rutte had previously been criticised for his noticeable silence on this issue.Lastly for Trump, ownership is“psychologically needed for success”, because “ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document”. The truth is, we can only guess what the reasoning behind this madness is.Trump has said that the US will treat Greenlanders well. I doubt that will be the case. Because we also know that the president has a tendency to lie.There is great pressure on the Greenlandic people. We are constantly worrying whether our country will be taken by military force. We follow the news intently in fear of new threats. All eyes seem to be on us right now. We need to be clear: Greenland is not for sale.For a while, Greenland has been a warning sign to the rest of the world as to what to expect with the climate crisis, and unfortunately Greenland is now becoming a warning sign for what is happening in the world order. Things have changed in geopolitics. We’re hearing warnings on how democracy is at risk, how this decade everything is being reshaped. We witness how one Nato ally threatens another and gets away with it. This is alarming. So I think it is important to ask ourselves: what comes next? How far should we be willing to go to keep an unpredictable, insatiable ally content? And could this moment perhaps be seen as a chance for a critical self-reflection in colonial history?Malu Rosing is a Greenlandic writer and an Arctic adviserExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionUS foreign policyDenmarkDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

The Premier League proves that’s untrueLeander SchaerlaeckensThere are no salary caps and no luxury taxes, yet the world’s most-watched soccer league is only getting more balancedThu 15 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 06.01 ESTShareDavid Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.Current commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silversaid thenin his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships. And that’s what we’re seeing here.”“The goal isn’t necessarily to have a different champion every year,” Silver added. “It’s to have [...] parity of opportunity.”Pitch Points: Alonso’s future and Wrexham’s Premier League dreamsRead moreNFL commissioner Roger Goodell gave his own endorsement of competitive parity in 2011: “There are systems that we have to make sure that we maintain. When you come into a season, every fan thinks that their football team has a chance to win the Super Bowl.”When the Los Angeles Dodgers loaded up on talent yet again before the 2025 MLB season, seemingly fated to repeat as champions, commissioner Rob Manfredacknowledged that, “We certainly have owners in the game who are as concerned as fans are about the level of disparity in the game.”For decades, the heads of American sports leagues have argued that parity is necessary to sustain fan interest and to stay financially sustainable. And they have manipulated the talent market in all sorts of ways – with salary caps, revenue sharing, drafts, wealth and talent redistribution, “aprons”, and so on – in service of that goal.Yet the competitiveness of a league has no obvious bearing on its popularity. Baseball was never more popular than when the New York Yankees dominated it. The NBA’s cultural ascent coincided with the Celtics and Lakers’ decade-long duopoly, followed by the Chicago Bulls dynasty. Manchester United won thePremier Leaguejust about every year as the circuit became globally dominant.Concerned about sustainability? Don’t be. Professional teams that lost money often double ashandy instruments to write off taxesfor billionaires while the asset steadily appreciates anyway. To a cynic, parity has always felt like an excuse to short-change the players, a contrived cover for cost-controls and labor suppression.Lately, the flaws in the parity principle have been delightfully illustrated by the Premier League, the sports world’s ongoing experiment to determine what happens when virtually no brakes are applied to runaway globalized capitalism. Past the halfway point of this season, just nine points separate fourth-place Liverpool from 15th-place Bournemouth. Sixth-place Newcastle are three points from 12th-place Everton. In sum, seven teams sit within the swing of a single game. Which is to say that with no parity mechanisms whatsoever, almost all the teams in the league are competitive.They can’t all win the thing, exactly, but through an ever-evolving class of owners who treat their Premier League clubs as anything from vanity projects to investment vehicles to soft-power plays, a broad upper class and a huge middle class of teams have emerged.Sam Coffey’s Man City move is another blow for a hamstrung NWSLRead moreThe league’s largely unfettered economics – with the profitability and sustainability rulesnow tweakedto merely limit clubs to spending no more than 85 percent of their footballing earnings on their squads – practically require every club to spend at a competitive level every single season. This has caused a flattening of the talent level between many teams, and forced the smaller clubs to get smarter and better. In either case, the situation stands in stark contrast to the American system, in which many parasite teams allowed to feed off their more ambitious peers.Meanwhile, the Premier League’s 20 teams are trending towards more competitive balance. Liverpool’s 84-point title last season was the lowest haul since Leicester City’s fluky (if thrilling) championship in 2015-16, when all the habitual contenders happened to have an off-year at exactly the same time.More tellingly, perhaps, is the uptick in the average points total of the middle third, give or take, of the Premier League table in the past four seasons and change. In 2021-22, the clubs who finished eighth through 13th averaged 49.5 points over the course of the campaign. That number ticked up by half a point over the next two seasons, before jumping to 54.7 in 2024-25. So far, 2025-26 is on pace to post a figure of 53.7, suggesting that something lasting may be shifting. (The 2020-21 season did produce a 54-point average, but that was a significant outlier to the three seasons before and after it.)Certainly, you could point out that this competitive balance may exist organically in the Premier League but eludes almost every other league in the world, save for Italy’s Serie A. But then the closest comparator to the Premier League in our little parity case study isn’t the European continent’s legacy soccer leagues. It’s the other best-in-class, globally popular circuits that dominate their sports: the NFL, the NBA and MLB.At least a half-dozen Premier League teams, and as many as eight, have the resources to mount a plausible title challenge in any given season. That’s about a third of the league. Three-quarters of the top-tier clubs stand a reasonable chance of finishing in the top half or better.That’s a kind of parity, too. Yet it was achieved without manipulating the market to the detriment of the players and, ultimately, the product.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.

Even if he doesn’t actually do it, this is a new era: a post-western world of illiberal international disorder.The task now for liberal democracies in general, andEuropein particular, is twofold: to see this world as it is and to work out what the hell we’re going to do about it.A global public opinion poll published today is a useful starting point. It was conducted last November in 21 countries for the European Council on Foreign Relations, in partnership with ourEurope in a Changing Worldresearch project at the University of Oxford (and do please readthe full report, which I have written with Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard). This is the fourth ina series of pollswe’ve done every year since Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, so we can see how things have evolved from very bad then to critical now.Back in 2022,we founda transatlantic west united in outrage at the full-scale invasion of Ukraine but divided from other great and middle powers, such as China, India and Turkey, who were quite happy to go on doing business as usual with Russia. The Russian economy was surviving unprecedented western sanctions because those other states now had sufficient wealth and power between them to counterbalance even a united west. So this was already a post-western world, but still with a west acting in it.Trump 2.0 has changed all that. Now we have a post-western world, but with no coherent geopolitical west acting in it. To the extent that any strategic coherence should be attributed to the erratic narcissism of Trump, his approach is closer to that of Putin than it is to that of any US president since 1945. As his right-hand man Stephen Millerfrankly explains, they believe the world is “governed by strength … by force … by power”.Europeans have understood this. Astonishingly, less than one in five continental Europeans (taking an average of the 10 EU countries we surveyed) and just one in four Britons now see the US as an ally. In Ukraine, the figure is down to 18%. We Europeans do still see the US as “a necessary partner”, but not as an ally.The rest of the world is also waking up to this. While inour first poll, 60% of Chinese respondents saw American and European approaches as the same or similar (ie there’s a single west), now just 43% say that, while a clear majority thinks they are different. As of now, the west is history.So what should we do about it? The worst thing we could do is to go on bleating about the lost “rules-based international system”, making selective invocations of international law (Ukraine but not Gaza) while continuing the sycophantic appeasement of Trump. At the same time, we obviously don’t want to behave like him or Putin.What we need is a new internationalism: faster, more flexible, harder-edged. Reject the use of force but embrace the use of power. Don’t fixate on existing structures and alliances but seek a wider range of partners, pragmatically, from issue to issue. Worry less about rules, more about results; less process, more progress. This is a challenge particularly to the institutional EU, the ultimate slow-moving, rules-based, process-heavy instantiation of 1990s-style liberal international order.Yet we are already beginning to do it for Ukraine, with the novel combination of a coalition of the willing and the EU itself moving at what, for Brussels, is warp speed. As Iargued last month, we should urgently prepare to sustain an independent Ukraine even without US support.What aboutGreenland? First, we should be guided in everything we do by the elected governments of Greenland and Denmark. That, after all, is what distinguishes liberal democrats from authoritarian imperialists.On Wednesday, Denmark and some of its European Nato allies announced the sending of further troops to Greenland. The foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmarkthen met in Washingtonwith the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and agreed to set up a high-level working group. It’s quite clear the fundamental disagreement has not been resolved. All the signs are that Trump is going to get more extreme and unpredictable as time goes by and his domestic difficulties increase.So here are a few suggestions. To highlight the European commitment, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, French president Emmanuel Macron and British prime minister Keir Starmer should visit Greenland, along with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen. They should be joined by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, since Canada is theNatoally that is Greenland’s actual western neighbour and directly impacted by Arctic insecurity.If they can take a train to Kyiv, they can take a plane to Nuuk. Oddly enough, this visit may be as important as the substance of the security commitment, for President Trump’s second language is television. He’ll get the message from the pictures. A number of highly visible, vividly uniformed European and Canadian liaison officers should be stationed in Greenland for the foreseeable future.On Tuesday, Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said if they have to choose, “we choose Denmark … we choose the EU”. So the EU should rapidly find a way to increase its currently tinyfinancial support to Greenland– and not just, as apparently planned, in the new budget period starting in 2028. This will be a good occasion for European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and European council president António Costa to get on the plane to Nuuk.While they are there, they should start a strategic discussion about a possible future close relationship between an independent Greenland and the EU. It’s quite clear that the EU of tomorrow is going to have a range of customised relationships with key neighbours, including the UK, Ukraine, Turkey and Canada. Why not also with Greenland?Meanwhile, Europe – the US’s biggest single economic partner – should privately review the full range of economic responses (including, for example, selling off US Treasury bonds) it could make in the still unlikely event of Trump ordering a Putin-style military takeover of Greenland. The outline of these contingency plans could be discreetly conveyed to the White House via US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent or presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.There are doubtless other possible moves, but the general thrust is clear: a Europe (and Canada, and other liberal democracies) projecting quiet strength, power and resolve.One of the most depressing findings in our poll is that Europeans lead the world in pessimism. Almost half of them don’t think the EU can deal on equal terms with global powers such as the US and China. If we start practising this new, faster, harder-nosed internationalism, maybe more Europeans will believe in Europe again.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDenmarkNatoEuropeDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Now my Indian-born dad is scared ICE will take him from his American care homeThu 15 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 03.07 ESTShareAs an American of mixed Danish and Indian heritage, who is also a citizen of France and, therefore, of the EU, Donald Trump’s contempt for the rule of law fills me with dread. “I don’t need international law,”he boastedon 7 January in an interview with the New York Times. For Louis XIV, it was “L’état, c’est moi”. For Trump, it’s the “Donroe doctrine”, or “thewestern hemisphere is minefor whatever profit I and my elite group of loyal courtiers can wring from it”.At the same time, Trump’s honesty about his intention to use the astonishing military power he wields for unfettered plunder is at least refreshing. No more American pieties to democracy and human rights. The world hasn’t seen this kind of unabashed dedication to amassing wealth since the British East India Company. All hail thenew king emperor! Or else.As an American, I am horrified by the lethal violence unleashed by ICE thugs across the US, even if, on my Danish-American mother’s side, I am descended from the“right” kindof immigrants, according to Trump: white, Protestant northern Europeans. By a twist of history involving the 1911 utopian Danish settlement of Solvang in California, I have a slew of cousins in Denmark. I keenly feel their anguish at what ishappening with Greenland. They are good, kind people who can’t understand why the US is now turning against one of its most loyal allies.As a citizen and resident of France, I feel like standing up and singing the Marseillaise with tears in my eyes, as in thefamous sceneof defiance in Casablanca, only this time it’s to protest against American fascism, not the Nazis. Do my neighbours in a little village south of Paris thinkl’américaineis an internal enemy? Neighbours who, just a year and a half ago, gratefully celebrated the80th anniversaryof the liberation of France by the Americans?On my paternal, Indian side, it’s a different story. My father was born in 1930 as a subject of the British empire. Like many Indians of his generation, he bears lifelong psychological scars from his perceived position of inferiority. Though the postwar US of 1949 was hardly free of racism, it offered him educational and professional opportunities he did not have in India, and may not have had anywhere else in the world.But under Trump, the old wounds of empire are being reopened. This 95-year-old man, a naturalised citizen of the US since the 1960s, who, as an aeronautical engineer worked on the Apollo mission to put a man on the moon, helping the US win the space race against the Soviet Union, confided last December that he is afraid ICE will come to his care home, seize him in his wheelchair and deport him. He’s brown. He knows he is no longer wanted in Trump’s US. This is the kind of fear the Trump regime, aided by far-right European parties who pine for the white dominance of lost empires, wants to bring toEurope. It terrifies me.The Danes, like all other Europeans, are no strangers to imperialism. Denmark had its own East India Company back in the day. Its main Indian factory was located on the Coromandel coast south of Chennai, formerly Madras, inTranquebar. IndianTamils were traffickedto Denmark as enslaved servants. With support from the Danish crown, Danish Lutheran missionaries had arrived in Tranquebar in the early 1700s.As they did in Greenland. After neglecting the island for many years, the Danish crown sent a Lutheran missionary, Hans Egede, to Greenlandin 1721. He went about converting the native people to Christianity. Such were the beginnings of Denmark’s efforts to civilise theIndigenous peopleof Greenland, resulting centuries later in shameful social engineering projects such asforced sterilisationandtaking children awayfrom Greenlander parents.Europe must now tell Trump that enough is enough – and cut all ties with the US | Alexander HurstRead moreIt is an ugly history but, sadly, no worse than the treatment of native peoples by other European powers elsewhere. Under “manifest destiny”, the celebratedideological underpinningof Trump’s white supremacist Maga movement and of his project of imperial expansion, the extermination of native peoples in the US was enthusiastically pursued. If anyone thinks the racist Trump lot will be more respectful of native Greenlanders’ human rights than a now chastened Denmark, they’re a fool. Wait until US ICE units, finally appropriately named, arrive in Greenland.Denmark’s Caribbean possessions, a legacy of the era of slavery and plantation sugar production, were sold to the US in 1916, becoming the US Virgin Islands. In exchange, the US secretary of state signeda letterstating that “the government of the United States of America will not object to the Danish government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland”. This is the basis of Denmark’s claim to sovereignty – over any by the US – over the now autonomous territory of Greenland: a land dealbetween one big new imperial power and a much smaller, older imperial power.My father’s fear as an immigrant of colour to the US is similar to the fear of recent immigrants in Denmark who face eviction and deportation under a Danish “ghetto law” that the European court of justice ruled just last month may be illegal under EU law. (The current UK governmentwishes to emulateDenmark’s immigration policy.) Breaking the law to get rid of unwanted, dark-skinned foreigners? That sounds more like Trump than what one would hope from Denmark, whose only protection from the new imperial raider is respect for the rule of law.It should be clear by now that the existence of the rule of law anywhere – whether inMinneapolis, inBrussels, or in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk – is an insufferable affront to Trump’s power. It’s an affront we in Europe must be prepared to deliver if we wish to preserve ourselves.Mira Kamdar is a Paris-based writer and author ofIndia in the 21st Century.

Keep watchingThu 15 Jan 2026 13.19 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareThe best thing right now would be to read the turmoil in the Tory party as told by the spy novelist Len Deighton. He would give us more detail on Robert Jenrick’s defection media-handling plan: a statement on what a future in Reform meant to him, how he’d wrestled with his decision to leave the Conservatives behind. Kemi Badenoch would discover it by a process of intricate deduction, rather than the more likely story – that some mischief-maker leaked it to her. The trail of clues would be ever more ominous, as Jenrick skipped opportunities to show loyalty to his party leader, mysteriously didn’t show for longstanding commitments. The betrayal would unfold slowly in scarce-to-be-believed fashion until, wham: someone saw his to-do list. Iron turquoise shirt. Call Sophy Ridge.Instead, Jenrick’sejection from his partyis slightly spoiled, from a storytelling point of view, by the chaos of conjecture and semi-analysis. What happened this afternoon was beyond Deighton. For hours, Nigel Farage would confirm only that he’d had conversations with Jenrick, and stated categorically that he hadn’t signed a deal with him. There were questions over whether Badenoch had successfully ruined Farage’s Westminster press conference, planned for 4:30pm today, where he would purportedly reveal Jenrick as his latest defector. And even more about what it would mean for Jenrick’s political ambitions, inside or outside the Tory party.And then, the press conference came. Farage insisted there was no imminent deal with Jenrick and that a defection, if it came at all, could be months off. Badenoch sacking Jenrick had been seen by some as evidence of her political nous, blindsiding both him and Reform. Torching this narrative and basking in his own opportunism, Farage said: “I want to say thank you to Kemi Badenoch. This is the latest Christmas present we have had. I welcome Robert Jenrick into this room and into Reform UK.” Except it was something of a wait for his latest Tory acquisition to step into the light – a vacuum Farage was forced to fill until his new champion arrived to applause. Theytook the applause and shared the stage, but there is an immediate question: how long will that stage be big enough for the both of them?Show some gratitude, people – Nadhim Zahawi has joined Reform for our benefit, apparently | Marina HydeRead moreFor all the bonhomie and jollity on display, it is a mixed blessing for Reform when senior Conservatives defect: while it solidifies its claim to be the new centre of rightwing gravity in British politics, it has staked that claim on the basis that it is the outsider, that it is the new breed. The more high-profile itsConservative joiners, the more it’s associated with (arguably tainted by) old eras of Conservatism, whether that’s Nadine Dorries as an emblem of the Boris Johnson era, or Nadhim Zahawi as lieutenant to every Tory prime minister since Theresa May.It’s hard to ignore the relational fallout, all the old enmities that will have to be skimmed over or forgotten. Farage hasexplicitly called Jenrick “a fraud”in the recent past, though of insults, my personal favourite was“he is no friend of Epping”. Zia Yusuf, Reform’s punchy former chair, has claimed on X that Jenrick is aFarage impersonator. It’s hard to imagine them working together harmoniously, but it’s often hard to imagine Reform’s leading lights working together at all, yet here they still are.As engrossing as these personal considerations are, there is nothing dramatic about this from the perspective of values. Jenrick spent most of last year establishing how comfortable he was around the tropes of the far right, whether that’s immigrants posing a threat to women and girls (specifically, hewrote in the Daily Mail, his daughters) or Birminghamnot having enough white peoplein it. He will fit in fine with Reform, as he would with the BNP.In an earlier press conference today, Farage sought to amp up the then rumoured defection as an earthquake for British politics,saying that“for all the talk that Kemi’s doing better at PMQs, for all the talk of a supposed Kemi bounce, on 8 May, the Conservative party will cease to be a national party”. Which would indeed be dramatic if the earthquake only happened this afternoon, but it’s been happening in slow motion since 2016 reshaped the Tory hegemony. Since May quit in despair, since the membership dwindled to its current hardcore, since its nativist and pop-con voices became dominant.Even through the return to sense that Rishi Sunak was supposed to represent, the party bears no resemblance to the unflappable, centre-right, establishment institution that historically defined its role. Do those mainstreamConservativesstill exist, the ones that put business interests first, who are open-minded about immigration in the service of growth, who want life on the poverty line to be hard but not unlivable, who liked Europe for its seamless trade and prosecco? There seem to be a few of them in the Labour party, but as voters, who’s to say; they are no longer represented, and therefore are invisible.Farage would have us believe that pragmatists and conservation-minded one-nation Tories are extinct, because of course he would; that effectively anoints him. Badenoch wants to persuade us that she represents the whole of the right because, again, of course she does; that lends legitimacy to her posturing that is otherwise just Reform-only-less-exciting. Both strive for a populist energy and seek to dignify it with yesterday’s branding. It’s a hollow marketing exercise, and as such, Jenrick – the man of the moment – does seem its ideal mascot.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I spent eight years behind bars in Iran’s notorious Evin prison. I was tortured. I remember it as if it happened yesterday.Every few years, uprisings erupt across Iran – and each wave of resistance is deeper and more widespread than the one before. In 2022, it was women who led theWoman, Life, Freedom movementafter the murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini by the country’s “morality police”, and it revolutionised my country. Today, women wear what they want, go out in public with their boyfriends – even live with them – without fear of being arrested. Women earned these rights with their lives. In late December 2025, the spark was once again lit – this timein an old bazaar in Tehran.The demands are the same ones we raised in the 1980s: an end to poverty, corruption and unemployment, the right to organise, and freedom from repression. Despite the gains for women’s freedoms made since 2022,workers are still denied basic labour rights. Students are arrested and even executed for peaceful protest.Womenare still fighting for fundamental rights. People are still risking their lives to stand up to torture and state violence.The regime’s response has been brutal. Human rights organisations report security forcesshooting into crowdsof largely peaceful protesters. I have seen heartbreaking images of families desperatelylooking for their loved onesamong hundreds of body bags. The true death toll remains unknown, but reports suggestmore than 2,000 peoplehave been killed. Given the scale of the protests and the footage of violent clashes, the real number is probably far higher.According to the Human Rights Activists news agency, by the end of the 17th day of protests18,434 people had been arrestedand, so far,97 forced confessionshave been broadcast on state television. These scenes bring back painful memories of my own imprisonment, where many people were tortured until they “confessed”. For survivors like me, moments like this reopen old wounds. I still see the faces of friends who were executed.The regime is terrorising civilians, burning shops and destroying beautiful, historic bazaars.Doctors are reportedly preventedfrom treating the wounded. Injured protesters are taken away from their hospitalbeds. But despite the killings, people are still in the street. They say they have nothing to lose but their chains.But the situation is changing so quickly. As of yesterday, military vehicles now patrol the streets in Tehran day and night, stopping anyone who dares go out. Only bakeries remain open, and people are leaving their homes only to buy the bare necessities.Now, Iran has been plunged intoan internet blackout. The regime wants to hide its crackdown from the rest of the world and stop Iranian people from organising. For those of us in exile, we wait in agony for news. I have not been able to reach my family and friends for more than a week. Watching the few grainy videos that reach us, survivors like me relive our worst nightmares.When I fled Iran, I left everything behind – my family, my friends, my home. I was lucky though, I survived. I rebuilt my life. Many others did not.Freedom fromTorturehas supported Iranian survivors like me for years, and in 2024 they assisted more people from Iran than any other country. For those who have escaped, the harrowing reports of brutality the world has been hearing since December are deeply triggering. We know exactly what the regime is capable of.My heart aches for my country. Iran has gone through half a century of war against its own people. Our society is deeply wounded, but the status quo cannot continue, because the Iranian people will never give up fighting for their rights and freedoms. Iran’s rulers use torture to silence dissent and instil fear. They tried to take my voice away because I dared to dream of equality and freedom. Today, I use that voice to speak out about the horrors that continue, and to ask the world to speak up for Iranian people.Since 2022, I’ve watched with dismay as global attention has drifted away from Iran. Silence only empowers those who torture and kill with impunity. The international community and the media must keep shining a light on what is happening.We must raise the political cost of executions. We must demand the release of political prisoners. We must insist that the use of torture ends right now. We must stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the Iranian people, in their struggle for what many of us in the UK take for granted every day: freedom, dignity and a life without fear.Nasrin Parvaz is a women’s rights activist and torture survivor from Iran.

They simply don’t know how to flirtLouis HansonCall it tall poppy syndrome or the nonchalant olympics, but we’ve grown accustomed to an almost nonexistent form of flirting from the local male speciesThu 15 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 19.55 ESTShareA few months ago, I posted aviral video onlinehighlighting the flirting differences between American and Australian men.Prompted by a recent trip to New York, I’d observed that the American man was rather forward and proactive in his advances; he was much more likely to stop you – a stranger – on the street, at a bar, or literally at any public location for that matter, to compliment you or enquire about your relationship status.Hey, I like your outfit! Hey, you have nice eyes! Hey, you’re not from around here, are you?It’s enough to make one’s day, or to send shivers down one’s spine, depending on how you generally feel about human interaction.‘Am I doing this right?’: how to master the lost art of flirtingRead moreAt this point, I must note, I’m not talking about creepy, boundary-crossing advances (yuck); I mean flirting in a genuine, putting-oneself-out-there kind of way. Let’s say you’re at a cafe and you’re sitting near a guy that you find attractive. After exchanging some glances, he comes over to you to spark a friendly conversation. Respectable, flattering, fun – the good kind of flirting!Despite the fun, I still found the forwardness quite shocking; I wasn’t used to it. The mere presenceof flirting over in the States illuminated the sheer absenceof flirting back here in Australia.Sure, the Australian man may bless you with the occasional glance in your direction. He may deliver you a little upwards nod from across the bar, while looking you up and down. He may even chuck you a wink, if you’re lucky. But compared with American men, the Australian does not flirt at all.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Why do Australian men refuse to put themselves out there? What happened to a little flirtin’ and romancin’? Is the American way of flirtingtooover the top?The one thing that did surprise me, though, was the number of people in the comment sectionsupportingthe Aussie way of flirting (or lack thereof) – for every comment that recoiled in disgust at the Australian man’s feeble courting attempts, there was also a comment along the lines of “give me the Australian method of flirting any day”.“Maybe this is why, as an Australian woman, American men freak me out,” one commented. “They’re so complimentary, it gives me the heebie jeebies, like why are you being so nice? What’s wrong with you?”“The bar is so low in Australia,” another added, “I’d probably freak out if [I was] approached like the American man.”Sure, it may seem over the top, but it does beg the question: have we – the girls and the gays – become so used to the bar being so low in Australia, that anythingabove the bare minimum seems weird? Or maybe I’m reading into it too much, and some people just prefer the nondescript, low-key, Aussie way of flirting.Personally, I prefer to be showered in praise every moment of every day (the US approach), but each to their own.Louis Hanson is a writer, comedian and presenterExplore more on these topicsDatingOpinionRelationshipsAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

Responsible governments should simply ban itGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastThu 15 Jan 2026 00.14 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 00.15 ESTShareBillionaire and career Bond-villain cosplayer Elon Musk has been forced by public backlash into ahumiliating backdownover use of his AI chatbot, Grok. Watching the world’s richest man eat a shit sandwich on a global stage represents a rare win for sovereign democracy.Because – unlike his company history oflabourandsafety abuses… hisexploding rockets… his government interventions thatdeny aid to the starving…disabling Starlink internet systemsin war zones … sharing “white solidarity” statements … or growing concern aboutovervaluations of his company’s share price– the nature of Grok’s latest scandal may finally be inspiring governments towards imposing some Musk-limiting red lines.Scully, I want to believe.Musk’s X to block Grok AI tool from creating sexualized images of real peopleRead moreIn its signature tone of “insufferable jerk who’s just completed his first online webinar on how to patronise girls”, Musk’s chatbot appeared this week to make the world less safe, less fair and perhaps even as unpleasant as a fascist-styled, ketamine-addled rich-kid dipshit in cheese hat dancing while the world burns, if one could imagine such an awful thing.Grok’s latest notoriety isn’t because it’s shared false information – though it has, previously,downplayed the Holocaustdue to a claimed “programming error” and, more recently, spread conspiracy-style claims about theBondi massacre.It’s not because of Grok’santisemitic comments, or random claims of “white genocide” within unrelated conversations.It isn’t about the fallibility of AI chatbots more broadly, either – even thoughconsumer advocates,health professionals,media associationsand perhaps everyone who’s ever taught at a university ever have repeatedly warned chatbot “advice” is recklessly unreliable.If you’re asking what behaviours could’ve possibly been left to condemn in the wake of Grok once accepting the name “MechaHitler”, I envy your naivety – because the answer is: Grok released tools enabling the creation and sharing of nonconsensual sexual exploitation images.Grok’s “spicy mode” capacity launched in August, and by December its host platform X was “deluged with images of women and children whose clothes (were) digitally removed”. Last week, researchers in Paris reported finding800 pornographic imagescreated by Grok’s tools, including depictions of sexual violence. AUK-based internet-monitoring groupreported users of a dark web forum boasting about Grok creating “sexualised and topless imagery of girls aged between 11 and 13”.Formerly confined to the internet’s darker corners, “nudifying” deepfake tools have been used for the image-based abuse of children and adults fromBacchus Marsh, Australia to Almendralejo, Spain, creating content so “vomit-inducing” a bipartisan US Congress prohibited it in the Take it Down Act last year. Yet Grok placed tools with similar functionality within reach of any aspirational sex offender with X access. Public complaints metastasised over new year while the platform generated up to7,751 sexualisedimages per hour.The alternative is give in, give up … and accept reality in the image of the Grok that Musk builtAcross Australia, the US, the UK, EU states, and many others, it’s not just the consumers of child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual image-based abuse who are criminalised. It’s also the makers. It’s the publishers. It’s the hosts.Musk’s response?First, he posted laugh-cry emojisat “bikinified” images, then hiscompany claimedit had somehow restricted the service just by paywalling their generation. Condemned as insufficient, Musk subsequently published a statement saying that using Grok to make “illegal content” would draw equivalent punishment to uploading it – ignoring Grok’s facilitation role. When Britain joined other countries – notably Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil – accelerating investigations into X’s compliance with local laws, Musk cried censorship … and shared deepfaked images ofKeir Starmer, tits out, in bikini.As scrutiny intensified this week, he ultimately declared he wasnot aware of any “naked underage images”being generated on the platform. Now, the tool’s been removed.Note,15civil society, internet and child safety groups wrote to xAI last August, warning “a torrent of obviously nonconsensual deepfakes” was “entirely predictable”.The definition of addiction is the compulsive repetition of harmful behaviour. My name’s Van Badham, and I’m hooked on hopium, jonesing for any sign there’s a democratic government left on earth now inspired to go full Gandalf against the Balrog and slap Musk down.X/Grok hosted image-based abuse, its owner was contemptuous of our sovereignty. It wasn’t its first scandal, it won’t be its last: responsible governments should simply ban it.Musk’s AI tool Grok will be integrated into Pentagon networks, Hegseth saysRead moreWe all know why they haven’t: Musk uses his influence to wade into electoral contests of countrieshe doesn’t even live in. His $44bn purchase, X, operates as a personal propaganda fountain, platforming his preferred flavours of far-right crap at such strength and volume that Stockholm-syndromed Twitter remnants mistake it for public opinion.It’s not, but self-recruited digital stormtroopers mobilise from its public permission structures into acts of unforgivable cruelty. Images of Renee Good’sdead bodywas being digitally altered by Grok within days of her being killed by an ICE agent.There was a time when leaders sought government to influence history, not to roll over supine to unelectable dweebs they would have rightfully avoided at high school. US SecDef Pete Hegseth’s incomprehensible announcement this week that – yes – Musk’s very sameGrok will be the AI integrated into the Pentagon’s military systemsguarantees an IT lesson in “garbage in, garbage out” on an epic historical scale; but the political timeliness of global outrage and horror towards X/Grok’s cumulation of reckless behaviours may be everyone else’s best chance to escape it.The alternative is give in, give up … and accept reality in the image of the Grok that Musk built: ugly as a cybertruck, unfunnyas a sink– and as powerless as a child stripped naked by adults while other adults stand around them doing nothing.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionXElon MuskDeepfakecommentShareReuse this content"

Where to turn to now?Wed 14 Jan 2026 20.13 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 00.37 ESTShareWhat is the name for the grief of losing a restaurant? Surely the Germans have a word for it.Many Sydneysiders will be keening and lighting candles for Abdul’s, a beloved Lebanese restaurant with threadbare carpets, laminated menus, a man who could roll a kebab for the Olympics and the most delicious food. After being a staple and a landmark for decades, it’s difficult to believe it has really gone.Abdul’s occupied a key corner shop in a part of Sydney that used to be somewhere to avoid. When you paid for your meal, only the strongest willed could resist picking up a baklava or turkish delight. The hummus was smooth. The service curt. It was perfect.I took my city kids on a road trip to teach them about the outback – and learned a few lessons myself | Emily MulliganRead moreOne of Abdul’s primary charms was that it never changed. You could expect the assuring toss of the bag of Lebanese bread on the table as you sat down. They were among the last businesses to accept payment by card. The decor remained unchanged since I first went there as a child. None of this was a deterrent. It had legions of fans.In fact, my devotion to Abdul’s predates my birth. My parent’s first date was at Abdul’s, leaving my mum with the impression Dad was cheap, but I’m pretty sure the shawarma won her over. I can’t imagine it being anything Dad said.Relevantly, my parent’s thirtysomething wedding anniversary was also held at Abdul’s. In fact, all key family events were marked there – partners and kids indoctrinated as they came along. Birthdays, pregnancy announcements: Abdul’s was always our go-to as life happened. It was a constant.The family who ran it felt like quasi characters in our lives: dependable, always there, churning out excellent food day in, day out. I can only imagine what our city was like in the mid-60s and how extraordinary Lebanese food must have seemed when they opened their doors. My only frame of reference for a family-run business is watching Succession – so it seems complicated. And yet Abdul’s ran for 60 years, which shows something about how special it was. Both in felafel quality and the family behind it.It was appreciated by so many, whether for a quick kebab where everything was dependably fresh, or a banquet where upon completion you’d need to be rolled out of the venue. The owners would take a picture with famous folks who visited and stick it on the wall, alerting us that our choice of Lebanese restaurant was endorsed by Wayne Bennett and Miranda Tapsell. What could be more Sydney than celebrity-endorsed kebabs?Now we are bereft. Where to turn without a restaurant that my family had used as an alternate living room for decades? What about the next time I have a hankering for a vat of baba ghanouj?I wish I had been a better devotee, not complaining as prices went up, remembering to go regularly, giving the “lemon drink” another go after years of deciding it was for decoration only.After the pandemic lockdowns we all saw businesses struggling and some of our institutions just couldn’t stay afloat. Somehow I thought Abdul’s was locked into the foundations of Elizabeth and Cleveland streets, fossilised into the landscape, available to me for ever. Time never did seem to take effect inside its walls.What I wouldn’t give to go back now.Thank you Abdul’s for the memories, for introducing my country kid Dad to Lebanese food in the 70s, for the perfect tangy tabbouleh, for eventually installing an Eftpos terminal. You have a special place in my heart and stomach for ever.Emily Mulligan is a writer based in SydneyExplore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkOpinionFoodMiddle Eastern food and drinkSydneyFamilyAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

As a new stage work revisits his life, its director asks if art can be separated from artistBill BarclayThu 15 Jan 2026 11.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 13.51 ESTShareCarlo Gesualdo wrote some of the most darkly sublime music of the late Renaissance. He also savagely murdered his wife and her lover in their bed. Now be honest: which would you like to discuss first?The art will always be secondary to the atrocity, however magnificent the madrigals and sacred music. Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa, had been cuckolded by the Duke of Andria in a long-running tryst that had become the scuttlebutt at court. The premeditated double murder of 1590 was a truly grisly affair, concluding in the public display of their mutilated bodies on the steps of the palazzo for several days.Gesualdo’s biography is often reduced to this act, yet his own end, too, was harrowing. Twenty years on, the prince had retreated to his estate to indulge in a life of ritualistic agony, reportedly employing servants to beat him thrice daily to ease sleep and constipation. This domestic nightmare included the presence of two concubines accused by his second wife of witchcraft against him. Their ghoulish testimonies, elicited under torture, suggest a household that had descended into a gothic psychosis.View image in fullscreenCarlo Gesualdo da Venosa (1566 - 1613), painted by Francesco Mancini.Photograph: DEA/A. DAGLI ORTI/De Agostini/Getty ImagesThe composer’s sheer repugnance is so colourful that I was surprised to be approached by St Martin-in-the-Fields, who asked if I might create a piece of music theatre about his life. This year marks the central London church’s 300th anniversary, and next week my new work, Death of Gesualdo, opens as a tribute to the venue’s bold artistic independence. It features the phenomenal ensemble the Gesualdo Six, who long ago adopted the troubled prince as their namesake (the first piece the group sang was the composer’sTenebrae Responsoria). And so we have all now become enmeshed in the handling of his dark materials, and must confront the sticky relationship between the creator and the crime.Gesualdo wrote madrigals, but not the sunny pastoral ones that defined his English contemporary Thomas Morley (Now Is the Month of Maying, It Was a Lover and His Lass). Were those kind of compositions his, we might successfully disentangle the art from the artist. Yet Gesualdo was a musician whose sombre works (Ahi, disperata vita – ah desperate life; Moro, lasso, al mio duolo – I die, alas, in my suffering) could easily score a film of his own sordid life. The music and the man easily form a singular, haunting synthesis – the aural diary of a degenerate.View image in fullscreenTaraash Mehrotra, Markus Weinfurter, David Tarkenter, Imogen Frances and Sian Williams rehearsing Death of Gesualdo at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAt this juncture I was forced into a moment of moral pause. Is it appropriate to half-valorise a murderer whose music and stature would be obliterated online today?For me, the art is almost always separate from the artist, odious or not. We can’t locate antisemitism in Wagner’s actual scores. To eliminate Guernica from the canon because of Picasso’s abuse of women is a punishment unbefitting of the crime. To take a less extreme example, if I’m upset by JK Rowling’s stance on trans issues, banning her books from my daughter’s bedroom only closes a door for both of us. We know way too much about artists today – we are swimming in their private biographical details – and are thereby unwittingly complicit in this contamination of their art. To make matters worse, the facts and the fictions are increasingly blurred – an artist who is young and famous today will be forced to consider that someone may have already created deepfake pornographic material of them.Allow me to present myself as an example. In my production, I attempt to tackle these issues by mapping Gesualdo’s tortured harmonies on to the painful episodes of his life, connecting his musical hallucinations with his descent into psychosis. Patterns are fun to find and dots thrilling to join. Of course, I vainly hope this reveals something new and valuable about him.But high art at best is a Rorschach test – an ink blot. It isn’t meant to reveal the artist, it is meant to reveal us. A staging of Hamlet tells us little about Shakespeare, frankly. It hardly tells us much about Hamlet. If it’s an excellent production, it might remind me that it’s been 17 years since I’ve lost my dad, and I really, really miss him.This is what makes Gesualdo such a valuable case study in 2026: here was that rare artist before celebrity culture taught us how to obsess. Centuries before the internet, this great-nephew of Pope Pius IV was born into a life of transparency. His second wife was Eleonora d’Este of the prestigious northern Court of Ferrara, a “Music City”, and a cultural nexus of 16th-century Europe. All murders aside, his nobility, wealth and role as a leading composer made him the subject of constant gossip – about his sexuality, intelligence and more – for his entire life.The homicides were a festering scandal, yet perhaps more shocking is they were perfectly legal; for an Italian prince of his day, an “honour” killing was an expected rite of restoration. This is why he evaded punishment and formed a second strategic alliance with the Court of Ferrara. But there the whispers intensified, and perhaps as a result, he devoted himself to the solitude of composition. His later years were marked by another retreat – this time by a fixation that he was being hunted by the families of his victims.In my work, Death of Gesualdo,the composer’s fragile psyche forms a toxic alchemy with the public glare that fuels his psychosis even as it yields astonishing music. His final years culminated in the Tenebrae Responsoria of 1611 – an apparent self-requiem that conflates Christ’s suffering entirely with his own. One hears guilt, atonement and isolation in the sublime dissonances of this haunting masterpiece. He died two years later, a man broken by the very status that had protected him.View image in fullscreen‘Erasing art is the wrong lesson from the 2020s’ … artistic director Bill Barclay rehearses with  Imogen Frances.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBut are any of these connections true?Truth be told, Gesualdo’s chosen forms – the madrigal – were quite typical for his day. He was not among the avant garde in Florence, nor was he inventing opera with Monteverdi in Mantua, he was writing mannerist madrigals, a late form on its way out. Mannerism relied on artificiality, complexity, chromaticism and dissonance. No one understood that assignment better than our dark prince. A musicologist must be honest that “psychopathic composer” is an irresponsible elision. But we have allowed his bloodlust to define his music, haven’t we, and that is the problem and the opportunity.In travelling my own road through this commission, I have concluded that punishing odiousness in artists by erasing their art is the wrong lesson from the 2020s. Artists must realise there is a sharp danger of their work becoming contaminated with their reputation. Audiences must realise that double-clicking on another’s suffering is a step too far. As for Death of Gesualdo, it may reveal nothing about him. It could reveal something about me. If it’s any good, neither should matter, because it will reveal something truly important about you.Bill Barclay is the writer and director ofDeath of Gesualdo at St Martin-in-the-Fields16-17 January;York National Centre for Early Music18-19 January; andSt John the Divine, New York, 13 February.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You won’t find that on this list, however: instead there’s metal, soul, and an ‘indecently exciting’ No 1 …Alexis PetridisThu 15 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 12.16 ESTShare30. Maze featuring Frankie Beverly – Live in New Orleans (1981)Already stars in Black America, Maze became the ultimate if-you-know-you-know band among British fans of underground soul thanks to Live in New Orleans. It perfectly encapsulated their appeal: smooth but not slick, an awesomely tight band making breezily relaxed music, one fantastic song after another.29. Hawkwind – Space Ritual (1973)Live albums can often seem like an afterthought, a nice addendum rather than a pivotal part of a band’s career. But Space Ritual is the best way to experience Hawkwind’s unique melding of psych, proto-punk, electronics, motorik krautrock-like repetition: advertised with the fabulous line “88 minutes of brain damage”, it’s immersive, hypnotic and awesome.28. Portishead – Roseland NYC Live (1998)Capturing a one-off gig featuring Portishead’s standard decks/synth/guitar lineup supported by strings, woodwind and brass, Roseland NYC Live is magical. Rather than clutter their eerie sound, the orchestra augments it, the perfect setting for Beth Gibbons’ voice: the dramatic climax of Mysterons is worth the price of entry alone.27. Laura Nyro – Laura: Live at the Bottom Line (1989)Recorded years after her commercial peak, Live at the Bottom Line nevertheless offers a perfect summation of what made Laura Nyro special: it feels intimate and supple, ranging across her career and musical styles from soul to gospel to jazz. Her voice sounds amazing; whether classic or previously unreleased, the song quality never dips.26. Grateful Dead – Europe ’72 (1972)They didn’t invent the term cosmic American music, but no artists embodied it like theGrateful Deadin 1972, their sound split between freeform exploration, earthy blues and country-rock. Stuffed with incredible, hitherto unleased songs – He’s Gone, Brown-Eyed Women, Ramble on Rose – the triple Europe ’72 might be their greatest album full stop.View image in fullscreenCosmic … Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead in London, 1972.Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty Images25. Otis Redding – Live at the Whisky a Go-Go: The Complete Recordings (2016)Six CDs may seemde tropbut this is still the best way to hear Otis Redding live. Deposited in a rock venue in an attempt to snag a white audience, he didn’t change his soul circuit approach but worked hard to win them over, with electrifying results.24. Iggy and the Stooges – Metallic KO (1976)Metallic KO is a mess: a low-quality recording of the Stooges on their last legs – frequently out of tune and time – before a crowd so hostile you can literally hear hurled bottles smashing on stage. But as a piece of rock mythology, an account of screw-you defiance in the face of disaster, it’s utterly gripping.23. Sylvester – Living Proof (1979)Disco was not a genre that produced many great live albums, but then Sylvester wasn’t just any disco artist: his joyous performance at San Francisco’s War Memorial Opera House hurtles from You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) to versions of Billie Holiday’s Lover Man and the Beatles’ Blackbird, his voice incredible throughout.View image in fullscreenNot just any disco artist … Sylvester performing with backing singers Martha Wash and Izora Rhodes-Armstead.Photograph: Max Redfern/Redferns22. Talking Heads – Stop Making Sense (1984)The visuals are what everyone remembers from the movie of Stop Making Sense: the big suit, the boombox. The album obviously strips them away, but what’s left is still remarkable: the vast majority of the songs here smoke their studio incarnations, variously sounding more urgent, more joyful, more writhingly funky.21. Iron Maiden – Live After Death (1985)Hailed in some quarters as the greatest live metal album full stop, Live After Death offers the sound of Maiden cresting their mid-80s imperial phase: everything you might conceivably want from a Maiden set of the era performed by a band firing on all cylinders, with Bruce Dickinson in full-on ringmaster mode.20. Beyoncé – Homecoming: The Live Album (2019)The live album feels like a dying art in the 21st century, but this sparkling recording of Beyoncé’s marching band-assisted Coachella performance carries a genuine sense of event and risk: it isn’t like anything else in her catalogue.View image in fullscreenSparkling … Beyoncé at Coachella.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Coachella19. Sam Cooke – Live at the Harlem Square Club (1985)There’s something very telling about the fact that Cooke’s label refused to release this 1963 recording at the time: it’s fast-paced, raw and incredibly intense, none of which fitted with the smooth pop image they were trying to project of the singer – all of which make it such an electrifying listen today.18. Depeche Mode – 101 (1989)A perfect snapshot of the pointDepeche Modeascended from synth-pop hitmakers to US stadium-filling alternative superstars, 101 also underlines why it happened: subtly tweaked and rearranged, these familiar songs hit harder in their live incarnations. Dave Gahan sounds imperious, as if he always expected to end up playing in front of 60,000 people.17. Curtis Mayfield – Curtis/Live! (1971)Mayfield was at a peak when he taped Curtis/Live! in New York. You can tell: it flits effortlessly between Impressions classics and fresh solo material, the gentle optimism of People Get Ready and the tough fatalism of If There’s a Hell Below We’re All Gonna Go, the aching I Plan to Stay a Believer and the supremely funky Check Out Your Mind.16. Johnny Cash – At San Quentin (1969)It could easily have been 1968’s At Folsom Prison, but San Quentin has, well, San Quentin, which the inmates compel Cash to play twice. The tumult the second performance occasions should be impossible to top, but Cash does it, thanks to another ace in his pocket, the live debut of A Boy Named Sue.View image in fullscreenTumultuous … Johnny Cash at San Quentin.Photograph: ITV/Rex Features15. Elton John – 17-11-70 (1971)Recorded weeks after his career-kickstarting gig at LA’s Troubadour Club and an education for anyone who only knows the hits, 17-11-70 offers the purest expression of his original vision for theElton JohnBand, “a power trio with a piano” big on extended improvisation – even the ballads rock surprisingly hard.14. Donny Hathaway – Live (1972)A rule of thumb is that a great live album should sound substantively different from the artist’s studio work. That’s true here: Hathaway’s voice is as exquisite as ever, but his band sounds jazzier, looser, more given to jamming. The audience appear to be going bananas throughout: who can blame them?13. Thin Lizzy – Live and Dangerous (1978)You could argue that Live and Dangerous isn’t really a live album – producer Tony Visconti claimed that 75% of it was re-recorded – but you’d have a far harder time arguing against its quality: it captures Thin Lizzy at their pre-heroin peak, far punchier and more potent than even their best studio album.View image in fullscreenPunchy and potent … Phil Lynott performs with Thin Lizzy.Photograph: Fin Costello/Redferns12. Motörhead – No Sleep ’til Hammersmith (1981)The suggestion Motörhead achieved everything they were put on Earth to achieve with No Sleep ’til Hammersmith irked Lemmy deeply, but it’s understandable: it’s nasty, speedy, brutish, gruff and utterly relentless, grabbing the listener by the neck from the moment Ace of Spades kicks into life and declining to let go for the next 40 minutes.11. Joni Mitchell – Miles of Aisles (1974)Miles of Aisles captured Mitchell at a moment of flux: at the height of her fame, but about to push her music in more expansive, less commercial directions. It’s a process that might have begun at these shows, as she radically rearranges songs from her earlier career in the company of a flatly incredible band.View image in fullscreenMoment of flux … Joni Mitchell at the Berkeley Community Center, 1974.Photograph: Larry Hulst/Getty Images10. Bill Withers – Live at Carnegie Hall (1973)For a man who was still working in a factory 18 months before this album was recorded,Bill Witherssounds fabulously relaxed and loquacious on stage at New York’s Carnegie Hall: that he’d amassed a set of songs as incredible as the 14 here doubtless helped. It’s all wonderful, but the climax of Harlem/Cold Baloney is something else.9. Bob Marley and the Wailers – Live! (1975)Live albums can be a poor substitute for attending a gig, but Live! was taped in such a way that you feel you’re actually in the crowd. The Wailers’ performance is obviously amazing, but the way the recording captures the audience and the atmosphere is almost equally so. And the unedited deluxe edition is the way to go.8. Nina Simone – ’Nuff Said! (1968)Nina Simone’s discography is packed with incredible live albums – from 1959’s At Town Hall to 1976’s fraught Live at Montreux – but none have quite the emotional charge of Nuff Said’s recordings from Westbury Music fair, three days after Martin Luther King’s assassination: a performance that alternately mourns and blazes with fury.View image in fullscreenIncredible … Nina Simone performs at Newport jazz festival, July 1968.Photograph: David Redfern/Redferns7. The Who – Live at Leeds (1970)Tommy had sent their career stratospheric but – as ever with the Who – caused turmoil: the album was treated like high art, a reception that ignored the band’s brutal, incendiary side. Live at Leeds was the solution, offering raw live recordings with no songs from Tommy. This was rock music as visceral and explosive as you could wish.6. Van Morrison – It’s Too Late to Stop Now Vol 1 (1974)Latterly, Van Morrison’s reputation as a live performer has often centred on his irascible attitude. It was not ever thus: the performances here are fluid, extraordinary things, the songs bent and shaped in the moment to sensational effect. Furthermore, it’s evidence for the claim that he’s the greatest white R&B singer of all.5. Aretha Franklin – Amazing Grace (1972)If you want secular live Aretha, 1971’s Live at Fillmore West should be your first stop. But for emotional heft and astonishing vocal power, her gospel performance on Amazing Grace – recorded in her father’s LA church – is absolutely unbeatable, regardless of your faith or lack thereof.View image in fullscreenAstonishing … Aretha Franklin performing Amazing Grace.Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy4. The Jimi Hendrix Experience – Live at Monterey (2007)There’s stiff competition for the title of the best live Jimi Hendrix album – not least from 1970’s Band of Gypsys – but Monterey just squeaks it, thanks to the almost tangible crackle of excitement about the show that introduced Hendrix to America, not to mention the chaos about the band’s feedback-laden performance.3. Bob Dylan – The Bootleg Series Vol 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The ‘Royal Albert Hall’ Concert (1998)Bob Dylan’s Manchester Free Trade Hall show (initially wrongly credited on bootleg recordings as the Royal Albert Hall) may well be the most famous gig in rock history. The story is incredibly familiar (“Judas!”) but what’s amazing is how tensely gripping the recording is, even when you know what’s going to happen. NB: on Spotify, it doesn’t happen, because – wait for it – all the between-song chat has beenedited out.2. James Brown – Live at the Apollo (1963)All three of Brown’s Live at the Apollo albums are essential, but the first volume clinches the prize: it’s atmospheric, electrifying, and it captures classic chitlin’ circuit soul, simultaneously raw and incredibly tight. The screams and cries from the audience that strafe its eight tracks only add to the experience.1. Jerry Lee Lewis – Live at the Star Club, Hamburg (1964)Live at the Star Club is a badly mixed recording ofJerry Lee Lewison his uppers in every sense: his career has flatlined and his performance sounds like a 40-minute advert for the alarmingly invigorating properties of amphetamines. Songs start at an astonishing pace and frequentlyspeed up; his backing band, Britain’s Nashville Teens, just about cling on by the skin of their teeth. It should be a disaster. Instead, it’s almost indecently exciting, capturing the feral essence of rock’n’roll like nothing else. “It’s not an album,” gawped Rolling Stone’s review, “it’s a crime scene.” They had a point.Explore more on these topicsMusicRankedJerry Lee LewisJames BrownBob DylanAretha FranklinVan MorrisonThe WhofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Has anyone ever been more legendary than Harriet?April O’NeillThu 15 Jan 2026 11.55 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 11.56 ESTShareWednesday’s episode ofThe Traitorswas explosive: Matthew’s recruitment deal with Traitors Stephen and Rachel “confirmed”, James stealing a shield, Rachel revealing her “FBI training”. But let it be known, if I ever go missing I want Harriet Tyce on the case. Her behaviour was nothing short of Shakespearean – dropping the secret writer and criminal barrister bomb, calling out Rachel against the dramatic backdrop of a gothic chapel, publicly prosecuting her at breakfast then presenting nothing but vibes-based evidence at the round table. To top it all off, she is the first Faithful in the show’s history toaskto be banished simply to prove a point. I fear Harriet is operating on levels of camp no TV show has ever seen before.It’s a common trend that emerges every season: a woman over 50 captures the nation’s heart and becomes a viral sensation, elevated to “mother” status by fans. And this mother is always powerful, outspoken and often utterly incomprehensible. In series one, we had Amanda Lovett, the then 54-year-old estate agent turned Traitor, masking her ruthless “Welsh dragon” instincts behind a clueless appearance. Series two brought us Diane Carson, the 63-year-old Faithful and former teacher, who came armed with blunt directness and a ginger bob only to be offed by fizzy rosé as Ross, her secret son, took part in her funeral procession. Turn to 70-year-old Linda Rands in series three, a retired opera singer who clung on as a Traitor until episode seven despite blunders so blatant they made billboards.View image in fullscreenNothing short of Shakespearean… Harriet Tyce on The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/PAIn this series, I thought we couldn’t get better than Fiona, the 62-year-old local government officer who totally flew under the radar, fooling not only Traitors Rachel and Stephen but the audience with her sweet, chatty mumsiness – only to be the Secret Traitor. I thought her swift transformation from cunning liar to total kamikaze, gunning for fellow Traitor Rachel out of nowhere in front of the whole castle, was the peak of television. But with Fiona banished, 52-year-old Harriet clearly saw a gap in the market and took matters into her own hands.View image in fullscreenKeeping mum … Diane Carson from series two of the UK Traitors.Photograph: BBCHarriet entered that chapel as a woman on a mission, swiftly wiping the smug grins off Rachel and Stephen’s faces as she scoffed at their responses (“I think that this answer is not worth the paper on which it’s written”), turning that confessional booth into the witness stand. After she told Rachel “the gig is up” and taunting the Traitors for not murdering her earlier, the nation held its breath as she marched into breakfast, overruling calls for a private chat, to totally annihilate her fellow player. Gone was the controlled eloquence of the courtroom she used to uncloak Hugo: Harriet didn’t just drop a “truth bomb”, she went straight to nuclear.Was it a bit wild? Yes, but that is what makes her iconic. What these women share is that they are fearless and brazen, if not always on the right track. They don’t just fade into the background like many players have done – there’s always a handful you never quite learn the name of – they throw themselves into the spotlight, all guns blazing to find answers. Be they Traitor or Faithful, they take action. And make brilliant television.View image in fullscreenForce to be reckoned with … Celebrity Traitors contestant Celia Imrie.Photograph: Cody Burridge/BBC/PAThe fan fervour comes from a place of underestimation. Despite Fiona telling us to “never underestimate a woman of a certain age” in her banishment speech, we’re still shocked that these women can cause such chaos and be so gloriously compelling. No one thought 73-year-old national treasure Celia Imrie would get stuck right into the missions on The Celebrity Traitors, and no one expected Harriet’s calm control to tip over into fiery brilliance by asking the cast to “call her bluff” and vote her out to prove that she is a Faithful (and Rachel a Traitor). There is nothing more legendary – nothing more “mother” – than sacrificing yourself to prove you’re right.Well, partly right: Harriet’s assertion that there are four, maybe even five, Traitors is so far off the mark it makes her performance border on farce. But her tunnel-vision brilliance and forceful cross-examinations cement her in the show’s hall of fame. Before tonight’s episode, I ask the remaining Faithfuls to heed Harriet’s parting words: “Do not let this sacrifice be in vain.”Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’d been his boss and trained him, so kissing him would be highly inappropriate. However, if somebody is looking to see me kiss Mr Washington, please whisper that into his ear.I hear you’re a big fan of knitting. What’s been your greatest knitted creation?TopTrampThe knitting has been eclipsed by pottery the past three years. I go to a local pottery studio, do what I can on a wheel, and get my creativity out there. The knitting was a wonderful thing. I’d make simple squares without having to count stitches, then sew them all together. I must have made about a dozen blankets, most of which are still in a trunk upstairs. If I get another job in television – which I hope I do – that has you sitting around quite a bit, so knitting is a good mobile craft.You’re brilliant as both goodies and baddies – how do you choose?JolaferMy work chooses me. The mark of a really good actor is one that has a range and doesn’t just show up in the same role again and again. I’m happy to play what I’m offered – apart from afterThe Fighter, when all I was offered was older, nasty women. I don’t want to do that any more.View image in fullscreenPlaying Alice in The Fighter.Photograph: Paramount/Everett/ShutterstockYou’ve played lots of blue-collar characters. Do you get the urge to play somebody really posh and rich?PeteTheBeatAbsolutely! I amdyingto do that kind of work. I’ve been asking for years: “Please, may I play the princess? The glorious, kind, benevolent queen?” I want lovely fancy costumes, maybe from another period. Years ago, I made a film called A Time of Destiny, which was set in the 40s. Not all actors can fit in period pieces because they feel too modern, but I can play goodies and baddies – past, present and future.What was it like filming police drama Homicide: Life on the Street [the series ran from1993 to 1999], and did you get to hang out with the cast afterwards?Oberursel67The cast was almost all male, so that perhaps answers that question. Did they invite me to the bars with them – the single mother of a seven-year-old? No. It was a lot of years together, so I held a lot of those guys really close. But I don’t do what I do for the party afterwards. I’m more interested in the process.How did you get into the role of Alice Eklund-Ward in The Fighter?LeobatchI accepted because David [O Russell, director] really, really wanted me to be his Alice. Then I met the real Alice Ward, who came from a very different socioeconomic background than my mother’s mother, but there was something of my mother’s mother in her, so that’s where I found a path towards becoming her. I was no more than 10 years older than the majority of the nine people who played Alice’s children, but that’s movies for you.What goes through your mind when you stand up to receive an Oscar?MrSOBaldrickOne loses one’s mind. I had won a lot of prestigious awards for The Fighter that season, and sat in that great gigantic theatre thinking: “Well, it certainlyispossible.” Kirk Douglas came out to present the best supporting actress award, opened the envelope and called my name. I was so delighted to meet him – that was all I was thinking about. I turned to the house, which in most theatres, you can see by looking a little above your own eyesight. In the Dolby theatre, you have to raise your chin like you’re about to scale Mount Everest. Every single actor, director and producer you recognise, is staring you in the face. I then cursed, and I’m still sorry I cursed. I fucking curse all the time, but you cannot curse on network television. Thank God for the 10-second delay, which was introduced for fucking idiots like me. Having said that, winning an Oscar has not been good for me or my career. I didn’t dream of it, I never wanted it, and I had a much better career before I won.View image in fullscreen‘I cursed, and I’m still sorry I cursed’ … Leo accepting her Oscar.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyWhat are your memoriesof filming ABC Western series The Young Riders? I loved your character Emma – it was a shame she left early!Tahra_I agree. It was a total shame. I loved being Emma. I loved being out in Arizona with the horses. I love that people still have such an adoration of that show, 35 years later. Emma was a goodhearted, hardworking woman. I don’t know why I’m not seen as that more often. I’d grown up reading Little House on the Prairie and other Laura Ingalls Wilder books, so I loved going to live in that new west world with the costumes, the long dresses, the corsets and the hairdos.What are your memories of playing Holly in Denis Villeneuve’s 2013 film Prisoners?Sagarmatha1953Holly is so misunderstood. These days, people leave or switch over before the end of a movie. I beg you to watch until the end, because Holly makes her entire history clear in a single speech. You might think she’s a bad person, but she’s just protecting her child, which is an admirable thing.In Olympus Has Fallen, how do the North Koreans capture the White House, yet suddenly become soincompetent once Gerard Butler shows up?zerkaloThat’s exactly how it works. Gerry Butler doesn’t lose in the pictures.Which of your films are you the most proud of?SkillWizardI’ve made several films that nobody’s ever heard of which are very, very good. I cannot recommend seeing my new film The Knife more highly, in which I play a detective who is neither a goodie or a baddie. She’s a woman doing her job, which is of a lot of interest to me. I also have a smaller part in King Ivory, a fascinating, beautiful, painful and truthful portrait of the fentanyl crisis in the US. There’s a wonderful, fantastical small film I made many years ago called Racing Daylight, written and directed by Nicole Quinn, where I get to play a character from both present and past times. There’s another gentle, sweet, delicate film called Francine, where we meet a woman on the day that she’s been released from a long-term jail sentence and watch her try to integrate back in to society, which I’m very proud of.You’ve said that your best pick-me-up is a good nap. Where’s the weirdest place you’ve ever been caught sneaking in 40 winks?TurangaLeela2Oh, it’s not sneaky at all. If somebody finds me napping, I’m proud of myself because I’ve been able to do the thing any doctor will tell you: get more rest. Just don’t let me miss lunch. And don’t let me miss when you need me on set!The Knife is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsMelissa LeoThe FighterTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Returning to university in Manchester in the mid-90s for a new term, she was attempting to put on an enormous rucksack full of books (she did English). As she managed to get the thing on, she experienced an error in balance, fell backwards and laid on the platform, wiggling her arms and legs like an inverted tortoise, unable to move.Along came Alan Rickman, clearly intending to board the same train. He stopped, pointed at her and laughed before striding off up the platform. She never felt it was unkind, more that she was playing a role in some impromptu station art performance.TerryHFS‘One of the all-time greatest and nastiest screen villains’He was one of the all-time greatest and nastiest screen villains inDie Hard, completely opposite of course to the real Alan Rickman off-screen, with perhaps the most extraordinary – and most deserved – death scene for any villain.At a tribute event some years later for Bruce Willis, Rickman turned up with a bandaged head, and crutches or similar to mockingly show his character had somehow survived (he must have landed on a cushion or something), summing up his good-natured sense of humour. He is still much missed.JFBridgeView image in fullscreen‘Extraordinary death scene’ … as Hans Gruber in Die Hard.Photograph: AJ Pics/Alamy‘He mastered silences on screen’One of the qualities I always felt Alan Rickman had was that whatever role he was playing, you could almost hear what his characters were thinking beyond the lines they were saying. He had mastered silences and stares on screen.gavernism‘A wonderful human’What a strange irony that such a wonderful human will be primarily remembered as a movie baddie, but I can’t think of another actor who relished those roles as much as he did. Most film stars want to be liked way too much to play them with the conviction Alan brought. He didn’t need our adoration – he clearly had enough of that from his friends.Keef08View image in fullscreenRickman with Lesley Manville in Les Liaisons Dangereuses at the Royal Shakespeare Company, 1985.Photograph: Donald Cooper/Alamy‘Incredibly knowledgable’I met him once. Not a humble brag. But it was an astonishing encounter with a wonderfully engaging man. I was a lowly arts council officer (as we were called then – this is 2003, I think). I was invited to an aftershow party at the Barbican after a Richard Maxwell play (I think it might have been Drummer Wanted). It wasn’t a starry do – just a few dozen theatre nerds excited to have witnessed another brilliant experiment in theatre.I remember standing on my own with a glass of wine when Alan Rickman introduced himself and asked what I thought of the play. For the next half an hour we chatted about our shared love of experimental theatre practices – Forced Entertainment, the Wooster Group, Lone Twin etc.He was passionate about all of it, incredibly knowledgable, eager to hear my thoughts, happy to learn, unhurried. It was just 30 minutes but I still remember it distinctly 25 years later. And that voice …theatredavid‘Keep the sssssstichesssss sssssmall!’I liked Alan Rickman ever since I saw him as the preposterous Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood. My sister and I (both young teenagers then) mimicked his lines in that film for ages (“and keep the sssssstichesssss sssssmall!”). Later I saw him in a few other things and always found him beautiful: a graceful man with a kind of sadness and intelligence in his expression. It’s wonderful to read how much he was loved by those who knew him personally.kastachicoryView image in fullscreen‘A graceful man’ … as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.Photograph: Warner Bros./Allstar‘Hard to believe Hans Gruber was his very first movie role’It’s still very hard to believe Hans Gruber was his very first movie role. Yes he had years of theatre experience but acting in a hoped-for blockbuster is very different. The elan with which he essays a role that is at times three roles at the same time – German thief pretending to be German terrorist pretending to be an American businessman – is impressive enough, but it’s the little details like the hyper-accurate way he makes a tiny grammatical mistake when explaining about watching his father make models.ChrisMRogers‘A true gent’I had the pleasure of working with Alan Rickman when he directed The Winter Guest at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. I was only a lowly assistant stage manager so there was no reason for him to get to know me, but he did and it was appreciated. After the show opened he came back just before it finished to see everyone and he found me setting up the show. “Hello Simon, how are you?” he said. My name is not Simon but ASMs are used to being forgotten so I didn’t correct him. He left me and then did one of the best double take re-entrances not captured on camera – “JON! Oh my God, I am so sorry!! I called you Simon!!” He was truly mortified! A month later – long after the show had moved to London – my first child arrived, followed swiftly by a bottle of champagne and a card from Alan. He’d asked the company manager to let him know when the baby came. He was a true gent and a pleasure to know, even for a short while.MelhenneyExplore more on these topicsFilmAlan RickmanDie HardRobin HoodTheatreShareReuse this content"

So the successor to Noomi Rapace, Rooney Mara and Claire Foy is bound to be brilliant – whoever they are …Stuart HeritageThu 15 Jan 2026 09.41 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 11.31 ESTShareThis week Sky announced that it will be remaking Stieg Larsson’s 2005 novel The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo as an eight-part television series. So far, all we know is that it will be set in the present day and will be written by Steve Lightfoot and Angela LaManna.What we don’t know is who will play Lisbeth Salander, the aforementioned girl with the dragon tattoo. And this will be a big deal, because previous screen adaptations of Larsson’s books have made stars of whoever was cast as Salander. In 2009’s Swedish adaptation, she was played by Noomi Rapace, who was nominated for a Bafta. In David Fincher’s 2011 remake, she was played by Rooney Mara, who was nominated for an Oscar. And in 2018’s The Girl in the Spider’s Web adaptation, she was played by Claire Foy, who wasn’t nominated for a Bafta or an Oscar, but was still very good.Sky’s series is going into production this spring, so it is almost certain that it has cast its Salander. But let’s not allow that to stop us indulging in a little mindless casting speculation. Here’s who should play her.Emma CorrinView image in fullscreenOtherworldly intensity … Emma Corrin as Diana, Princess of Wales in The Crown.Photograph: Des Willie/NetflixFar and away the best pick for the role, Corrin shares a strange, otherworldly intensity with Salander. They are magnetic and unpredictable, and have a clear talent for challenging characters. They are also very obviously unafraid of playing characters so well known that they run the risk of lapsing into caricature; anyone who dares to playDiana, Princess of Waleswill make mincemeat of Salander. Plus – and it’s a big plus – Sky’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is going to be made by Left Bank Pictures, which also made The Crown. Look at it from a certain angle and you could almost convince yourself that it made The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo only because it had a relationship with Corrin.Jodie ComerView image in fullscreenNot a bad sociopath … Jodie Comer in Killing Eve.Photograph: Anika Molnar/APThis is mainly because Comer is excellent in everything, so it stands to reason that she would be excellent in this. She plays troubled very well (see28 Years Later). She plays capable very well (seeHelp) and she is not a bad sociopath, either (seeKilling Eve). The last also shows that she knows her way around an accent which, since the series is filming in Lithuania, might also be useful. If you want a familiar face who can disappear into a role, she would be the one to pick.Anya Taylor-JoyView image in fullscreenTerrifying … Anya Taylor-Joy in The Queen's Gambit.Photograph: Charlie Gray/APAlthough she has largely left television for film, Taylor-Joy’s biggest star-making vehicle to date is still the Netflix miniseriesThe Queen’s Gambit. She is at her best when she is given time to fully interrogate a role, rather than skate along the surface of a movie as a pretty supporting character, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo would allow her to do exactly that. Also, she would be terrifying, which works in her favour.Alba AugustView image in fullscreenGeographically more authentic … Alba August in The Rain.Photograph: Per Arnesen/NetflixWe shouldn’t forget that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a Swedish book, and therefore it might be better if the series cast someone more geographically authentic. If that’s the case, August, a Danish-Swedish actor, might be a good shout. She has been good in everything she has done – she was fantastic inNetflix’s post-apocalyptic series The Rain– and it feels as if she has been waiting a long time for an English-language breakthrough. This would certainly be that.Noomi RapaceView image in fullscreenAnd repeat … why not bring back Noomi Rapace, seen here with Nils Bjurman, in 2009’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo?Photograph: Nordisk Film/Sportsphoto/AllstarOr how about this? Sky’s announcement made mention of the fact that The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo would be set in the present, so perhaps its gimmick is that all the characters are 20 years older than they were when the book was published. If that’s the case, then recasting Rapace in her breakout role would be a no-brainer. Rapace is now 46. Wouldn’t it be interesting to see what Lisbeth would be like in middle age? Has she softened over time, or has she become angrier than ever? The new series probably isn’t going down this route at all, but it would be a fascinating experiment.To the person who has already been cast as Salander, if they are reading this and getting progressively angrier that I haven’t named them as the obvious choice for the role, sorry. You are obviously going to be much better than any of the people I have listed. It’s my fault. I’m just not very imaginative. Unless Corrin has been cast, in which case I told you so.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStieg LarssonThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (US)ThrillersJodie ComerAnya Taylor-JoyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He discusses Buddhism, partisan politics and the terrifying flight that changed his lifeThu 15 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 15 Jan 2026 10.55 ESTShareLike his first novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, which won the Booker prize in 2017, George Saunders’s new novel is a ghost story. In Vigil, an oil tycoon who spent a lifetime covering up the scientific evidence for climate change is visited on his deathbed by a host of spirits, who force him to grapple with his legacy. What draws Saunders to ghost stories? “If I had us talking here in a story and I allowed a ghost in from the 1940s, I might be more interested in it. It might be because they are in fact here,” he says, gesturing to the hotel lobby around us. “Or even if it’s not ghosts, we both have memories of people we love who have passed. They are here, in a neurologically very active way.” A ghost story can feel more “truthful”, he adds: “If you were really trying to tell the truth about this moment, would you so confidently narrow it to just today?”Ghosts also invite us to confront our mortality and, in so doing, force a new perspective on life: what remains once you strip away the meaningless, day-to-day distractions in which we tend to lose ourselves? “Death, to me, has always been a hot topic,” Saunders says. “It’s so unbelievable that it will happen to us, too. And I suppose as you get older it becomes more …” he puts on a goofy voice: “interesting”. He is 67, grizzled and avuncular, surprisingly softly spoken for a writer who talks so loudly – and with such freewheeling, wisecracking energy – on the page. He says death is close to becoming a “preoccupation” for him and he worries that he is not prepared for it.About 25 years ago, Saunders was on a passenger plane that was hit by geese shortly after taking off from Chicago. There was a loud bang, the plane began making terrible noises, black smoke filled the cabin, people screamed, the lights of the city appeared to approach very fast, and Saunders believed he was going to die. At the time he was “at peak spirituality”, a Tibetan Buddhist who meditated for three hours a day, and yet he experienced pure terror. “It was like all the elements of my identity got rolled back. I wasn’t thinking about writing. I wasn’t even able to think about my family, there was just some primal self that was about to be lost,” he recalls.“And then this funny, I don’t know …” he trails off for a moment, apparently unsure if funny is the right word, before telling me that the teenage boy next to him asked: “Sir, is this supposed to be happening?” and he, his fatherly instinct kicking in, replied with bravado: “Yes, of course”. Itisa funny story – Saunders puts on voices to tell it – and he deploys it the way he uses humour in his fiction, to temper the earnestness and moral seriousness of what he is trying to convey.The plane landed safely in Chicago, and for about a week after, Saunders felt euphoric. Buddhists believe that a true awareness of one’s own mortality enables a person to fully embrace the wonder of being alive. “It’s almost like if you were invited to a really wonderful party and it was going to end at 11.30 and they let you know that – it would change the quality, as opposed to: this is a six-day party, or an infinite party,” he says. He has had “flare-ups” of that feeling since, and he chases it in his writing.If you’d seen the stuff I was writing at 25, you’d never think that person would be published. You’d feel sorry for themSaunders won a MacArthur genius grant in 2006 and is perhaps best known for his short stories. He has published five collections and a couple of novellas, which are dark and satirical, often set in fantastical, dystopian worlds – strange theme parks or malls or futuristic prisons – that present American society through a fun-house mirror, its most grotesque and absurd and spirit-crushing features magnified. They are compassionate stories, told by a man whose advice to students – a 2013 commencement speech on regretting “failures of kindness”, a mid-pandemic letter on the importance of bearing witness – often seems to go viral, and who sees writing as a “sacramental act”. He holds the impassioned, optimistic belief that literature can make us better people, because it requires that both the writer and reader transcend themselves and their coarser instincts, and exercise their capacity for reflection and empathy. Just as when he meditates he might practise a visualisation to generate compassion – one involves imagining someone you love dearly being washed away down a river, and as that feeling of wanting to help wells up you try to expand the feeling outward, to all people – he has found the act of writing enables him to expand his empathy outwards. It pushes him to what he describes as “a certain view of things in which everyone is just me on a different day, or a different life”.View image in fullscreenThe ghosts in Lincoln in the Bardo and Vigil can practise empathy in the most direct, literal way, by stepping into each other’s minds. Vigil is told from the perspective of Jill Blaine, the ghost of a sweet-natured, 22-year-old newlywed who was killed in a car bomb explosion and then entered the mind of her killer. Her moral purpose is to comfort the dying, and she calls her guiding philosophy “elevation”, the view that our lives, all our failures and our triumphs, were inevitable, shaped by forces beyond our control. “Who else could you have been but exactly who you are?” she asks KJ Boone, the oil tycoon. “All your life you believed yourself to be making choices, but what looked like choices were so severely delimited in advance by the mind, body, and disposition thrust upon you that the whole game amounted to a sort of lavishjailing.” Is she right? Saunders says he hasn’t decided, and believes good fiction should aim to ask the right questions, rather than provide answers. “My job is to be the rollercoaster designer and try to set the elements up so it produces the maximum amount of ‘wow’… My feeling is always to err on the side of ‘what makes sparks fly’, and then the meaning is kind of secondary.”But Saunders does remember being six or seven years old and thinking, when someone told him “oh, you’re such a good boy”, that “I didn’t choose any of those things, that’s just the way I am”. He recalls when he was younger still, three or four, knocking over a coffee pot and scalding his sister, and later worrying about whether he had done it on purpose. He’s always been “neurotic” and “OCD” (although not officially diagnosed), and refers to these looping, self-interrogating thoughts as his “monkey mind”. Writing is a “mental health thing” for him. It quietens the monkey mind.He grew up in Oak Forest, south Chicago, where his father worked for a coal company and later owned and ran a fried-chicken franchise called Chicken Unlimited. He was an “errant” reader, who read the books his father left for him before he went to work, an eclectic mix that included Machiavelli’s The Prince and The Other America, an exposé of American poverty by the socialist writer Michael Harrington. He got into Colorado School of Mines to study geophysical engineering and read in his spare time, but had “no taste”. “Ayn Rand was the only novelist I really liked for a while and I didn’t detect anything false in it. Because I was so young I thought: ‘Well, that’s how it is,’” he says.After college he worked with an oil exploration crew in Sumatra, and wrote fiction in his spare time, trying to emulate Hemingway. “If you had seen the stuff I was writing at 25, you would never think that person would be published. You would feel sorry for them,” he says. He was, in his telling, redeemed by an unearned arrogance. “I think this is true and it is even a compositional principle: if you say ‘I’m going to do this’, and then you don’t allow yourself to be rebuffed by the things that should rebuff you, then eventually the problem heals,” he says.View image in fullscreenGeorge Saunders in New York.Photograph: Benedict Evans/The GuardianA few years after returning from Asia, when he was living a “nicely out-of-control life” in Texas, he wrote a story unlike anything he’d written before, inspired by a dream he’d had about a theme park without any gravity. A Lack of Order in the Floating Object Room was published by the Northwest Review, and it helped him win a funded MFA at Syracuse University in upstate New York. He spent his first weeks in Syracuse sleeping in a truck.There, he met a novelist named Paula Redick, and he fell in love so quickly and completely that in three weeks they were engaged and less than a year later they were married. They have two daughters, now grown, and live together in LA with their 13-year-old dog, Guin. “It’s such a nice life,” he says, with real feeling. He and Paula write in their separate offices and meet up for lunch, they walk the dog, they are each other’s first readers – although she is a better one than he is. He knows that if a story doesn’t produce a strong emotional reaction in her, it’s not ready. They push each other to produce work with spiritual weight. “It’s not enough to be clever or sarcastic, we want there to be that undercurrent of something deeper,” he says.How did he know so quickly that she was the one? “The word that comes to mind is undeniable: I cannot not get on that boat,” he says. She was “very deep”. Both had been raised in religious families – he was a “really rabid Catholic kid”, she was from a “kind of fundamentalist” family – and they remained very “spiritual”. “We have that at our core: like, are we at all moving towards being better people and more ready for the end?” Plus, Paula was “so beautiful”, he adds. Zadie Smith once joked to him that, in old photos, George – very blonde and hirsute, with a mullet and a moustache – looks as if he is abducting Paula.Paula got pregnant and went into labour at four months, forcing her to go on bedrest to save the baby, and Saunders completed his degree by correspondence. His thesis was “crap”, he says, because he laboured under the misconception that he needed to produce Serious Literature, and reverted to writing lifeless, derivative prose. On graduating, he got a job as a tech writer. He noodled about on boring work calls, composing scatological poems accompanied by little doodles, and it cheered him that they made Paula laugh. Eventually, he began writing short stories again. This time, he made them funny. In 1996 he published his first short story collection, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline. A year later, he began teaching at Syracuse, where he remains a creative writing professor. “I often think at that level the difference between very, very good writing and great writing has to do with letting something into the mix that you’ve been holding back for complicated reasons.” For him, it was humour.Saunders is an enthusiastic teacher. Since 2021 he has been running his Story Club Substack, which he posts bi-weekly, to discuss craft. “I thought I’d do it for a year, and then it turned out to be so much fun,” he says. It now has more than 315,000 subscribers and about 30,000 paying ones. “There’s something really non-internet-y about the comments. People are so smart and generous,” he says, which he finds a “consolation”, a corrective to the political climate. Sometimes he finds himself wondering: “how does this impulse to kindness coexist with, say, ICE raids?”My nature is to be a peacemaker – but I don’t want to be a peacemaker for Trump’s regimeI had run into Saunders on the stairwell on the way to the interview, and somehow by the time we reached the second floor landing we were discussing our shared fears over Trump’s authoritarianism. “I keep thinking, ‘well, the people won’t tolerate this’, but people are tolerating it,” he says now. Mostly he feels “yucky” when talking about such things, however. “The person I am at a family party arguing politics is not so interesting, just another old dude with opinions,” he says, aware that many of his views are “robotic”, a product of his media diet. When writing fiction, he’s a different creature politically, one forced to consider multiple perspectives. “That person, through working every day, can become a slightly more interesting person, and that person is a little slower to judge, a little more confused, a little quieter,” he says. “That in itself made me think I don’t have to be so despairing about, say, the partisan political war, because we’re all just trapped in that lower mode. There is this possibility, however remote, that we could for brief periods ascend out into the other mind – and then it’s actually not so terrifying. Now, the problem is scale. I mean, if just one person does it, we’re still fucked.”He began writing Vigil because he was curious about whether the people who devoted decades to covering up climate change had regrets now, “given the weather”. The challenge – and he sees it as a moral one – is to “see if you can imagine how this action, which to you seems so bad, can to that person seem good”, he says. It’s partly a question of technical skill. “There’s a facile way to do it and a complex way to do it, and you can only find that out in the lines themselves,” he says. “If you don’t do it right, it leads to a facile kind of sympathy, that kind of liberal thing where someone drives a spike through your head and you say ‘thank you for the coat rack’.” In other words, he didn’t want to present KJ Boone in a sympathetic light or suggest his actions were right – but he did want to make him understandable, recognisably human and complex, the qualities we often struggle to recognise in our adversaries in the heat of a political argument.Saunders is still pondering how, given his platform, he should talk about politics when he goes on tour with Vigil in February. “To preach to the converted in the familiar terms in which they’re preached to feels a little too good, like it’s too much sugar. Whereas my nature is to be a little more of a peacemaker. But that’s dangerous right now because I don’t want to be a peacemaker for this regime,” he says.For now, he has a few months of quiet, walking the dog, pondering potential new writing projects. “The one thing I’m doubling down on is: just keep making fictive worlds. Improve the quality of your thought, improve the quality of your compassion, by that sacramental exercise, then whatever you have to do you’ll be better equipped,” he says. And then, inevitably, he adds the joke: “also start weightlifting, build a machine-gun turret …”Vigil by George Saunders will be published by Bloomsbury on 27 January.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The shock this time was the voice: not a nasal mature Cumbrian but a smoother, deeper, younger north Oxford tone. This was Misha Glenny’s debut, having replaced Melvyn Bragg as host of the university of the airwaves, In Our Time.Next week’s edition is a deep dive into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific, the world’s deepest oceanic depression, formed by the forced layering of tectonic plates. That subject might have been a good place for Glenny to begin, as he’s said that it was a 2008 edition on tectonic geology in the Bragg era that fired his fascination with the format and a desire to fill the seat if it became free.But the BBC might have feared the metaphorical implications – with Glenny navigating the Bragg Trench, Radio 4’s deepest chasm, following the polymath’s retirement last year after his 27-year stint.So there was logic in beginning instead with John Stuart Mill’s 1859 philosophical treatise, On Liberty. As a journalist and broadcaster, Glenny has reported on the rises and falls of authoritarian regimes, especially in eastern Europe. The lines between freedom and tyranny are a topical subject in the Putin and Trump ascendancies, with the US president also now de facto commander-in-chief of Venezuela and eyeing the governance of Greenland, Canada and Cuba.Brawls, blackmail and Judi Dench: 75 staggering moments from 75 years of The ArchersRead moreListeners, though, may have sensed buttock-clenching on the management floors of Broadcasting House when the conversation steered close to actual liberties taken by politicians. Glenny did not want to begin his In Our Time career by bringing the BBC a second$10bn lawsuitfrom the 45th/47th president.The show’s second incumbency began with a chaotic trail on the Today programme at 8.45am, in which Nick Robinson asked Glenny how the first show had gone. That seemed to throw his interviewee, whose mumbled response implied that he couldn’t say yet as it hadn’t gone out. (Radio 4 confirmed that the episode was pre-recorded.)The new host’s first academic triangle was Helen McCabe (University of Nottingham), Mark Philp (Warwick) and Piers Norris Turner (Ohio), the inclusion of an American suggesting a greater desire to reach out to the series’ big international audience.Beyond the identity of the presenter, nothing much had changed – the safest and probably most sensible approach with a broadcasting franchise transition. It was a thoughtful 42 minutes, especially revealing on the increasing belief that Mill’s wife, Harriet Taylor Mill, was a substantial co-author. A possible omission was real-life application and parallels. Although there were occasional references to a notional “despot” or “government” and “bigoted” thought, no names or places were mentioned. It is impossible to know if the focus would have been the same before a litigious occupant of the White House.With younger academics often up against a senior questioner, In Our Time has always resembled a varsity seminar. Bragg’s persona veered between testy professor and enthusiastic student, depending on the proximity of the topic to his own knowledge.On his first outing, Glenny sometimes sounded like a junior don taking over the class of a celebrated Emeritus, but this showed a proper humility about the magnitude of the challenge.Bragg developed various catchphrases – from “could you unpack that for us?” to an occasional, “yes, I’m not actually thick” when the unpacking of ideas became too Ikea. Glenny was scrupulously polite, coming closest to disagreement with a chuckling “that’s a different issue!”.Next week: tectonic plates. And, as whoever is now running the BBC will be well aware, the In Our Time succession comes at a time when the supportive layers beneath the corporation are bucking and perhaps buckling. A new director general and head of news are needed after the resignations ofTim Davie and Deborah Turnessover thePanorama editingthat triggered Trump’s litigation. The keystone TV series, Strictly Come Dancing, has no hosts at the moment and the signature radio franchise has just got a new one.It’s certain that In Our Time will be mentioned during the current negotiations with the government over a new BBC charter. The Glenny incumbency certainly can’t be accused of dumbing down – the biggest risk during BBC funding renewal – but he needs to access greater registers of approval and disapproval before he can claim bragging rights.In Our Time aired on BBC Radio Four and is available on BBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsRadioreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it is concern over Israel’s war in Gaza that has prompted the most intense criticism, with the Irish broadcaster RTÉ citing “the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there” as a reason for its non-participation.Alongside RTÉ, broadcasters from Spain,Iceland, the Netherlands and Slovenia said in December they were pulling out, while the 2024 winner Nemoreturnedtheir trophy in protest.On Tuesday, Conchita Wurst, one of the contest’smost emblematic winners, announced she would not participate in any future Eurovision events, citing a “personal decision”.The Israeli broadcaster Kan has welcomed the decision to keep Israel in the contest, rejecting allegations of political interference. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has said Israel “deserves to be represented on every stage around the world”.Johannes Pietsch, known by the stage name JJ, the 2025 winner, last year called for an Austrian edition “without Israel” but then apologised for the uproar his proposal had caused in his country.Only 97,000 fans watched Monday’s semi-final draw on YouTube, down from more than 240,000 last year. But the EBU rejoiced over a “record sellout of tickets” for the upcoming edition, after the launch of online sales on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Disco, Occasionally will be released on 6 March. It was produced by Kid Harpoon, the British songwriter and producer who has worked on all of Styles’ previous albums. The artwork shows the 31-year-old pop star wearing sunglasses and ducking beneath a disco ball seemingly suspended from the night sky.The 12-song track list has not been shared – nor any music – but Styles’ web store offered packages including vinyl, cassettes, T-shirts, what appears to be an analogue camera and a bum bag. The site seemed to immediately crash on the announcement.The long-awaited album news followed Styles sending a voice note of him singing “we belong together” to fans who had signed up to a WhatsApp promo line earlier in the day.It has been reported that Styles will give a second residency at Madison Square Garden in New York after playing 15 sold-out shows at the venue in 2022. It is also rumoured that Styles will hold a residency at the Co-op Live in Manchester, in which he is an investor. He has been tipped by bookies as a potential headliner of Glastonbury 2027 after the festival takes a fallow year this summer.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Harry Styles’ album Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally.Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally comes four years after Harry’s House, which reached No 1 around the world and was certified triple platinum in the UK with more than 900,000 certified sales. It won the coveted album of the year at the 2023 Grammy awards in addition to two other categories. It was also named album of the year at the 2023 Brit awards and spawned the hit single As It Was, his most-streamed song on Spotify with 4.2bn streams.The last new music Styles released was Forever, Forever, an eight-and-a-half minute instrumental song played on piano that he previously performed on the final date of his 2023 tour. Each of Styles’ previous albums was co-produced by Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson.The album will be Styles’ first since the death of his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne in October 2024 at the age of 31. Payne fell from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aries. In a statement released at the time, Styles said that Payne’s “greatest joy was making other people happy, and it was an honour to be alongside him as he did it”. One Direction were active from 2010 to 2016 after being formed on The X Factor.Outside music, Styles has made headlines as a marathon runner. He finished the 2025 Tokyo marathon in three hours and 24 minutes in March, but blitzed his own time at the Berlin marathon in September, achieving a covetedsub-three-hour finishin two hours and 59 minutes. His lifestyle brand Pleasing also made the news last year when it launched a sex toy and lube, complementing the line’s apparel, accessories and beauty products.In May, he was, mysteriously, spotted in Rome awaiting the announcement of the new pope, Leo XIV, wearing a cap emblazoned with “techno is my boyfriend”. If his new record contains religious themes, he will be in good company, after Rosalía’s Lux: released in November, the Catalan star’s fourth album referenced numerous saints from across history.Styles has also backed Ed Sheeran’s call for the government to provide funding for music education, investing in schools, training for music teachers, grassroots venues, apprenticeships and a diverse curriculum.In 2022 he starred in the films My Policeman and Don’t Worry Darling. Styles has no future publicised movie appearances.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The tapes are said to reveal Lowry’s authentic voice, which McKellen will lip-sync on screen.The Lancashire-born actor described the role as a “unique privilege”.“These tapes reveal an intimate insight into the artist’s thoughts – his ambitions, regrets and his humour. Anyone like me, who admires his paintings and drawings, will be intrigued and delighted that the artist is brought back to life through his own words,” McKellen said.View image in fullscreenA portrait of LS Lowry in Greater Manchester.Photograph: Robert Smithies/The GuardianLowry is admired for his unique depictions of working-class urban life, mill scenes and industrial landscapes, peopled with his distinctive matchstick men. He learned his craft in the evenings at Manchester’s Municipal College of Art and then at Salford School of Art while working as a rent collector by day.The tapes offer personal insights as he reminisced about his life, discussing experiences that shaped him from his childhood. The film-makers noted the “surprising exchange” between the enigmatic artist and a young fan – Angela Barratt – whose interviews “capture Lowry in his most intimate, reflective moments”.The documentary, titled L.S. Lowry: The Unheard Tapes, is also billed as a portrait of urban life in the north of England in the 20th century, exploring the transformation of Salford andGreater Manchester, the region Lowry depicted so prolifically and whose shifting industrial landscape profoundly influenced his work.Richard Grossick, representing the Lowry estate, said: “It is good fortune that these compelling recordings of interviews have survived and are being used in this way.”Of McKellen, he added: “It is hard to imagine any other actor better equipped to channel the rhythmical allure of Mr Lowry’s distinctive bygone Lancastrian tones.”Michael Simpson, the director of visual arts at the Lowry, a theatre and gallery space in Salford which now holds the tapes, said they reveal “an artist of wit, contradiction and perhaps surprising depth, far removed from the myth of the ‘simple man’”.In 2013, Tate Britain finally staged a large Lowry exhibition, which was billed as the first of its kind held by a public institution since the artist’s death.View image in fullscreenGoing to Work by LS Lowry depicts factory workers outside Mather and Platt engineering firm in Newton Heath, Manchester,  1943.Photograph: IWM/Imperial War Museums/GettyLongstanding admirers of Lowry include Julian Spalding, who staged exhibitions of his work as the director of galleries for the cities of Sheffield and Manchester at a time when he said the artist was “excluded” from London galleries and dismissed as a provincial northerner.Spalding has long accused the art establishment of displaying a snobbish elitism towards Lowry because he was from the north of England and popular with the public. He added: “Lowry wasn’t allowed in the picture at all. But he’s one of the big figures of British art of the 20th century – and he was totally sidelined.”The role of Angela will be played by Annabel Smith, who is appearing at the Royal Court theatre in The Shitheads.The BBC Arts Arena documentaryL.S.

The Palestinian author and academic Randa Abdel-Fattah, who wasuninvited from this year’s writers’ week, was among the group.Adelaide festival apologises to Randa Abdel-Fattah and invites her to participate in 2027 writers’ weekRead moreWhen Friedman was notified, the academics were sent a letter by the board saying that requesting the cancellation of an artist or writer was an “extremely serious” issue.“We have an international reputation for supporting artistic freedom of expression,” the letter signed by the board’s chair, Tracey Whiting, said.“Thomas L Friedman was programmed to contribute online from New York. However, I have been advised that due to last-minute scheduling issues, he is no longer participating in this year’s program.”Whiting resigned as the chair of the festival board on Saturday. Guardian Australia has been unable to reach her for comment.The inconsistency between the way the board handled the cases of Friedman and Abdel-Fattah was brought to light earlier his week when Berg’s previously confidential letter of resignation from the board began circulating.Berg’s letter was tendered on 22 October to Whiting, South Australian arts minister Andrea Michaels and the Adelaide festival’s executive director, Julian Hobba.“I cannot serve on a board which employs a director of Adelaide Writers Week (AWW) … who programs writers who have a vendetta against Israel and Zionism,” Berg wrote in his resignation email.“That the director programs pro-Palestinians and anti-Zionists is well known. The Board has encouraged her to program writers who might have a different perspective. She resolutely fails to do so.”He accused Adler of lobbying for the cancellation of one such person who held a different perspective to her “on the grounds of alleged inappropriate description of Middle East countries and organisations even when many of the pro-Palestinian writers she has programmed have said and posted much worse things about Israel and Zionists”.Earlier this week, Berg sent a statement to media confirming it was Friedman he was referring to in his resignation email.“In 2024, Louise Adler led a demand to the board to retract an invitation to Tom Friedman to participate in the 2024 Adelaide Writers Week,” Berg’s statement said.“After Tom Friedman … was invited to speak, Randa Abdel-Fattah had led a group of academics demanding that Tom Friedman be de-platformed. Then Louise Adler, [Adelaide festival artistic director] Ruth MacKenzie and [festival chief executive] Kath Mainland put an ultimatum to the board that they would resign if it did not endorse their recommendation to disinvite Friedman. In the face of that threat, the Board felt it had no alternative but to allow withdraw [sic] the invitation to Friedman.”Berg accused Adler and Abdel-Fatah of being “utterly hypocritical” in accusing the board of repressing freedom of speech when they had both actively sought to deny it to Friedman.“They both exhibit hypocrisy in defending free speech for some, when I observed them both to stridently oppose free speech during my time on the board,” he said.Adler resigned on Tuesday over Abdel-Fattah’s cancellation, and later that day, the Adelaide Festival Corporation announced the cancellation of the 2026 writers’ festival.Adler responded to Berg’s allegations by accusing the former board member of breaching board confidentiality.“I consider discussions of the board table to be confidential,” she said in a prepared statement.“I’m rather surprised that a former CEO of Macquarie Bank has breached those confidences. It’s indicative of the way the former board operated, and I believe will make for a rich case study for future management students.”Abdel-Fattah disputed Berg’s claims that she, along with Adler, led the charge to cancel Friedman.“I was one of 10 Indigenous and academics of colour who wrote a researched letter with references and footnotes about the harm of racial tropes,” she said in a statement to Guardian Australia.“What is missing in this is the question of power. We write letters on Google Docs to boards. The people who want to cancel us have premiers intervening.”Since last Thursday, the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has denied any direct interference, insisting the board acted independently.Adelaide festival has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAdelaide festivalSouth Australian politicsFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

In recent years, the adaptations have been infused with the grief and instability of the postwar backdrop against which they all exist, and been given rich, dark, adult inflections by Sarah Phelps for the BBC.The latest, however, is for Netflix by Chris Chibnall and we are back in the world of period costume, clipped vowels and dialogue infused with nothing but plot, designed to get the puzzle pieces recited into the right position for the next bit then the next bit then the solving – this time at the end of three very hour-long episodes.We open with Iain Glen getting gored to death by a bull in Ronda, 1920. A note with a clock printed on it is delivered to him just before evisceration – because this is Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials and clocks are bloody everywhere.We then cut to a party in a grand house being held by northern industrialists, the Cootes, who have rented the house from Lady Caterham (Helena Bonham Carter) because she has class but no cash and they have cash but no class. You get the idea. If you don’t, there’s a scene where Lady Coote cheats at bridge, so we all know where we stand. But I do have to say this: if you’re going to have posh people snotting all over others, you should make sure they’re not spouting grammatical errors everywhere, unless it’s deliberate and ironically intended. If not, you need to know that it’s “the difference between you and me” not “the difference between you and I” and assorted other points. Is this the smallest hill I will die on? Yes.View image in fullscreenHelena Bonham Carter as Lady Caterham in Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials.Photograph: NetflixThe daughter of the house, Lady Eileen “Bundle” Brent (Mia McKenna-Bruce) is having a pretty good time at the party. Gerry Wade (Corey Mylchreest), the best friend of her late brother, killed in the war (“Life is far too short. We’ve all learned that the hard way”), asks her to dinner and makes it clear he plans to propose. Unfortunately, he is found dead in his bed the next morning, apparently after a sleeping draught overdose. But he was a notoriously sound sleeper, who never had need of a sleeping draught! That fact was so well known that his two prankster pals had hidden eight alarm clocks (ordials) around the room to wake him up that morning. But why are they now all on the mantelpiece? And why is one of them missing (makingseven)? And why is the missing one later found broken on the lawn?After a butterfingered working-class policeman breaks everything he touches at the potential crime scene, Bundle decides to investigate the matter herself. The Cootes leave in a rush, only stopping to make one of the servants cry and for Sir Oswald to gesture at the Caterham pile and announce “I can access this world whenever I flourish my chequebook. They say you can’t buy class but it’s the cheapest, most readily available purchase in all of England!” I know it’s early days but if I hear a more monkey-typed speech this year I’ll be surprised, and horrified.View image in fullscreen‘Life is too short’ … Mia McKenna-Bruce as ‘Bundle’ Brent and Corey Mylchreest as Gerry Wade.Photograph: NetflixBy this stage of proceedings, I realise this is Agatha Christie by way of Enid Blyton, made for an international market that thinks Downton Abbey is real and that Paddington Bear is holding the queen’s hand in heaven. Otherwise it was commissioned to teach complainers about remakes a lesson. “Alright – you’ll learn the hard way why some of Agatha’s back catalogue remains undeveloped and next time we give you another Poirot, you’ll take your Belgian lumps and like it.”On we go, through the motions, somehow watching a production more dated than a Joan Hickson Marple would be, as Bundle looks at telltale stains on furniture and interviews crying maids, anonymous notes arrive, letters mentioning “seven dials” but not what it means are discovered, trips to London are undertaken, the identity of Iain Glen is revealed and the prankster helping her (the entirely wasted Nabhaan Rizwan) is shot (“You’ve been shot!” cries Bundle as she cradles the dying man who is presumably both aware of this fact and unlikely to want to be reminded). At last Martin Freeman arrives as real detective Supt Battle. As Battle brings order to the investigation, so Freeman brings some credibility to the televisual proceedings, pulling the thing together and up by virtue of his presence and an instinctive feel for how wholeheartedly and firmly these things need to be played. It’s a relief, but whether it’s enough to get you through all three uninspired, pedestrian hours of a supposed espionage thriller is up to you. Retro without flair and full of modern concerns about everyone’s emotional wellbeing is a mix that doesn’t work for me.Agatha Christie’s Seven Dials is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAgatha ChristiereviewsShareReuse this content"

Showered with awards, the book was a runaway hit and sparked a literary trend for shared transformative encounters with animals including cats, dogs, magpies and hares.This month, H Is for Hawk comes to the big screen in a new adaptation starring Claire Foy. But there is still time to get to know the source material, which tells of the sudden death of the author’s father and how Macdonald, an experienced falconer who had previously trained kestrels and peregrines, took delivery of a temperamental young goshawk named Mabel with the aim of taming her and teaching her to hunt. Macdonald, who is non-binary, is the audiobook’s narrator. Their reading is characterised by introspection, curiosity and flashes of humour as they observe this “spooky, pale-eyed psychopath” who, as well as feeding and flying, likes to play ball with scrunched-up bits of paper.H Is for Hawk intersperses the author’s adventures with their companion with biographical excerpts on writer TH White whose book, The Goshawk, chronicled his own attempts to train a bird in the 1930s using ancient and cruel methods. Unsurprisingly, Macdonald does a better job and their account of their relationship with the goshawk, which helps to alleviate a grief that feels close to insanity, is deeply affecting. Though the sections on White are diverting, it’s when conjuring the life and character of this extraordinary bird of prey that Macdonald’s prose truly soars.Available via Penguin Audio, 11hr 5minFurther listeningThe Let Them Theory: A Life-Changing Tool That Millions of People Can’t Stop Talking AboutMel Robbins, Audible Studios, 10hr 38minRobbins, a writer, podcaster and motivational speaker, reads her bestselling self-help book advocating confidence, serenity and letting go of the desire to influence other people and their opinions.A History of England in 25 PoemsCatherine Clarke, Penguin Audio, 12hr 48minAn eclectic series of poems connecting the English to their past, from the jingoist Agincourt Carol (1415) to John of Gaunt’s This England speech in Shakespeare’s Richard II to Adlestrop, Edward Thomas’s wartime paean to the countryside, as viewed from a train.Explore more on these topicsBooksAudiobook of the weekAudiobooksBirdsWildlifereviewsShareReuse this content"

As late as 2022, the Times’scolumnist Matthew Parris published acolumnheadlined “Fat shaming is the only way to beat the obesity crisis” in which he attributed Britain’s “losing battle with fat” to society’s failure to goad and stigmatise the overweight into finally, shamefacedly, eating less. The tendency to equate excess weight with poor character (and thinness with grit and self-control) treats obesity as a moral as well as physical failing – less a disease than a lifestyle choice.One of the great strengths of Reuters journalist Aimee Donnellan’s first book is its insistence on framing the discovery of the new weight-loss drugs within the fraught social and cultural context of beauty norms, body image and health. For those who need them, weekly injections of Ozempic, Wegovy or Mounjaro can be revolutionary. Yet for every person with diabetes or obesity taking the drugs to improve their health, others – neither obese nor diabetic – are obtaining them to get “beach-body” ready, fit into smaller dresses, or attain the slender aesthetic social media demands of them. Small wonder some commentators have likened the injections to “an eating disorder in a pen”.Like all great tales of scientific discovery, the weight loss saga is rich in serendipity, rivalry and obsessionDonnellan opens the book with a case in point, a poignant interview with “Sarah”, a 34-year-old marketing executive from Michigan. She recounts a summer of unprecedented success at work – suddenly being included in important meetings, being assigned new management responsibilities and receiving a raise. Yet nothing had changed about her behaviour at work. It was her appearance – after six months on Ozempic – that had undergone a metamorphosis. In the eyes of her employers, shedding five stone (32kg) of weight had transformed her worth: Sarah mattered more because she weighed less.Like all great tales of scientific discovery, the weight loss saga is rich in serendipity, rivalry and obsession – all of which Donnellan recounts with relish. Wonderfully, it includes a starring role for the only venomous lizard in the US, the Gila monster, though I will refrain from spoilers here. Another key protagonist is Svetlana Mojsov, a young Macedonian immigrant to the US who arrived at New York’s Rockefeller University in 1972 to do post-grad chemistry. (Today, one imagines, ICE would probably deport her.) At this time, the causes of obesity were seen as self-evident – eating too much and exercising too little – and therefore unfit for serious scientific inquiry. Mojsov disagreed. She was fascinated by why some people seemed to feel sated earlier than others, or metabolised food more quickly. Her research – for which she is tipped to win a future Nobel prize – successfully engineered a synthetic version of a natural hormone, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), which helps control blood sugar.Scientists at Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk seized on GLP-1 as a potential new treatment for diabetes. Decades of effort at last culminated in a drug, semaglutide, that people with diabetes could administer once weekly, unlike multiple daily injections of insulin. But the drug trials revealed something unprecedented. Not only did semaglutide control blood sugar beautifully, it caused participants to lose up to 20% of their body weight, seemingly without even trying. Novo Nordisk had stumbled across the holy grail – a safe chemical treatment for obesity that worked to astonishing effect. As word of the miracle jab leaked, celebrities began to seek it out. When a newly svelte Oprah Winfrey told her podcast fans that taking the drug was the cause, suddenly everyone was clamouring for Ozempic. That this had occurred in her lifetime, said Winfrey, “felt like relief, like redemption, like a gift”. It was certainly a gift to Novo Nordisk, whose market value is now, thanks to Ozempic, bigger than the entire GDP of Norway.Commendably, Donnellan is careful not to treat the GLP-1 drugs an unalloyed good. She addresses their side-effects, such as severe nausea, and their use by non-obese people to the potential detriment of their health. The one omission is that she doesn’t dig into what is surely the most intriguing aspect of weight-loss drugs: incredibly, scientists simply don’t know why they excel at treating obesity, beyond the fact that GLP-1 receptors are present in the brain. It appears that saturating the brain with abnormally high levels of the hormone dials down people’s craving for food. A lifetime of incessant chatter about eating is dampened. Restraint becomes easy, effortless. Does this mean drugs like Ozempic will be licensed in the future to treat drug, alcohol, gambling and sex addiction? What would that do to our concept of free will? Ozempic is a miracle drug, a rebuke to a century of condemnation of those who are obese, and a profound challenge to the very definition of what it means to be human.

She is helping Salmon prepare to challenge Lincoln in the 1864 elections­ – managing alliances and optics, and planning a party to announce his campaign, plus a lucrative marriage to finance it, despite her deep connection with Lincoln’s secretary, John Hay.But while this production from Brooklyn-based companythe american vicariousraises interesting questions about female power, ambition and the psychological fallout of an emotionally distant father, it struggles to answer them fully or with enough heft.Thomas Klingenstein’s script too often strays into the expositional weeds of the civil war. (Amajor Republican donor, Klingenstein believes the US is in a “cold civil war” with the “woke regime”, though he keeps things historical here.) In a production directed by Christopher McElroen, there is little badinage to lift the dense dialogue, a missed trick given Kate’s intellect, and her political manoeuvrings are confined to the house. As she mines Hay for information, primes military commander George B McClellan (Haydn Hoskins) and prods Salmon’s love interest Carlotta (Christy Meyer), you long to witness her prowess in the wild – or at least at her own party. Deliberate side-lining, perhaps, but frustrating nonetheless.View image in fullscreenLittle badinage … Wallis Currie-Wood, Darrell Brockis and Tom Victor in Our American Queen.Photograph: Lidia CrisafulliNeal Wilkinson’s set, a huge dining table bedecked for the party, screams of the importance of appearances, and the people who don’t get a seat, while images changing in a gilded frame keep pace with the war. Occasionally, an actor turns unnecessarily upstage and the frame shows a live feed of them – a technical flourish that simply robs us of watching characters face-to-face. The enormous table further hamstrings connection, as the cast skirt around it, although this works for Kate and Hay’s flirtatious sparring.Their relationship is the play’s most successful element, and the pair are the strongest of the cast of five. Tom Victor’s sensitive Hay stokes sparks of vulnerability in Wallis Currie-Wood’s steely Kate, which later ignite a bonfire of repressed pain. Darrell Brockis is suitably impassive as Salmon, though his accent is distractingly patchy.In the end, the play’s biggest challenge becomes managing both Kate’s fictional motivations and real-world actions. It leaves us unsure about what truly drove this formidable woman.AtBridewell theatre, London, until 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreUS politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The results struck some contemporary listeners as austere, but there’s a self-effacing purity and beauty about this complex, intellectually probing music that deserves a wider audience than hitherto.

In Memoriam Dylan Thomas from 1954 is an extended, impassioned setting for solo tenor of Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Threni, a spiny, multifaceted jewel from 1958, sets words from the Book of Lamentations. The haunting Introitus and bristling Requiem Canticles, from 1965 and 1966 respectively, complete the set, interspersed with briefer pieces including an unpretentious Lord’s Prayer and the severely cerebral two-minute Elegy for JFK.The playing of theNoord Nederlands Orkestis fearlessly crisp and clean, but it’s the characterful vocals ofCappella Amsterdamthat really draw the ear, bringing this spellbinding music to life.

The Commodore 64 Ultimate, a new version of the legendary 8-bit computer, comes in a box designed to resemble the original packaging – a photo of the machine itself on a background of deep blue fading into a series of white stripes. Then when you open it, you find an uncannily accurate replica of what fans lovingly referred to as the breadbox – the chunky, sloped Commodore 64, in hues of brown and beige, the red LED in one corner above the row of fawn-coloured function keys. It’s like 1982 all over again.My dad bought us a C64 in late 1983. It was our second computer after the ZX81 and it felt like an enormous leap into the future with its detailed colour graphics, advanced sound chip and proper grown-up keyboard. We unpacked it on our dinner table, plugging it into a small portable TV and loading the one game we had, a very basic Donkey Kong clone named Crazy Kong. My life would never be the same again. This contraption was my obsession for the next four years – my friendships and free-time would revolve around games such as Bruce Lee, Paradroid and Hyper Sports. To this day, I treasure the memories of playing golf sim Leaderboard with my dad. The sound effects, speech samples and graphics conjured by that computer have lived rent free in my head for, god, almost 40 years.View image in fullscreenAn array of classic and modern inputs … Commodore 64 UltimatePhotograph: CommodoreCommodore was a huge success for a decade. It followed the 64 (which sold somewhere between 12-30m units) with the Amiga, another great gaming machine. But with the rise of the PC came a long painful decline – the company eventually filing for bankruptcy in 1994, the brand kept semi-alive for years afterwards by a series of intellectual property buyouts. In August 2025, however, retro YouTuber Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson, backed by a board of Commodore veterans, bought the brand and promised to reinvigorate it.The result is the Ultimate, a faithful reproduction, not just in looks (although you can opt for a Starlight edition with lots of LED lights and a transparent case), but in tech specs. Instead of running a software emulation of the C64, it’s built around an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) – an integrated circuit programmed to simulate the actual hardware. You can plug in an original C64 Datasette or disk drive and it will run original software (a wonderful touch is that if you’re running a disk file, the computer simulates the noise of a disk drive complete with whirs, tics and bleeps). It even has a cartridge port that will run old game carts such as International Soccer. To complete the scene, you can plug your old Quick Shot II into one of the two joystick ports. Then simply load up a copy of Daley Thompson’s Decathlon and immediately break it.View image in fullscreenBreaking joysticks as well as Olympic records … Daley Thompson’s Decathlon gamePhotograph: Ocean/MobyGamesBut it’s not just a machine for playing old games. Turn it on using the authentic power switch on the side and it boots into the original Commodore 64 start screen, complete with the words, “Commodore 64 Basic V2, 64K Ram system, 38911 Basic Bytes free. Ready.” And the flashing cursor. You can programme it just as you could back then, using Basic or, if you’re feeling advanced, assembly language. Obviously I tried everyone’s first program in the 1980s:10 print “keith is cool”;20 goto 10It worked. After that, I dug out an old program listing from Computer & VideoGamesmagazine and have been typing it in – although it’s a challenge as the print is small, faint and smudged after 30 years in my attic. On top of this, you can click the power button upwards and it switches to an alternate menu crammed with new options. You can plug in a USB thumb drive and load C64 games and apps that you’ve acquired online. The computer also comes with a sample USB drive (shaped like a cassette tape) that is filled with demos and games to try. Even better, it’s easy to connect it the internet via a wired or wireless connection, which gives you access to a community archive of games, as well as old school bulletin board systems, basically the 1980s equivalents of Reddit forums.What I love about the machine is this seamless integration of modern tech into a retro environment. You can plug it into a modern monitor via HDMI, but the menus and inputs are all redolent of the 1980s era – lists of text, Ascii art, cursor keys or W, A, S, D for navigation. The memories of interacting with this ancient hardware came flooding back. Everything you did on the C64 required some effort and expertise, whether that was loading a game or writing little programs – there was no drag-and-drop, no plug-and-play; you were a computer user not a platform consumer. In its press release announcing the product, Commodore referred to itself as “the Digital Detox Brand – a bold stand against today’s toxic tech”. And while that’s a little polemical and self-aggrandising, there’s some truth in it. Exploring the C64 these last few weeks has given me more pleasure than downloading an app on to my phone ever has.Set to be priced at £260.50 ($349.99/AU$524), it’s not cheap and begs the question – is there value to this machine beyond its appeal to original owners? I think there is. In a more accessible way thanthe incredible PDP-10 replicaI wrote about last year, it’s a living historical relic, a way to reconnect with the original concept of a desktop home computer – as something we learned and coded for. The excellent user’s guide it ships with is filled with useful information on how to get it to make music and display graphics; I sincerely hope that an alternative indie gaming scene thrives here as a result. There is intrinsic value in understanding computers at a fundamental level beyond slick user interfaces; there is value in developing a knowledge of how programs work, however simple.And even the machine’s nostalgic impact has worth. It has been fun to show my sons this fossilised contraption – no curated walls of games to buy, no ads, no pop-ups, no social media notifications. Meanwhile, playing those old games again has proven the value of great design and clever programming over hype and visual impact. It’s a lesson we could all afford to learn.Commodore 64 Ultimate is available from March, £260.50/$349.99/AU$524Explore more on these topicsGamesRetro gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Stars are already appearing in the inky mid-afternoon sky.Life-changing moments are easy to spot in retrospect, but at the time they can feel so ordinary. I didn’t know then that my wintry swim would lead to a year of adventures. I was a hair’s breadth from wimping out, but then I was in. The water was so cold it burned. I gasped for breath. The bones in my feet ached with cold as I trod water, legs frantic under the dark surface. It lasted under a minute and then we were out.As we warmed up, hands around mugs of hot chocolate, skin zinging from the experience, more and more women arrived at the cafe, hair wet from the sea. As stars spread across the early evening sky, we chatted about swimming and how it made us feel. I’d been looking for something to pick me up ever since I had left my job on the verge of burnout. I said to my friend: “I’m going to spend a year doing this. I’ve finally found what makes me feel alive. I’m going to spend a year swimming in the Nordic countries.”View image in fullscreenAllas Pool in Helsinki.Photograph: Subodh Agnihotri/AlamyThere are some delightful generalisations to make about Nordic people. Finns, they say, are born in the sauna. Norwegians are said to be born on skis. But if you ask me, all Nordic people are born with saltwater in their veins: that’s how much they love the sea. In Iceland it’s so ingrained that people see water as a cure-all. If you need time to think, if you need perspective, they say you should lay your head in water. It became my mantra for the year.I swam in a harbour pool all by myself, as if I owned it, with views of the Oslofjord’s rocky pine-covered islands stippling the horizonI decided to swim once a week wherever I was. After my experience in Bergen, I returned to my home in Copenhagen and started to plot a route around the region. Where would I swim if I could swim anywhere? I could take a dip in the harbour outside my flat – that was easy. But what about Sweden, 35 minutes away by train? What about the Arctic – could I do that? Maybe I’d swim inAllas Pool, the heated floating swimming pool in Helsinki harbour I’d seen on Instagram.As a journalist covering Scandinavia, the travel side was easy; all I had to do was pack my kit wherever I went on assignment. I only needed a swimming costume, two towels, one for my feet and one for my body, and an S hook to hang my bag from. That last tip came from a lady I swam with one pitch-black morning in central Copenhagen: you don’t want to inadvertently leave your bag in a puddle, after all.View image in fullscreenLaura at Copenhagen’s Kastrup sea pool.Photograph: Laura HallI reached out to other Scandinavian swimmers on Instagram to ask if I could join them for a dip if I was in town. I looked up places with saunas, natural spas and simple stretches of beach where other people regularly swam. Serendipitously, things started to happen. I went to write about a tiny hotel on a remote archipelago in Arctic Norway and I found myself packing a swimming costume. I landed in a snowstorm and the next day picked my way down an icy path fromthe Arctic Hideaway’s sauna to the quay in my flip-flops. Looking down, I could make out the dark purple spiny sea urchins moving on the seafloor. And then I was in, head under the water, in a sea where an orca had been seen just days before.I’ve learned that doing things that make you feel alive is intoxicating. Sinking into nature on a regular basis makes you feel part of itAt the Arctic Hideaway I met Siri, a champion freediver, and a few months later I went to meet her in Oslo. I swam in aharbour poolall by myself, as if I owned it, with views of the Oslofjord’s rocky pine-covered islands stippling the horizon. At lunch, Siri told me how she had dived with orca in northern Norway and seen a huge bull orca spot her, turn and swim towards her. He had appraised her with one of his black eyes before calmly swimming away. I was in awe of what you can find in the sea if you go looking.As the year went on, my swimming confidence grew. I met dippers dressed as mermaids, whirlpool swimmers, lighthouse swimmers and a lot of naked swimmers. I met people setting themselves big swimming challenges, and those who make a daily practice of submerging themselves in the water for their health and for fun. It has been a life-changing adventure.View image in fullscreenLaura even swam at Uunartoq in Greenland.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyI knew I had really changed when I found myself swimming in Greenland. On a tiny island calledUunartoqin the south of the country, I stripped down to my black swimming costume. Just off shore, two icebergs, each the size of a three-bedroom detached house, floated beneath stern black mountains. Up the hill, there was a natural hot pool with gently simmering water. But all I wanted to do was get in the sea.Travels in Moominland: summer in Tove Jansson’s FinlandRead moreMy feet sank into the feather-soft sand of the beach as I ran and threw my body into the waves. Little pieces of seaweed drifted in the water and I could see all the way to the bottom. I was out quickly, unable to take the cold for long. But I ran up and down the beach to warm up so I could go in again, this time for longer. Then I climbed the hill and sank into the 38C waters of the island’s hot spring, watching tiny bubbles percolate up from the silty floor.After a year of swimming in some of the world’s coldest seas, I’ve learned a lot about my ability to do hard things. I’ve learned that doing things that make you feel alive, with other people who feel the same, is intoxicating. I’ve found that sinking into nature on a regular basis makes you feel part of it. I’d started the year feeling burnt out and depressed, not sure if I could find a future for myself in this part of the world. But I learned that while I will always be English, it’s still possible to get a little saltwater in your veins.The Year I Lay My Headin Water: Swimming Scandinavia in Search of a Better Lifeby Laura Hallis published by Icon at £18.99.

To put it bluntly, I’m afraid you’re out of luck.Alcoholdoes much more than make you tipsy; it is the magic ingredient that gives so much of wine’s wondrous complexity, character and charm. Not only does it carry volatile compounds that make up wine’s endlessly fascinating combinations of scents and tastes, along with a sensation of warmth, it also creates that viscous body and texture – what’s rather grossly known in the trade as “mouthfeel” – of the liquid in your mouth, and the overall balance of all these factors in the wine.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When the base wine is dealcoholised, however, all that character goes with it. Compared with beer’s relatively low-alcohol content, wine’s usual 11%-15% ABV means that, when the alcohol has gone, you feel its absence more, which is partly whynolo beers are generally more successful than nolo wine. That said, there are some wine substitutes that are worth trying, but, to avoid disappointment, my advice is to see them as drinks thataren’twine because, well, they’re simply not.Some compounds can be reintroduced after dealcoholisation, or added, usually with unfermented grape juice, to replicate wine-like aromas and flavours. Hi-tech processes are improving all the time, but it’s still nigh-on impossible to mimic effectively the weight and balance of wine. Sugar is often used to give some body and/or to counteract excessive tartness, but that means many such drinks are unattractively sweet and cloying.Fizz fares the best. Bubbles give a layer of refreshing spritz, as well as that pleasingly celebratory pop of the cork, while chilling helps to crisp up the flavours and tone down sweetness. Feel free to add cocktail-ish flourishes to up the interest factor: a dash of crème de cassis, say, or elderflower cordial. A black velvet made 50:50 with 0.0% Guinness also works well.Sparkling fermented teas can be a good wine alternative, the tea providing a little welcome tannic structure (try the Real naturally alcohol-free range, which is widely available and£10 at Waitrose), while kombucha’s natural acidity lends an appetising, tangy kick to the palate and comes with probiotic and antioxidant benefits to boot.I’d also serve nolo reds a bit cool. They’re the trickiest to copy, so need all the help they can get to stop them being jammy, and they’re certainly no match for a real red wine, but the best can just about cut the mustard with a steak or tomato-based pasta, and they also respond well to mulling, if that’s your thing. White wine fans would do best with drinks made from aromatic grapes such as muscat, whose floral sweetness can make a pleasing match with gently spiced food, as well as a humble sweet chilli crisp.Four nolo wine alternatives to tickle your tastebudsLyre’s Classico Rosé£14.99 (75cl) Lyre’s, 0%.

My friend Mark’s dad’s boat, along with all the others, would be stacked high with sacks ofqueeniesthat they’d dredged up only hours before, and Mark’s mum would pack us off to school with a tub each of queen scallop meat doused inSarson’s vinegarand white pepper, to eat later as a playground snack. At the time, I thought nothing of it, but, looking back now, I realise quite what a luxurious schoolday treat this was.These days, however, our local scallop fishermen don’t fish for queenies much any more, because the time it takes to shuck and clean them is more or less the same as that for larger king scallops, so they’re no longer financially viable; also, instead of all those trawlers that Lyme Bay had in the past, it’s now mostly divers who fish more sustainably for kingscallops, without demolishing the sea bed in the process. There are two main dive boats that fish out of Lyme Regis nowadays, operated by Jon Shuker and Ali Day, and they’ve pretty much cornered the local market. They recently started experimenting with so-called “disco scallops”, which are caught in pots fitted with flashing lights that lure them in, which is much more efficient, crew-wise, than diving, because a boat with one diver is legally required to have a crew of four, comprising the working diver, a standby diver, a supervisor and a driver. Crazy, eh?That’s why scallops come with a pretty hefty price tag. And while those pot-caught disco scallops are more economical for staffing costs, they’re less so catch-wise, because the yield is nowhere near as good. Let’s wait and see how the experiment goes, but in principle I wholeheartedly support this kind of new commercial fishing idea; the disco scallop fishing method alsowon the innovation award atthe BBC Food & Farming awards a few months ago, as a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to harvest scallops.Party starters: Jacob Kenedy’s Italian Christmas canapes – recipesRead moreYou may well have watched the David Attenborough documentaryOcean, which featured some shocking footage of the damage that dredging does to the seabed. My 13-year-old daughter, Isla, and I both ended up in tears, and it left so powerful an impression on me that I think the series should be compulsory viewing in schools. If this kind of thing were on the curriculum, our kids wouldn’t grow up thinking that food comes only from the supermarket.Scallops were never off the menu at my formerLyme Regis restaurantHix Oyster & Fish House – or at least not unless the weather was so bad that the divers were unable to get out to sea – and I’ve served them in just about every which way possible – with black pudding or chorizo; cooked, chopped and added to a big mix of roast local shellfish; and raw in the form of ceviche and the like. In the West Country, we don’t get those huge scallops that Scottish divers catch, but the flipside of that is ours cost about a fifth of the price. In a restaurant, you can pay upwards of 25 quid for just one fat Scottish scallop, while for the same price you could probably get a plate of five Lyme Bay ones.This week’s recipe is perhaps my favourite way to cook scallops at home. It’sveryeasy, too – though if you wanted to titivate it a little, you could maybe crumble some black pudding into the crust, or some chopped and fried chorizo, or a little grated lemon zest, or sprinkle on a splash of white vermouth or pastis (Tarquin’s make a great local one down in Cornwall) at the end.Baked scallops with herb crustServes412 scallops, cleaned and on the half-shellFlaky sea salt and black pepper80g butter2 medium shallots, peeled and finely chopped4 garlic cloves, peeled and grated100g fresh white breadcrumbs3 tbsp chopped soft herbs– parsley, chives, tarragon or chervil, or a mixtureHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the scallops on a baking tray and season. Melt the butter in a frying pan on a medium heat, then sweat the chopped shallots and grated garlic for a couple of minutes, until soft but not coloured. Take off the heat, stir in the white breadcrumbs and chopped soft herbs, and season. Spoon the herby breadcrumbs evenly over the top of the scallops, pop the tray in the oven and bake for six to eight minutes, until golden. Serve immediately, ideally with a glass of something crisp and white.Mark Hix is a restaurateur and writer based in Dorset.

While it’s not something I do explicitly, I do like to cut back a bit at the beginning of the year. The marathon that is Christmas socialising can be fun but relentless, and I imagine there are many others in the same boat. When it comes to wine, at least, the problem with cutting back is what to do with the rest of the bottle. Sure, I’ll have a glass or two if I fancy it one evening, but it’s pretty much a wasted bottle if you don’t finish the rest within a few days. Fear not – I have a plethora of recipes that will ensure you never need to waste a drop – enjoy a glass or two, then use the rest in the dish of your choice. Winner, winner,chicken Marbella dinner(one of my all-time effortless favourites – scroll the link for the recipe).There are lots of excellent suggestions in thiswonderful featureon how to incorporate wine into everything from pasta to pudding. In particular, the braised short ribs from James Ramsden immediately caught my attention, as this is precisely the kind of food I want to be making and eating right now. Preferably with a pan of oozy,buttery polentaon the side. Another dish that is ticking all the cold, winter boxes is Tom Hunt’smeat stew, an all-round great braising method. If you are more of a white wine drinker, then Italian classicchicken cacciatoreis equally comforting and would also be perfect with creamy polenta ormash. And let’s not forget about rosé – whoever says you can only drink it in the summer has clearly not readFiona Beckett’s strong casefor this delicate pink drink being enjoyed year-round. While the recipe for theseprawns with garlic and chillicalls for white wine, I am confident you could happily switch for rosé.View image in fullscreenBoozy goodness … Nigel Slater’s spiced pears with red wine and dark chocolate.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverIf meat is not your bag, then there are also plenty of vegetarian ways to cook with wine. When I was growing up, my mum always used red wine in her pasta sauces, often with slow-cooked, sweet onions and aubergine. Rachel Roddy’s recipe forspaghetti with red wine and onionsisn’t a million miles away from that nostalgic sauce, and the same goes for Joe Trivelli’spici in red wine(with the added bonus of hardy, bitter radicchio). Meera Sodha also likes to pair full-bodied wine with radicchio, in the form of a heartyrisotto, which is surely the ultimate bowl of winter food. I will take portions of them all, thank you.And, just because it is January, let’s not forget pudding. In fact, I make more of a beeline for it during the colder months because my days deserve all the added joy they can find right now. While thesecherries in red wineare a simple summer treat, I also love them in the depths of winter, made with what I consider a freezer essential – frozen pitted cherries. Make a batch, leave them in the fridge and enjoy whenever you need a sweet fix (I top them with whipped cream and crumbled amaretti). And while Nigel Slater’s recipe forspiced pears in red wine and chocolatecalls for a whole bottle of red, rather than a leftover amount, I think it is worthy and brings all the good things to the winter table – a spectacular pudding, whether you are being abstemious or not.My week in drinksView image in fullscreenOld-school … Mr Fitzpatrick’s Temperance Bar.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianPosh pop|Mr Fitzpatrick’s Temperance Barin Rawtenstall, Lancashire, is one of my favourite pit stops when I am in the north-west.
