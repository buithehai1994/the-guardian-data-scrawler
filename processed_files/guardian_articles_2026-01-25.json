Here’s what the science saysAmy FlemingSun 25 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTShareEver since Keith, 39, from Kansas, was in a car accident in 2023, he has lived with “pretty much constant mid-back and shoulder pain”. Over-the-counter treatments didn’t touch the sides and he didn’t want to resort to opiates. “Having exhausted everything there was solid science for with no satisfaction, I delved into acupressure,” he says. He bought an acupressure mat made of lightly padded fabric, studded all over with tiny plastic spikes, to lay his back on, and was surprised to find that it actually helped.Acupressure mats, also known as Shakti mats, are inspired by the beds of nails that Indian gurus used for meditation and healing more than 1,000 years ago. While today’s mats have the nonthreatening sheen of a luxury wellbeing product, the spikes are no joke. In fact, the internet serves up a plethora of images of flaming, dented backs after their use – although you’re unlikely to seriously injure yourself using them. While the mats have been widely available for more than a decade, there has been a recent surge in mainstream interest. You may have seen them heavily advertised on your social media feed, the most prominent brand being Shakti Mat, made in India and costing up to £99 for the premium model. But Amazon is full of acupressure mats and pillows –Lidl recently stockeda mat and pillow combo for a tenner. Yet there is still no compelling evidence that they relieve stress, pain and sleep problems, or help with any other unmet health needs.It’s not a cure-all, and I’ve got no science-based explanation for it, but I find relief when I use the matKeith reclines on his mat and pillow for about 45 minutes at a time. “It’s not a cure-all, and I’ve got no science-based explanation for it, but I find relief when I use the mat,” he says. Out of curiosity, he took his blood pressure before and after sessions (he even did control tests, before and after resting without the mat) and, he says, “My blood pressure trends lower after using it.” As someone with diabetes and high blood pressure, this has been a valuable bonus benefit for him – not that he would recommend it or claim it would necessarily work for anyone else. “In no way is this anything but anecdotal,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe spikes on the mat’s discs are supposed to stimulate acupressure points on the body.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianBut many other people report that acupressure mats work for them, as many posters to theIsItBullshit subredditattest. One says that it makes them “relaxed AF” and their sleep metrics improve after using it. Another, a contractor, says he uses it three times a week if his back and neck are stiff, writing: “It’s a magic wand at times.” Another user says that they often end up falling asleep on their mat. Most acknowledge that there’s little but anecdotal evidence about the benefits, and aren’t interested in the ancient philosophy behind the practice of acupressure – they say it just works for them.Sahar Hooti, an acupuncturist and author of The Pocket Guide to Perimenopause, has never used an acupressure mat, but she says that the sheer number of tiny spikes on the mats mean that some of them will inevitably end up touching on an acupuncture – which is also an acupressure – point. Indian Ayurvedic medicine focuses on similar (though not identical) points to traditional Chinese medicine, the type of acupuncture and acupressure that Hooti practices, and the most widely used in the UK. “Acupuncture points are strategically placed on our nerve pathways, so [the mat] is stimulating these points, but also other points that are in between – just stimulating the surface of the skin for relaxation, like giving yourself a massage.”View image in fullscreen‘The mat and pillow are covered in plastic discs with 4mm-deep spikes around the outside’ … Amy Fleming.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThree thousand years ago, she says, fish bones were used as the first Chinese acupuncture needles. “Then they became stones, etc. Every culture has its own way of acupuncture. It’s like when you have a massage, the hands of the therapist are stimulating all of the nerve endings in your back. The ‘nails’ on the mats are just another road to that healing, but with added extra strategic, pinpointed benefit – pun intended – when it hits an actual acupuncture point, which is a nerve ending that sends a particular message to your brain to carry out a specific function.” In Chinese acupuncture, she says, the points on the back are “beneficial for direct organ rejuvenation, and so I use a lot of [these] when people have a lot of systemic issues”.The spikes look like an ouch waiting to happen yet, on initial impact, I am almost disappointed by how little it hurtsI’ve heard that lying on the mat hurts at first and then you relax into it, a bit like a cold plunge. So I borrow a friend’s mat and neck pillow to try. Both are covered in plastic discs with 4mm-deep spikes around the outside, and shallower 3mm ones on the inside. They look like an ouch waiting to happen, yet, on initial impact, as I recline, I am almost disappointed by how little it hurts. Relaxing on to it is a damn sight easier than plunging into freezing water. There’s a slight prickle, followed by warmth and a continued mild prickle. The small of my back naturally curves away from the floor or mat, so when I raise or hug my legs, forcing my back to flatten, the intensity heightens and I feel a stronger sense of tension and release. I’ll admit that it does feel as if I’m doing more than merely lying down and relaxing on a mattress, which is illustrated by the angrily red, deeply dimpled skin I have afterwards, and the lingering itchy, stingy sensation. But it’s hard to tell whether or not it’s more beneficial.Some claim that the discomfort the mats induce also stimulates the release of endorphins, although this too remains unproven. It will certainly, says Hooti, create an injury response: “The brain thinks, ‘Oh my God, something’s happening. Let’s rush blood to the area, to heal whatever’s going on.’ Temporarily, I would say that’s a really good thing. It rejuvenates you.” She advises using the mats for no more than five minutes at a time. “Imagine prolonging that injury response in your brain. I would be very cautious, because if you’re pregnant, for example, it could be stimulating points that shouldn’t be stimulated.”View image in fullscreen‘There isn’t much empirical evidence for the benefits of lying on spiky mats’ … Amy experimented with an acupressure pillow and mat combo.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianHumans are often tempted to indulge in too much of a good thing, on the basis that, if it’s doing us good, the longer we do it, the more good it will do us. Hooti says of the use of acupressure mats that, in her professional opinion, “If you don’t have any severe health conditions, it’s safe, it’s really good short term, but everything in moderation.”Learning to do “selective, strategic acupressure” on yourself – applying pressure on points on your body, such as the webbing between the thumb and forefinger, to relieve stress – would be even more effective, she says. “But my conclusion is: anything is better than nothing. We need stimulation. We’re in a day and age where stagnation occurs, as we call it in Chinese medicine – blood circulation becomes sluggish through excess cortisol, which is the stress response. We’re a nation of wired and tired, right? So I feel that bringing a little blood to the surface doesn’t do us any harm.”There isn’t much empirical evidence for the benefits of lying on spiky mats, butone attempt to measure their effectswas undertaken in 2023 by Benjamin Schöne, associate professor of psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. “It was a student project,” he says, “and we did it basically for fun. I thought it was a good learning opportunity for students, and I was a bit personally invested, because I used one of those mats to relax, falling asleep.”The idea was to test the mats daily for three weeks on perceived stress levels and physiological markers such as heart rate, blood pressure and pain tolerance (the standard endurance measure of putting your hand in cold water). Like Keith’s private experiment, there was a control group who relaxed on a mat without needles.View image in fullscreen‘Angrily red, deeply dimpled skin, and a lingering itchy, stingy sensation’ … indents on Amy’s back after using the mat.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe researchers’ hypothesis was, says Schöne, that “if you lie on needles every day for some time, your pain tolerance should improve, because that goes along with the claims of these mats, that they help neck pain or back pain or whatever. So they facilitate relaxation and the pain really goes away, but maybe also pain tolerance increases generally.” The researchers also checked if participants felt and slept better.Unfortunately, he says, “We found nothing.” By which he means nothing significant enough to warrant funding for further studies for his particular group. Participants’ blood pressure, heart rate and pain threshold and tolerance did not change significantly over the course of the experiment, but subjective stress decreased (as did subjective wellbeing, oddly), and sleep quality and concentration endurance increased. No significant differences were found between the group using acupressure mats and those using regular mats. Both had some positive effects on participants, but the experiment showed that using the acupressure mats was no better than “just lying down, relaxing a bit”, says Schöne.He also notes that while subjective wellbeing actually decreased a little for both groups, he doesn’t think this means that the mats had a negative effect. “We tested students during the term, and at the end of the term, when they are more stressed. So this could be one effect, but it could also be, if I asked you, how is your wellbeing, you start noticing that your wellbeing might not be so good.”The stress reduction was about 7%, and it’s just due to lying down and relaxingThe other limitation he points out is that they only used healthy participants – not people who sought out mats because they were stressed or experiencing chronic pain, so Schöne suggests that further studies working with specific health complaints such as tension pain would be useful. For instance, “if you have high blood pressure, the mats could bring it down. Our study does not exclude that.”And at least the study showed that resting, either with or without an acupressure mat, reduces perceived stress. “The stress reduction was about 7%, which is, I would say, substantial for three weeks, and it’s just due to lying down and relaxing. From a very personal point of view, these mats are an interesting way to facilitate relaxation, to establish an evening ritual, maybe before you go to bed. And I think there should be more research on that. It’s a more complicated topic than you would think.”As a scientist, however, he decided to fade out his own mat use due to the current lack of strong evidence, although, he says, “It did help me a little bit falling asleep during a stressful period.” I can well imagine that, in these always-on times, it may feel easier to submit to rest if there’s a sense that you’re still actively achieving something, participating in a self-improvement activity that challenges and stimulates you. The mats certainly offer a subtle, massage-like sensation – although it feels to me fairly surface level. And, while mercifully I’m not seeking relief from any injury at the moment, I’d rather do a bit of yoga and then lie on my back and drift into rest on a nice, smooth mat.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Nothing compares to the nightmare I saw in Iran’s hospitals when the state started shooting protestersSupported byAbout this contentSun 25 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareBy 8 January, Iran’s anti-regime protests that began in late December had spread across the country with reports of at least 45 people killed by security forces. Over the next three days the regime appears to have instigated abrutal crackdown on protestersthat is now estimated to have led to the deaths of more than 5,000 people.By the time I reached the hospital in Tehran on Thursday (8 January) night, the sound of the city had already changed.Up until a few hours earlier, doctors and patients were still sending me photos on WhatsApp; pellet wounds to the back, the hands, the head. Painful injuries, frightening injuries – but survivable. The kinds of wounds that could be treated, that suggested the violence still had limits. Then, at eight o’clock,everything went dark. Internet, mobile phones, messages, maps – all gone.Minutes later, the gunfire started. From about 8.10pm or 8.20pm, I could hear shots echoing through the streets, along with screaming and the sound of explosions. I was called into the hospital. By the time I arrived, it was immediately clear that we were no longer dealing with the same situation.The patients coming in now were not hit by pellets – they had been shot with live ammunition. War bullets. These were not warning shots. These were bullets designed to pass through the body. Bullets that entered on one side and exited from the other.View image in fullscreenX-ray showing pellets after police shot at demonstrators in Tehran.Photograph: Vahid OnlineI am a surgeon who deals mostly with torso injuries, and that night the operating rooms filled with wounds to the chest, abdomen and pelvis. I did not see arms or legs, others dealt with those, but I saw the injuries that decide whether someone lives or dies within minutes. The injuries where there is no margin for delay, no room for error. Many of the shots had been fired from close range. The damage they caused was severe. In some cases, catastrophic.Very quickly, the hospital became a mass casualty zone. We did not have enough of anything: not enough surgeons, not enough nurses, not enough anaesthesiologists, not enough operating rooms, not enough blood products. Not enough time. Patients kept arriving faster than we could treat them. Stretchers lined up. Operating rooms turned over again and again.In a hospital that would normally perform two emergency surgeries in a night, we carried out about 18 operations between 9pm and 6am. When morning came, some patients from that night were still on the operating table.Once the situation is considered ‘under control’, hospitals receive official letters demanding patient informationThere was no pause. No moment to step back and assess. You moved from one patient to the next, from one operating room to another. I have worked through earthquakes and seen mass casualties after major accidents. I have never experienced anything like this. Even in disasters, you might receive 20 or 30 injured patients over several hours. That night, and the night after, it was hundreds: gunshot wounds; severe trauma. One after another.The exhaustion was total. Physical exhaustion, yes, but more than that, mental. As surgeons, our job is to save lives. That night we were saving people who had been shot by their own government. That contradiction stays with you. You keep operating because you have no choice, because people are still arriving, because stopping is not an option; but part of you is breaking.While in the operating room, I heard weapons that do not belong on city streets. I heard the sound of DShK [Soviet designed] machine guns. Later, I saw them mounted on the backs of pickup trucks moving through the city. I am describing what I heard and what I saw, not what caused specific injuries, but the atmosphere was unmistakable. This was not policing. This was something else.As the night went on, it became impossible to even think about counting the dead. There was no way to collect accurate numbers. The volume of casualties far exceeded the capacity of the hospitals, the staff and the infrastructure.People were afraid to come to the hospital. They knew what happens afterwards. From experience, once the situation is considered “under control”, hospitals receive official letters from security institutions demanding patient information – names, details, injuries. If administrators refuse, they face serious consequences. This system existed long before these protests.View image in fullscreenAn X-ray showing pellets. Later, patients had been shot with live ammunition.Photograph: Vahid OnlineDuring those days, many injured people chose not to come at all. Instead, they called me. My phone rang constantly whenever there was even a brief signal. People spoke in code, terrified the calls were being monitored.The calls were not only about young adult protesters. They were about a 16-year-old child, about a man in his 70s, about people who had simply been in the street. You did not need to be demonstrating to be shot. You only needed to be there.By Friday morning, I was still in the operating room. Some patients from the night before were still undergoing surgery. Later that day, I had to travel to a city in centralIran. The city I drove through looked wounded. Metro stations were burned or shattered, their slanted glass structures destroyed. A route that would normally take less than 10 minutes took nearly two hours.When I arrived in the city, the situation was the same: friends working in hospitals there told me the night had been catastrophic. One colleague said the on-call surgeon could not cope and that several doctors had to operate continuously. In one hospital, 13 abdominal and chest surgeries were performed in a single night.The violence did not resemble policing, it felt like wartime rules applied to civiliansEven private hospitals, where gunshot victims are usually nonexistent, were overwhelmed.I do not have official numbers – no one does yet. But I know the hospital capacity. When a small hospital that normally sees one death in 24 hours receives eight bodies in one night, when medium hospitals receive 20 – people who likely died before reaching the hospital – you understand what is happening. When you know how many hospitals a city has, and what their capacities are, you can estimate.In a city of about 2 million people, I believe more than 1,000 may have been killed in a single night; [across Iran] I would estimate more than 20,000. These are purely estimates, based on my experience and bed capacity, not official statistics.‘In isolation, we’ll never flourish’: What Iranians think about the protests and an end to the Islamic RepublicRead moreIn one street, I saw blood pooled in a gutter, nearly a litre, with a trail stretching several metres along the ground. Someone who loses that much blood does not survive long enough to reach a hospital.As time passed, the violence escalated step by step. On Thursday night, I heard mostly individual shots. On Friday night, I heard automatic fire.View image in fullscreenA still from video shared online on 8 January showing demonstrators chanting ‘death to the dictator’ as they march in the Iranian capital, Tehran.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesThe level of violence did not resemble policing, it felt like wartime rules applied to civilians.Families continued to call. Many were terrified not only of their injuries, but of what would happen if they sought care. The hospital, which should be a place of safety, had become a place of fear.The scale of what happened in those days cannot be fully conveyed: the destruction, the volume of injuries, the silence imposed by communication blackouts, the exhaustion of medical staff. The sense that something fundamental had broken.My words are not enough to describe what happened. But I know this: what took place was far beyond anything the public has been told. And most of it happened in the dark.Based on testimony given to the Guardian’sDeepa Parentand theCenter for Human Rights in IranWhile there have been no formal or official death toll figures, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agencyestimated5,002 have been killed – comprising 4,716 demonstrators, 203 government-affiliated people, 43 children and 40 civilians not taking part in the protests.Explore more on these topicsIranRights and freedomProtestMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Here is why it mustNeal LawsonGood politics is about collaboration and contestation. The NEC’s ruling means the party has turned its back on thatNeal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation CompassSun 25 Jan 2026 09.37 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareThis government has become very adept at U-turns. Apparently it is time to turn again. By deciding toblock Andy Burnham’s candidacyfor the Gorton and Denton byelection, the Labour NEC has turned its back on a different and better form of politics, one that Labour and the country so desperately need. The decision today has implications far beyond personality or faction: instead, it is about how a modern and effective government operates to meet the complex and interrelated challenges our society now faces.Francis Crick once said: “A good scientist values criticism almost higher than friendship.” This is equally relevant to politics. Any progressive party needs agility to navigate an endless onslaught of events beyond its control. What therefore matters most are systems and cultures that allow constant feedback, and different views and voices to be heard. Governing is always a mix of professional expertise, top-down control and open debate and negotiation. It is the latter trait that needs to become predominant for any organisation to survive, let alone thrive, given the complexity, even chaos, of governing today.What has all this got to do with Andy Burnham? Three things. First and most simply, he doesn’t hold exactly the same views on everything asKeir Starmer. Some see this as a threat, as though nothing but a North Korean level of leader-worship is acceptable. But a high-functioning 21st-century organisation sees difference as a strength, in which only through contestation can better government emerge. This kind of healthy political contestation shouldn’t be blocked by the NEC.Second, Burnham doesn’t just have differences of opinion, but rather a viable if small-scale version of government that the Labour leadership could learn from. His mayoralty in Greater Manchester is showing that pluralism works. By emphasising place before party he brings everyone except the national populist right with him. Rarely if ever do the Greater Manchester combined authorities have votes, because everything is consensually agreed. And it works. This openness has allowed Burnham and his team to plan for the long term with a greater level of certainty. Among other things, they have created thefastest growing city regionin the UK. And when, at the end of last year, Burnham made aspeech in Manchestertalking about how this growth can be replicated and scaled across the country, he was introduced by the Liberal Democrat leader of Stockport council.Burnham does not have all the answers to all the problems that face Britain – neither does Starmer – but U-turns may be less frequent and better long-term decisions may be made if they and others worked together. I think Starmer and Burnham want to get to very similar places but have different paths – let them and others work out together how best to achieve that through collaboration and contestation. That’s politics.And third, if Starmer reverses this decision and lets Burnham run, it would signal the biggest and best possible reset forLabour. Thousands of people energised by the ideas around Burnham may stay on as Labour members, and many more could rejoin or join for the first time. A big and energetic byelection can take place in which the forces of progressivism go head to head with the forces of regressivism. The tide of Reform UK could be turned back.It’s Andy Burnham, the man who could be king. Will he, won’t he – are we really still watching this movie? | Marina HydeRead moreBut this moment is much bigger than Burnham, Starmer or even Labour itself. Beyond all this febrile talk inside the party and the media about people’s intentions, ambitions, the supposed rivalries and gamesmanship, this is a moment for Starmer to signal a new way of behaving and doing politics. It is nonsense to suggest that everyone should simplyshut up and be loyal, that no one who aspires to better things for their party or their country should make speeches and write articles and develop their thinking and their networks. Or stand for their party. If we want future leaders, we can’t expect them to say and do nothing to prepare themselves for leadership. This isn’t how all other relationships, families, organisations or companies work, and it shouldn’t be how our political system works. This is a moment for all of us to grow up.Finally, this is a moment for Labour to reestablish the principles of internal pluralism. Every political party needs to protect its borders from those out to wreck it, or those with offensive or extreme views. But outside those cases, healthy debate is the only route to a healthy party. No debate, no alternatives and the absence of nuance mean any organisation will wither and eventually die. Ultimately, the left and the right in Labour need each other.This is not a call for disagreement to end, but for honest, constructive and respectful disagreement to fuel the reset that everyone knows the party, the government and the country need. Just when public cynicism and contempt for politics couldn’t seem to get any worse, this decision makes the world feel a little darker. For our prime minister to look his best, to show who is in charge and signal the change Britain voted for in 2024, he should reverse this decision.Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation CompassExplore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamOpinionLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

A selection will be published next Sunday.Send new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyTrue love is not transactional. If we only “love” on the expectation of being loved back, then it is not love, it is bartering.Love is unconditional. I love you, and that is all and everything. You do not need to do anything. You do not need to reciprocate. You do not even need to know.Violet_FemmeI’d say the unrequited version is easier to deal with than the semi-requited version. If somebody makes it plain that they don’t find you appealing, it’s relatively easy to get over, especially if you avoid situations where they’re likely to be.Much more difficult, going on my younger days, is when they do see something attractive about you, things go on for a month or whatever and then that attraction, as far as they’re concerned, dissipates.PeteTheBeatI suffered as a teenager from unrequited love. I was able to move on by learning to love wisely a person who loved me back. When I did this, it was surprising to find that the objects of my unrequited love turned round and came after me. I was able to see them clearly then, and turn away.Teresa Rodrigues, by emailSomebody – I think it might have been a French surrealist – said “I love you. What has that to do with you?”Who I love is my problem. Nobdy else, not even the object of my affections, is under any obligation to respond, or even care. You can’t always get what you want – I know who sang that – and it’s part of the general proposition that you will have learned from childhood to deal with disappointment, whether it’s a Labubu or world peace that you didn’t get.jno50You can grow attached to an unrequited love object as a response to psychological trauma. It could take many years of therapy and life experience to be able to “see” the deeper patterns that can shape the intense feelings of unrequited love.Debra from Massachusetts, by emailTo get over it, I reduce contact with the person and get on with my life through hobbies, travel or exercise. Eventually time gets me through it all, and I’ll have improved myself for the next individual that actually is interested in me.NeutraHow can we learn from unrequited love?

I think we can learn a lot from it about what we idealise and project on to other people, and what we are missing in ourselves. Usually the object of our love represents things to us that we wish we had, or wish we were, or feel could somehow make us better people.Sometimes people also develop love objects paradoxically to avoid having to actually love someone. If you are yearning for a distant perfect someone, that stops you having messy, real relationships with other people now. It can be a protective mechanism. I think it works well in a way, but it is also ultimately maladaptive. It’s better to get into bed with someone else and have fun with a person you actually can build something with, rather than dreaming of the unobtainable as a way of avoiding stuff.I would also always ask someone in this situation: why do you want to have a relationship with someone who doesn’t want one with you? By definition, that can’t be a good relationship.MiffledKittyAvoidant coping mechanism that has always worked for me: if someone doesn’t love me, I don’t love them, either.

Someone I had unrequited feelings for was completely focused on someone else and while painful it helped to think of it as them pursuing that person rather than rejecting me.Taizy85View image in fullscreen‘Unrequited love is similar to addiction.’Photograph: Posed by models; Alexandr Muşuc/Getty ImagesHope isn’t helpful, hope that somehow, some day your love will be returned. And you can’t try to be friends as despite yourself you’ll probably still love and look for signs it’s returned by the object of your love. Cut them out of your life but with a kindly goodbye, and accept you will grieve the loss. Little by little it will get better as you take determined, conscious steps to forge a life away from them. Include self-care, new activities. A cliche, but be kind to yourself. Don’t look back!SeuteursGet a dog! Preferably a rescue one. Cherish it, engage with it, share your life with it. In return it will love you unconditionally and, when the two of you go for walks, you will almost inevitably find yourself encountering and talking with other dog owners. And, perhaps, if your dog bonds with theirs, you may find yourself in a human-human relationship without realising it is happening.XerxesCorkI’ve been trying for a few years to get over a friend I fell hard for! It went from a budding friendship to me realising I was starting to have feelings, thinking it was mutual and then confessing them to her, only to be rejected in a very painful way.I’ve brought it up with my therapist many times, as well as talking it out with friends. A few things that stuck with me and have really helped me make progress were: I deserve someone who is enthusiastic about me and chooses me, because that’s the only relationship worth having. You shouldn’t have to convince someone.Another thing, I started to think practically about what they’d actually be like as a partner. I realised they’d be a terrible partner – for me, at least. I loved them as a friend but I knew in my gut that they’d break my heart if we ever did end up together.Sometimes you just fall for someone for a multitude of reasons which can’t be easily explained. And there’s a certain type of grief there in letting go of the idea of you two together, accepting the end of a fantasy you build in your head and the reality that it will never happenSara633Unrequited love teaches us that love is a force that is unnameable, uncontrollable, and fundamentally selfless. When we love another, even when that person doesn’t love us back, it reveals our limitless capacity to love another. Even when unrequited love is painful, it is a blessing that shows us the depths of our hearts. We can accept that love is unrequited by loving someone fully, in all of their faults and foibles, and finding a way to understand that person just isn’t meant for you.Yale Coopersmith, New York, by emailView image in fullscreen‘Unrequited love can teach you about the qualities and characteristics that you admire in someone, leading you towards more (available) people to date.’Photograph: Posed by models; Kathrin Ziegler/Getty ImagesAs a queer person with an unlucky track record of falling in love with straight friends, I’ve had to face and overcome this feeling many times. But, what I have learned the most over the years is that though you may not be able to be as close with that person as your heart desires, this predicament can teach you about the qualities and characteristics that you admire in someone, leading you towards more (available) people to date or to explore in yourself.Katy B, by emailYou need to remember that there are other people out there who will recognise you, and your immense worth, fully and completely.

It’s not clear how easy it is for you to remove this person from your orbit; if they are a work colleague, unless you really love your job, it is worth moving. It may be that the unrequited love is boredom in your current role, which you distract yourself from by fantasising about a colleague. If you have them on any social media and can reasonably do so, block them.If you can’t remove them from your orbit, start new hobbies or nurture new social groups. Make sure that you are not doing so in order to meet a new person that you can feel unrequited love for, but so that you can follow your own interests and the object of your affection decreases in importance.Bob500It takes time.

And you know, in the end that is all you really want for someone you love, that they are happy and fulfilled. Even when you yourself are not the cause or reason for that happiness.SimotherSometimes a charming manner to all can be misconstrued as flirting to a lonely or needy person, the love not requited at all. That fantasy of requited loved can become more dangerous for the accused flirt, who may be called a tease or worse, and lead from melancholy to anger to attack due to rejection, when the attention becomes so abnormal or burdensome that a direct approach becomes necessary.What feels like “overwhelming love” for one person may feel like stalking to another. When someone experiences overwhelming “love” for another, who cannot love them back in the manner sought, that person should leave the “object” of their desire alone and move on.

I first fell in love with a girl at school, in 1966. I was hopeless, genuinely bad at it. And the love went on, unfulfilled and unrequited, for 20 years.

Why are her loved ones still waiting for an explanation?Tom FaberSun 25 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareIn commemorations and memorials after her death, the view was unanimous: Heklina had been a bitch. In the world of San Francisco’s drag scene, where she made her name, this wasn’t meant as an insult. Heklina had been a legendary performer whose stage persona was equal parts raunchy and abrasive, slinging insults known as “reads” in fine drag tradition. “Yeah, she was a bitch,” recalls her longtime collaborator Sister Roma, “but she was a bitch in the best possible way.”Seven weeks after Heklina died, a memorial for her closed down San Francisco’s Castro Street, with crowds gathering to watch the event on giant screens. Among comedy routines and performances, the city’s queer community paid homage to Heklina not just as a drag queen, but also a shrewd promoter whose long-running event series Trannyshack created a platform for countless drag artists to cut their teeth, including those who went on to become stars on the hit showRuPaul’sDrag Race: Alaska, BenDeLaCreme and Jinkx Monsoon.Monsoon says it was Heklina who gave her the drag gig that launched her career. She describes Heklina as part of the “old guard of drag”, who are “the queens who made it big before the TV shows began. To be a drag artist who was known within the community,beforeDragRace – it was a special mantle held by only a handful of amazing performers.”I was, like: are you asleep? And I’m shaking her, and eventually I touched her hand and it was coldAlaska tells me it was a Heklina show that she attended on her 22nd birthday that originally inspired her to do drag. “I witnessed drag on stage that was raw and real and told a story. It was lawless and wild. I was hooked.”Heklina was just 55 when she died in London, in circumstances that theMetropolitan policewould label “unexpected”. It was her close friend and collaborator of 27 years, the film-maker and drag performer Peaches Christ, who discovered her body. She wrote on 3 April 2023: “I am shocked and horrified to bring this news to you. I am living in a real-life nightmare so forgive me if I don’t have all the answers right now.”Peaches never expected that, close to three years later, she would still have very few answers to why and how Heklina died. The police investigation was so slow that it provoked demonstrations where queer protesters, drag queens and their alliesmarched outside Scotland Yard, holding photos of Heklina and placards with slogans such as “We deserve justice, not discrimination”. Why was the Met taking so long to provide answers? Peaches began to suspect it might be because drag queens who work in the “seedy” world of queer nightlife, whose sex lives might be unconventional, are not deemed worthy of the same level of care and attention by police as everyone else.When she died, Heklina had been in London to showcase Mommie Queerest, a drag parody of the gloriously trashy 1981 Joan Crawford biopic Mommie Dearest, which she had been performing with Peaches for more than two decades. The pair were staying in a flat on Soho Square while rehearsing for their shows at the nearby Soho theatre.On a day off between rehearsals, Heklina wanted to arrange a hook-up. She liked to dress in drag and meet men who identified as “straight” for sex, a habit she often talked about on stage. Peaches didn’t want to be around for that, so they agreed that she would go and stay in a nearby hotel. They stayed in touch via text, then, on the morning of Monday 3 April, Peaches returned to the apartment to pick up Heklina for rehearsals.View image in fullscreenPoster for Mommie Queerest, in which Heklina was to star as Christina and Peaches Christ as Joan Crawford.Photograph: Soho TheatreWhen Peaches went to put her key in the front door, she found it was already open. The inside of the apartment was a mess: Heklina’s makeup was out on the table, her bedroom door was open. Peaches assumed that Heklina must have gone out to get coffees and forgotten to lock the door. She tidied the flat and prepared their lunches for the day before going into the darkened living room to draw the curtains. That’s when she found Heklina’s body.“I found her on the floor, in drag, in a very unusual position,” she recalls. “It looked like yoga – she was on her knees with her face on the ground and both hands on either side of her head.” At first she thought it must be some kind of prank. “And then it’s, like: are you asleep? And I’m shaking her, and eventually I touched her hand and it was cold.” The memory of Heklina’s face still haunts Peaches today. “It’s the image I see at night when I lay down in bed to sleep. It’s the thing I think about when I wake up in the morning.”The police were called to the flatat 9.47am, where Heklina was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead. The drugs GHB and methamphetamine were found in her body at levels that could be fatal.Peaches was first treated as a potential suspect, but following interviews and a review of CCTV footage she was cleared and, as a close friend to Heklina, provided with a family liaison officer by the Met. At first the police seemed kind and helpful, promising to keep Peaches updated alongside Nancy French, another close friend who was designated next of kin.While the fact that Heklina was meeting men for anonymous hook-ups, combined with the drugs found at the scene, probably indicated an accidental overdose during chemsex – a term used in the gay community for sex while consuming specific drugs – a cause of death has still not been confirmed, and an inquest has yet to take place. And when, almost two years after her death, police shared a previously unseen CCTV video showing three men walking away from Heklina’s flat, it only raised more questions. The men remain unidentified, andHeklina’s loved ones are still waiting for answers.Heklina was born Steven Grygelko in 1967 near Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father, of Native American and Polish heritage, had been stationed with the US Navy in Iceland, where he met Grygelko’s mother at a local dance. The two got married against the Icelandic grandparents’ wishes, and moved to America to start a family. They had a daughter, and then they had Steven.He would later describe his childhood as unhappy. His parents divorced. Both struggled with alcoholism. He recalled once attending a family dinner where he realised that he was the only member of his immediate family who had never been to prison.Through his childhood, Grygelko moved around a lot. First to upstate New York and then Iceland for a few years in his teens with his mother, before she started finding him too difficult and sent him to live with his father back in the US. It wasn’t long before he left his father’s home, which hewould describe as“repressively heterosexual”.At 18 years old, he joined the navy to escape from home, but was kicked out for failing a drug test while stationed in San Diego. By 20 he was in rehab back in Iceland, where he lived for another four years. “There was a lot of chaos in my childhood and teen years,” he said in a2022 episodeof the LGBTQ+ history podcast You Make Me Real. “I was able to kind of rise above all that. And I really credit the gay thing for that, because I just knew there was a more fabulous life waiting in the big city.”For decades, San Francisco has been a city where misfits from all over the world flock to find their tribe. “For many of us it’s the American version of Oz,” says Peaches. “If you’re weird, queer or an outsider, it’s been a place to run away to to reinvent yourself.” Grygelko moved there in 1991 and instantly felt at home.His first time on stage in drag was at the Miss Uranus pageant in 1992. He had to come up with a name, and spontaneously devised Heklina, derived from the Icelandic volcano Hekla. While he didn’t win the pageant, he began to hungrily explore the city’s drag scene.By 1996, Heklina was working at a gay bar called The Stud in the city’s South of Market district, where she was offered the opportunity to put on an event in the traditionally slow Tuesday night slot. Trannyshack was born, a weekly party where drag shows began at midnight. In the early days, the stage was made from wooden planks stacked on top of beer crates, which were liable to collapse during particularly energetic performances. Back then, drag was still underground. Nobody expected it to lead to a career, much less celebrity.View image in fullscreenHeklina (centre) with Peaches Christ (left) and Putanesca (right), at The Stud in San Francisco, where her party, Trannyshack, was held.Photograph: San Francisco Chronicle/GettyOne of the distinctive features of San Francisco’s drag scene that Heklina championed is the idea that everyone is welcome to perform. You didn’t have to be a man dressed as a woman; you could be a bearded queen, a drag king, trans or a cisgender woman who might be excluded from conventional drag spaces. One example of the latter was Scissor Sisters’ Ana Matronic, who performed at Trannyshack almost every week over three years. “Heklina’s policy was very open,” she recalls. “As long as you were a good performer, you had a place on the stage.” The band’s 2004 song Filthy/Gorgeous is inspired by this period and Heklina appears briefly in its music video.While there were a few old-school drag shows around the city, Trannyshack was more transgressive. “It wasn’t your standard boa and sequins style of drag,” says Matronic. “It was new drag, alternative drag, inspired more by John Waters than old Hollywood.” Following in the footsteps of New York’s Club Kid scene and earlier San Francisco parties such as Klubstitute, Heklina helped expand the envelope of drag – it was more about art, experimentation and provocation than female impersonation.There were lip-syncs and DJ sets at Trannyshack, but that was just the start. “Numbers would involve blood and vomit and faeces,” says Sister Roma. “You never knew what you were going to get. It was wild, and if you went there, you had to be prepared for that.”“San Francisco drag at that time had no rules,” Alaska, a former winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, recalls. “I love Drag Race and it has changed my life, but it has always existed within certain parameters and strict guidelines. Trannyshack was anti-rules. It was representative of the truth of our community in a way that something on television could never be, still to this day. And I think that’s why the community loved it and needed it so much.”The shows provided an important outlet for the queer community, who were facing the devastation of the Aids epidemic. In the early 1990s, Heklina would check the obituary pages of the local newspaper each week to see who had died. “It was a very surreal time of intense grief,” she later recalled, “and everybody was dealing with it and walking through this constant sea of death.”Trannyshack rose from these ashes. “People had just stopped dying of Aids because new medications came out,” Heklina said in 2008. “It felt like a celebration after all that mourning … I’d planned to go to some people’s funerals and there they were on stage with me.”View image in fullscreenHeklina (second from left) in the drag production of The Golden Girls in 2021.Photograph: GoochHeklina herself had been living with HIV for many years. In early Trannyshack performances, the presence of blood and horror-filled imagery echoed the community’s recent experiences. Heklina’s friends remember her wicked sense of humour, her gravelly laugh and her ability to make light of even the darkest situations. With an enormous boxy wig and her famous beauty spot, she had a commanding stage presence and impeccable comic timing, able to volley a brutal comeback but also to get humour out of being very, very stupid.In a clipof her drag version of The Golden Girls TV show, which became an annual tradition in San Francisco, she milks the simple word “no” into a virtuosic comic sequence that goes on for over a minute and a half, to such hysterical effect that her co-stars can’t help but break character and laugh.Trannyshack continued to grow, running weekly for 12 years, spawning a popular pageant competition and satellite editions in Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, London, New Orleans and Honolulu. Celebrities turned up, including Sofia Coppola, Gwen Stefani and Pink. Lady Gaga did a performance there just before she became famous, and then stayed to dance all night.By 2015, however, the name Trannyshack had become controversial among younger members of the community, due to the term being increasingly viewed as a slur word. Heklina accepted that culture evolves and words change their meanings. Her new regular show would be called Mother. And mother was what Heklina was to many younger queens –perhaps an intimidating one, but still a supportive figure who gave a lot of aspiring drag performers their first break. “There’s a Heklina archetype in many drag communities,” says Peaches, “the cold, calculated businesswoman who’s running the gig. The Mama Rose who’s in the trenches and building this amazing stage for you but is also going to hold you to a standard.”While she was known for her frosty persona, after her death many friends commented on Heklina’s generosity. She helped one pay their rent, hired another when they were struggling for cash, and supported performers struggling with substance abuse. Heklina herself battled with substance addiction throughout her adult life. “She did not want to be known for being kind,” says Peaches. “Behind the scenes she helped many people out, but would never publicise it.”View image in fullscreenHeklina gets ready for a drag show at Oasis nightclub in San Francisco, 2020.Photograph: Santiago Mejia/Polaris/eyevineIn 2014, Heklina opened a theatre and nightclub called Oasis with three business partners, intending to create a space run by drag queens, for drag queens. “It was refreshing to see someone who actually does drag in charge of the business end of things, rather than some guy who had never put a wig on in his life,” says Alaska. The club was a success, but by 2020 Heklina was tired of managing a venue. She started a podcast, toured a one-woman show (Heklina’s Grand Opening), and in 2020 moved out of San Francisco to a house she had bought near Palm Springs, in southern California, a few doors down from her friend Nancy. They planned to grow old there together.For a while after Heklina’s death, friends and family were busy dealing with her estate and organising memorial events. After a few months, Peaches and Nancy realised that London’s Metropolitan police had gone silent. Emails to officers went unanswered for months. This information vacuum allowed conspiracy theories to take hold – some people believed Peaches and Nancy were hiding the truth, while others told Peaches they felt sure it was a covered-up murder.It was only when Peaches put this theory to the Met that they finally responded, leading to a call with an officer in February 2024. According to a lawyer’s notes from the meeting, the officer emphatically denied a cover-up but did apologise for how the investigation had been handled. He said the main investigator on the case had been replaced, implying their failure to properly handle this matter may have been the result of “conscious or unconscious bias”.Just a year earlier, theBaroness Casey Review, a report commissioned after the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by police officer Wayne Couzens, had raised urgent questions about bias in the police. The 363-page report, published in March 2023, determined the Met was institutionally racist, sexist and homophobic. In the LGBTQ+ section, the text chronicles homophobia experienced by queer officers within the Met, as well as reporting a 20% fall in LGBTQ+ Londoners’ trust in the Met between 2015 and 2016 and 2021 and 2022, compared with a 12% fall among the non-LGBTQ+ community.Homophobia within an institution such as the Met is not just exhibited in active acts of hatred, but also in the assumptions officers make during investigations. Between 2014 and 2015, the serial killerStephen Port murdered four young menby administering fatal doses of the drug GHB and dumping their bodies near his flat in Barking, east London. A series of fundamental failings in the Met’s investigation were judged by an inquest jury to have potentially contributed to three of those deaths, as a more thorough investigation could have caught Port before he killed again. The families of the victims accused the Met of homophobic bias in its dealing with the case.I think that police see that tableau and go: OK, case closed, it’s not really worth looking intoWhen asked about improvements they had made following the Casey Review, a Met spokesperson said: “We understand more work needs to be done for us to build trust with the LGBT+ community in London,” but pointed to the implementation of full-time LGBT+ community liaison officers across all boroughs of London, who act as a single point of contact for LGBT+ people and organisations.Kai O’Doherty, director of policy and research for Galop, an LGBT+ anti-abuse charity, was critical, noting the Casey Review recommended “a complete overhaul” of the Met, “yet we have seen no meaningful action from the Met to address its institutional anti-LGBT+ prejudice. In order for LGBT+ victims and survivors of abuse to have meaningful access to safety and justice, a comprehensive strategy to combat homophobia and transphobia in the Met is urgently needed.”How might homophobic bias have affected the Met’s dealing with Heklina’s death? In the assumptions made by officers when they came upon a drag queen who has died following a drug-fuelled sexual encounter, “I think that police see that tableau and go: OK, case closed, it’s not really worth looking into. That’s just what you get if you’re that kind of gay,” says the London-based Canadian drag queen Crystal, who attended the Scotland Yard protest.View image in fullscreenPeaches Christ (in silver) leads a 2025 protest in Westminster …View image in fullscreen… and outside New Scotland Yard …View image in fullscreen… where Ana Matronic of Scissor Sisters spoke. Photographs: Zuma Press/Alamy & ShutterstockBias might also explain why the investigation was deprioritised, taking so long and leaving Heklina’s loved ones in the dark. “If that had been a young white girl found dead in an Airbnb with men coming and going, regardless of what drugs were in her system and regardless of whether she liked to have hook-ups, I guarantee you that investigation would have gone forward at full pelt. That’s homophobia manifest,” says Cheddar Gorgeous, another drag queen who was at the London protest.Despite promising to be more communicative, after the apologetic call the Met went dark once more. There followed a series of bungling moves that annoyed Peaches, such as the police failing to access Heklina’s phone, which might contain valuable information about who she met on the night of her death, then accidentally sending it to California, and subsequently needing to get it back. Then in January 2025, the policereleased CCTV footageshowing three men who had been in Heklina’s flat on the night she died, with a public call for information. Peaches pointed out that the chances of anybody recognising these men would have significantly diminished over nearly two years.“I’m still livid that it took almost two years and me going to the press and blasting the police for there to be any movement,” says Peaches.View image in fullscreenSteven Grygelko AKA Heklina (left) and Joshua Grannell AKA Peaches Christ in 2017.Photograph: Courtesy of Joshua GrannellPeaches organised two protests in London and San Francisco on 31 March 2025 to raise awareness of Heklina’s case, apply pressure on the police, and to draw attention to the LGBTQ+ community’s unfair treatment by police more broadly. In a statement afterwards, DCI Christina Jessah, who leads policing in the local area, said, “We know that many feel deep distress following Steven’s death and some feel frustration with the pace of the police investigation. We are also aware of the concerns of Steven’s next of kin and have apologised to them directly.”She added that a review of the Heklina investigation was under way to establish any missed opportunities. The police have now assigned a new investigator – the fifth on this case so far. “The detectives and the people they’ve assigned to us now are lovely,” says Peaches. “They’re doing damage control and they’re very effective at it. They’re gentle, they’re communicating. But, for me, the damage has already been done.”While the Met won’t comment on an active investigation, based on off-the-record conversations with people familiar with the case, it seems likely that they will conclude that Heklina’s death was caused by an accidental overdose after the three men left her apartment, and that there was no evidence of foul play. If this is the conclusion, wonders Peaches, why did it take so long to get answers? “Why not just say earlier she overdosed on drugs, no foul play, and be done with it? We would have thought it was sad and awful, but it never would have escalated into all this.”In the absence of closure, what would justice for Heklina mean? For Peaches, it would be “shining a light on the Met police’s longstanding institutional homophobia”, a cause in which she never expected to become entangled. She asks, “Can we move the dial so that the police feel pressure to do better with future cases involving people from our community?”Today in California, Heklina’s loved ones are sorting through what she left behind.An articlein the San Francisco Chronicle details Nancy ’s process of distributing Heklina’s wardrobe to the wider drag community. A benefit at Oasis nightclub raised $10,000 to digitise Heklina’s video collection, which contains more than 300 hours of footage from the 1990s and 2000s. Nancy and Peaches are in discussions to make a documentary about Heklina’s life.After her death, Heklina was cremated in London. A cousin on her father’s side followed a Native American tradition by cutting off her own long braid and offering it to be burned alongside the body.At a memorial in Palm Springs, Nancy explained how Heklina’s ashes had been divided in four (“so she’s skinny now”) and distributed among her family and loved ones. She keeps her portion in a chic black clutch, which Heklina had taken with her on the trip to London. It is a fitting resting place for a figure who, in life, always refused to be bound by convention.The way Heklina’s community has banded together in the wake of this tragedy is testament to her influence as a performer and organiser. Beyond her bitchy demeanour, they pay tribute to the genuine love and care she poured into her queer family and her lifelong dedication to pushing forward drag as an art form.“Heklina will be remembered for helping create more drag in the world – drag of all styles and representations and backgrounds and messages,” says Jinkx Monsoon. “She lifted others up in a world where we are used to being pushed down.”Explore more on these topicsDragLGBTQ+ rightsSexualityCrimeMetropolitan policePoliceLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now 26, she says she’s finally making music for herself and happy to wear her heart on her sleeveSun 25 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareMadison Beer may only be 26, but she is something of a veteran in the pop industry. She got her start at 13, after Justin Bieber tweeted a link to a YouTube video of hercovering Etta James’s At Last, and has spent the intervening decade-plus toiling away in mainstream pop, amassing a huge gen Z fanbase in the process – including more than 60 million followers between Instagram and TikTok. It’s an understatement to say that her career has been a slow burn: the day before we speak, it’s announced that her single Bittersweet, released in October, has become her first song to reach the US Hot 100 chart, entering at No 98. When I suggest congratulations are in order, she shrugs off the achievement. “I’m obviously super excited and thankful whenever a song performs well, but I think I’m at the point where I love what I make, and I’m proud of it regardless,” she says amiably, before laughing. “Only took me like,15 years! But it’s cool.”Beer’s attitude is indicative of someone whose career has progressed in fits and starts, a far cry from the kind of meteoric rise that fans and onlookers sometimes expect to see in aspirant pop stars. As she prepares for the release of her third album, Locket, she is in prime position to break through to pop’s upper echelon: Her 2023 album Silence Between Songs featured the sleeper hits Reckless and Home to Another One, the latter a sorely underrated Tame Impala-inspired cut, and in 2024 she released Make You Mine, a Top 50 single in the UK which was nominated for a best dance pop recording Grammy.But those successes, she says, came relatively recently, and she spent many years freeing herself from the idea that things such as charts and awards define an artist. “It was definitely hard for years to detach from that ideology, but I feel so much better off now that that’s not something I drive myself crazy over,” she says. “I don’t want to diss myself here, but I haven’t had No 1s, I haven’t had gigantic songs – actually, that’s not true, I think Ihavehad gigantic songs, but [not] to people’s criteria. I’m like: if I can still sell out a tour and perform for crowds and enjoy it, then clearly I’m OK.”Bullying a 15-year-old is unacceptable, whereas when I was 15, that wasn’t really a conversationBeer was raised in Long Island, New York; after that first burst of publicity via Bieber, her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she was signed as a management client by Scooter Braun, Bieber’s then-longtime manager. The early years of her career followed a time-worn format: she recorded tie-in songs for doll brands; collaborated with more established teen idols such as Cody Simpson; and treaded water until it was time to record an album. Beer started working during a transitional phase for the pop industry, when social media was a powerful force that labels still didn’t really know what to do with. She attracted a lot of hate online, as is common for young female stars, and felt wholly unsupported by the infrastructure around her.“People are so quick to be like: ‘This is what’s wrong with this person,’ and attack someone’s character. The first boyfriend I had [Jack Gilinsky of pop-rap duo Jack & Jack] … I got so much hate from his fanbase and all of these people online. I learned, very early, that people can be quite cruel,” she says matter-of-factly. “I definitely feel protective [of younger stars] and I fear for people. I would hope that people are now like, ‘Bullying a 15-year-old is unacceptable’, whereas when I was 15, that wasn’t really a conversation. I didn’t really feel very protected.”View image in fullscreenBeer here now … Madison on stage in Fort Worth, Texas.Photograph: Omar Vega/Getty/iHeartRadioAt 16, Beer was dropped by Braun and her then-label Island Records; in a recentCosmopolitan interview, she said she felt that Braun and her label “stole years of my childhood that I’ll never get back”. I ask how it’s felt to witness him part ways with clients such as Justin Bieber andAriana Grande, and receive criticism in the press for his acquisition and sale ofTaylor Swift’s masters, but Beer sidesteps the topic. “I feel like I’m just at a point in my life where I’m doing my thing, and I’m focusing on my music and my career. I’ve done a lot of therapy, especially regarding those early years, and I’ve really tried to let go of it all,” she says. “Holding animosity, hatred and negativity towards things like that [doesn’t] do me any good. I’ve completely let go of it, and I don’t care. That’s not my issue, not my circus.”That perspective, and sensitivity to her own emotions, comes to the fore on Locket. The album pairs raw, provocative lyrics with lush, dreamy pop music that sits somewhere between Lana Del Rey and Sabrina Carpenter – the latter of whom is another star who, like Beer, worked for a decade in pop’s trenches before breaking through in her 20s. Beer says she couldn’t have made a record like Locket, which is direct and freewheeling in its approach, without her more introspective sophomore effort. “With Silence Between Songs, I really let people get to know me – that was really what I wanted to get out of that album, whereas with this one, I kind of felt like I didn’t need to go crazy over explaining myself and my story so much,” she says. “I was more so creating music that I loved. It’s a new chapter, it’s a new energy – I’m older, wiser, in a really good place.”View image in fullscreenDress to impress … Beer at last year’s Grammys.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicOn Silence Between Songs, Beer didn’t “care if it [didn’t] do well, because it’s weird – I’m pulling influence from the Beach Boys, from the Beatles, all these different areas of my life”, she recalls. With this album, she wanted things to be a little more “digestible to my fanbase” – and, as such, the sound fits a more traditional mould; it is, for the most part, a plush R&B record studded with throbbing dance-pop tracks such as Yes Baby and Make You Mine. “With this one, it was more so just like, ‘I want to have fun’.”Silence Between Songs was released in 2023, after a few difficult years for Beer, during which she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and attracted widespread criticism online for a variety of fairly trivial snafus, including an incident in which she said she “romanticised” the relationship in Lolita, and another in which she was accused of staging photos of herself at a Black Lives Matter protest (which both she and the photographer deny). In 2023 she also released a memoir titled The Half of It, in which she opened up about her struggles with mental health, the sexualisation she experienced as a teenager and much more. Both projects were made out of a desire for fans and more casual observers to see her as human, rather than just another internet celebrity.“I’ve been online since I was 12, and some people have their minds made up about me – they judge me, which is all OK, I’ve made my peace with that,” she says. “But at the end of the day, I felt with writing a book, at least the people who do want to take the time to get to know me … I [had] to give them an opportunity. I wanted to showcase the truth of things I’ve been through, and show my vulnerability, and hopefully inspire other people. I was at a place where I was like: ‘See me, please, I’m begging you.’ Now that I know the right people have read it and resonated with it, I don’t feel like I need to spend my hours and days sitting online being like: ‘No no, that thing you think about me is not real.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Morgan MaherBeer’s newfound peace with how people perceive her comes through on Locket, whose lyrics can be disarmingly honest in its assessment of totalising, dissociative infatuation. “Some days I barely respond to my own name,” she sings at one point; at another, “I only exist in the moments you’re talking to me.” Beer dated TikToker Nick Austin from 2020 until spring 2025, and is currently dating the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. She says the album chronicles “a pretty up and down, intense relationship” she was in while writing the record. “I feel very deeply, and I get spirally, I guess I could say, and kind of find myself being someone that dwells on things. I’m the kind of person that’s like: if I’m in a fight with my partner, I feel like I literally don’t have a place in the world.”She continues: “There were times where I would shelter how intense I am – I was like: ‘I don’t want people to deem me crazy or obsessive’, but that’s how I am. When I love, I love fucking hard, and that is the truth,” she says. “I definitely have abandonment issues, attachment issues, I know I have these things that I try to work through, but it’s just my nature of feeling things super deeply.”Beer’s ability to freely admit her flaws, she says, comes from all the work she’s done on herself in the past decade. “I’ve done every kind of therapy – I’m talking about everything all the time, and I think I’ve come to a point where I can acknowledge these things about me without feeling shame,” she says. “I acknowledge that I am not perfect, and I have my own issues, and I do shit sometimes that I look back on and I’m like: ‘Why did I do that?’ As long as you can do that and work through it, I think it’s OK.”The downside to writing so openly about a relationship, of course, is that fans will inevitably try to ascribe certain lyrics to certain people, which Beer describes as “a really difficult thing, especially for me”, given how much hate she’s received on social media. “It’s scary for me to release an album like this. It would be pretty easy for me to go online and be like: ‘This is what happened [in my last relationship]’ and I don’t like that. I think that it’s totally inappropriate in regards to people’s privacy,” she says. “I dated this person for a long time, and I don’t want anybody to go and attack them or rip them apart. I don’t wish ill upon literally anybody.”It seems as if Beer will be able to stand by Locket as a piece of music, beyond any commercial success, critical praise or fan reaction. She’s grafted to get to this place, and won’t likely let it go any time soon. “Those things are out of my control,” she says. “To me, the true meaning of success is being able to feel peace and happiness, no matter what.”Locket is out now.

Another called the decision a “huge mistake”, while a third said the leadership was “mad” not to make more of the self-styled “King of the North”.Andrea Egan, head of the huge Unison union, a major Labour funder, said members would be “disappointed and angry”. A series of unions are understood to be in discussions about what they may do jointly to try to change the decision. “This is blatant gerrymandering,” one union source said. “It will not do.”In a brief statement, Burnham said he was “disappointed” by the NEC’s decision, hitting out at “the way the Labour party is being run” under Starmer and raising concerns about the impact of the decision on the byelection. Labour figures across the north-west are concerned that Reform UK could take the seat.Starmer has faced near-constant internal unrest in recent months, with the party trailing in the polls and many MPs spooked by political misjudgements and the prospect of being wiped out by Reform UK at the next election.His allies hope that keeping Burnham away from Westminster will shore up the prime minister’s position and avoid damaging internal conflicts dominating the agenda in the run-up to the May elections. It also prevents a potential leadership coup if those go badly – although Burnham had denied this was his intention – and Starmer still faces threats from elsewhere.But they acknowledge the decision comes at a cost by deepening internal rifts and further eroding party discipline, and that the prime minister could ultimately take the blame if Labour loses the byelection, eroding his position still further.The decision will also cause disquiet among senior Labour figures, with Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, and Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader, having called in recent days for Burnham to be allowed to stand in the seatvacated last weekfor health reasons by the ex-minister Andrew Gwynne.View image in fullscreenThe former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner called for ‘no stitch-ups’ in the process during a speech in Liverpool on Sunday.Photograph: Ryan Jenkinson/Getty ImagesA similar call came fromAngela Rayner. Speaking at a party event on Sunday, shortly before the NEC decision, the former deputy leader said: “I know my friend, the mayor, has put his name forward, and I believe the local members should get the choice, no stitch-ups.”Powell was the only person to support Burnham’s case in the NEC vote, which he lost eight to one. The home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, who praised Burnham earlier on Sunday as “an exceptional politician”, abstained because of her neutral role as NEC chair.The decision would appear to completely stop Burnham’s attempts to return to parliament in the short term, where he would be seen as a major rival to succeed Starmer in the event of a challenge against the prime minister, whose personal poll ratings are disastrous.A Labour statement said that under party rules, sitting mayors or police and crime commissioners must seek permission to stand for parliament. “The NEC has decided not to grantAndy Burnhampermission to stand,” it said.“The NEC believes that causing an unnecessary election for the position of Greater Manchester mayor would have a substantial and disproportionate impact on party campaign resources ahead of the local elections and elections to the Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd in May. Although the party would be confident of retaining the mayoralty, the NEC could not put Labour’s control of Greater Manchester at any risk.View image in fullscreenThe home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, was the only one of 10 NEC members to abstain from the vote.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APSteve Reed, the communities secretary, defended the decision. “Voters don’t like elections that come midterm,” he told the BBC. “People voted in Greater Manchester overwhelmingly for Andy Burnham to be their mayor two years ago, for a four-year term.”But a series of MPs condemned the move, among them Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, who called it “an incredibly disappointing decision”, adding: “The leadership should not feel threatened by having one of the most popular politicians in the country as part of the national team.”Simon Opher, the Stroud MP who is part of Labour’s 2024 intake, called it “petty factionalism” from Starmer’s aides.“The voters of Gorton and Denton are being denied the opportunity to choose a brilliant candidate to represent them in parliament, and this risks gifting the seat to Reform in the run-up to the local elections,” he said. “We desperately need to be better than this.”One source on the party’s soft left said: “No 10 have chosen factionalism over what’s right for the party. They will have to change course, not least once they realise they will lose the byelection without Andy.”Team player or captain? Labour wrestles over Andy Burnham’s ambitionsRead moreThere was no immediate reaction from Burnham. But Mainstream, the left-leaning Labour group associated with the Greater Manchester mayor and other senior figures such as Powell, said: “Labour must reverse this decision if it is serious about putting country before party. We urge the party to reconsider in the interests of taking on Reform and building the strongest possible team in Westminster.”Another Labour source said the NEC meeting, described as “respectful and collegiate”, had heard concerns about the cost of holding a mayoral byelection to replace Burnham two years into his term, and worries about a divisive campaign by Reform UK.Supporters of Starmer had argued that Burnham running for parliament would destabilise the government. “At a time of great geopolitical tensions and in the middle of a cost of living crisis, the country would be aghast if the government turned inwards,” one Starmer ally said.“The chaos and psychodramas of the Tories saw them kicked out of office. The country wants us to get on with governing. We don’t have time for endless speculation.”“Politically, we would be giving up the certainty of a Labour mayor for the next two years,” the Starmer ally said. “We would be confident of winning again, but Reform would massively out-spend us and it would become a nasty, divisive contest. It would mean gambling with communities and people’s lives.”Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamLabourKeir StarmerGreater ManchesterByelectionsAngela RaynerEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

The former president and former first lady said these tactics had now resulted in the fatal shootings of two US citizens – Pretti andRenee Good, both in Minneapolis. Yet, they said, Trump and other administration officials appeared eager to escalate the rhetoric before an investigation had been undertaken – and despite the fact that they “appear to be directly contradicted by video evidence”.The Obamas called on Americans to support the wave of peacefulprotestsin Minneapolis and other parts of the country.View image in fullscreenStill image of a video of the moment when Alex Pretti’s firearm is retrieved from waistband holster by a federal agent as another agent draws his weapon before Pretti was fatally shot.Photograph: Video Obtained By Reuters/Reuters“They are a timely reminder that ultimately it’s up to each of us as citizens to speak out against injustice, protect our basic freedoms and hold our government accountable,” they said.Another former Democratic president,Bill Clinton, followed witha statementthat also condemned the killings of Good and Pretti amid the “horrible scenes” of the immigration crackdown.“All of this is unacceptable and should have been avoided,” Clinton said. “To make matters even worse, at every turn, the people in charge have lied to us, told us not to believe what we’ve seen with our own eyes”.Republican US senator Bill Cassidy said the “credibility” of ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were “at stake”.“There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,”Cassidy wrote in a post on X, after an ICE officer shot Good to death on 7 January and border patrol officers fatally shot Pretti on Saturday. “We can trust the American people with the truth.”Other Democrat lawmakers, including US House member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, also issued calls for federal immigration authorities to leaveMinnesota. They urged Senate Democrats to vote against funding the US Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and border patrol, during budget negotiations in the coming days.“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny,” Ocasio-Cortezposted on X.On Sunday morning, US senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Adam Schiff of California, both Democrats, said they would vote against the impending department of homeland security funding.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in a demonstration on Sunday, a day after Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters“When they’re killing two constituents in my state, and they’re taking two-year-olds out of the arms of their mom, and they are taking an elder Hmong man out of his house and putting him out there in his underwear, and then figuring out they have the wrong man … no, I am not voting for this funding,” Klobuchar told NBC’s Meet the Press, alluding to incidents involving federal immigration agents that have drawn heavy media scrutiny.Schiff said he was “not giving ICE or border patrol another dime, given how this agency, these agencies are operating”.Schumer, the Senate minority leader, first announced on Saturday that he and his fellow Democrats would not provide the necessary votes if DHS funding remains in the measure. A spokesperson for Senate majority leader John Thune said DHS and other government funds will be voted on as a single package. Without a compromise, the government faces a partial shutdown at the end of January.Schiff warned that a government shutdown would result if Republicans “insist” on combining immigration enforcement funding with other government appropriations. “It will be a Republican decision,” he said. “They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”Connecticut US senator Chris Murphy, also a Democrat, told CNN’s State of the Union that Democrats “can’t vote to fund this lawless Department of Homeland Security … that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls all across the country, in violation of the law.”View image in fullscreenPeople gather on Sunday at a makeshift memorial at the site where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Tim Evans/ReutersThe New Jersey governor, Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, told CNN that the confrontations inMinneapoliswas not about sanctuary cities.“This goes far beyond that,” she said. “This is about a basically Stasi-type force of secret police that wear masks, that are unidentifiable, that are unaccountable, that have leadership in theTrump administrationblatantly lying about what’s going on, when the American people can see the video.”Meanwhile, Pretti’s parents, Michael and Susan, called for “the truth” to be told about their son.“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” they said. “The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.”Alex Pretti did not brandish gun, witnesses say in sworn testimonyRead moreThe family’s statement came after US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem made the claim that Pretti brandished a gun before agents fired “defensive shots” at him. None of the ubiquitous video evidence shows Pretti brandishing a gun.Klobuchar also said that the Trump administration had described the shooting, which is shown in several eyewitness videos circulating widely on social media, “in ways that simply aren’t true.“I just keep thinking, your eyes don’t lie,” Klobuchar said. “Law enforcement is based on trust, and we have had a total breakdown of trust.”She called for a “transparent” investigation into the shooting and called for the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agents to leave Minnesota.The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, told Meet the Press that “there’s obviously an investigation that’s ongoing”.“Secretary Noem talked about that yesterday, which is what we would expect anytime a tragedy like this occurs,” Blanche said.But he disagreed with the premise that the videos of the encounter told the whole story. “We don’t know what happened in the minutes leading up to what we just watched. We don’t know what ICE saw, what ICE heard,” Blanche said of Pretti’s killing by federal agents. “That’s part of the investigation that’s going to be happening.View image in fullscreenOfficers from Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA) at the scene on Sunday where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents on Saturday, in Minneapolis.Photograph: Adam Gray/AP“You see a violent interaction with the man who was shot. And so we don’t know. No matter how many times you look at it, no matter how many different angles that we see, there’s a lot that we don’t see.”Blanche re-iterated the government’s position that the anti-immigration enforcement protesters were not peaceful. “They are trying to impede and obstruct ICE, and it makes the job that our men and women have to do virtually impossible to do without interactions like that,” he said.But, alluding to Minnesota governor Tim Walz and his fellow Democrat Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, Blanche added: “Make no mistake about it. This was entirely avoidable if we had a governor, if we had a mayor, if we had leadership in Washington and over in Minnesota that actually cared about their citizens.”FBI supervisor resigns after trying to investigate agent who shot Renee GoodRead moreBorder patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino was asked why federal agents shot and killed Pretti.“You don’t know he was unarmed,” Bovino told CNN’s Dana Bash. “I don’t know he was unarmed. That’s freeze-frame adjudication of a crime scene via a photo. That’s why we have investigators.“The facts are going to come to light as to what exactly happened with an investigation.”When asked by Bash whether he was blaming the victim, he said, “The victims are the border [atrol agents.”During a Sunday afternoon press conference, Bovino was asked about the videos that show Pretti was unarmed before being shot and killed. He said there are, “Many videos out there, many different accounts that you may see that I may see.”“Folks, this is why we have something called an investigation, to take what you’re talking about, to take those videos, to take witness statements, to take, officer statements, all those minute details that will paint a true picture, not a freeze frame concept, and paint a larger picture of what really happened.“That is why we investigate, so we can get to the truth, so there’s not speculation.”He added that they still don’t know how many shots were fired. And he said “all agents that were involved in that scene are working, not in Minneapolis, but in other locations that’s for their safety”.View image in fullscreenA man leads the crowd in the Pledge Of Allegiance at a makeshift memorial for Alex Pretti in south Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Sunday.Photograph: Craig Lassig/EPABovino had pushed that the operation in Minneapolis had really been about targeting Jose Huerta-Chuma, someone they described as an undocumented immigrant who needed to be taken off the streets. He said Huerta-Chuma was in the process of being taken into custody when “agitators, rioters and anarchists” prevented the arrest.But Minnesota’s Department of Corrections (DOC) contradicted Bovino’s characterization of Huerta-Chuma as having a “significant criminal history”. According to DOC records and Minnesota court data, the individual identified by federal officials has never been in the state’s custody and has no felony commitments.DOC records also indicated that someone with Huerta-Chuma’s name was previously held in federal immigration custody in a local Minnesota jail in 2018, during Trump’s first presidency. The decision to release him from federal custody would have been made by Trump administration officials. DOC said it had no information explaining why Huerta-Chuma was released. And Bovino had no explanation when asked by a reporter on Sunday.He instead remarked about Pretti, saying: “When someone makes the choice to come into an active law enforcement scene, interfere, obstruct, delay or assault a law enforcement officer, and they bring a weapon to that, that is a choice that individual made.”View image in fullscreenMakeshift memorial at the site where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal immigration agents, in Minneapolis.Photograph: Tim Evans/ReutersRepublican US senator Lindsey Graham also took the line that “an armed man trying to impede a lawful arrest is a recipe for disaster”. The South Carolina Republican said he expects law enforcement officers to use good judgement “but not to foolishly risk their lives or the lives of others”.“If you go to such events with a loaded gun, bad things can happen,” Graham added, though it is legal in Minnesota to possess guns in public places with a permit. Permit holders who don’t have both the document and a license on them can face a misdemeanor $25 fine.Late Saturday, a federal judge issued an order blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Pretti’s killing, after Minnesota officials sued DHS.The Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, said the suit demanded “a full, impartial, and transparent investigation into [Pretti’s] fatal shooting at the hands of DHS agents [that] is non-negotiable”.Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara, meanwhile, said information about what led up to the shooting was limited. As protests erupted in Minneapolis on Saturday, federal officers impeded state investigators from accessing the scene of Pretti’s killing.Trump responded to Pretti’s shooting with his typical combativeness. The Republican president accused Walz and Frey of “inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous and arrogant rhetoric”.Vice-President JD Vance for his part claimed events in Minneapolis were “engineered chaos” resulting from “far-left agitators, working with local authorities”.ICE and border patrols officials were scheduled to hold a news briefing early Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsMinnesotaBarack ObamaMichelle ObamanewsShareReuse this content"

It has accused the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, of “threatening” the town and other sites around the country with asylum housing plans.Amid a sea of union jacks and Saint George’s flags, those who had journeyed in for the march from another part of Sussex included Lynn Hall, who described herself as an “ordinary concerned mother of two”.“I feel really emotional about this because this was a site that was used by young cadets and now it is they who have been displaced,” she told the Guardian. “People have real concerns here about this and it’s about the unaccompanied young men who will be living here. I’m not hardline, I’m not political and I don’t want to be against anybody but I feel strongly.”Like others in the crowd, Hall was carrying a flag emblazoned with the logo of Advance UK, a hard-right political party set up by the former MEP Ben Habib after splitting from Reform UK and which has drawn support from the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson. Hall was surprised to be told this, adding that she was unaware of the group’s background.View image in fullscreenWhile many local people joined the march,  far-right activists and groups from other parts of England were also in attendance.Photograph: Andrew Hasson/The GuardianEarlier, those who took turns to stand behind a “Crowborough says no” banner during the march on Sunday morning was Callum Barker, a former activist with the far-right Homeland party, who was an organiser of protests outside theBell Hotel in Essexduring the summer.Also present were activists from the Operation Raise the Colours movement, including some who werebanned last weekby French authorities over plans to engage in activities on the French coast.The march snaked its way in from the former military base, past the home of Helen and John Tate, a lawyer, former senior civil servant in the Home Office and deputy parliamentary ombudsman. “As far as the Home Office is concerned we have no say in the matter. The local MP [Nusrat Ghani] has tried to do her best by organising meetings, but it has gone ahead,” he said.But for a bad knee, his wife said, she would have joined the march. “I think it’s a good thing as it really does show the extent of local opposition,” she said, although both she and her husband were concerned that the presence of far-right activists could “aggravate” the situation.About 27 men have been housed at the camp so far. Crowborough is one of two military sites the government announced last year it would use to house asylum seekers, along withCameron Barracks in Invernessin the Scottish Highlands.Those taking part in the march followed behind a banner, preceded by a car blaring techno, bearing a crucifix and emblazoned with rightwing slogans as well as images of three young girls murdered in Southport. The crowd took part in chants of “Keir Starmer is a wanker” and in some cases “Keir Starmer is a traitor”.No arrests had yet taken place on Sunday, according to Sussex police. Ch Supt James Collis said: “We know that the use of the Crowborough training camp for asylum accommodation has caused concern within the community. Our police presence has been increased in Crowborough and the surrounding area to provide a clear point of contact for the public for engagement and reassurance.”Three people werearrested on Saturdayafter disorder outside Crowborough camp. A 36-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman from Crowborough and a 54-year-old man from Newhaven were detained on suspicion of an offence under the Public Order Act.On a visit to Crowborough on Thursday, the home secretaryvowed to defendany legal challenge “vigorously” amid news that the local authority, Wealden district council, was also considering action. Mahmood told broadcasters: “I understand the strength of feeling but I do also believe that getting out of asylum hotels is absolutely crucial for the country.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Forces with slow response times would be sent senior officers from faster forces to advise on improvements, the Home Office said.Police Federation criticises plans for mandatory ‘licence to practise’ for officersRead moreMahmood said in a statement: “People are reporting crimes and then waiting hours or even days for a response. By the time the police arrive, the perpetrators and witnesses are long gone. I will restore neighbourhood policing and scale up patrols in communities to catch criminals and cut crime.”John Hayward-Cripps, the chief executive of Neighbourhood Watch, welcomed the new national standards. “It’s a very basic expectation that police will respond when you report a crime, and quickly when it is serious,” he said. “When that doesn’t happen, it’s not just frustrating, it is very stressful and damages trust.”Police and crime commissioners have warned, however, that some forces will struggle to meet the targets without additional investment.Matthew Scott, the police and crime commissioner for Kent, and Clare Moody, the commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said: “While a rapid police response is desirable, we know that many forces will struggle to meet these targets without significant investment, as they may require additional staff and upgraded control room technology to deliver.”The home secretary has also said she will cut “red tape” and “unnecessary admin” that prevents officers from spending more time on the beat.To fight everyday crime, the government will ramp up its pledge to restore visible policing and patrols in communities through an extension of its neighbourhood policing guarantee.In a white paper entitled: “From local to national: a new model for policing”, Mahmood is expected to outline changes that will include:A reduction in the number of police forces.Local policing areas to deal with everyday crimes such as shoplifting.Home secretaries to be given the power to sack chief constables.An FBI-style National Police Service to lead on terrorism, fraud and organised crime.Every police officer in England and Wales to hold a licence to serve.A fast track for professionals and experts so they can take senior police roles.A new police commander to lead on violent disorder and rioting.A new national forensics team to help catch rapists and murderers.While some senior officers have voiced support for the plans, rank and file officers have questioned whether the changes will make a difference.One Labour MP and former Home Office minister questioned whether the government should be pushing through wholesale reforms rather than concentrating on tackling visible street crimes such as shoplifting and mobile phone thefts. “These may be necessary reforms in the long run but they might not be good politics, given our position in the polls,” the former minister said.Explore more on these topicsPoliceHome OfficeShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

The border was supposed to have opened during the initial phase of Donald Trump’s plan to end the war last October.Israel conditioned the reopening on the return of all living hostages held by Palestinian militant factions in Gaza, as well as a “100% effort” byHamasto locate and return the bodies of all deceased hostages. All have been returned except for the body of Gvili, a police officer.The Israeli military “is currently conducting a focused operation to exhaust all of the intelligence that has been gathered in the effort to locate and return the fallen hostage, Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, of blessed memory,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, adding that once this search operation is “exhausted” Israel will open the Rafah crossing.On Thursday, Ali Shaath, head of a transitional Palestinian committee backed by the US to temporarily administer Gaza, said the Rafah Crossing would open this week. It is effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there.The Gaza side of the crossing has been under Israeli military control since 2024.While Israel has carried out search efforts before for Gvili, more detail than usual was released about this one. Israel’s military said it was searching a cemetery in northern Gaza near the “yellow line”, which marks offIsraeli-controlled parts of the territory.Separately, an Israeli military official said Gvili may have been buried in the Shuja’iya-Daraj Tuffah area, and that rabbis and dental experts were on the ground with specialised search teams. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing an operation still under way.Gvili’s family has urged Netanyahu’s government not to enter the ceasefire’s second phase until his remains are returned.But pressure has been building, and the Trump administrationhas already declared in recent days that the second phase is under way.Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas in a statement Sunday said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili’s remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.Meanwhile, the shuttered headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in East Jerusalem was set ablaze overnight, days afterIsraeli bulldozers demolished parts of the compound.It was not known who started the fire. Israeli settlers were observed at night looting the main building for furniture, said Roland Friedrich, the agency’sWest Bankdirector. He said holes were cut in the fence.Israel’s fire department said it sent teams to prevent the blaze from spreading. In May 2024, Unrwa said it was closing its compound aftersettlers set fires to its fence.Unrwa’s commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, told the Associated Press the incident was the “latest attack on the UN in the ongoing attempt to dismantle the status ofPalestinerefugees”.Unrwa’s mandate is to provide aid and services to 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel, including East Jerusalem.Israel has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and alleging that some of its employees were involved in the 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. Unrwa leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaWest BankMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUnited NationsHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

His flurry of events also kicked off withan interviewin which Burnham breezily recounted how some Labour MPs had contacted him during the summer to ask if he would try to replace Starmer.For all that Burnham has pledged his loyalty to the prime minister, not even his close allies doubted that his decision to formally seek permission to become the candidate in the forthcoming Gorton and Denton byelection was anything but the first stage in a likely challenge.While allies of the prime minister spoke scathingly on Sunday of“Andy Burnham’s ambition”being at the centre of the plan, supporters of the mayor argue that with Starmer’s personal poll ratings dismal, Labour needs to change course if it is to prevent a Nigel Farage-led government.So what next? For all that Burnham will be aggrieved at the swift and comprehensively organised quashing of his plans by No 10, he can settle back into the role of the heir presumptive, the king over the water, the vessel for hope rather than the bearer of prosaic actuality.This also involves not having to actually fight a byelection where, notwithstanding the 13,000-plus majority enjoyed by Andrew Gwynne, the departing MP, Labour nowfaces a political street fightagainst Reform UK, the Greens and possibly a pro-Gaza independent candidate.The news that Zack Polanski, the charismatic Green leader, will not be standing takes away some of the Green threat, but the party is hugely bullish about its chances, and could at the very least dilute Labour’s vote enough to ensure it loses.Burnham can now watch all this from his mayoral office, with allies ready to brief the media, in the event of a Labour loss, how his local popularity would have made the difference.While some of Burnham’s allure to Labour MPs has been a product of his absence from Westminster, as a mayor he has carved out a distinct if occasionally woolly left-leaning ethos, certainly more distinctive than his philosophy as an MP, where he twice unsuccessfully stood for Labour leader, in 2010 and 2015.As set out in a Guardian opinion piece only last week,what Burnham calls “Manchesterism”is a growth-based vision combining government investment and intervention with wholesale devolution, something best exemplified by the region’sBee network, an integrated travel system taking in trains, buses, trams and bike routes.Whether this, combined with Burnham’s low-key, easy-going charisma, would be enough to turn around Labour’s polling nationally is a question to which we do not, for now, have an answer.But with a general election as distant as mid-2029, and Starmer showing few signs of recovery, at some point we may.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerLabourManchesterGreater ManchesteranalysisShareReuse this content"

The White House Stenographer’s Office calculates it has transcribed 2.4 million of Trump’s words, four times the length of Tolstoy’s epic War and Peace.Tracking Trump is not just a problem for exhausted reporters – but also exhausted diplomats, who are tasked with searching for the signal in the ceaseless Trumpian noise.Western diplomats have upgraded their media monitoring operations to take account of Trump’s habit of dropping an explosive policy announcement or launching an unexpected incendiary broadside against an ally at almost any point in the 24/7 news cycle.Foreign ministries now also have to look out for the private texts of their boss reappearing on Truth Social.Trump holds press conferences almost every day, and in his first year posted on Truth Social 6,606 times. Research shows that Thursday midnight, Tuesday 11am, Saturday 5pm and Monday 11pm are the witching hours at which he most frequently issues posts, often leaving western diplomats in a different time zone at a disadvantage.One diplomat said the most frequent refrain most mornings is: “What has he said this time?”On the night of 1 December he posted 156 times, and – as on many nights – he mixed market-moving announcements with personal boasts and conspiracy theories, including the possibility that Joe Biden was executed in 2020 and replaced by robots and clones.Here’s how Europe can file for divorce from Donald Trump | Phillip InmanRead moreFor European diplomats, the late-night posts are often the worst since they may be landing on their phones as they make their way into work.The UK Foreign Office discovered at 6.15am last Tuesday that someone, possibly Nigel Farage, appeared to have got hold of Trump through an intermediary to convince him to denounce the UK Diego Garcia deal, something Downing Street thought had long been put to bed.A diplomat based in the UK said it is also now becoming a specific skill to be able to translate and sift Trump’s often rambling remarks for any hidden policy gems of genuine consequence.He explains: “You can have the speech live on your dinner table at home, and he starts speaking about his childhood of playing at a park next to a mental hospital and his mother telling him he could have been a professional baseball player. You start to switch off – you don’t want to live inside this man’s head – and then you realise you missed something.”Many of these rambling press conferences are pure self-aggrandising junk, but there is always the possibility that he will drop a bombshell that he is, say, planning to send an armada to Iran, or slap 100 % tariffs on Canada.Another diplomat pointed to the opening section of his anniversary press conference last week celebrating his first year in power, in which he spoke for 80 minutes about why America was “the hottest country in the world” before taking questions.Soon after saying Somalia does not even resemble a country and the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar is a crook and he personally cannot stand her, he started showing reporters photographs of alleged criminals picked up by ICE in Minnesota, each with the headline “the worst of the worst”.Then he set off on a monologue that contemplated the photographs before riffing on “a beautiful place in Switzerland where I am sure I am very happily awaited for”, pivoting to Venezuela and opposition leader María Corina Machado’s gift of her Nobel prize and landing on American oil companies’ satisfaction at his approach. “You are not getting bored with this right?” he asked. “I hope not.”Even in this ramble – revealing his deep fear of being boring – there are some clues that he still wants to work with the existing Venezuelan government, but that Machado is not out of the picture, because her Nobel gesture touched him. Flattery still works, the diplomats register.So taxing are these marathons that one diplomat admits that one of the remaining values of X is that you can check whether journalists have spotted something they had missed.Trump’s ‘new normal’ leaves Australia marooned. We can no longer pretend otherwise | Zoe DanielRead moreDame Karen Pierce, Britain’s ambassador to Washington who famously got on well with the Trump crowd, was recently quizzed by another diplomat on the secret of her success.She explained that she decided to try to go on Fox News as much as possible, knowing that Trump watches it. Some embassies now have a diplomat detailed to cover how Fox is reporting geopolitics, since they believe this is probably the single most important source of Trump’s information.The diplomat said: “We believe he does not read, but if there is a Maga commentator on Fox, that will be where he is getting his information.”Some western diplomats even believe the whole week-long row over Trump threatening to impose tariffs on eight European states was purely due to the president being convinced that Europe had sent a reconnaissance mission to start building Greenland’s defences in the face of a US invasion.“If he sees pictures on TV of a C-130 on a runway in Greenland and there is a Maga commentator spouting nonsense, you are in trouble,” one said.But just as he is highly vulnerable to misinformation, so is he a mine of disinformation. While fact-checking was a growth industry in Trump’s first term, now it is accepted that Trump has his own facts. But diplomats cannot dismiss them because they are part of an arsenal to threaten rivals.In a long passage of his speech in Davos, for instance, he claimed the Chinese were selling windmills (as he calls turbines) to Europe, but leave them out of their own energy mix.“They sell them to the stupid people that buy them, but don’t use them themselves,” he said, to a packed audience of business executives that knew he was spouting nonsense. China’s wind and solar generation in 2024 equalled 40% of total electricity generation in April 2025,according to the thinktank Ember.He says this because he has demanded the EU buy $250bn (£180bn) of US oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear technologies every year until 2028.All of that makes the diplomat’s job very much harder. Fortunately for them, the further Trump strays from reality, the more valuable the diplomat, versed in the art of interpretation, may prove to be.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Erm, no. And it’s far from the best use of this hugely genuine, witty personalityLucy ManganSun 25 Jan 2026 14.50 ESTShareMission to Space with Francis Bourgeois is a tricksy little beast. Unlike, it must be made quite clear, its presenter himself. Bourgeois, for those who have not had the absolute pleasure, is a 25-year-old engineering graduate who came to prominence on social media by making TikTok videos about his great passion: trains. The unforced joy on his face when a locomotive goes by (any locomotive, though his favourite classes are the 37 and 158 and his least favourite the 170), and his ease with his geekiness, quickly made him a star.His other love, we are told, is space. The animating feature of this overgenerously apportioned documentary (two parts of 45 minutes each) is the question: can a trainspotter become an astronaut?The answer, too obviously and from the very start of the film, is no. It becomes more and more likely that the makers were labouring under the delusion that to be a passionate geek is synonymous with being a savant. I mean, I get it. I’m an arts grad, too, and anyone who can look at an engine or a sum and make any kind of sense of it seems to me like a god as well. But as Bourgeois meets experts in various aspects of space exploration and we watch him fall flat on his face, sometimes literally, time and time again while he is put through some of the physical paces required of astronauts, the optimistic vibe begins to wear off. Bourgeois begins to look not like the enthusiastic amateur he is (a quality that should be protected at all costs and celebrated for its rarity), but like a young man who has been required by television’s strictures to bite off more than he can chew.He is thrilled (please always mentally insert the word “genuinely” before any adjective describing him) to meet retired European Space Agency astronaut and Army Air Corps majorTim Peake, who went into space in 2015, at the RAF Centre of Aerospace Medicine, to see how well he withstands G-force. Bourgeois tells him he habitually loses vision if he stands up too quickly. You can see Peake deciding that discretion is the better part of valour as he straps his young charge into the centrifuge. Bourgeois duly passes out almost before he turns the ignition. Or whatever you do with a centrifuge. Like I said – arts grad.On we go to the US, thanks to an invitation from commercial space flight company Axiom Space (currently building the space station that will take over from the ISS), where Bourgeois’ combination of innate literalness and dry British humour – impossible to tell where one leaves off and the other begins – leads to many awkward silences. Shown the hatch designed to accommodate a range of rocket passenger sizes, he tells his guide, former Axiom chief strategy officer Matt Ondler, that he is relieved because his head circumference at birth was in the 99th percentile. “Interesting,” Ondler murmurs, after a struggle.At the American College of Hyperbaric Medicine they test his resistance to hypoxia, a condition that occurs when oxygen levels in body tissues are low (a risk to astronauts). It is … negligible. When he is taken on a zero-gravity flight he is violently sick. When his ability to respond to emergencies aboard a space station is tested, he panics and “kills” the pretend patient.And despite Bourgeois’s sanguine nature and wit, the overall effect – especially spread out over 90 minutes when it could easily have worked at half that – is depressing. There is an attempt to broaden the emotional appeal by considering what it is like for astronauts to leave family and friends behind, but this only results in an awkward encounter with a therapist in which Bourgeois talks about his cat and the therapist is clearly wondering what she’s doing there.Things take a turn for the better in the last 15 minutes, when Bourgeois “discovers” space engineering and bonds instantly with the passionate geeks who build the stuff that will go into orbit. They talk of valves and revolutions and pressure (“It’s like you’re singing to me!” Bourgeois tells one delightedly), and you wish someone had had the courage to realise that the astronaut-dream stuff was not working and set him to investigate this instead. An enthusiastic amateur with an engineering degree and a gift for communication would have been great to watch. And there would have been no need for a cringe-makingly lyrical voiceover delivered with exhausting brio by Sir Stephen Fry top-and-tailing the programme, either. I hope we see Bourgeois better used in future.Mission to Space with Francis Bourgeois is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Pål Hansen/The Guardian. Styling: Andie Redman. Grooming: Lucy Halperin. Archive photograph: courtesy of Josh GrobanBorn in Los Angeles in 1981, Josh Groban is a singer-songwriter and actor. His self-titled classical-crossover debut went five-times platinum in 2001, and he has since sold more than 25m albums. As an actor, he has appeared in films such as Crazy Stupid Love and TV shows The Office and The Simpsons. Groban made his Broadway debut in 2016 in Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812 – a role that earned him a Tony award nomination. Groban performs his first UK show in six years at a one-offO2 event in London on 1 April.I went through a lot of phases whenI was five – astronaut, firefighter, and, in this photo, cowboy. The look was inspired by the old country and western films I was watching, a kind of homemade blend of gunslinger and headband-wearing guitarist. And it wasn’t just for the back yard – I wore it everywhere. If I dropped something on the street, my mum would say, “Josh, cowboys don’t litter.” She was great at using whatever character I’d invented to teach me a lesson.Back then I was shy and socially awkward, and I could fly off the handle without knowing why. I didn’t realise I had ADHD, so I was bouncing off the walls one minute and crashing the next. I was creative, but often privately: the kind of precocious show-off who’d put on a magic show with my brother, doing silly card tricks, but if someone asked me to do something heartfelt, I’d freeze. Even now, at 44, I’m still terrified to play new songs for people – the words “Come on, Josh, play us a song!” at a party remain my worst nightmare.My voice didn’t drop until I was 14, and I struggled in lessons unless they were arts classes. I switched schools several times as my parents were trying to find an environment where I could actually absorb anything academic. ADHD wasn’t talked about much then, and teachers didn’t always have the patience for it.Actor and writer Paterson Joseph: ‘Tilda Swinton asked me a question that changed everything that came next’Read moreWhen I was 13, a teacher pulled me outof the back of the choir and gave me my first solo. It was the first time I’d shown anyone what I only did in my bedroom, and the first time I felt genuinely good about myself. Something clicked after that. I was at school with the actor Jason Schwartzman, and we performed a Gershwin song called ’S Wonderful – Jason on drums, me on vocals. My classmates were losing their minds because the kid who usually hid in the corner was suddenly doing a scat solo.Those formative moments transformed what had otherwise been a tumultuous chapter in my childhood. From there I auditioned for musicals, joined the jazz vocal choir and eventually landed at the LA County High School for the Arts. That’s when I realised I could actually do this professionally.I was discovered at 16 by the producer and songwriter David Foster, who had heard about me through a local voice teacher. After listening to a tape of mine, he asked me to stand in for Andrea Bocelli, who was stuck in Germany and couldn’t make rehearsals for the 1999 Grammys. I was naive enough at that age not to grasp how important it was to be singingThe Prayer with Céline Dion, but I was still terrified. Céline was incredibly kind and kept reassuring me I could do it. Dad said I knocked it out of the park – and the next morning I just went back to class, as if nothing had happened.I was about to go to the prestigious performing arts school Carnegie Mellon when David suggested that there might be another pathway for me. Instead of studying, I took a leave of absence and started recording. It was the early 00s – hybrid genres such as rap-rock and pop-rock were dominating the Billboard charts, every male singer had frosted tips, and glossy boybands were huge. Being a traditionally trained musical-theatre baritone was not exactly in fashion, so David, with his 16 Grammy awards, was taking a stab in the dark with me. Once it came out, I fully expected the album to tank and that I’d head back to theatre school. I never looked back.When it came to playing live,Davidwould joke about how the women in the audience were lusting after me. I’d insist, “No, no, they’re so sweet! They’re kind. They’re donating to charity!” Looking back, it was very much a kind of lusty mothering. On the one hand they wanted to pinch my cheeks like I was a sweet boy; on the other, I’d be sitting on the edge of the stage and I’d feel their hands going up my pant leg. Fortunately, none of it got to me because I was completely oblivious.The tension between being a sensitive person and getting famous is still something I talk to my shrink about. Honestly, I was probably healthier when I was a kid in my bedroom and nobody was paying attention. Part of the problem was the material: I was 18, listening to grunge, but singing songs like To Where You Are about love and grief. At 5am, doing TV while jet-lagged in some far‑off country, I felt pressure to inhabit these very adult emotions I couldn’t relate to, while knowing how deeply the songs mattered to the people listening.It took me a while to figure out who I was in adulthood, and for a long time I felt as if I was frozen in time as a 12-year-old. As a result, my 20s were chaotic, and eventually that sensitivity turned into depression. Music became a liability to my mental health. I let the negativity in – the praise, the criticism, the feeling of not belonging. It was like reliving all the insecurities of school, on steroids. There were years of walking on stage with a huge smile and crying on the way home, until I finally went on medication because of how dark things were getting.Luckily, I had great friends, family, and a team who didn’t want me to crash and burn. The music business can be cold and cynical, but my people protected me. I never self-medicated with drugs or alcohol; I never wanted to damage my voice. I always wanted to do well. And now I feel lucky that I can be proud of having kept my head down and pushed through it.In my 30s, I rebelled creatively– I guess it was my middle-finger phase. I got in the studio with Rick Rubin, worked with comedy people I’ve always admired such asTim and Ericand everyone involved inParks and Recreation. Performing on Broadway felt like coming home to my younger self, too – I was surrounded by like-minded weirdos, experimental musicians who can also act and dance; a real Swiss army knife of talents. That experience was a lot like coming full circle – they were all like that kid with the headband and the guitar, a little bit of everything.Now, in my 40s, I feel grateful to embrace the strange, winding path I’ve taken. I’d be hesitant to tell the five-year-old version of me what the finish line looks like, because I don’t think I’d be here without the hard stuff – the sensitivity, the what-ifs, the failures. Sometimes you need to feel as if you don’t fit in to understand where you do. Plus I definitely wouldn’t want to give him a big head. Based on the outfit alone, that kid was one step away from becoming absolutely intolerable. I’m endlessly proud of him for making it through in one piece, but he needed to be taken down a peg.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now plans are afoot for female classes and youth clubsNeha GohilSun 25 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTShareIt’s early afternoon on a gloomy day at the Jamia Usmania mosque inBradfordand a group of mostly elderly men have finished their midday prayers.The assembly of mainly retired men would usually return to the familiar drumbeat of day-to-day life, but instead they make their way downstairs to tackle squats, glute bridges and the butterfly position in the mosque’s weekly 45-minute pilates class.“It’s a very unique thing for older Asian men,” said Zafar Kayani, 69, the pilates instructor. “They’re coming here for their spiritual health. Then getting that physical exercise and mental wellbeing, and they’re connecting with each other.”View image in fullscreen‘They’re connecting with each other,’ says instructor Zafar Kayani (in grey top).Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIt has been a whirlwind few weeks for the organisers of the pilates sessions, which began at three mosques in Bradford with a small number of attenders. A TikTokvideopromoting the class went viral, since amassing almost 2m views, and interest has grown, with up to 30 people attending each session.The TikTok sparked interest from mosques across the UK and farther afield, including from Malaysia and Canada, with inquiries on how similar initiatives could be implemented for their congregation.“We never expected it to go that viral,” said the mosque’s general secretary, Mohammed Ilyas. “It was just a general upload to promote and get more members in. It started from Bradford and if it goes worldwide, we believe it’s a positive thing and we’re making a change.”The class is attended by men of varying abilities, aged between 50 and 80. “They feel comfortable in the environment,” Ilyas said. “They come to pray already at the mosque, and after the prayers they can just join in the class, [in] whatever they’re wearing.”View image in fullscreenThe men can join in the classes in whatever they’re wearing, says the mosque’s general secretary.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe session begins with stretches before moving on to more strenuous exercises. So far the classes have been a success, with people noting improvements in their mental and physical wellbeing.“Before I used to feel ache[s] everywhere, all over [my] body,” said Mohammed Salim, a 66-year-old retired shopkeeper. “But when I started walking and doing exercise, it’s much better. Recently I had the pacemaker fitted, but I don’t feel anything because I do the activity.”Tahir Butt, 74, has had a double-knee replacement, and said the classes had been “very beneficial”. “I wouldn’t think of doing those exercises [before] because of my condition,” said the retired bus driver.Kayani, who runs the sessions, believes the classes will have a positive impact on public health and the NHS. According togovernment health dataon physical activity published in 2024, men from the Asian (59.6%) and “other” (60%) ethnic groups were less likely to be active than the overall average (65.6%).“When they start there will be aches and pains, there will be groans,” said Kayani. “A few weeks along the line, you can see they’re doing [it] with ease.“This is beneficial for the NHS. If there’s less people going to see the doctors, going to the hospital appointments, it’s less cost to them.”Despite the focus on physical exercise, the instructor keeps the sessions lighthearted and jovial, punctuating the 45-minute period with witty comments and humour – and telling people they are “men of steel”.View image in fullscreenA man takes part in the weekly pilates class at the Jamia Usmania mosque.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWhy men should be doing a lot more pilates  | LettersRead moreAt the end of the session, he invites the group to close their eyes, breathe deeply and imagine the bliss of being on holiday in a hot climate, prompting a short period of quiet and calm in the room. “Open your eyes and you’re back in wet Bradford,” he says, triggering laughter.Akhtar Malik, the manager of the Bradford Youth Development Partnership, said the sessions had fostered friendships and helped to tackle loneliness. “That’s the key thing – being happy, laughing – [it] gives you that motivation to keep coming, week in week out,” he said. “We provide a social platform where they can meet other people. It’s a friendship group.”For Ilyas, the success of the pilates sessions has spurred on his mission to transform the mosque into a space not just for prayer but for community activities – with plans for a female pilates class and youth clubs.“As well as a mosque, a community hub where people can join in other activities, which were provided by the council 20 years ago but are nonexistent now – we want to make that happen again,” Ilyas said. “Make it as accessible as possible, not just for the elders, for the young generation as well, make the mosque welcoming.”Explore more on these topicsBradfordPilatesIslamWest YorkshireReligionNorth of EnglandYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The answer is a depressing nope, the film a pained and grating misfire played like Weekend at Bernie’s for MoMA members that’s not funny or smart enough to work as farce or satire.It’s the latest from writer-director Cathy Yan, who was at Sundance in 2018 with Dead Pigs, a colourful, poppy Shanghai-set ensemble comedy drama that was vibrant and commercial enough to get her a DC gig, making the most of Harley Quinn spin-off Birds of Prey. The Gallerist is her inevitable next step, a combination of one for them and one for herself, a star-studded dark comedy that, during her introduction before the Sundance premiere, she jokes she didn’t have to edit in her living room. But it’s a major stumble, limply aiming at low-hanging fruit (isn’t the art world kinda dopey?) and wasting a cast who could and should be having more fun.I’m always a fan of Portman’s big swings, more recently nestled next to her thankless Marvel work, but she can’t seem to find her footing here, playing ambitious and morally disintegrating gallerist Polina, styled like a cross between Miranda Priestly and Andy Warhol. She’s hoping her new exhibition, unveiling during Art Basel’s Miami edition, will nudge her further from snobbish judgment (she’s known to have gained her money via ex-husband and “canned tuna king” Tom, played by Sterling K Brown) and towards the acclaim she desperately hungers for. She’s showcasing the work of relative unknown Stella (Randolph) whose work is maligned by obnoxious art influencer Dalton (Zach Galifianakis) during an early viewing. After a vicious exchange, Dalton accidentally slips on a pool of leaking air conditioner water and impales himself on Stella’s centrepiece. Polina then goes through the natural stages of grief – repulsion, pleasure, fear and finally, after a montage of dead bodies used in art flashes through her head, creativity. What if this was made to look intentional?What follows is a scramble to both attract attention to the piece but draw it away from the truth and Polina recruits assistant Kiki (Jenna Ortega) to help with her scheme. A wacky assortment of characters proceed to enter the gallery as the hype builds, from a fresh-out-of-prison art maven (Zeta-Jones) to a trashy party boy (Daniel Brühl) to Dalton’s suspicious younger girlfriend (Charli xcx).Yan tries to forcefully sweep us up in the unfolding mayhem, energetically swirling her camera around the clinically bright and entirely artificial gallery, and keeping things aggressively paced (like many a Sundance film, it’s around the 90-minute mark) but the film just never clicks into place. What should be wickedly cutting in-the-know dialogue is soft and uninventive, what should be a seat-edge string of escalating circumstances becomes increasingly tiring and hard-to-buy and while the cast is game, they mostly struggle to find the right level for Yan’s admittedly difficult-to-match zany energy. Zeta-Jones is all vamped up with nowhere to go and nothing juicy enough to say while Ortega is clearly trying but feels like she’s often acting without direction. The big disappointment is Portman who just never feels comfortable in her character, unsure of how big she should go in certain scenes and unable to even master her character’s physicality, the whole performance feeling like a strain. It’s not that Portman can’t do comedy (I even found her to be funny in fuck buddy rom-com No Strings Attached) but she’s completely rudderless here.The art industry potshots might be lazy but Yan does give us a glimmer of something more probing and perhaps more personal. There’s commentary on the uneasy wrestle between art and commerce with Stella uncomfortable with producing her own raw piece of art that’s then cheapened by Polina’s tacky antics. Predictably in this attention economy, those very antics suddenly bring in more money and fame for Stella but then her art is no longer her own. I wondered if maybe Yan was referencing her time working with DC, what we can only imagine would be a rough process for many an artist and I wished the film had been more focused on Stella than Polina. A final monologue tries to add weight to a film that’s mostly been feather-light but Stella is a character too underwritten to matter to us, a shame for Randolph who still deserves more since her Holdovers Oscar win.We all deserve more from The Gallerist though, a talented cast put to waste and a director freed from the shackles of superhero cinema not finding her way back to the real world.

A few will probably be beyond rehabilitation and need to stay in for life. Nina had a lot of inside knowledge, pardon the pun. I thought she was anti-prison entirely, but she was very clear: she’s in favour of locking people up when they’re a danger to the public. But her thing was repeat low-level offenders.Dining across the divide: ‘We discussed whether we should increase immigration, and I said no’Read moreNinaI don’t think prisons work; there aren’t enough staff, there’s not enough money, there’s no chance to rehabilitate people. The women are cut off from their families, their children. Their mental health was the main problem, which couldn’t be dealt with in prison, the staff weren’t trained to do it. Ian’s stance was that shoplifters needed punishment, but my argument was that they were coming in as part of a job. They go out to rob, they do 12-week sentences, they don’t have any sort of rehabilitation.IanWhat was interesting, which I didn’t know, is that there are people who do their stretch, go out, do something deliberately, get caught and then come back in, almost like drug mules, packed full of drugs to sell in the prison. That doesn’t serve society or those women.NinaWhere do you get the money from to fix all this? The public don’t care about prisoners, they don’t want to spend their tax money on them. The government will just put a sticking plaster on it and build more prisons. You’ve got the private sector as well, making money out of it – they’re worse than the HMP.View image in fullscreenSharing plateIanI’m no fan ofMaduro. It’s been a brutal regime and he stole the election last year, but Trump’s actions basically mean the international order has gone. Especially if he goes ahead in Greenland as well. The fact is, nobody’s going to stop him, are they? He knows, and we all know, we’re not going to go to war with America over Greenland. It feels like the reason Trump wants to do it is to go down in history as the president who expanded the USA. And that goes with the narcissist he appears to be.NinaI’d just come back from Barbados – it’s quite close to Venezuela, and there were loads of Americans there. It was quite bad vibes – three days when all the flights were cancelled because they didn’t know what to do about the airspace.

History shows where this is goingIn his fresh intoxication with global conquest, Trump is following an established pattern – one that promises disasterPeter BeinartSun 25 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 09.03 ESTShareView image in fullscreenTo many observers, Donald Trump’s open bellicosity – his threats to attack Greenland and Iran, and his recent kidnapping of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro – looks like an ideological reversal. “Donald Trump betrayed his MAGA base today [by] launching a war of choice to bring regime change in Venezuela,”tweetedDemocratic congressman Ro Khanna on 3 January. The day before, former Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greenewrote: “President Trump threatening war and sending in troops to Iran is everything we voted against in ‘24.” On 20 January, National Public Radioreportedthat “Trump supporters share confusion and anger over the president’s focus on Greenland”.The sense of whiplash is understandable. As a candidate, Trump often denounced war. Now he is infatuated with it. But while Trump seems uniquely set on dismantling the postwar order in the service of his quest for global domination, there is precedent for his transformation.Successful wars are intoxicating; they turn doves into hawksPresidencies are not static. They evolve. And over the last half-century ofUS foreign policy, one pattern is clear: the more time passes since America’s last calamitous war, and the more presidents use military force without encountering costly resistance, the more aggressive they become. Successful wars are intoxicating; they turn doves into hawks. It happened in the decades between Vietnam and Iraq. And it is happening to Donald Trump today.The ugly truth of American violence has never been plainerRead moreHistory also shows that hubris of the kind presently emanating from this White House generally ends in disaster.To understand how American presidents move from caution to calamity, it is worth starting with the only president since the second world war whoneversent troops into combat: Jimmy Carter. The reason has everything to do with timing: Carter was the first president inaugurated after Vietnam, the greatest US military defeat of the 20th century. Asked early in his presidency whether he would send troops to repel an alleged invasion of Zaire by communist Angola, Carterreplied: “We have an aversion to military involvement in foreign countries. We are suffering, or benefiting, from the experience that we had in Vietnam.”For all their ideological differences, Carter’s successor, Ronald Reagan, shared that aversion. Reagan’s cold war rhetoric was often fierce, and he lavished money on both the Pentagon and on anti-communist regimes and insurgencies overseas. But he was cautious about directly waging war. Like Trump in his first term, Reagan liked brief attacks that he could use as political theater. In 1983, he invaded the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada. The operation took only a few days, after which Reagan’s administration handed outmore than 8,000 medals, even though the attack involved only slightly more than7,000 US troops. Three years later, Reagan bombed Libya. Reagan in the aftermath of Vietnam was like Trump in the aftermath of Iraq. He liked short, dramatic acts of force against adversaries too weak to put up a fight.View image in fullscreenA US armored personnel carrier patrols the streets of St George’s, Grenada during the Grenada invasion.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveReagan’s successor, George HW Bush, grew bolder. In 1988, a Florida grand jury indicted Panamanian dictator – andlongtime CIA employee– Manuel Noriega on charges of drug trafficking. Reagan had called on him to resign but, fearful of another Vietnam, refused to invade. But after Noriega annulled an election, Bush – who was under pressure to appear tough on drugs – did. Bush’s invasion of Panama involvedmore than three timesas many troops as Reagan’s assault on Grenada. Yet politically, the risk paid off. While the invasion killedhundreds of Panamanian civilians, only23 US servicemembers died, and the US arrested Noriega in less than two weeks. America’s victory in Panama,accordingto Bush’s secretary of state, James Baker III, contributed to “breaking the mindset of the American people about the use of force in the post-Vietnam era”, and thus “established an emotional predicate” for the Gulf war 13 months later.Obviously, past US military success is not the only factor that prompts presidents to wage war. They also respond to events. By invading Kuwait in 1990, and potentially threatening Saudi Arabia, Iraq imperiled what every US president since the second world war has considered a vital US interest: cheap oil. Despite this, Vietnam’s memory still haunted many US politicians. In his speech opposing the Gulf War, senator John Kerryasked: “Are we ready for another generation of amputees, paraplegics, burn victims, and whatever the new desert war term will be for combat fatigue?” Forty-seven senatorsvotedto deny Bush the authorization to use force. But Bush attacked anyway. The US killedas many as 100,000 Iraqis, but lostonly 147 US troopsto enemy fire. Iraq surrendered after a ground war that lasted a mere100 hours. “By God,” Bushexclaimed, “we’ve kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all.”The consequences of that renewed enthusiasm for war were not apparent at first. Bill Clinton had vowed to focus on the economy, and with the Soviet Union gone, America’s leaders struggled to conjure foreign threats. “I’m running out of villains,”bemoanedColin Powell, who served as Bush and then Clinton’s joint chief of staff. “I’m down to Castro and Kim Il-sung.” In the absence of great power adversaries, the Clinton administration launched “humanitarian wars”, which it justified less on security grounds than moral ones. But here too, America’s apparent success made it more aggressive. The United Nations security councilauthorizedthe US-led bombing campaign that helped end Serbia’s ethnic cleansing of Bosnia in 1995. But four years later, when Serbia menaced Kosovo, the US launched an air war without a UN mandate. That created a pretext for George W Bush to ignore the UN when he invaded Iraq two years later – which in turn created a pretext for Trump’s contemporary demolition of the “rules-based order”.View image in fullscreenGeorge W Bush is joined by a bipartisan group of House members in the White House Rose Garden after they met to discuss a resolution on the use of force against Iraq in 2002.Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News/Getty ImagesAfter 11 September 2001, fear, jingoism and rage powered the Bush administration’s decision to invade Iraq. But so did apparent military success. The US and its Afghan allies forced the Taliban from Kabul in just over a month, fueling the George W Bush administration’s confidence that it could topple Saddam Hussein as well. The Iraq war was far more ambitious than the Gulf war, which had aimed merely to expel Saddam from Kuwait, not overthrow him and install a new government. But it was now more than a quarter-century since the fall of Saigon. The “Vietnam syndrome” had been eclipsed by repeated American military victories. Bush’s plan to invade Iraq encountered far less opposition in Washington than his father’s bid to defend Kuwait. The number of Senate Democrats who voted to authorize war jumped from10in 1990 to29in 2002.But in Iraq, America’s string of easy victories ended. Although the US deposed Saddam, it could not quash the insurgency that followed. As the war dragged on, the costs to Americans grew. In April 2004 alone,more than 1,200US troops were wounded and 135 died. For the first time since the aftermath of Vietnam, opposing military intervention became a political asset. In his 2008 presidential run, Barack Obama’s opposition to the Iraq invasion helped him defeat first Hillary Clinton and then John McCain, who had both supported the war.View image in fullscreenCareening toward the brinkFrom this shift in the politics of war, “America first” was born. Trump hadsupportedinvading Iraq. But in 2004, as the public mood turned, he grew more critical. When he ran for president in 2016, he pretended he had opposed the war from the beginning. With this lie, he followed Obama’s political lead – battering first Republican presidential frontrunner Jeb Bush, and then Clinton, for their associations with the war.For Trump, “America first” didn’t imply any legal or moral opposition to foreign invasions. To the contrary, hecriticizedBush for not seizing Iraq’s oil. He denounced regime change and nation building because they allegedly expended American blood and treasure on behalf of non-Americans. Instead, Trump promised short wars in which only foreigners died and the US took no responsibility for what happened once the shooting stopped.Once in office, Trump in his first term resembled Reagan. He promised Americans peace while creating a spectacle of American dominance by killing foreigners who had no capacity to resist. Helifted restrictionsdesigned to limit the number of civilians the US murdered in drone strikes. Hekilleddozens of Afghans when hedroppedAmerica’s largest non-nuclear bomb, which had never before been used in combat, on Islamic State forces. In his final year in office, he assassinated Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the al-Quds force, which directs Iran’s military operations abroad.Unlike his predecessors, Trump does not even pretend that his imperialism serves any purpose nobler than American dominationTrump viewed these attacks as political winners. Hecalledthe Afghanistan bombing “another very, very successful mission”. Like Reagan’s attacks on Grenada and Libya, Trump’s in Afghanistan and Iran sparked no significant resistance, either abroad or at home.And as occurred in the late 1980s and 1990s, this apparent success has fueled greater ambition. In his second term, Trump has become even fonder of using the US military to stage demonstrations of national, and personal, dominance, both overseas and in America’s cities. One former Trump officialcallsit “propaganda through force”. As Al Jazeeranotes, the US in 2025 attacked seven different countries. On Christmas, Trump ordered the bombing of Nigeria, supposedly to defend Christians. He has bombed Somalia more times than George W Bush, Obama and Joe Bidencombined. This summer, he joined Israel in a massive airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities, something his predecessors refused to do. And, as in his first term, Trump has paid no political price because none of his targets have been able to mount a costly response.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump addresses the nation from the White House in Washington DC on 21 June 2025, after the announcement that the US bombed nuclear sites in Iran.Photograph: Carlos Barría/AFP/Getty ImagesThe more Trump exults in America’s capacity to pummel countries and networks that can’t fight back, the more his appetite expands. Although he once made opposing regime change a defining element of “America first”, Trump now embraces it. Last week, heannounced: “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran.” This week, a Wall Street Journal headlineread: The U.S. Is Actively Seeking Regime Change in Cuba by the End of the Year.Trump’s strikes on Venezuela have followed a similar logic: military attacks without significant military or political resistance have fueled greater aggression. Since last fall, he has escalated fromattackingVenezuelan ships to kidnapping the country’s president tosuggestingthat the US may control Venezuela for years anddeclaringhimself the country’s “acting president”.Democrats have become the party of war. Americans are tired of itRead moreNow, in his most reckless gambit yet, Trump is declaring his right to rule over Greenland and nakedly steal territory from a Nato ally. Unlike his predecessors, Trump does not even pretend that his imperialism serves any purpose nobler than American domination. And his vanity and stupidity leave him unable to imagine the costs that his unlawful occupations might entail. He has recentlyimpliedthat controlling Venezuela’s oil could require US troops to guard its refineries, which would leave them vulnerable to insurgent attacks. Although Trump has for now ruled out force against Greenland, and says he wants to assume control of the territory peacefully, Greenlanders mightresista US occupation as well.In response, America’s former Nato allies are starting to create a world order that isolates the US economically, thus punishing the Americans Trump promised to make rich. They are also forging closer ties to China – Canada just announced a “strategic partnership” with Beijing – thus making a mockery of Trump’s claim that his aggression strengthens America’s position in the world.Trump’s approval rating has hit itslowest marksince he returned to the White House, with many Americansconvincedthat he should focus more on the economy and less on overseas adventures. For Trump’s domestic critics, all this makes his turn toward war even more inexplicable. But in the decades between Vietnam and Iraq, America traveled a similar path.Trump is not the first president to grow intoxicated with the fruits of state violence, and to forget that wars do not only empower presidents. They destroy them too.Peter Beinart is a professor at theNewmark School of journalism at the City University of New York, a contributing opinion writer atthe New York Times, an editor at large ofJewish Currentsand writesthe Beinart notebook, a weekly newsletter.

It has ruined my life, to be honest.”Sarah works full-time as a school teacher, but has been forced to take up a second job to pay the spiralling bills from the management company of her building.While she was aware of the annual service charge of around £1,400, she wasn’t prepared for the bills for a reserve fund which have risen steeply as the management company aims to secure an extra £400,000 from residents for a roof replacement and other projects.At one point she was paying £800 a month to cover the service charge and reserve fund contributions, and then, just before Christmas, a notice asking her for almost £14,000 landed on her doorstep.“I just did not expect any of this when I purchased my property,” she said. “I feel like it is the worst decision I’ve ever made – it has ruined me financially. I’m sure there are lots of people feeling the same as me. If the government want people to purchase property, this needs to stop.”Rayner urges Starmer to keep promise on leasehold reformRead moreLeaseholders across England have urged the government to speed up its long-awaited leasehold reform, which has passed into law but much of which has yet to be implemented via secondary legislation. Labour initially promised to abolish leasehold within 100 days of taking office, but dropped this pledge because of the complicated nature of the task.View image in fullscreenLeaseholders across England have urged the government to speed up its long-awaited leasehold reform.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThere are reports ofinfighting in the Cabinet Officeover the exact details of the secondary leasehold reform bill, which was originally due to be published before Christmas but has yet to materialise.The government has promised changes, including making it cheaper to extend leases, requiring greater transparency over service charges and making it easier for leaseholders to take over management, but there are questions over whether the bill willlimit annual ground rent chargesfor existing leaseholders.The residents of Wakefield Court, where Sarah lives, have spent 18 months and £15,000 pursuing a “right to manage” process in order to wrest control of the block from the Freshwater Group, a London-based property management company.Residents are concerned that the latest bill is being rushed through by the company before it loses control of the block. They said issues with the roof had been known, and ignored, for years.The Freshwater Group denied this and said it has been consulting on the work for years. “It has nothing to do with any right to manage. It is about maintaining and preserving the fabric of the building and ensuring it is weathertight, safe and insurable,” a representative said.View image in fullscreenAcross the country, desperate leaseholders report similar problems of soaring service charges.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“They’re trying to milk us for every penny we have,” said Shabbir Mohammed, a leaseholder on the site for more than 20 years. “It’s ruining people’s lives.“We’re paying almost 10% of the value of our property just for this reserve fund. And no one is able to sell. Leasehold reforms were promised by the Labour party. They need to be held to account. This can’t be allowed to go on.”Across the country, desperate leaseholders report similar problems of soaring service charges and poor maintenance, and nowhere to turn for support. In Wanstead, east London, leaseholders at Buxton, Hood and Lister Lodges said they were living in limbo with a bill of about £40,000 per household for major works that had yet to start, more than five years after they were first planned.Liz Withnall said that when she bought her two-bedroom flat in 2020, she was told the cost of the works would be about £4,500 per flat but the bill has since soared, leaving her unable to sell.Is this Labour party for rich investors or hard-working leaseholders?  We must make that clear today | Angela RaynerRead moreHer freeholder is Newham council, which residents allege has neglected the buildings for decades, leaving leaseholders to pick up the bill. “In the course of the five years this has been going on, I’ve had another child,” Withnall said. “So it’s now me, my partner and two children in a two-bed flat and we can’t move. We’re in a very tricky limbo situation where I see it going on for a decade. And the only reason it has got to this point is because of severe neglect for over 40 years.“People have been begging for work to be done on the property for decades and nothing has been done. And we are beyond worried about how we will pay.”Jonathan*, 40, who owns a leasehold flat in Pickering Close, Hackney, has been forced to move out after his ceiling developed large cracks. The management company, FirstPort, has failed to fix the roof, which has resulted in water pouring in when it rains. In a neighbouring flat, the ceiling has collapsed.He is now paying rent and his mortgage, and has just been billed another £3,000 by FirstPort, one of Britain’s biggest property management companies that is on the government’s radar because ofdozens of complaints against it.View image in fullscreenThe collapsed ceiling of a leasehold flat in Pickering Close, Hackney.Photograph: Supplied“Every time it rains I get these spikes of anxiety because I know that someone else’s ceiling has collapsed,” Jonathan said. “It is now dangerous to live there. If leaks are going through electrical fixtures, there could be really severe consequences.“The problem has been reported for years, but there’s still absolutely no sign of anything being done. I use the term sanctioned criminality, and I do believe that’s what it is – and this stuff is going on everywhere all the time.”A spokesperson for Newham council said there had been delays to the work being carried out at Buxton, Hood and Lister Lodges due to environmental issues and a planning complication due to the historical nature of the buildings.“We recognise the frustration some leaseholders have experienced in recent years and have been discussing the scope of the work required, as well as charging and repayment options,” they said. “We are now moving into formal consultation, before procurement to deliver the project. We are sorry for these unavoidable delays.”A spokesperson for FirstPort said fixing the roof at Pickering Close had been delayed due to a disagreement with the first contractor that had been appointed.“Scaffolding is currently being installed, and roof repairs are scheduled to begin in early February, with completion expected within four weeks,” they said. “We have not been advised that any homes are unsafe to occupy. Where interim support has been required, this has been provided, including the replacement of affected insulation.”*Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsHousingLeaseholdPropertyCommunitiesLondonBirminghamnewsShareReuse this content"

It is now up to them to curtail his despotic reignSun 25 Jan 2026 08.27 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 12.49 ESTShareDonald Trump is a monster, and a stupid one at that – as hisfoul slanderof British soldiers who served in Afghanistan shows. His bid to seize loyal ally Denmark’s sovereign territory; his norm-shattering,profoundly ignorant speechin Davos last week; and hiscontemptuous bullyingof UK and EU leaders have definitively demonstrated what an existential, unappeasable, unspeakable menace the 47th US president truly is.All the post-Davos talk is about what the UK, the EU and Nato must do in future to resist and constrain Trump, and how to counter hisattempts to demolishthe global rules-based order. Yet a sense of proportion is required. If his policies and posturing are removed from the equation, it’s clear that the unedifying but familiar postwar world of great power rivalries and de-facto spheres of influence remains largely unchanged. Continuities outnumber ruptures. It’s also clear this crisis is not ultimately one Europe can solve.Trump and Trump alone is the principal, pressing problem. And Trump is a made-in-America monster. It’s up to Americans to un-make him and set things straight – which they surely will, sooner or later.The still-festering Greenland crisis is the latest example – after Venezuela, Gaza and Iran – of Trump’s neo-imperial overreach. If he honestly wanted to boost Arctic security, he only had to ask. Denmark isalready treaty-boundto accept more, bigger US bases. Nato allies and the EU are keen to help. But what Washington’s kraken really wants is to gobble up the entire territory and its resources, regardless of Greenlanders’ wishes.Trump’s excruciatingly undignified, whingeing performance in Davos revealed a man whose egotism knows no limits, whose overweening ambition to boss the world is spinning out of control. This is no exaggeration. How else to understand his new “board of peace” – a $1bn club for dictators, with himself as chair-for-life, that is plainly intended to supplant the UN?Trump’s strong-arm tactics, including the usual tariff threats, caused something close topanic among European leaders. The reaction of the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen was typical. “The shift in the international order is not only seismic, it is permanent,” she warned. The broad consensus – Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, waseloquently apocalyptic– is that the world has changed, for ever and for the worse, and that the only remaining rule is “might makes right”.View image in fullscreenMark Carney speaking at a news conference at the Citadelle, Quebec, 22 January 2026.Photograph: Mathieu Belanger/ReutersThis doomsday lament is exaggerated, lacking in perspective. Historically speaking, the UN-led rules-based order has always been a take-it-or-leave it choice for the great powers of the day. The illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 is a case in point. What made the system work, most of the time, was the rational pursuit of national self-interest. The key difference today is that Trumpbehaves irrationally, imperilling US interests and values and those of its allies.Most Americans now appear to share Europe’s view of Trump as a dangerous embarrassment. On almost every issue, domestic and foreign, hisdisapproval ratingsare hitting new highs. In Davos, Trump regurgitated the lie that he won a “landslide” in 2024. In truth, he edged the election with 1.5% of the popular vote. Out of a registered electorate of 174 million, about 97 million voted for somebody else or not at all. Today, theanti-Trump majorityis vastly larger.What’s to be done? November’s midterm elections may rein him in – although they feel a long way off. Trump’s mishandling of the economy, particularly his tariff wars, is fuelling an“affordability” crisiswhose existence he denies. His violent anti-migrant paramilitary assaults on US cities are producing scenes reminiscent of the 2024 movieCivil War. Trump tramples daily onthe US constitution, the separation of powers, representative democracy and civil liberties.Americans did not vote for this. Nor did US allies such as Britain. Despite its unfailingly polite, patient diplomacy and personal hospitality towards Trump, Keir Starmer’s government has beenrepeatedly betrayedor undercut over Ukraine, big-tech regulation, trade, climate policy, Gaza aid, Palestinian statehood and now the UK record in Afghanistan.It’s easy to understand why western politicians fret. Greenland isfar from settled. Trump and Nato are at breaking point. The struggle for a just peace in Ukraine is at dire risk of being lost. Trump’s “historic” Middle East peace plan fatally ignores the central issue: Palestine’s independence. His personal disdain for sovereign borders, the UN charter and international law encourages fellow autocrats everywhere.As the world finally punches back, was this the week Donald Trump went too far? | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreLast week’s traumas may have been formative. It is now widely agreed that Europe must do much more to defend and promote its own security and values as a front-row geopolitical player. In public, the anti-Trump tone toughened considerably. Appeasers took a back seat as shock and anger turned to defiance. Europepushed back hardagainst Trump’s “coercion”. One diplomat called it a “Rubicon moment”. But there are limits to what it can do.Hope lies in the fact that most Americans agree Trump is a mistake, if not an outright, repulsive aberration. Polls show most remain firmlypro-Europe and pro-Nato. And most surely realise this all-round damaging White House travesty cannot continue unchecked.For the sake of their friends, for the sake of global order, for their own sanity, the US’s silenced majority must now move with speed, determination, unity – and, if required, an unaccustomed degree of constitutional flexibility – to curtail his despotic reign before matters deteriorate further.Citizens of the Republic! Impeach Trump. Declare him unfit. Rise up, rebel and overthrow him as, 250 years ago, George III was overthrown. Do whatever you must to peacefully rid the world of this gaudy, gormless usurper and dethrone this would-be king – but do it fast. Spike his guns. Shut him down. Lock him up. Exorcise the monster.Since 1945, Americans have assumed the role of global freedom’s standard-bearer. Now they must liberate themselves. The US in 2026 requires a second revolution. To escape the nightmare, to rescue democracy, to rebuild the city on the hill, the tyrant must fall.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionNatoUS foreign policyUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

There’s a readjustment required every time – back to tidy silence, to my studiedly casual WhatsApps going unread, to imagining their days by checking their weather. With my caretaking impulses thwarted, I’m anxious and unsettled, forever offering unwanted care parcels and unsolicited advice. “Let them live their lives,” I bleat to myself, while doing everything but.In my defence, I wonder how natural it is to live in a monogenerational pod. My current round of wondering was prompted by reading about the rise of the “stay-at-home hub-son”. This subcategory ofboomerang kidswas first identified last year, after 28-year-old Brendan Liaw described himself as a professional stay-at-home son on the US quiz show Jeopardy!, prompting a rash ofthinkpieces(and understandable eye-rolling in many communities where intergenerational living is commonplace).Much of the hub-son discourse is anecdotal, but it’s rooted in demographic fact, bothin the USand here: ONS data released in July showed34% of 20-34-year-old men lived with their parents in 2024, compared with only 22.1% of women in that age bracket. TheWashington Postrecently talked to some happy homebody sons including Abdullah Abbasi, who makes tongue-in-cheek stay-at-home-sons (SAHS) merch, andLuke Parkhurst, who lives with his mum and is embracingthe SAHS life. “I can look someone in the eyes and say, ‘Hell, yeah, I’m a stay-at-home son,’” he said.Thank goodness, then, for my one stay-at-home child, still needy and cluelessMy sons would rather gnaw off their own arms than stay at home, and while this is, I suppose, a success – they’re independent, that’s considered the end goal of this parenting business – it doesn’t feel like it sometimes. Thank goodness, then, for my one stay-at-home child, still needy and clueless; still filling my heart with the kind of sweaty, stomach-churning love that feels like standing on a cliff edge. My worry for my youngest peaked recently, because if you think watching your kids go out into the world is agonising, try putting one in a straw-filled plastic box in the fridge for six weeks and wondering if they’ll survive.View image in fullscreenFacing winter … a young spur-thighed tortoise.Photograph: Tierfotoagentur/AlamyI speak, of course, of our surprise baby tortoise. Born, unexpectedly, in 2024, this winter was the first in which baby (gender still not established – I may have the rarer stay-at-home daughter) was chunky enough to hibernate: from 50 pence piece at hatching, it is now the size of a generous National Trust scone. The thought ofhibernationwas scary enough, but tortoises have to hibernate fasted, so we had to keep baby awake in the cold, unfed, for days. We moved the tortoise table into the hallway and I’m anthropomorphising, but seeing that small head snap up to look at me when I walked past, with what I read as hope, then wounded, hungry, incomprehension, day after day, was harrowing.It was almost a relief to put baby in the box and close the lid, but even so, it felt unnatural, cruel even, to stick my child in the fridge; definitely worse than leaving their siblings, as freshers, in a grotty hall of residence with some groceries and a duvet in an Ikea bag. How was I supposed to do this? My husband took over.Why am I a vegan? I do it for my mental health | Emma BeddingtonRead moreOccasional checks and weigh-ins meant we knew our precious was still alive over the festive season, but the unboxing last week was still agonising; we placed baby, who is too young for full-length hibernation,under a heat lamp and waited. To our relief, it stumped around a little and took a brief bite of chicory. But then it burrowed into its bedding and tried to go back to sleep. We’ve been going through this process for several days now, offering the seduction of warm baths, grated cuttlefish on its greens and even a bit of banana, but baby’s interest in the awake life remains, at best, lukewarm.It’s worrying, but I get it. Who among us wouldn’t prefer to burrow back into darkness for a few months and shut out the January 2026 world? And, I realise, I’m also, on some level, a little grateful. Keeping a grumpy scone alive despite its best efforts is the perfect distraction from my empty-again nest, and, if I manage it, I get the ultimate reward: a child who can never, ever, leave me.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionPetsAnimalsParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

So what is holding us back?John HarrisIt was life-affirming to meet the residents of Rainbow Way in Minehead. But so much still stands in the way of Labour’s vision for social housingSun 25 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 14.22 ESTShareImet Carole Guscott, a retired former carer, on a clear winter’s morning in the Somerset town of Minehead. She was walking her whippet, Gracie, on the way back to her new flat, past the local Premier Inn and on to a cul de sac called Rainbow Way. “I knew as soon as I saw it,” she told me. “I just thought: ‘I can make this place my home.’”Up until recently, she was living in a private rented place near the centre of town and paying £780 a month in rent. For four years she had known thatRainbow Way was being built. She also knew that its houses and flats were an example of something that is vanishingly rare in post-Thatcher Britain: new council housing, which meant security for the people chosen to be the tenants but also intense competition for places.But she then got a call, and an invitation to come and have a look. “I was stunned,” she said. She instantly decided to move in, paying just over £500 in monthly rent, and delighting in the views of the surrounding hills and townscape. “The flat is just so open and bright,” she told me. “I feel blessed that I’m here.” She also said: “Without a council house, there just isn’t the security.”There are 54 new council homes on Rainbow Way: 33 flats and 21 houses – the first such dwellings to be built in this part of Somerset in 30 years. Aroundhalf the peoplenow living here were recently “homeless, facing harassment, being moved on from supported accommodation or urgently needing two or more bedrooms due to family circumstances”. Of the new tenants, 89% were already resident in Minehead and 11% had “strong local connections”: an important point, because the town is a byword for deprivation andlow social mobility, with an economy centred on seasonal employment – symbolised by its renowned and vast Butlin’s – and a dire level of local housing need.View image in fullscreenSome of the new houses at Rainbow Way.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianAnd so here it all is: gently contemporary architecture, a compact children’s playground and homes designed to be zero carbon. On the morning I visited, a party of councillors and their officers werehaving their photo takenin front of one of the four-storey apartment blocks as they cut a length of ceremonial ribbon. As gulls cawed, a van pulled in, dropping furniture off at one of the new flats. Ushered into the sole flat still awaiting tenants, I flicked through a dossier of instructions and suggestions about how to get the best out of the garden, and local walking routes. There was a tangible sense of calm, wellbeing and lives that have taken a welcome new turn.How did this happen? Somerset has a new unitary council, which has absorbed four district councils that were once responsible for housing. Two of those councils had long since sold their stock to housing associations, but the others had stuck with providing and maintaining homes. Here, then, was an opportunity for the ruling Lib Dem administration to both sustain 10,500 existing council homes and build as many new ones as possible. At the last count, there were11,644 householdson the Somerset waiting list – what can currently be done may only scratch the surface, but that does not make the drive to build any less urgent.As far as national politics is concerned, the warm glow emanating from Minehead triggers a couple of obvious questions. Amid the bitter, resentful public mood and a housing crisis that grips so many parts of the country, why are there not far more Rainbow Ways? And given that the government has talked repeatedly of “the biggest increase insocial and affordable housebuildingin a generation”, how long will we have to wait for some kind of breakthrough moment?Which brings us to Labour’s record so far, and aspects of policy that ministers do not talk about nearly enough. Thanks chiefly to Angela Rayner’s time at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the government hasdrastically restrictedthe right-to-buy scheme that made the economics of council housing almost impossible, limiting discounts, allowing councils tokeep all the receiptsfrom any sales and announcing plans to exclude new properties from the scheme for the next 35 years. In stark contrast to past periods when budgets were squeezed by rents being capped and reduced, they can nowincrease annuallyby up to the rate of inflation plus 1%. And then there is the biggest move of all: £39bnset asidefor affordable housing over 10 years, which will apparentlypay for 180,000 homesfor social rent by 2035, although no one expects the results to even begin to become apparent until the end of the current parliament.The housing charity Shelter gladly acknowledges how significant this is, but also points out that 18,000 new council homes a year is way short of the90,000 annual completionsit says are needed to get a grip on the housing crisis. And there is one other glaring problem: the legacy of a labyrinthine agreement struck between central government and local authorities back in 2012, whichtransferred £13bnof historic housing debt from Whitehall to councils on the basis of guarantees and assumptions – that rents would steadily rise and right-to-buy sales would continue at pre-2012 levels – that did not hold. Somerset now carries £190m of that debt, which it says it can service, though if it were free of that burden it would be able to build much more.View image in fullscreenCarole Guscott in her new home.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianOther local authorities are in much more difficult circumstances. When I got back from Minehead, I had a conversation with Sarah King, the leader of Southwark council, whichaccording to them built 600 new homes in its chunk of London last year but is held back from doing more by its £408m share of the same burden, as well as fire and safety demands that – entirely correctly – arrived in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster (“The commitments put new demands on us without any new money,” she said). Unlike with some other councils, the cost of servicing its housing debt means Southwark can no longer borrow to build. “And this is the depressing bit,” she said. “We have sites with planning permission, but we can’t build on them because of the state of our finances.”Labour faces costs of £50bn to replenish affordable housing after right to buy, report saysRead moreMinisters, she said, understand her predicament, but she and her colleagues – along with the people who run scores of other councils – are still demanding the kind of meaningful action that would begin with central government writing off at least some of that debt on the basis that doing so would open the way to much more housing investment. And asthey campaign, they feel the need to restate some obvious truths. “If you invest in council homes, you save massive amounts on the housing benefit bill,” King told me. “You make savings on people’s health because people are living in homes that are warm, safe and dry. You provide space for children to do their homework.”This, of course, was the source of the lovely, life-affirming feeling I got that morning in Minehead – accompanied by a nagging sense of unfinished policy, time fast running out, and yet another example of one of this country’s most tragic habits: patiently and anxiously waiting, even though we all know what urgently needs to be done.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionSocial housingRenting propertyLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

Work brings dignity and purpose to people’s lives. That’s what makes the AI transformation so consequential.”Business surveys suggest that outside the tech sector, leaders are enthusiastic about the potential of AI, but are not yet feeling the benefits. A PWC poll of UK chief executives, published to coincide with the start of the WEF, for example, showed that 81% were making AI their top investment priority but only 30% had seen any cost reductions as a result.That means in the months ahead, there will be intense pressure to find savings, with the focus likely to be on the wage bill.Chairing a WEF session on “jobless growth”, Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford’s digital economy lab, pointed torecent work he and colleagues did, suggesting workers in the US aged 22-25 are already experiencing AI-related job losses, especially in sectors where AI “automates rather than augments labour”.Brynjolfsson believes that this dichotomy is a crucial one, which gets to the heart of why Musk’s robot dreams have a dystopian edge.Four years ago Brynjolfsson wrotea paper called The Turing Trap. He argued that the Turing test, which posited that the ultimate accolade for a technology was to replicate human intelligence by seeming human, was the wrong goal.Instead, he argues, “as machines become better substitutes for human labour, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, then humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created.”Young will suffer most when AI ‘tsunami’ hits jobs, says head of IMFRead moreBrynjolfsson urges policymakers to use tax incentives and regulation to nudge companies towards developing technologies that enhance humans’ abilities – putting powerful tools in their hands – rather than replacing them completely.That was broadly the picture presented by the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, in an upbeat session about the future of AI, in which he talked up the benefits for the global south, describing a world in which doctors are freed up by tech to spend more time with patients, for example.Nevertheless, he warned that the technology risked losing its “social permission” if it could not be shown to be making people’s lives better, rather than just enriching a small number of powerful tech firms.“We, as a global community, have to get to the point where we’re using this to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries, right? Otherwise I don’t think this makes much sense,” he mused.Certainly, “social permission” for AI to swallow up energy, water and capital may be hard to come by, if the way many people encounter it – aside from in a sea of misogynistic online slop – is as the reason for their career going off the rails.And that’s why trades unionists are rightly calling for an urgent conversation about how the benefits of increased productivity, if indeed they materialise, can be shared with society, not hoarded by the tech bros.As Liz Shuler, president of the US union federation the AFL-CIO put it, “if we can all agree that this is to make our jobs better and safer, easier, more productive, then we’re all in. But if you’re looking to just de-skill, dehumanise, replace workers, put people out on the street with no path forward, then absolutely you’re going to have a revolution.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Viewpoint columnRobotsElon MuskGrok AIMetaEconomic policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

What happens when they start to speak out?Sun 25 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 06.05 ESTShareAchild is born. Before they even landed “Earthside”, in the language of Instagram, a scan of them as a foetus in utero was uploaded to a waiting audience. The room in which they will sleep – the pale pastel paintwork, the carefully curated nursery furniture – is all there, ready, waiting: an advertorial empty of its model. Then comes the photo of the baby being born, held aloft to their audience while still covered in vernix, eyes not yet open, their mother smiling, hair perfect.From now on, their every moment and milestone is documented for the camera and monetised. That first smile, first word, first step, all mediated by a device and sent to an audience of strangers, many of whom have formed a parasocial relationship with that mother, that father, that child. The child comes to know and understand the black mirror that is regularly put in front of them. There will be days when the child happily performs for the camera; others when they push it away, when they don’t want to be filmed. A natural feeling, but one they may well have learned to suppress. Because performing for the camera makes mummy and daddy happy, although they don’t call it performing. They call it authenticity.One day, after years and years of this, that child rebels.That child isn’t Brooklyn Beckham, who was born before the advent of Instagram, so started his life beingmonetised in print instead. But they may as well be. To paraphrase one Mumsnet user, the Beckham family feud could spark a #MeToo moment for the children of celebrities and influencers. The Beckhams walked so that influencers could run – they’ve learned from the best. So inured to this mass monetisation of childhood have large swathes of the public become that many no longer see anything wrong with it. They no longer see the truth, which is that we are in the midst of a giant social experiment, with children as the guinea pigs. Never before in the history of humanity have children seen their right to privacy so violated, and by the adults who are supposed to care for and protect them. And anyone who watches or engages with this kind of mass content is complicit.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn and David Beckham during a charity match, Old Trafford, Manchester, 14 November 2015.Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd/Getty ImagesCall me pious, or jealous, or a luddite if you like, but I know I am not the only one to whom this all just feels so, so wrong. Yesterday I watched a reel of a newborn baby who had been outside their mother’s body for a mere 20 minutes before their face was beamed around the world, and I thought – excuse my language – “this is fucked”. I felt grubby in my spectatorship, mere days after Brooklyn’spublic denunciationof his family system, and the psychological damage that he claims public exposure has caused him. I don’t follow these people, but they still, somehow, appear.Children of 1990s and 2000s celebrity culture – Prince Harrybeing another– are the canaries in the coalmine of this mass experiment. Those damaged boys – now men – have tried to tell us in their own words how difficult it is to construct your own identity when you grow up in the glare of spectacle. For this they are called ungrateful, because in this economy, isn’t fame and fortune the best thing a parent can give a child?Only if you’ve lost touch with what a child needs – food, water, love, attention, interaction, a feeling of safety – can you think this life is preferable to a normal, private childhood. “Brand partnerships” do not appear on Maslow’shierarchy of needsfor a reason. Brand partnerships don’t give a child the freedom they need to be themselves without self-scrutiny, an essential freedom for psychological wellbeing in adulthood. Nor does being constantly photographed and shared.The problem is that so much of it just seems so wholesome. Smiling children in matching pyjamas, blowing out birthday candles, paddling at the beach, dancing. Sometimes, their tears and their tantrums are shared, too (I havewritten aboutthat cruelty before): all the better to share these moments of vulnerability. Soauthentic.Teachable, even.There are of course the shocking cases of neglect and abuse, such as that of theYouTube vlogger Ruby Franke. The vast majority of content creators are not like this. However, uncomfortable though it is to state, any influencer who centres their children in their content operates on the same continuum, and some people – myself included – judge them for it. Not that they, with their hundreds of thousands of followers, probably care about that.When they might start to care, though, is when their own children inevitably speak out. I believe that these parents are heading for a painful reckoning. So, albeit to a lesser extent, are the people consuming it, who have somehow found themselves able to detach from the reality of what they are doing, which is looking at other people’s children on the internet. After all, the children seem happy enough, don’t they?As far as I’m concerned, it’s all very creepy and wrong. It amounts to a deprivation of a child’s freedom to enjoy their childhood unobserved. And look, I’m not perfect: I have written about my child, shared photos of the back of his head. Perhaps your kid’s face is on the internet. Maybe you feel uneasy about that, and about the accounts that you follow. All I ask is that you examine that feeling, listen to it. Maybe consider pressing unfollow, locking your account. This isn’t going away. Brooklyn is only the beginning.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Emulating India’s response might helpSun 25 Jan 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 16.31 ESTShareWhen the centre-left French politicianAurore Lalucqposted a warning last Wednesday that Donald Trump could cut off Europe from international payment systems, the clip wentviral. To many, her message made sense. After all, if Mr Trump waspreparedto test allies’ boundaries over Greenland, it is not far-fetched to imagine Visa and Mastercard becoming used against a recalcitrant Europe.The US can turn off payment systems it controls. Russia learned this first-hand after sanctions were rightly applied for its invasion of Ukraine. As up to 60% of Russian retail transactions depended on Visa and Mastercard for authorisation, the ban left many ordinary people stranded withoutaccessto funds andunableto buy goods. Under Mr Trump, America’sgoalis to “help Europe correct its current trajectory”. Given such talk, Ms Lalucq, who chairs the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, is not wrong incallingfor an “Airbus of European payments” to protect the EU.If the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is serious about the bloc’s “independence”, then during her visit toIndiathis week she might ask New Delhi for advice. Within a decade, India has built a digital public infrastructure designed to reduce reliance on foreign-controlled payment networks and insulate its domestic payments fromexternal pressure or sanctions.India’sUnified Payments Interface(UPI) could be the answer Ms Lalucq is looking for: a state‑backed, universal payment system. The plumbing does not need Visa or Mastercard to be involved. UPI has near‑zero fees. It is not a wallet but a public standard: banks, fintechs and apps compete on top of it. Card networks never took deep root in India. But UPI has meant the country has leapfrogged straight to mobile app “e-cash” – with shoppers using QR codes for everyday payments.The biggest players are US companies –Google Pay and Walmart’s PhonePeaccount for 80% of transactions – but they don’t control UPI. India now processes billions of transactions a month, with instant settlement between shoppers’ bank accounts and merchants’. UPI made digital payments ubiquitous amongpoor households. Meanwhile, credit cards’market sharein India’s digital payments fell to 21% in 2024 from 43% in 2018.Creating a European UPI would not be easy. The EU is institutionally complex. Banks would resist change. Companies such as Stripe already provide cross-border wiring. But this is about state and bloc autonomy. Ms Lalucq’s curtdismissalof Wero – Europe’s bank-led payments wallet – makes sense as it is aprivate sector product, not public infrastructure. India’s experience raisedcivil libertyquestions. It could be argued that Europe has a mature privacy framework to address them.Would-be world powers aren’t waiting. China’s paymentecosystemhas been built to be governed domestically. India shows that this was not a one‑off. Both want to export their models. India’s UPI is built as an open, decentralised public standard. China’s Digital Silk Road, by contrast, locks partners intoBeijing’s technology and authoritarian governance.A European payments system that bolsters the continent’s sovereignty is a good idea. Ms Lalucq ought to be thanked for raising it. For the EU to look to India for answers would also be a practical expression of the call byMark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, for deeper ties betweenmiddle powers. Strategic autonomy may begin not with grand strategy, but with how we shop.Explore more on these topicsMoneyOpinionCredit cardsBankingBanks and building societiesIndiaEuropean UnionEuropeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But a new generation of cinephiles might save it from the streaming giantsSun 25 Jan 2026 12.25 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 16.29 ESTShare“It was from a weekly visit to the cinema that you learned (or tried to learn) how to walk, to smoke, to kiss, to fight, to grieve,” Susan Sontag wrote 30 years ago, in an essay to mark 100 years of film entitledThe Decay of Cinema. For Sontag, the onset of the “ignominious, irreversible decline” of the 20th century’s greatest art form was the arrival of television. Today it is the advent of streaming.Cinema is in a state of existential crisis.Netflix is bidding to take over Warner Bros, as the industry is still recovering from lockdown and the 2023 Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes. Leonardo DiCaprio, whose One Battle After Another received13 Oscar nominationslast week, having failed to break even at the box office,askedif people still have “the appetite” for movies, and if cinemas are in danger of becoming “silos – like jazz bars”. Matt Damon hassuggestedthat films are being dumbed-down to cater for changing watching habits. And the director Mary Sweeneysaidthat her ex-husbandDavid Lynch, who died in January last year, would struggle in Hollywood now because of “the dissipation of our concentration and the way the digital world has permeated people’s lives”.Amid these anxieties over audiences’ dwindling attention spans,Clare Binns, the creative director of Picturehouse Cinemas, and the recipient of this year’s Bafta award for outstanding British contribution to cinema, has called time on a growing trend for ever longer films. At three hours and 35 minutes,The Brutalist(2024) required a 15-minute interval. Avatar: Fire and Ash, now in UK cinemas, is three hours and 17 minutes. Protracted running times are not just painful for audiences but for profits, as cinemas can only have one showing each night. Many independent cinemas across the UK are already struggling, withalmost a third facing closurewithin the next three to five years without investment. As Ms Binns said, it would be a “tragedy” if local cinemas disappeared.But it is not all bad news. According to aBritish Council survey, gen Z finds film and television nearly twice as influential as digital creators in shaping UK culture. AnAmerican trade reportrevealed a 25% increase in cinemagoing among US young people last year, while the UK and Irish box-office revenue in 2025, at £1.07bn, was thehighest since 2019. Ironically, social media is encouraging younger audiences back to the cinema, withviral hits such as Saltburnand the emergence of the thriving film buffs’ platformLetterboxd.As the outrage when the cultPrince Charles cinema in Londonwas threatened with closure showed, cinemas are much more than places to watch movies. Whether it is an art-house theatre or sprawling multiplex, once the lights go off, cinemas are magical places. Netflix and chill will never have the same romance as a night at the movies.“Give cinema some respect,” Martin Scorsesesaidin defence of his Killers of the Flower Moon (2023), which has a runtime of three hours and 26 minutes. If we sit at home bingeing on algorithm‑driven content while scrolling our phones, we risk being rewarded with a diet of ultra-processed films, full of sugary rushes, empty scenes and endless exposition. We must all get off our sofas.“If cinema can be resurrected, it will only be through the birth of a new kind of cine-love,” Sontag wrote at the end of her essay. On this she was right. A new generation of cinephiles might save cinema from the streaming giants.Explore more on these topicsFilmOpinionOscarsBaftasNetflixAwards and prizeseditorialsShareReuse this content"

They might say they suffered us, but the camaraderie was real. (I remember one deployment in Qatar, during which the Americans had T-shirts that read “Operation: Enduring Freedom”, while the British, not to be outdone, had some T-shirts made to read “Operation: Enduring Americans”. We all got a kick out of that.)Donald Trump disparaged your armed forces, and this is simply wrong. And he craves controversy, so prepare for more of the same. Please know that our armed forces and our general population do not share this view. We in the US Navy take a great measure of pride in the customs and traditions that were passed down to us from the Royal Navy. Most of us still remember 2024, when the US stood with the other free nations against the oppressive regimes that are now being courted by JD Vance and Trump.I remember standing in front of the statue of George Washington during a visit to the National Gallery in London and thinking of how very young our nation is, how far we have come – and how far we have yet to progress.My heart aches when I think of these things, and I know that I am not alone in this sentiment. I will always remember the bravery and sacrifice of all the RN/RAF personnel I served alongside during Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom, and I’ll do what I can to help sort things out over here.Wish us luck, and keep the home fires burning. Fair winds and following seas.Christopher JamesSenior chief petty officer, US Navy (retired), Virginia Beach, Virginia, USAt first I laughed aloud at President Trump’s childishly petulant missive to the prime minister of Norway, suggesting that his failure to receive the Nobel peace prize somehow helped justify the unlawful seizure of a close European ally’s territory and the erosion of trust that has long sustained Nato as a central pillar of collective defence for democratic governments, including the United States (Donald Trump links Greenland threats to Nobel snub as EU trade war looms, 19 January).But the laughter caught in my throat. I thought of my father, a second world war veteran who died recently and would have turned 100 next week, and of my Scottish grandfather, who fought alongside French and American forces in the first world war. My father had hoped to visit the graves of buddies at Normandy before he died, though he knew it was too late. As he spoke, tears filled the eyes of a man who was ordinarily clear-eyed and even-tempered, and a lifelong Republican to boot (with exceptions for Roosevelt, Nixon and our current leader). He turned to me and asked, as if addressing the country itself: “What’s become of our nation if one man can so easily tear apart what we fought for?”Scott AtranBoca Raton, Florida, USPresident Donald Trump’s recent remarks about UK soldiers who served in Afghanistan were not merely clumsy; they were deeply insulting to those who carried the burden of that conflict and to the families who continue to live with its consequences. If the president truly wishes to “walk back” his words (Trump praises UK troops after remarks about Nato soldiers in Afghanistan, 24 January), the only meaningful way to show genuine contrition is to come to the National Memorial Arboretum. Standing among the names of the fallen would confront him with the reality of the sacrifice he so casually dismissed. Our service personnel and their families deserve respect that goes beyond political backtracking. An apology delivered on that ground, in front of those whose lives were changed for ever, would be the first credible step toward repairing the damage caused by his comments.Richard EltringhamLeicesterExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNatoUS militaryMilitaryAfghanistanlettersShareReuse this content"

These threats to NHS staff safety are experienced both physically – in wards, departments and GP practices across the country – and virtually, as staff are filmed and photographed without their consent, and humiliated or abused on social media.The data on the sharp and continuing increase in violence and abuse rightly creates headlines. Beneath it are complex lives and rapid shifts in societal and behavioural norms. This complexity means that there is no neat solution to the growing problem of violence and abuse towardsNHSstaff.The patient with dementia who hits and kicks the healthcare assistant who is trying to provide them with personal care will not be deterred by police intervention or exclusion. These patients may be better supported, and violence averted, with care environments and routines designed for them, and through a national mandatory training framework on de-escalation skills for NHS staff.There is certainly a place for consistent enforcement intervention. Operation Cavell – a partnership between healthcare, local police services and the Crown Prosecution Service to prevent and reduce assaults against emergency workers – should be rolled out nationally. The NHS should develop a national exclusion framework for patients with mental capacity who abuse or assault staff.The Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 should be strengthened to include online abuse and racist abuse. The NHS is here for all and it must be safe for all – patients and staff alike.Kate JarmanMilton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation TrustRecent suggestions that the NHS sexual safety charter has failed underline a long-standing problem: many NHS staff do not feel safe reporting sexual misconduct within their own NHS trust (Charter to tackle sexual harassment across NHS in England has failed, say unions, 18 January).Research by the Working Party on Sexual Misconduct in Surgery (WPSMS), culminating in theBreaking the Silencereport, found that staff are reluctant to report incidents when perpetrators hold positions of power or when confidence in local processes is low.The charter signals good intentions and sets expectations, but it cannot drive cultural change unless credible reporting mechanisms are implemented – systems that staff can trust, that provide consistency across NHS trusts, and that collect reliable data. Seventy-six percent of NHS trusts have introduced trust-level anonymous reporting, according toNHS England.Yet individuals affected by sexual misconduct consistently tell us that fear of reprisal remains a significant barrier to reporting, particularly when reporting processes are controlled locally. Without a trusted reporting mechanism, sexual misconduct remains underreported, harmful behaviour goes unchecked, and organisations are unable to recognise or address the scale of the problem.If the NHS is serious about tackling sexual misconduct, establishing a national, independent, anonymous reporting mechanism must be an urgent priority – something the Royal College of Surgeons of England and WPSMS have repeatedly called for. Without it, the real extent of sexual misconduct in NHS trusts will continue to sit below the radar, and any efforts to create a safer workplace will inevitably fall short.Prof Vivien LeesSenior vice-president,Royal College of Surgeons of EnglandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We are rapidly moving into times where the risks of such scenarios are high. Without food for its population, the UK would face economic and political breakdown and anarchy.You mention the urgent need to accumulate national stocks of food supplies, probably mostly imported, but say nothing about the UK’s own capacity to produce its own food supply from the agricultural and horticultural industries. In a lengthy period of worldwide food shortage, this would be the only way of avoiding food shortages.Following the food shortages of the second world war, we did reach a level of78% self-sufficiencyin 1984, but this has gradually fallen to 62%. This level of home production is about to decline rapidly as the demand for land from a range of other more lucrative uses continues to grow. House- and road-building, the use of agricultural land for woodland and other carbon-saving purposes, solar farms, the creation of new wildlife habitats, recreational use and the general unprofitability of farming will see our self-sufficiency fall again over the next decade. The government’s own land use framework predicts a10% reductionin farmland by 2050, but this is likely far short of reality.These alternative uses of land are all beneficial and desirable, but are they ultimately more important than feeding the population? Most other countries do not think so.Richard HarveyOwston, LeicestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

My own book, Poems NOT on the Underground, published in 1996, sought to address this anomaly.Thus, with apologies toPhilip Larkin: “They fuck you up, the Northern Line trains / They may not mean to, but they do / They say they’re coming though Camden / Whereas you know they’re stuck at Waterloo.” It ends: “Governments hand on misery to man / It deepens like the Northern Line itself / Get off the trains as early as you can / And don’t commute at all if you want your health.”Roger TagholmLondonHomer (the epic poet, not Bart’s dad) was on to our poor attention span way before the Netflix top brass (Matt Damon is right: phones + Netflix means we are now in the pub bore age of cinema, 19 January).The Odyssey is oral poetry.Homercouldn’t count on his audience keeping in their heads who was who or why one god had a beef with another. That’s why Telemachus is invariably described as “sensible” (even when his actions are otherwise), Penelope is frequently called “wise” and the sea, we constantly reminded, is “wine-dark”.If director Christopher Nolan does hold up his fight sequences to fill us in on the plot of the forthcoming multiplex blockbuster, he will have the ancient bard on his side.John KeenanBrightonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

United scored with outstanding strikes from distance by Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha in the second half to stun the leaders.Arteta’s team of ruthless cyborgs malfunction in way that is all too human | Jonathan WilsonRead more“The first half an hour we’re very dominant,” Arteta said, “playing the areas that we wanted, scored a goal, had two fantastic chances to score another one. And after that, we gave them the goal.”Zubimendi’s mistake was not the only Arsenal error, perhaps a result of the successive goalless draws in the previous Premier League games ramping up a sense of anxiety.“The first error leads to the second one,” Arteta said. “There were three or four, which is very unusual today – but they are part of football and today we got punished. In the end, we have to show the mental strength we have on matchdays.”Arteta resisted the temptation to complain about two possible handballs – the ball may have brushed Dorgu’s hand before he lashed in the goal that put United 2-1 up, although replays were not conclusive, while a shot hit Harry Maguire’s hand which was presumably deemed not to be an offence because it was breaking his fall.Cunha’s stunner earns Manchester United thrilling late win at ArsenalRead moreArteta said: “With the changes, we managed to shift the energy, scored the second goal, and you could feel that everything changed and the game was there to go and win it. In the next action, Noni [Madueke] is one v one in the six-yard box. We don’t get anything out of that. It goes to a goal-kick … one pass, win the duel, and Cunha puts it in the perfect angle to lose all the momentum, all the good energy that we were building up and to go and win the game for them.”The Arsenal manager also refused to be critical of fans who gave the home side a smattering of boos at half-time. “We have to do more, and when we do that we can rest in peace.”Michael Carrick, who has overseen impressive wins against the top two in his first two matches in interim charge of United, praised the game intelligence of his players. “We understood the flow of the game,” he said. “At times we were going to be a little bit up against it and digging in. You’ve got to take a bit of control and calm things down a bit.

It’s frustrating. Our crossing was poor.”Howe employs so many analysts these days that there is a suspicion Newcastle have become a little too formulaic, a bit overly data driven.Here the off-the-cuff brilliance of Rogers and Buendía in particular made the difference on a day when consistently intelligent defending from Ezri Konsa and company, not to mention some excellent goalkeeping on Emiliano Martínez’s part, also proved pivotal.View image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez saves a header from Newcastle’s Lewis Miley.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAGranted, Newcastle might have taken an early lead had Martínez, making his 200thPremier Leagueappearance, not done extremely well to deny Sandro Tonali with an outstretched foot. Nick Pope, though, was soon performing similar wonders to divert a Watkins shot away for a corner after Jadon Sancho’s fine through pass.Pope, though, had no answer to Buendía’s swerving, dipping and thoroughly stunning opening goal dispatched from just outside the area after a lovely team move featuring, inevitably, a pivotal contribution from Rogers.Villa had conceded 12 goals on their previous three visits to St James’ Park alone and were without a win here since 2005 but, as they played through Newcastle almost at will in the first half, this felt different. “My players were extraordinary,” Emery said. “The individual and collective discipline was so high.”Although Martínez was again required to excel when saving Lewis Miley’s header following Anthony Gordon’s cross, a home midfield lacking the injured Bruno Guimarães struggled to help subdue Rogers’s disorientating change of pace and sheer invention in possession.This was only the 11th top‑tier game Guimarães had missed since arriving from Lyon four years ago and, ominously for Howe, Newcastle have won none of them. “Bruno was a big miss for us,” the home manager said. “He’s the focal point for a lot of our buildups; we missed his ability to pass forwards.”There is a chance the Brazilian’s injured ankle will have healed in time for the trip to Paris but that was of little consolation here – particularly on a day when Joelinton needed to temper his aggression after collecting an early yellow card and Tonali, although influential, did not have things all his own way against the similarly smart Youri Tielemans.It all dictated that the invitations presented by Emery’s sometimes riskily high defensive line were not being accepted by Yoane Wissa and friends.When Joelinton succumbed to a groin injury early in the second half, he was replaced by a Villa old boy, Jacob Ramsey. “It was a big blow to lose Joelinton,” Howe said. “We hope it’s not too serious.”At least Ramsey played quite well, his arrival coinciding with a mini home resurgence. Were Villa starting to feel the effects of their flight back from Istanbul in the early hours of Friday morning after aEuropa League win at Fenerbahce? Was the absence of the key midfielders John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara with knee injuries hurting them as much as feared?Perhaps and possibly, but Pope still needed to prove equal to a curling, counterattacking shot from Rogers and Howe felt it necessary to replace the underwhelming Wissa and Gordon with Nick Woltemade and Anthony Elanga.Not that it ultimately changed much. Watkins’s pace and movement had troubled Newcastle all game and, shortly after forcing Pope into a stellar save, he scored Villa’s second.View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa grabs the ball in delight after Ollie Watkins’ late goal for Aston Villa.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersHitherto, the principal visiting threat had been menacing long‑range shots but Villa’s second goal derived from a set piece. Or more specifically, Newcastle’s failure to clear a corner. The ball eventually dropped to Lucas Digne and his half‑volley across the box was met by Watkins’s diving header, prompting wild celebrations.“I am so, so happy,” Emery said. “My players were fantastic.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Manchester United were far superior in the second half with a clinical display as Elisabeth Terland, Jess Park, and Hanna Lundkvist – on her debut – all got on the scoresheet to claim the three points.Strikes from Verena Hanshaw and Shekiera Martinez helpedWest Hampick up a much needed second victory of the season with a 2-1 win againstLeicesterwhich stopped them from slipping to bottom spot.Rita Guarino also saw her team win for the first time since taking over in December and goals from Hanshaw and Martinez kept West Ham a point clear of safety despite a late own goal from Eva Nystrom which set up a grandstand finish.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked about his side’s sizeable advantage over the defending champions, Jeglertz remained level‑headed as usual, as he replied: “Of course I am very happy to be nine points ahead of Chelsea but, on the other hand, there are nine games left to play, you know the ball can bounce in different directions. There are no easy games in the league.“I’m not worried about the players [getting ahead of themselves]. We always talk about ‘take the next game, take the next game’. That’s the only way.”This was by no means an easy win. Nonetheless, Jeglertz’s team could have opened the scoring through Shaw when she was picked out at the back post by Kerolin’s hooked cross, but she appeared to lose her footing and knocked an effort wide from close range, in a first half the visitors dominated.View image in fullscreenKerolin scores Manchester City’s first goal.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAKerolin then raced on to a through ball and rolled it home superbly to make it 1-0, but Eder Maestre’s side struck back valiantly in the second half and played the majority of the second period deep in City’s defensive third.The hosts’ gradual pressure was rewarded when Freya Godfrey lashed in a rising strike in front of the home supporters, from a difficult angle, and anyone who thought Manchester City were going to canter to the finish line in May was having a rethink.The home side were watched from the stands by their owner, Michele Kang, as well as the former Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas and her Barcelona teammate Patri Guijarro, who were attending as guests of friends and teammates. They watched the WSL newcomers go close when Kosovare Asllani fired over earlier in the second period, as they improved markedly after the break.Shaw, the WSL’s top scorer, nearly won it after being fed by Vivianne Miedema, but she lashed over. The Jamaican’s moment was still to come, however, and the away side celebrated the victory in a manner that made it clear they knew how important her late strike could be.View image in fullscreenFreya Godfrey celebrates scoring London City Lionesses’ equaliser.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“It was a relief, almost. It was a tough game,” Jeglertz said. “We had control partly of the game but they were lethal in the transitions and, after they scored for 1-1, the game was very open. That says something about the league, also, that there are no easy points. If we are not on our absolute top level, teams will challenge us, and London City were doing that.“Even though the game was not the most beautiful game, we have players that can finish off the game. The players were just focusing on ‘How can we score?’ and making sure we got the three points.“In the end, there is something in this group, that ‘finding a way to win’ is crucial, and [our] winning mentality is great. I believe so much in the players and how we are playing. If we keep on doing that, this season will end in a good way.”It was Maestre’s first defeat since taking over during the WSL winter break but he was pleased with the improvements he feels his side are making, as he said: “We started a little scared. It’s not easy facing the first team in the league but, as the match moved forward, we were getting confident that we were able to get something more. I am very proud of the team.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLondon City LionessesManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Rangers moved to within four points of Hearts after the league leaders missed the chance to put considerable distance between themselves and Celtic.A three-horse race for the titleshould enthral.A contender must land a con­vincing blow to dethrone a champion but despite equalising twice, facing 10 men for the final 21 minutes and creating several clearcut openings, Hearts were unable to overcome Martin O’Neill’s tiring team.Celticimpressed sporadically but made their flashes of quality count through Benjamin Nygren’s free-kick and the incisive break that created a second for Yang Hyun-jun.Pressure firmly on Celtic in Scottish title race finally worthy of the nameRead moreThe visitors’ vulnerability at set pieces was punished by Stuart ­Findlay and Cláudio Braga. Blair ­Spittal, on as a substitute, almost won it for Derek ­McInnes’s team in the 97th minute, 20 minutes after Auston Trusty had been sent off, but his ­rising drive kissed the top of the Celtic crossbar.“It’s not the worst point when you come from behind twice but I still feel there was something more out there for us,” theHeartsmanager said. “The fact there’s a disappointed dressing room in there illustrates how far we’ve come.”Quick GuideRöhl talks up 'statement' Rangers win in title raceShowDanny Röhl, the Rangers manager, felt \"great\" following the \"statement\" 3-0 win against Dundee which narrowed the gap on Hearts, the Scottish Premiership leaders, to four points.James Tavernier, the Rangers captain, scored from the spot early in the second half before the substitutes Danilo and Djeidi Gassama added further goals in stoppage time for an eighth successive win in all competitions.Hearts' 2-2 draw with Celtic at Tynecastle meant that Rangers leapfrogged their Glasgow rivals to sit behind the Jambos as the title race heats up.Röhl said: \"Yeah, it feels great, but hopefully the feeling will be better and better during the second half of the season because there is still a long way to go. We know this.\"I know at Rangers the demand is high to get a lot of wins. But for me, it's also eight wins in a row. It's a statement, especially from the point we were at. And if you can continue this and you do your homework and you go again, then yeah, it's on.\"We knew before the game, it's not an easy one. Everyone expected us to win. Then you face an opponent who are on a small run. They're well organised, you have to break them down first.\"In the first half, we tried but in some moments we had too many players behind the ball instead of in the right areas. This was the topic at half-time. Then you come out fantastic, make the goal, then you have two or three good moments so you can score for 2-0 or 3-0 and then in some transition moments we were not clinical, we lose the ball, and we were a little bit too open.\"But finally, then the 3-0, for me, is a statement as well.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The roar that reverberated around Tynecastle at kick-off screamed ­volumes about the importance of the fixture. But the occasion appeared initially to get to Hearts, whose approach was too forced and too rushed. Cooler heads eventually improved the home team’s performance.There were debutants on both sides with the Birmingham loanee Marc Leonard starting in central midfield for Hearts and Tomas Cvancara, the towering Czech forward signed on an initial loan from Borussia ­Moenchengladbach, leading the line for Celtic.Leonard’s influence grew after a difficult start in which he dragged Nygren to the ground just outside the area. Nygren took the free-kick and swept a powerful shot past Craig Gordon. McInnes took exception to something said during the celebrations that followed in front of the Celtic bench and he had to be pushed back by the fourth official. The assistant managers Paul Sheerin and Shaun Maloney had a tête-à-tête later, too. “It was nothing to do with ­Martin or Shaun,” McInnes said. “One of their inexperienced coaches got a bit carried away and that’s all I’m going to say.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Nygren opens the scoring for Celtic in the seventh minute.Photograph: Mark Runnacles/ShutterstockHearts could have levelled almost immediately when Braga broke into the Celtic area but he shot tamely at Kasper Schmeichel. An ineffective display in front of goal was under way for the hosts. Alexandros Kyziridis should have equalised when a defensive howler by Trusty put him clean through on Schmeichel’s goal. The winger had to score but the Dane stood tall and made a crucial save with his leg.Kyziridis missed another excellent chance in the second half, taking an eternity to size up a shot inside the area and enabling Liam Scales to intercept. Hearts were level by then.Leonard delivered a corner to the back post where Findlay rose above two Celtic players to bury a header past Schmeichel. Celtic had shown little in the final third following their early lead but burst into life when Cvancara headed against the bar and then led a break down the left. ­Having sprinted clear of Craig Halkett, the striker rolled a perfect cross along the face of goal for Yang to convert from close range.Plenty of spice was added to the mix. Cvancara was booked for needlessly barging into Leonard. The on-loan midfielder then dissected the Celtic defence to release Pierre ­Landry Kaboré, who was hauled to the ground by Trusty. The referee, ­Steven McLean, enraged Tynecastle by ­initially showing only a yellow card to the Celtic centre-half, presumably on the basis the Hearts striker was running away from goal. McLean was advised to review the incident on the pitchside ­monitor and he returned with a red card in his hand. Trusty was on his way to the tunnel by the time it was brandished.Celtic played for almost an hour with 10 men in Bologna on ­Thursday. Hearts tested their energy ­levels to the limit. Braga somehow failed to beat Schmeichel from point-blank range when Sabah Kerjota’s cross landed at his feet but made amends with four minutes of normal time remaining.A set piece was again Celtic’s undoing, this time a free‑kick sent deep into the box by Harry Milne. Oisin McEntee headed down perfectly for Braga to lash home through a crowded area.McInnes was relaxed about the title race. “We are confident and enjoying where we are,” he said. “But we are well aware that some big clubs are desperate to be where we are and so we have to keep improving.”O’Neill’s take was equally pragmatic. “We knew at one minute to three today that we had a tough time and we still have a tough time because another game has gone past, but we’re still in it.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipHeartsCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A penny for the thoughts of LIV’s office bearers, who had information they would presumably rather remain private put into the public domain by the new Desert Classic champion.Patrick Reed emerged from the joust, thereby delivering a reminder that he remains among the finest golfers in the world. David Puig did not even receive the consolation of second place, his slow finish and a strong one from Andy Sullivan elbowing the Spaniard into third.Rory McIlroy backs Muirfield for Open return despite ‘lowest point’ in 2013Read moreFurther ignominy arrived for Puig after close of play; he was handed a two-stroke penalty after grounding his club in a bunker behind the 18th green. Make that a tie for seventh for Puig. Ouch.That it was Reed versus Puig for so long carried broader intrigue. It highlighted an anomaly. Neither can play on the PGA Tour because of their LIV membership. The PGA Tour has a significant deal to underpin prize funds on this, the DP World Tour, until the end of next year. The DP World Tour continues to accommodate LIV rebels, which can lead to eye-catching scenarios such as the one that played out on the Majlis Course.With the PGA Tour now bullish about seeing off LIV and its Saudi Arabian riches, a theory endorsed byBrooks Koepka’s recent swapping of domains, it is hardly a leap of faith to suggest those in Florida might ask the DP World Tour to reassess tournament entry rules if the dollars are to keep flowing across the Atlantic. When criteria was created to allow Koepka’s return, it was carefully created so that the likes of Reed need not apply. Yet here he was, departing the Emirates Club with $1.5m that essentially comes in part from the PGA Tour. Golf remains in a weird and wonderful place. Reed used his press conference to reveal his LIV deal has expired.“We’re still finalising the contract,” Reed said. “We’re not complete on that yet. I don’t like to talk business and stuff while I’m playing, and so it’s like Monday through Wednesday is the only time to really talk about it.”Reed even floated the idea of finishing inside the top 10 of Europe’s order of merit, therefore potentially earning a path back to the PGA Tour. “If I ended up not playing on LIV this year, obviously I would be out here playing more on this tour and trying to secure one of those spots in the top 10,” Reed said. He is suddenly in a useful bargaining position.View image in fullscreenDavid Puig was handed a two-stroke penalty after grounding his club in a bunker behind the 18th green.Photograph: Ali Haider/EPAEarlier Reed, one of this sport’s truly global performers, eased to his four-shot success, achieved at 14 under par with a closing 72. The finish was anticlimactic in nature. Reed has thereby scratched an itch, created bymissing out by one to Rory McIlroyin the Desert Classic’s 2023 staging.Reed’s advantage over Puig was four at the start of play. The deficit was cut in half by the turn thanks to Puig birdies at the 8th and 9th. Reed, though, was to steady himself. Shots collected by the former Masters winner at the 10th and 13th, offset only marginally by a bogey at the 11th, came as Puig toiled. Puig played the closing eight holes in three over before it became five thanks to that penalty and a seven on the 18th. Sullivan’s inward half of 33 was sufficient for second. Julien Guerrier took third. Francesco Molinari, Nicolai Højgaard and Jayden Schaper shared fourth.McIlroy signed off with a 73 for the most unusual of things, a finish outside the top 20 in Dubai. “I was stuck in neutral for most of the week,” the Masters champion said.Explore more on these topicsGolfLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourEuropean TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Undav, who had entered on the hour-mark, sealed the win in the 74th minute.The former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko scored at the age of 39 and 314 days inSchalke’s2-2 comeback draw againstKaiserlauternin the German second division to become the oldest player to score in the country’s secondBundesliga.

The club held crunch boardroom talks on Sunday before deciding to relieve the manager of his position.The Foxes slumped to a humiliatinghome defeat against a struggling Oxford Unitedon Saturday and have won only one of their past five matches. Andy King, the club’s former Premier League-winning midfielder who has been first‑team coach since last season, will take interim charge but Leicester are expected to appoint an external successor.Soap, wifi, but no football: a room without a view at Blackpool’s stadium hotelRead moreLeicester appointed Cifuenteson a three-year contract last summerwith designs on an instant return to the Premier League, but they have failed to establish themselves as promotion contenders. The club have lost faith in the Spaniard, who spent the previous two seasons at QPR, after a series of inconsistent results and particularly poor recent performances.Leicester’s owner, Aiyawatt “Top” Srivaddhanaprabha, attended the defeat against Oxford at the King Power Stadium, during which supporters chanted against Cifuentes and also the club’s hierarchy. Fans have grown disillusioned with the ownership after being relegated from the Premier League in 2022-23. The director of football, Jon Rudkin, is under fierce scrutiny.Srivaddhanaprabha said in a statement released on Sunday afternoon: “This has been a difficult decision and not one I have taken lightly. I would like to thank Martí for the total commitment he has shown during his time at Leicester. He gave everything to the role and worked tirelessly to help us achieve our targets. However, I believe this is the right step at this time to improve performances and results, and to act in the best interests ofLeicester City. Martí leaves with our thanks and our best wishes for the future.”Quick GuideLeague Two: Fleetwood sack head coach Pete WildShowFleetwood Town have sacked head coach Pete Wild. His departure comes after the team were beaten 2-1 by Colchester on Saturday, taking their winless run to seven matches in all competitions, and leaves them 15th in the table.A statement from the League Two club said: \"Following six defeats in the last seven games the club felt now is the right time to make a change to the first team management.\"Assistant head coach Adam Temple will also depart and everyone at the club would like to place on record their thanks to Pete and Adam for their hard work and professionalism during his time at the club. The club will issue a further update on the first team staff in due course.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The club, who are close to appointing a technical director to work with Rudkin as well as a new chief executive, are hamstrung by profitability and sustainability regulations and face a points deduction this season for allegedly breaching rules. They are limited to signing loan players in this transfer window, which ends on Monday 2 February.The Foxes are without a clean sheet in 23 league games and have struggled to find consistency. Leicester return to league action at home against Charlton next Saturday. Cifuentes inherited an experienced squad but was unable to strengthen. They have not paid a transfer fee for a player this season despite selling about £50m of talent last summer.After the defeat by Oxford, Cifuentes said: “It’s not a pleasant situation as a manager and as a person because you want to do well for them and it’s sad that they feel this way. At the same time, I know football is about results. At the moment, there’s a number of fans who are not happy with a lot of things. But as the manager you need to be accountable and responsible.”Explore more on these topicsLeicester CityChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

When he regained consciousness, he was bleeding from a large head wound, and believed he would die. The friendly fire attack killed one Canadian solider and left five others gravely wounded. Now an elementary school teacher, Moncur had nearly 5% of his brain removed, and had to relearn how to walk, talk, read and write.View image in fullscreenBruce Moncur, after recovering from a head wound caused by US friendly fire in Afghanistan.Photograph: SuppliedDonald Trump provoked a storm of diplomatic fury with his claims that Nato allieshad “stayed a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan. The comments were condemned as“insulting and frankly appalling”by the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who joined other leaders in expressing disgust and anger at the president.On Saturday, in a rare partial climbdown, Trump praised UK troops as being “among the greatest of all warriors”. His post on Truth Social, acknowledging that 457 UK troops had died in Afghanistan, is reported to have come afterKing Charles expressed his concerns, through private channels, about Trump’s earlier slur on UK forces.But Trump’s post did not apologise for his earlier comments. Crucially, nor did he clarify or withdraw his denigration of the role played by troops of otherNatoallies.And for the men and women who fought alongside US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, the damage already done by Trump’s earlier comment cut especially deep.“Our friends needed help and I and so many others answered that call. Now, my sacrifices are now being thrown in my face as ‘not enough’,” said Moncur, who accused the US president of “deep disrespect” towards veterans.“Nobody named Trump was on the frontline with me. And his sons were nowhere to be seen in the Afghan desert,” he said.Trump had fired his opening salvo as he headed to the World Economic Forum in Davos, telling reporters: “I know we’ll come to [Nato’s] rescue, but I just really do question whether or not they’ll come to ours.”Later that day, he told Fox News that he was “not sure” Nato would meet the “ultimate test” of defending the US if it were under threat.“We’ve never needed them … They’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan … and they did, they stayed a little back – a little off the frontlines,” he said. He added the US had been “very good to Europe and to many other countries. It has to be a two-way street.”The only time Nato has ever invoked its mutual defence clause – stating that an attack on one member represents an attack on all – came after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, when member states deployed thousands of troops to Afghanistan.In the 20-year conflict that followed, 3,486 Nato troops died, of which the majority, 2,461, were US service members. But at times during the war, allies experienced a death rate higher than their American counterparts.In 2006, Canadian troops were moved from the relative safety of Kabul to the frontlines of the deadly Kandahar region as part of Operation Medusa, in part to relieve American troops. The vast majority of Canada’s 159 combat deaths happened during the operation.After comrades were killed, their remains were placed in a flag-draped casket and brought to a plane, giving soldiers one last chance to bid farewell. “All countries saluted,” Moncur said. “We showed our respect – as one.”Trump, who avoided the Vietnam-era military draft five times, has a long history ofdisparaging and belittling the military. Paweł “Naval” Mateńczuk, a Polish special forces veteran, said that in general, soldiers “try to stay pretty numb” to what politicians say.“But today is the anniversary of my friend’s death in Afghanistan and it’s hard to just look past that,” he said.Over 19 years, Poland – which had joined Nato only two years before, in 2001 – sent more than 33,000 troops and military personnel to Afghanistan and 44 were killed in the line of duty.Mateńczuk, who was deployed to Afghanistan with Poland’s elite special forces unit GROM on four assignments, said that while president Trump was “often banging on about gratitude or someone thanking him for something”, veterans were not looking for that, because they “felt that gratitude first-hand, serving alongside American troops” and “you can’t break a bond like that easily”.“But what we carry with us as veterans is not just the gruelling experience of active combat, but the loss of our friends. Thousands more brought back memories that were far from pleasant. I know history can be shortsighted, but I never imagined it would be quite this shortsighted,” he said from Warsaw.“They were grateful we were there, taking part in an American war. It wasn’t a Polish war, or a European war; it was a war against global terrorism, and it was the US that had been attacked,” he said.On social media, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, recalled a ceremony for the five fallen Polish soldiers in Ghazni, Afghanistan in 2011. “The American officers who accompanied me then told me that America would never forget the Polish heroes,” he wrote. “Perhaps they will remind President Trump of that fact.”A day after Trump questioned the value of Nato support for the US, the Polish defence ministerpublished the full listof 44 Polish troops and military personnel killed in Afghanistan.Mateńczuk said Trump should consider apologising to the families of veterans, particularly those who had lost their lives. “There are so many Polish widows and orphaned children. If anyone is owed an apology, it’s them,” he said.In the United Kingdom, condemnation of the president’s comments has cut across the political spectrum, reflecting the reality that 457 British troops died, while another 2,000 military and civilian personnel were wounded in action.Richard Streatfield, a former army major in charge of 150 troops on the frontline in Sangin between 2009 and 2010, said Trump’s comments were “deeply insulting”.Streatfield, now a Liberal Democrat councillor in Kent, said he had overseen soldiers in “the most violent town” in Helmand, which in turn was “the most violent province” in all of Afghanistan.“We put in huge amounts of effort and some paid the ultimate sacrifice. Five of the company were killed and 50 were wounded. So to be told that your service was not as demanding or as difficult as the Americans’ is untrue, and deeply insulting,” he said. “In broad terms, the Americans, the Danes and us lost proportionally as many people as each other in relation to the size of force that we had in the country.”Streatfield said his American comrades would be “ashamed” of Trump’s remarks.“The American troops I served alongside … know precisely what kind of sacrifices were made by everybody there. Their own service and sacrifice is diminished by what Trump has said.”“The Americans needed us as allies. They are the ones who called in the article 5 requirement after 9/11. We heard the call, made the sacrifices, and to be told you’ve taken a step back is incredible.”Streatfield said many of his British comrades were also outraged by Trump’s remarks.“We are very passionate about the job that we did in Afghanistan, which was, to a large extent, undermined by Donald Trump’s own decisions. He’s the one who set the timetable for the Taliban to get back into power. He is the one that started the American withdrawal. Twenty million Afghan women and girls are now living in terrible conditions under the Taliban directly as a result of his decisions.”He added: “If you haven’t served, don’t do anything other than respect those people who have.”After his Fox News interview, Trump continued his campaign, posting on Truth Social: “Maybe we should have put Nato to the test: Invoked Article 5, and forced Nato to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants, thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks.”Moncur said that for someone who has never experienced the harrowing realities of frontline combat, “the pain that he has caused, and is causing, is immeasurable and it is shameful.“To see how American treat their friends now – who needs enemies?”Explore more on these topicsNatoDonald TrumpMilitaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Similar concerns hamper such conversations with children, including that they may develop disordered eating habits as a result.The complex factors that explain obesity, including poverty, lack of access to nutritious food, and children having limited opportunities to be active, means GPs approach conversations about children’s weight “with care and empathy for families under pressure”, Holden said.“When parents feel judged or blamed, conversations can quickly become emotionally charged and, as our members tell us, can lead to complaints from distressed or angry parents,” he added.Katharine Jenner, the executive director of theObesity Health Alliance, a coalition of 65 health and children’s groups, said that the large numbers of GPs who had seen obese infants and young children “is another sign we’re letting children down before they even start school. If we’re serious about prevention, it has to begin in the earliest years, otherwise the damage follow them through life.”She called for reformulation of food and drink products to make them healthier, restrictions on the marketing of products high in fat, salt and sugar, and better support for families.GPs also disclosed in the survey that adult patients who should not be using weight loss drugs are putting themselves at risk by obtaining them through deception from private pharmacies. They include people with eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia, and those already taking other medications that may interact badly with “fat jabs” and pose a risk to their health.Most of the estimated 1.5 million people in Britain using GLP-1 drugs to lose weight have obtained them privately, with only a small minority receiving them on the NHS, which has strict eligibility rules.One GP said GLP-1s are being “accessed privately pretty indiscriminately by many people whose body mass index is not in the obese category”. Another told how a patient with a history of anorexia nervosa had also obtained the drugs privately. Two-thirds (67%) of family doctors have seen patients who have done so despite not meeting eligibility rules.The findings raise questions about how rigorously private pharmacies are conducting proper checks on people who want to start using GLP-1s, such as checking what other drugs they already take.Large majorities of GPs surveyed said that obesity was likely to be a defining public health challenge in their career (92%), and that it would significantly affect the NHS’s ability to deliver care (95%). But 59% believe weight loss jabs will save the NHS money – only 22% disagree.The Department ofHealthand Social Care did not comment directly on MDDUS’s findings. But a spokesperson said: “Every child deserves the best possible start in life, which is why this government is taking decisive action to tackle childhood obesity.“We are restricting junk food advertising on television before 9pm and online, a move expected to remove up to 7.2bn calories per year from children’s diets; while giving local authorities new powers to stop fast food shops opening outside schools.“Through our ten-year health plan, we’re shifting the focus from sickness to prevention to create a healthier nation.”Explore more on these topicsObesityChildrenHealthDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The release of videos showing the violence of the protests was “something we will have to face sooner or later”, Yousef Pezeshkian added. “Shutting down the internet will not solve anything, we will just postpone the issue.”The sporadic lifting of restrictions is leading to a slow and painful inquest into how many protesters, including children, have died. Authorities launched a violent crackdown under cover of the internet blackout, with rights groups documenting several thousand dead. The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights says the final figure could be as high as 25,000. Thousands more people are still being detained.Pictures of many of the dead children are appearing on internet sites inside Iran, while the director of Farabi eye hospital in Tehran, Dr Ghasem Fakhraei, said staff at the specialist ophthalmology centre had operated on more than 1,000 patients requiring emergency eye surgery since the protests. Hospital wards were overflowing, he said.View image in fullscreenIn this photo obtained by the Associated Press, Iranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran on 9 January.Photograph: APMolavi Abdolhamid, a prominent Sunni cleric and outspoken Friday prayer leader in Zahedan, south-east Iran, referred to the violent killing of protesters during January as an “organised massacre”.Yousef Pezeshkian, a government adviser, said the risk of keeping Iran cut off from the internet was greater than that of a return to protests if connectivity were restored. He said security institutions must ensure security with the existence of the internet, which he called a necessity in life.Pezeshkian, echoing comments of his father, said the protests had turned violent only because of professionally trained groups affiliated with foreigners, but added: “In the meantime the security and law enforcement forces may have made mistakes and no one is going to defend wrongdoing and that has to be addressed.”Graphic of internet connectivity in IranIranian journalists were openly reporting a dispute with government about whether it was safe to relax the internet, with the president and the communications minister, Sattar Hashemi, backing the move but the measure being opposed by Ali Larijani, the head of the supreme national security council.A graphic showing Iran’s internet networkTehran’s stock market on Sunday was in the red for the fourth day in a row, and the Iranian currency, the rial, continued to fall against the dollar, one of the causes of the protests. The Central Bank of Iran said a debt issuance had only been 15% subscribed, a development that will require further government spending cuts or result in a rise in inflation, the official rate of which was more than 42% last month.Although shops have opened, even newspapers close to the security services admit trading is low.Iran’s computer trade organisation said the internet shutdown was costing $20m (£15m) a day, with lorry drivers also reporting it was difficult to cross borders because of the lack of electronic documentation.One frustrated trader said they were being given 20 minutes of supervised access to the internet a day, enough to answer a small number of emails, but not enough to conduct business.With the limited lifting of the restrictions, it is now possible to see pressure being applied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) narrative that the death toll is so high purely because of subversive activities of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency.Gholamhossein Karbaschi, a reformist former mayor of Tehran, said: “People are in shock and amazed … If the agents of Mossad and foreign countries are at work, how did they suddenly carry out these disasters throughout the country? Where did they come from?”He condemned the failure of the Pezeshkian administration to improve the economy. “The government in Iran is losing its original meaning. In no area can it be said the government is active, present and solving problems. All the other forces in the country are active and doing what they want except for the government. This government does not show any power in any area,” Karbaschi said.View image in fullscreenA screen grab show people blocking an intersection during a protest in Tehran on 8 January.Photograph: APSome of the protesters contacted by the Guardian in Iran blamed Donald Trump for failing to provide the help he had promised.“He betrayed us,” said one. “Trump is more hateful to me than the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei because the ideology of Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is clear. Trump promised and kept saying he would shoot the person who shot you. Trump is the lowest of leaders the world has seen.”Another said: “Bodies are intact, but hearts and minds are shattered. For a moment you feel happy that you have finally managed to get access to the internet. Then instantly guilt hits – what are you happy about it? Why are you still breathing, you useless person?”They added: “We are honestly sorry for ourselves because first, God does not exist. Second, we have become so miserable that we are impatiently waiting for another country to attack our country, hoping it will save us. And even then, there is no guarantee that it will.”Explore more on these topicsIranInternetProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But after a marked rise in accidents – particularly involving children – these vehicles the Dutch call “fatbikes” are to be banned in some parts of theNetherlands.“It’s nonsense!” said Henk Hendrik Wolthers, 69, from the saddle of his wide-tyred, electric Mate bike. “I drive a car, I ride a motorbike, I’ve had a moped and now I ride a fatbike. This is the quickest means of transport in the city and you should be able to use it.”An increasing number of road safety experts, doctors and politicians in the Netherlands disagree. Although motor assistance on e-bikes is limited to just over 15mph, many fatbike riders modify the factory settings to reach speedsof 25mphin this busy park.The safety organisation VeiligheidNL estimates that 5,000 fatbike riders are treated in A&E departments each year, on the basis of a recentsample of hospitals. “And we also see that especially these young people aged from 12 to 15 have the most accidents,” said the spokesperson Tom de Beus.View image in fullscreenThe Vondelpark will become a fatbike-free area of the city once the new measures are brought in.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersNow Amsterdam’s head of transport, Melanie van der Horst, has said “unorthodox measures” are needed and hasannouncedthat she will ban these heavy electric bikes from city parks, starting in the Vondelpark. Like the city ofEnschede, which is also drawing up a city centre ban, she is acting on a stream of requests “begging me to ban the fatbikes”.In the park, her plans stirred mixed reactions. While four in five fatbike riders who whizzed past said they were “too busy” to talk, 31-year-old Joost was sceptical. “It will be senseless,” he said. “Normal bicycles use the park, city vehicles use it. It’s all about having the appropriate speed.”But Muriel Winkel, 33, running with her dog, Joop, was enthusiastic. “They are all souped-up, which people don’t do with evil intentions, but they often ride carelessly, without watching out,” she said. “Sometimes, my dog really gets a fright.”Some point out that the tensions around electric bikes will soon reach other countries, especially with more political interest in stimulating active mobility.In this land of early adopters, 48% of bicycles sold in 2024 were electric and another 13% were fatbikes, according to figures fromRAI Vereniging and BOVAG motoringassociations. In Amsterdam,a third of journeysare made by cycling.The roadside assistance organisation ANWB said that the problem was not necessarily with the wide-tyred bike model – but the ease with which people could speed it up to use like a moped, “combined with risky behaviour”.‘Damage is piling up’: has the Netherlands forgotten how to cope with snow?Read moreFlorrie de Pater, the chair of the Fietsersbond Amsterdam cycling association, said that the rise of illegal bikes, plus a lack of enforcement, was scaring old people and children off the roads. “Because of the dangers of those who are cycling fast, especially older people over 55 or 60 simply leave their bikes at home,” she said. “We also hear that parents no longer dare to let their children cycle to school.”The brain injury specialist Marcel Aries, a consultant at Maastricht University Medical Center, said more authorities needed to consider controversial bans, alongside thehelmet requirementfor children on electric bikes from 2027. “It is reasonable for governments and municipalities to consider measures that may be unpopular,” he said. “They are public health responses to increasingly congested streets and widening speed gaps between cars, cyclists and pedestrians.”His view is shared by Marlies Schijven, a professor of surgery at the Amsterdam University Medical Center, whosefrustrated LinkedIn poston dangerous riders in 2024 has been viewed 2.9m times. “It is a good step, but a baby step, only in one Amsterdam park,” she said. “The problem is much larger. We still see pain, misery and death every day at our morning meeting in the hospital.”Wolthers, the fatbike owner, agreed that the problem was in letting children ride these powerful vehicles. “Children go through red, they don’t signal and they also can’t assess the traffic,” he said. “Hospitals have a chilling term for them: potential donors.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsEuropeCyclingTransport policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thousands more were hit with bills ranging from £250 to £18,000 to rectify work so poorly done that in some cases it posed a direct threat to health from mould and damp.While the Serious Fraud Office is being urged to investigate, the government must now try to repair not just the damage to houses, but the reputation of abattered industrythat is vital to efforts to reduce the cost of living and tackle the climate crisis.This week, the governmentset out its long-awaited “warm homes plan”, a £15bn investment to help reduce bills and increase clean energy. It will fund solar panels, batteries and low-carbon heat pumps, as well as home insulation measures. Although hailed by ministers as the UK’s biggest public investment in home upgrades, the plan has been greeted with concern by some campaigners and experts, because of its perceivedemphasis on generating low-carbon energyrather than saving it through insulation.“Some of the wording in the plan seems to deprioritise insulation,” said Christopher Hammond, the chief executive of UK100, a group of local government leaders for climate action. “But we know it [insulation] works. We are worried about the emphasis.”Of the £15bn, a third will go to upgrading homes for vulnerable people and those on low incomes. However, it is not known how much of that will be spent on insulation, compared with green energy.The sector has already been shaken by years of “stop-start” policies. Insulation waschampioned by David Cameronin the early days of the coalition government, but thescrapping in 2015 of the loan schemeshe set up caused a big drop-off of installations. For years, there was no government support, until Boris Johnson brought in a“green homes grant”. Six months later,that was scrapped, and MPscriticised the schemefor its delivery.Labour’s move to scrap Eco, first rumoured last autumn, was another blow. Sarah Kostense-Winterton is the chair of the Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group, which is made up of insulation providers and green groups. She said the sector had made about 7,000 roles redundant in the past three months, and the total jobs lost could reach 70,000 by the end of the year.“[The sector] needs certainty and security now if any meaningful progress on tackling fuel poverty and driving down home heating bills is going to be made in this parliament,” she added.Home insulation isone of the most effective ways of cutting energy bills, improving comfort and health, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Well-insulated homes are cheap to run – in the best,heating bills are minimal– and pleasant to live in, especially for older people, children and those with health problems, but installing insulation is easy to get wrong.Anna Moore, the chief executive and founder of the retrofit company Domna, said insulation was often wrongly treated as a “simple fix”, but good installations required careful planning, especially for ventilation. Without good airflow around the home, insulation can trap moisture.“The most common problems show up as damp, condensation and mould,” Moore said. “That usually happens because ventilation hasn’t been properly thought through, or because insulation has been badly fitted around edges, corners and openings.”Even worse, it can be hard to tell whether the retrofit has worked. “These problems don’t always appear straight away. Homes can look fine at first, but over time residents experience poorer air quality and buildings begin to deteriorate,” Moore added.Hammond said the best way to ensure quality was for local governments to work closely with local suppliers over the long term, building relationships and trust so that problems could be rectified and work of a high standard replicated across areas, potentially through “street by street” retrofit programmes.As well as the £5bn in grants directed at vulnerable people and those on low incomes, the warm homes plan will support those better able to pay. For instance, loans and “innovative finance”, such as green mortgages, will offer a lower interest rate to homeowners who refurbish to low-carbon standards.The government has not said how much of the £15bn will go towards insulation. Despite the misgivings of experts, the emphasis on solar panels, batteries and heat pumps may yield results faster than insulation alone.Researchpublished by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero last autumn found that UK homes were not as draughty as had been previously thought, meaning that heat pumps – whichrun at lower temperatures than gas boilers– could be effective even without insulating first.Also, solar panels have dropped rapidly in price to about £6,000 including installation for the average house, and are now available in forms such as DIY plug-in sets and balcony panels. A Whitehall source said the government wanted to “lean in” to what consumers wanted, rather than keep trying to push insulation on people first.The alleged fraud, cowboy construction and mishandling of insulation under the previous government’s Eco scheme will be costly and time-consuming for the Labour administration to fix. The challenge now will be to ensure that heat pump and solar installations do not fall prey to the same mistakes.Explore more on these topicsEnergy efficiencyGreenhouse gas emissionsClimate crisisRenewable energyLabourConservativesanalysisShareReuse this content"

As Tully toured locations across the subcontinent, it was clear that his standing as the BBC’s “voice of India” still endured, even though he had ceased to be its correspondent in the country more than 20 years earlier.Everywhere he went – the documentary’s producer, Frank Stirling, recalled – he could not walk down the street without people coming up to him wanting to shake his hand. In the eyes of the Indian public, Tully, who has died aged 90, was more than a foreign correspondent; he was a public figure, known throughout the country thanks to his authoritative but sensitive reporting on often tumultuous events.Prominent among these events were the Bhopal disaster, the siege of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and the assassination of the prime minister Indira Gandhi, all in 1984, with Tully demonstrating a deep understanding of the country’s complex and combustible politics.Tully’s name was synonymous with India to a degree that didn’t happen with colleagues serving in other posts around the world. He was the BBC’s Delhi bureau chief from 1972 to 1993, and its South Asia correspondent for another year after that. His beat took in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.BBCchiefs visiting India depended on him to show them round and open doors.The sense of belonging Tully felt in India stemmed not just from the fact that he had been born there. The country fuelled his fascination with the spiritual side of life, and that fascination fed into his broadcasts.From 1995 to 2019, after retiring from reporting duties, he was the main presenter of theRadio 4programme Something Understood, in which he explored the meaning of life through selections of poetry, prose and music. But Tully, who had studied theology at Cambridge University with a view to entering the priesthood, was never regarded as a sermoniser.“I still cling to Christianity and identify myself as Christian,” he told Radio Times in 2019. “But living in India with so many religions around me, I no longer believe that Christianity is the only way to God.”View image in fullscreenTully recording a despatch from the Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, in Delhi, 1994.Photograph: Sondeep Shankar/Getty ImagesTully was born in Kolkata, the son of William, an accountant in one of the leading managing agencies of the British Raj, and his wife, Patience (nee Treby).He was sent to the UK for his education, attending Twyford school in Winchester and then Marlborough college. His time at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, was followed by further studies at a seminary, but “I was always rather rebellious and I didn’t like the discipline”, he said in an interview with the Unesco Courier. “Also, I was a good beer drinker.”Tully returned to India to take up an administrative job with the BBC in 1965 before becoming a talks writer with its Eastern Service in 1969. Three years later he took on the role that made him famous.Operation Blue Star – to give the Amritsar siege its official description – provided Tully with the subject of his first book, co-authored with Satish Jacob, Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi’s Last Battle (1985). The incident was, he said, “one of the most extraordinary battles in military history”, in which the Indian army laid siege to the Golden Temple complex before attacking the Sikh fundamentalists who had occupied it in pursuit of the goal of their own homeland. Tully was on the spot as mortars exploded and gunfire was exchanged.His other books included From Raj to Rajiv (1988); No Full Stops in India (1991); India in Slow Motion (2002), co-authored with Gillian Wright; India’s Unending Journey (2007); India: The Road Ahead (2011); and Upcountry Tales: Once Upon a Time in the Heart of India (2017).Most of his reporting was for radio but he made appearances on the TV news and in 1996 he presented the BBC TV series The Lives of Jesus, and wrote an accompanying book.Tully’s departure from the BBC was controversial. Trouble started brewing in 1993 when he delivered a lecture at the Radio Academy in which he accused the then director-general, John Birt, of “turning the BBC into a secretive monolith with poor ratings and a demoralised staff”, adding that he didn’t “think Mr Birt understands what the BBC was or what it should become.”He was transferred from staff to a two-year contract, the protracted wrangling over the terms eventually leading him to resign. His long tenure at the helm of Something Understood then began, and he remained in Delhi.Knighted in 2002, he was also the recipient of two of India’s highest honours – the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan, both in recognition of distinguished service.In 1960, Tully married Margaret Butler, with whom he had two daughters, Sarah and Emma, and two sons, Sam and Patrick. He lived with her on his visits to London, while sharing his Delhi home with Wright, his partner. Once asked about this arrangement, Tully described it as “complicated”.William Mark Tully, broadcaster and author, born 24 October 1935; died 25 January 2026Explore more on these topicsBBCRadio 4IndiaobituariesShareReuse this content"

In one clip she is harangued by bearded man in Islamic attire for eating a pork sausage.The message is one well rehearsed on far-right social media, but it is the AI invention of Amelia that has made her endlessly adaptable, creating a viral internet trend that anyone with access to a mainstream chatbot can take part in. Users of X have turned to its Grok AI tool to create so many Amelia memes, she is now breaking out of niche online silos.The origins of the character are ironic, to say they least. An early iteration of Amelia began life in a counter-extremism video game funded by the UK Home Office and created to deter young people aged 13-18 from being attracted to far right extremism in Yorkshire.0:09AI-generated Amelia far-right meme – videoPathways: Navigating the Internet and Extremismis a simple multiple choice format game with basic animation. Its players are taken on a journey as characters at a college. They are invited to make decisions in scenarios including whether or download potentially extremist content or join an Amelia character on a rally organised by “a small political group” protesting against changes in society and the “erosion in British values”.Certain scenarios simulated in the game result in a referral under the British government’s Prevent counter-terrorism programme.However, it is a subversion of the Amelia character that has exploded across social media channels in a way that has astonished even the creators of the original game.Among the plethora of increasingly sophisticated AI-generated iterations are a Manga-style Amelia, a Wallace and Gromit version and AI-generated “real life” encounters between her and the characters of Father Ted or Harry Potter, accompanied by racist language and far-right messaging.Analysis provided to the Guardian by Peryton Intelligence, a UK company that monitors disinformation, indicated that an anonymous account known for skilfully disseminating far-right messaging started the Amelia meme on X on 9 January with a post that has since been viewed 1.4m times.The volume of “Ameliaposting” has since gone from an average of 500 a day when that account first introduced it to the world to roughly 10,000, starting on 15 January as it hit international audiences. On Wednesday, it hit 11,137 posts on X alone.In one of the most surreal twists, an Amelia cryptocurrency has emerged, with social media users seeking to leverage its value on the meme’s rising profile. On Wednesday, Elon Musk retweeted an X account promoting an Amelia cryptocurrency token.“What we’re seeing is the monetisation of hate,” said Matteo Bergamini, the founder and CEO of Shout Out UK, a political and media literacy training company that created the original game.“We’ve seen Telegram groups all messaging each other in Chinese about the meme coin and talking about how to artificially inflate its value, so a lot of money is being made.”The company itself has been the target of a deluge of hate mail, including threats that have now been reported to the police.Bergamini points out that the original initiative was never meant to be a stand-alone game. Rather, it was intended to be used in the classrooms alongside a suite of teaching resources, a fact he says coverage and commentary has ignored.“There has been a lot of misrepresentation unfortunately,” he said. “The game does not state, for example, that questioning mass migration is inherently wrong.”Others have suggested the initiative had backfired, not least by casting a “cute goth girl” as a negative character, leading to her inadvertently becoming a focus of admiration. But Bergamini said the game – which used feedback from focus groups with young people and was developed with a specific local threat picture in mind – continued to be used and feedback from schools and others was positive.Nevertheless, the speed and sophistication surrounding the creation of supposedly subversive Amelia memes online has taken him by surprise.“This experience has shown us why this work is so immensely important, but also gives us pause for thought about our safety in conducting this work due to the highly sophisticated coordination of those who profit from hate,” he said.Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said: “We have seen the meme having a remarkable spread and proliferating among the far right and beyond, but what’s also been of note is how it is now international.“In a way it gets to the heart of what we might term the ‘dissident’ far-right – individuals who position themselves outside of the mainstream political scene – whether that’s ‘shitposters’ who are just into provoking, others who are in twee memes. A whole ecosystem has embraced it. Clearly, the sexualised imagery is also key to this. The target audience is almost exclusively young men.”The Home Office said Prevent had diverted nearly 6,000 people away from violent ideologies. It added that projects such as the Pathways game were designed to target local radicalisation risks and were created and delivered independently of government.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Many families affected are living in B&Bs, hostels and overcrowded flats.Growing numbers of over-60s facing homelessness, charities warnRead moreMost teachers who responded said homeless children had attended their school in the last year.Almost half of respondents – 49% – said that their school regularly referred homeless families to food banks.Families are often placed in temporary accommodation miles away from their children’s schools, and 41% of teachers said staff had helped homeless children get to classes. A quarter of teachers said their school regularly washed school uniforms for families living in temporary housing without adequate laundry facilities.The vast majority of those surveyed said homelessness had an impact on children’s attendance, performance in assessments and mental health.View image in fullscreenAlmost half of teachers in the survey said that their school regularly referred homeless families to food banks.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAlicia Samuels, 39, has been living in temporary accommodation in Tower Hamlets, east London, since she was pregnant with her son Aeon, who is now six.She previously lived in her father’s council house but became homeless when he died. She said that since then she has had five temporary homes, some of which did not have laundry facilities.Samuels said that the one-bedroom flat she shares with Aeon is damp and infested with rodents. She added that Aeon had developed hearing problems because of fluid in his ear resulting from the mould.She said: “I’ve told the school about the fluid in Aeon’s ear. I don’t want him to get sanctioned for not paying attention, if his mind goes somewhere else because he can’t hear. He’s very shy and he doesn’t speak up in school much.“He would excel so much more if he had more space for himself. I think he would find more confidence and independence.”Samuels said she has avoided inviting other children to playdates with Aeon because she is “so embarrassed” by their living situation.She added: “It gets me emotional … he goes round his friends’ houses and they have their own room and a playroom.

We need 90,000 social homes a year for 10 years.”Matt Wrack, NASUWT general secretary, said: “Teachers and school leaders are pulling out all the stops to help mitigate the effects of homelessness on these pupils and their families, but they cannot fix our national housing crisis.

This month, he dismissed the allegations as“complete made-up fantasies”based on political motivation.In a wide-ranging interview with the Sunday Times magazine, Javid, who became the first home secretary from an minority ethnic background in 2018, said Farage’s remarks were “clearly the wrong thing to say”, even if they were banter to him.“He could well be a totally different person today,” Javid said. “But to demonstrate you are a different person, it starts with an apology and he hasn’t done that yet.

According to the agency, two men of unknown ages died of hypothermia.New York City mayor Zohran Mamdanireported“at least five New Yorkers passed away and were found outside” on Saturday before it started snowing.Snow, sleet and power outages: 140m Americans under warnings for major winter stormRead more“While we do not yet know their causes of death, there is no more powerful reminder of the dangers of the extreme cold, and how vulnerable how many of our neighbors are, especially homeless New Yorkers,” Mamdani said.He added the storm is bringing colder temperatures for a sustained period than New York City has experienced in eight years.“Up to [18] inches will fall over New England, and 0.50 inches of freezing rain over parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys,” the National Weather Service reported on Sunday with respect to the heavy snow and ice accumulation expected from the winter storm. “Furthermore, heavy rain will develop over the Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday and parts of the Tennessee Valley on Monday.“In the wake of the storm, communities from the Southern Plains to the north-east will contend with bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills.”View image in fullscreenPedestrians cross the street along Broadway during a winter storm on Saturday in Nashville, Tennessee.Photograph: George Walker IV/APCalling the storms “historic”, Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky,Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.“We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.Seventeen states and the District of Columbia had declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said. The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, at a news conference on Saturday, warned people to take precautions.“It’s going to be very, very cold,” Noem said. “So we’d encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.” She added: “We have utility crews that are working to restore that as quick as possible.”graphicThe number of outages continued to rise. As of 6.30am ET (1130 GMT) on Sunday, more than 900,000 US customers were without electricity, according toPowerOutage.us. Nearly 335,000 of those outages were in Tennessee. Mississippi reported more than 178,000; Louisiana in excess of 145,000; and Texas roughly 93,000.The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorising the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at datacentres and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.On Sunday, the department issued an emergency order to authorise the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.View image in fullscreenPeople wait to cross the street in Times Square during a winter storm on Sunday in New York City.Photograph: Heather Khalifa/APThe National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that would bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the south-east, where “crippling to locally catastrophic impacts” could be expected.Forecasters predicted record low temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into the Great Plains region by Monday.More than 10,500 US flights were cancelled on Sunday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Sunday morning, the storm is the highest experienced cancellation event since the pandemic.More than 1,800 flight cancellations have also beenreportedfor Monday.

Delta Air Lines adjusted its schedule on Saturday, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the east coast, including in Boston and New York City. It would relocate experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports, the airline said.JetBlue said that as of Saturday morning it had cancelled about 1,000 flights through Monday. United Airlines said it had cancelled some flights in places with the worst expected weather.US electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts. Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of datacentres in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS weatherExtreme weatherSnowNew YorkLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

The challenge had originally been scheduled to take place on Saturday but was postponed because of rain.Cheers erupted from a gathered crowd as Honnold, 40, began to climb the 101-floor building in Taiwan’s capital city, and again when he paused at one point and turned around to face them.Alex Honnold’s made-for-Netflix free solo of Taipei 101 draws awe – and uneaseRead moreThe 91-minute ascent was broadcast globally onSkyscraper Live, Netflix’s latest foray into live sports programming.“It was like what a view, it’s incredible, what a beautiful day,” Honnold, also known for his ropeless ascent of the mountain El Capitan in Yosemite national park, said after scaling the building. “It was very windy, so I was like, ‘don’t fall off the spire’. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.”Netflix and Honnold drew a backlash from some in the climbing community over the ethical implications of broadcasting such a high-risk endeavour live. Critics, including a Wall Street Journal columnist, have pointed to the high number of free-solo deaths and to Honnold’s role as a husband and father. They called the event “voyeuristic, ghoulish and irresponsible”.Honnold said he hoped people would be inspired in their own path after seeing his achievement. “I think that people often find the inspiration that they need to pursue their own challenges or their own goals. It’s often the kick they need to do whatever it is that they want to do in their life,” he said.“Often they’ll watch something like this and it’s a reminder that their time is finite and they should use it in the best way, the most meaningful way that they can. If anything, I hope that that’s what people take from it.”Honnold needed the full support and permission of Taipei 101 and the city’s government before embarking on the challenge.Taiwanese politicians thanked Honnold and Netflix on social media for putting the country – more accustomed to featuring in global headlines for its semiconductor prowess or Chinese military threats – in the international spotlight with such a different perspective.“Congratulations to the brave, fearless Alex for completing the challenge,” the island’s president, Lai Ching-te, wrote on his Facebook page.“Through Netflix’s live broadcast cameras, the world didn’t just see Taipei 101 – it also saw the warmth and passion of the Taiwanese people, and the beautiful hills and scenery of this land.”There is a long tradition in the US of live-broadcast daredevil feats, from Evel Knievel’s motorcycle jumps in the 1970s to Red Bull’s modern-day record attempts.Honnold is not the first climber to ascend Taipei 101, but he is the first to do so without a rope. France’s Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004 as part of the grand opening of what was then the world’s tallest building.Robert, who was covering Honnold’s ascent for CNN,offered his congratulationson Sunday, saying he could understand what he must be feeling. “For me, it felt incredible. Although I was not risking my life because I had a rope, the weather conditions were so horrible it took me four hours.“I know Alex, all along I was confident … I didn’t worry at all.”Taipei 101, which dominates the city’s skyline and is a major tourist attraction, was the tallest building in the world between 2004 and 2010 before being eclipsed by Dubai’s Burj Khalifa.Having a cheering crowd was unusual and a bit unnerving at first for Honnold, whose climbs are usually in remote areas.“When I was leaving the ground, you’re like ‘oh it’s kind of intense, there’s so many people watching’,” he said. “But then honestly, they’re all wishing me well. I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.”The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section – the “bamboo boxes” that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.Explore more on these topicsSportNetflixTaiwanRock climbingAsia PacificShareReuse this content"

The US president’s sabre-rattling may also have shaken the faith of his own Republican party.Trump’s fleeting threat to conquer the Danish territory prompted the most strident Republican opposition to anything he has done since taking office a year ago. It came on the heels of challenges to his authority over military powers, healthcare legislation and theJeffrey Epstein files.The mini-rebellion suggests that a small but vocal minority ofRepublicansfeel increasingly emboldened to speak out against a 79-year-old leader who, for all his dominance of the party, is polling dismally and could drag them down in November’s midterm elections.“You’ve never had a president with this much influence and this much political and legislative success so in that sense he’s winning but his own party is starting to question and wonder out loud at what cost?” saidFrank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster. “He has been the most influential president since Franklin Roosevelt but the public and even people in his own party are starting to wonder whether it’s too much.”As the world finally punches back, was this the week Donald Trump went too far? | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreSpeculating over Trump’s grip on the Republican party, and whether it shows any sign of slipping, has been a political sport for a decade, producing many false dawns along the way. Dissenting senators and representatives such asLiz Cheneyhave been ruthlessly purged or made to feel they have no alternative but retirement.Trump’s biggest crisis came with his crushing defeat in the 2020 presidential election and a subsequent insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the US Capitol, prompting even loyalists such as Lindsey Graham and Kevin McCarthy to condemn him. But not even an attempted coup was enough to break the party’s cult-like fever.Much-hyped pretenders to the crown such as the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis,could not competeand, when Trump roared back from four criminal cases to win the 2024 presidential election, Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives and Senate and felt vindicated in sticking with their idol.For much of Trump’s first year in office they gave the president such free rein on government downsizing, immigration enforcement and trade tariffs that critics said Congress had abdicated its responsibility, in effect setting up Trump as a monarch.But there have been blips. In Novemberfour House Republicans– Marjorie Taylor Greene, Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace – took a rare stand against Trump by signing a discharge petition to force a vote to release federal files related to sex offender Epstein.Despite months of lobbying against the release, Trump abruptly changed course and announced his support for the bill after it became clear the vote would succeed with potentially dozens of Republicans joining Democrats in support.Greene, once among Trump’s staunchest allies, resigned from Congress and accused the president of betraying his “America First” base and prioritising elites over his supporters’ concerns. In aNew York Times Magazine profile, she described herself as “naive” for initially believing Trump was a true “man of the people”.Earlier this month more than a dozen House Republicans defied leadership by voting for aDemocratic billto extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years without any restrictions. The party has also been scrambling in both chambers to narrowly fend off war powers resolutions intended to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in military action overseas.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to reporters on Air Force One after his climbdown over Greenland at Davos, on Thursday.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersMeanwhile Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the most vulnerable of this year’s Republican incumbents,has criticised“excessive” tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including wearing masks and targeting immigrants without criminal records, which she said have been ordered by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.Tara Setmayer, co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, perceived fractures. “I don’t think it’s as ironclad as it once was, evidenced by the Massies and the Marjorie Taylor Greenes and a few others who have begun to question the America First commitment of Donald Trump. Before, you wouldn’t have seen any of that; now you’re starting to see pockets of it.”She added: “Whether that’s culminates into a larger rebellion remains to be seen because it is a midterm election year and these politicians want to stay in office so they’re going to continue to watch how the public reacts to Donald Trump’s decision-making and behaviour, which has been rather alarming and erratic. He’s showing signs of wear, his age – all of those things combined are becoming more difficult for rank-and-file Republicans to defend and the polling shows that.”Few Republicans publicly dissented from the successful operation to capture Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela and many actively cheered it. But Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about seizingGreenland– threatening tariffs on European allies and refusing to rule out taking it by force – was seen by some as a bridge too far.The Republican senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats ona bipartisan trip to Denmark. Other Republicans took part in meetings in Washington with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.Murkowski and others pushed legislation that would prohibit Pentagon funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other Nato members without their consent. On the Senate floor, the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned that any attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies” and tarnish Trump’s legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.Tillis directed his criticism at Trump advisers such as the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, rather than the president himself. “The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.The most outspoken was Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska, who told the Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenlandwould lead to Trump’s impeachment– something he would “lean” towards supporting.It was notable, however, that McConnell, Tillis and Bacon have all announced that they will retire at the end of their current terms and therefore had little to lose by alienating Trump. Indeed the number of Republicans who broke ranks was perhaps less striking than the number who remained silent.Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Given the gravity of Trump’s behaviour and the global consequences of his decision-making just in the last few weeks, the fact that there hasn’t been a Republican rebellion once again speaks volumes about the cowardice that got us into this position in the first place.View image in fullscreenSusan Collins, who criticised Donald Trump this week, is seen as the most vulnerable Senate Republican in November’s midterm elections.Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP“He has to be reined in and the only people who can rein him in are the Republicans in Congress. Even with them facing electoral slaughter in November, they have yet to come together and work with Democrats to rein in Donald Trump.”An Emerson Collegenational poll this weekfound that 43% of likely voters approve of the job Trump is doing while 51% disapprove. Looking ahead to the midterms, 48% support the Democratic candidate on the generic congressional ballot and 42% plan on voting for the Republican candidate.Trump himself is barred by the constitution from running for president again. Several shops that sell Trump campaign merchandise have recently announced thatthey are closing down. Next year the Republican political conversation will inexorably turn to the search for his successor, rendering him a lame duck with diminishing influence over the party.Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said:“I don’t see a lot of evidence that many Republicans are willing to break publicly with him. But there’s clearly a sense of unease spreading in Republican ranks as they contemplate running for election or re-election in an environment defined by increasing public discontent with the Trump presidency as revealed by all the standard indices.“If the traditional relationship between presidential approval and the party’s fortunes in the midterm elections holds true then the Republicans are in for a rough November. They know that. They can’t break with the president but they can subtly distance themselves from him and I suspect that, unless the president’s numbers pick up substantially, that is exactly what they’re going to do.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS politicsGreenlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just under half (45%) of UK office workers surveyed believed AI would benefit companies more than employees.Younger workers, particularly thosebelonging to gen Z– born between 1997 and 2012 – were the most concerned about the impact of AI and their ability to adapt, while baby boomers – born in the postwar years between 1946 and 1964 and nearing the end of their careers – showed greater self-assurance.Higher levels of concern expressed by young people entering the workforce could stem from the decision of many business leaders,highlighted by separate research, to invest in AI to plug skills gaps through automation instead of training up new hires. This is adding to the challenges facing younger workers at a time when thelabour market is cooling.Increased use of AI and automation in businesses is increasingly replacing “low-complexity, transactional roles”, the survey showed, which could help to address labour shortages in certain industries through boosting productivity.About half (55%) of UK workers surveyed said AI had made a positive impact on their productivity, a view echoed by employers.“AI is not a rival to labour; it should be seen as key to augmenting tasks and highlighting the importance of roles that only people can do,” said Sander van ‘t Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad.“We must close the ‘AI reality gap’. While businesses race to embrace a new way of working, our data shows that one in five talent believe AI will have a limited impact on their tasks and nearly half perceive it as more beneficial to the company than themselves. This leaves them vulnerable in both their careers and the value they can add to organisations.”The pace of adoption of AI in the workplace is also having an impact on workers around the world. Four in five workers believe AI will affect their daily work tasks, while the survey found that job vacancies requiring “AI agent” skills had risen by 1,587% over the past year.Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US bank JP Morgan, told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week that governments and businesses would have tostep in to help workerswhose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk “civil unrest”.Explore more on these topicsBusinessAI (artificial intelligence)Work & careersJob lossesComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Common advice like “limiting individual youth access to screens”, or asking parents to keep tabs on their children’s every digital movement is “not only impossible, but for adolescents in particular, potentially invasive”, Schleider said.Instead, the AAP is “putting more emphasis on the structural responsibility of companies and society”, Schleider said. Their statement recommends regulations that limit “overt, sexualized, commercialised, or harmful content to youth”, including algorithms that send teens and children down rabbit holes with damaging themes.This guidance is also more nuanced than recent moves towards outright social media bans for certain age groups. Last month, Australiaimposed a ban on all social media accountsfor youth under 16.Schleider says the ban is “very unfortunate” because while social media platforms are indeed designed in a harmful way, bans do nothing to make those platforms safer.“Social media is the first and often only place that young people seek out help and support, and cutting that off immediately with no warning has really adverse consequences,” she said.Inher own research, Schleider has found that youth who need mental health treatment are more likely to get access in states that do not require parental consent. This is one example of why, in Schleider’s view, it’s healthier for teens to have some level of autonomy in their digital lives.The AAP policy statement does include advice for parents and other caregivers, including to track digital habits for the entire family and set parental controls.Dr Tiffany Munzer, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at the University of Michigan, and lead author of the statement, said “it’s hard to monitor screens 24/7,” but recommends “checking in intermittently to see what kids are doing.”Teri McKean, director of crisis support operation for the National Alliance on Mental Illness in Chicago, has four children between nine and 24. She uses a Google parental control system that monitors her thirteen year old’s phone so that she has to ask before she can download any apps, and that flags “any content that could be considered problematic in any of her communications”. The system also sets limits on screentime.But McKean doesn’t just rely on apps to monitor her children’s behavior—she talks to them about it too.“Every day it’s like, Mom, can I have Snapchat? Mom, can I have Instagram? And I say, you spend enough time on your phone anyway,” McKean said. Her thirteen year old acknowledges this.Keeping the conversation open is essential, Munzer emphasized.“Ask kids, what did you like about that [game]? Did you see any ads on the screen? And that just creates a little bit of an opening into the window of what a child’s experience is,” Munzer said, noting that it’s important to “build these lines of communication early on”, not only to help parents understand their children’s digital worlds, but to build stronger relationships with them. Looking at social media as a group activity can also make it less isolating and strengthen bonds.McKean enjoys watching social media videos with her kids: “TheKPop Demon Huntersdad videosarereally funny. Dads are really into the music, we all enjoy laughing at that.”While Ben Blair, a Chicago based educator with children aged 10 and 14, said he values communication, certain topics are tough to bring up. He hesitates to tell his teen son about sexploitation, in which adults manipulate minors, usually boys, into sharing explicit images for blackmail purposes.He talks openly with his son about sexual consent, but a conversation about sexploitation would be “such a stark reminder that he is entering a place in time where he’ll no longer be insulated from evil. There’s a profound feeling that there are pieces of his childhood that will never come back,” Blair said.Munzer and Schleider both agreed that it can feel impossible for parents to make the right decisions in today’s digital climate. That’s why they believe policymakers should put more energy into holding digital media companies accountable for the harm they cause to minors, and into making sure children have access to safe “third places” like after school activities and green spaces.“The system is set up for parents to fail no matter what they choose to do. And by the system, I mean how these social media, apps and online spaces are architected to keep eyeballs there,’ and “Not to protect young people’s well being,” Schleider said.For Blair, letting go feels irresponsible. He said if you compare smartphones to cars, it’s the parent’s job to “be the seatbelts, even when they’re terribly uncomfortable… I hope all parents can kind of own that, that it sucks to be the seat belt.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

So what are the psychological – and political – impediments?Paul SagarSun 25 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareRight now, about 7,000 people are awaiting a kidney transplant in the UK. According to NHS figures, in 2024/25 only 3,302 adult kidney transplants were performed. The charityKidney Research UK states that“just 32% of patients receive a transplant within a year of joining the waiting list and six people die every week while waiting.”People who experience kidney failure need either lifelong dialysis or a transplant to survive. Yet even for those lucky enough to get a transplant, that is by no means the end of the story. Kidneys from deceased donors last an average of 10 to 15 years, those from a living person 20 to 25. If (or rather, when) a transplant fails, the affected patient once again needs dialysis or a donated organ.The UK is not unusual in having far more people who need kidneys than there are kidneys available. Every country in the world has this problem. With one exception: Iran.What is different about Iran? It is the only state that has legalised the sale of kidneys. This began in 1988, and means the country has no waiting lists. You can expect topay about $5,000for a new kidney, subject to a price cap adjusted for inflation and enforced by the government. (By contrast, a kidney bought on the black market elsewhere cancost up to $120,000.) The proceeds go to the donor, who can be a friend or family relative, or just somebody who needs the money and happens to be a biological match. Indeed, in Iran most people who donate kidneys have no direct relation to the person receiving the organ. They are just doing it for the cash.The fact something generates icky feelings is not a good reason to make it illegalWhat are the lessons we might take from this? Should the UK likewise legalise the sale of kidneys? After all, if the aim is to get kidneys to people who need them, the Iranian experience proves that their system works. Currently the demand for kidneys vastly exceeds legal supply. This is because supply relies entirely on altruism, which is very limited. (Don’t believe me? Well, why haven’t you given one of yours away? After all, a healthy adult needs only one.) A straightforward way to resolve this is to increase incentives for supply. Stop appealing simply to altruism, appeal to self-interest. Don’t ask people to give their kidneys away for free – offer topaythem.It perhaps goes without saying that this suggestion is controversial. But how justified is that? It turns out that the main arguments against legalising the sale of kidneys aren’t very robust. One common objection is that the poor will be exploited. After all, who (other than the unusually altruistic) would sell a kidney, unless they felt theyneededto, because of dire financial pressures? Accordingly, a ban on the sale of kidneys might be thought necessary to protect the financially vulnerable.There are major problems with this line of reasoning, though. It’s all well and good telling people that they are being protected from “exploitation” by market forces, but that rings hollow if we are not simultaneously doing anything to make them financially better off in other ways – as is usually the case.Why pleasure is the key to self-improvementRead moreThere is something odd about claiming to be concerned about the plight of the poor while denying them straightforward measures to ameliorate their poverty. Similarly, if one worries that dishonest and exploitative corporate actors will not treat donors properly, that is an argument forregulation,not prohibition: ensuring the market operates in ways that protect participants – as appears to have been achieved in Iran.Another line of objection is that there is something sacred about human bodies, which should not be traded as commodities. But sacred according to whom? Those with religious dispositions may feel this way. But why should they get to decide what those without such beliefs may do with their body parts? Especially when there are thousands suffering and dying?More generally, there is the question of why the government should have the right to control individual choices in this matter. Given that people are allowed to give away kidneys for free, why should the state have any say in whether the same action can be performed for money?Here, people often fall back on an appeal to feeling. Many have a strong sense that it is somehow just wrong to sell organs. And as it happens, I share this feeling. For want of a better word, the idea of people selling their organs feels icky. Yet the fact something generates icky feelings is not necessarily a good reason to make it illegal. This becomes especially clear when we consider how changeable such feelings are across times and cultures.In the 18th century, for example, some viewed being paid to sing as akin to prostitution, and professional opera singers, particularly women, could be deemed morally suspect. At that time, therefore, it might have seemed appropriate to subject professional singing to legal strictures, just like prostitution. To us, such a proposition seems absurd. What this tells us is that such feelings very much can and do shift – indicating that they are reflective of local cultural variation, not some underlying moral truth.What we really need to consider is whether a practice that makes us feel uncomfortable is sufficiently important that those feelings must take a back seat when it comes to legalisation. What should be given more weight: personal queasiness at the idea of kidneys being for sale, or the lives of people who desperately need kidney transplants? It is, quite literally, a life-and-death question.But it is also a question of politics. The Iranian regime legalised the sale of kidneys in response to a domestic health crisis: with failing infrastructure more people were dying of renal failure or attempting to secure transplants overseas. Iran was able to undertake this momentous change in part because the regime was able to disregard the moral objections of Iranian citizens. Would I be comfortable if a UK government did the same?Here I feel queasy once again. Yet this time the queasiness is well grounded: discomfort with unilateral state power is essential to a free society. If people can decide through democratic means that a market in kidneys is desirable, then so be it. But if enacting such a change is only achievable through authoritarianism, then the cost is surely too high.Dr Paul Sagar is reader in political theory at King’s College London.Further readingKidney for Sale By Owner: Human Organs, Transplantation, and the Marketby Mark J Cherry (Georgetown, £19)How Death Becomes Life: Notes from a Transplant Surgeonby Joshua Mezrich (Atlantic, £10.99)Being Mortal: Illness, Medicine, and What Matters in the Endby Atul Gawande (Profile, £8.99)Explore more on these topicsHealthThe big ideafeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s body horror Saccharine, about a diet craze that involves eating human ashes, midnight movieBuddy, about a Barney-esque kids TV star who starts murdering children and then there’s Mum, I’m Alien Pregnant which, well, you can probably imagine.Josephine review – Channing Tatum is a knockout in shattering drama of lost innocenceRead moreBut the annual “wait, what?” prize easily goes to offbeat fable Wicker, the story of a smelly spinster fisherwoman who commissions herself a husband made of, that’s right, wicker. While the film does have its expected amount of audience-provoking moments – wicker-fucking bringing the most noise both on and off the screen – to its credit, there’s an attempt to give us more than just easy shock value, something that can’t always be said for films in this often tedious category. Writer-directors Alex Huston Fischer and Eleanor Wilson, who previously brought mostly likeable alien invasion comedy Save Yourselves! to the festival, use their far-out premise to touch upon more of-our-world issues like the patriarchal cruelty of marriage and the special fury reserved for those who dare to live outside of the accepted rules. They succeed in brief flashes but ultimately, there’s too much here that doesn’t gel, a tonally uneven mix of mostly unfunny bawdy humour, dark fantasy and unlikely romance, too much wood but not enough fire.Olivia Colman, who has had mixed results at Sundance ranging from The Father to Jimpa, is Fisherwoman, whose smell is as remarked upon as her singledom. She’s largely immune to the insults though, happily removed from the archaic gender roles that curse the local village. But after she sneers through another comically awful wedding, the jabs start to have an effect and rather than laughing it away, she asks the local basket-maker (Peter Dinklage, forever seeming like he’s on the verge of breaking into song) to make her a husband. A month later, he arrives.There’s admirable ambition to the film-making, an intricately built world that meshes mostly old with bits of the new. Like many a fairytale, it’s a society built around the importance of men and the deference of women. Men are known by their profession and women by their relationship to their husband. The wedding ritual sees the man not offer his wife a ring but insist a collar upon her. Fisherwoman’s flagrant refusal to play by the rules, to take charge of her own life as breadwinner, throws the community into disarray. The women, led by Elizabeth Debicki’s spiralling queen bee, are both horrified and perhaps a little jealous, maybe even aroused by her new husband, played byAlexander Skarsgårdin impressively handsome wicker (the effects work here is top notch). The men are worried about what his sexual and domestic perfection means for them and how their wives see them. Can anyone be happy anymore?The central relationship is taken seriously enough for us to want more than we’re ultimately given. His arrival asks so many questions – what does he know, what does he want, what does she need, what was she missing – yet their early scenes are mostly based around comically vigorous sex (questions about splinters are also never answered) rather than any real development. He’s a commission designed to love her but there’s no exploration of what this means for their relationship and any agency he might want or need. These might sound like silly thoughts to have while watching a film like this but we’re meant to be emotionally invested in what happens. When conflict comes it’s mostly simple and soapy – has he shagged anyone else in town – and while there’s an effective scene of Colman breaking down while explaining the difficulties of sharing a life that had previously been lived alone (she remains one of our great criers) it’s too little too late. We don’t know anything of his reaction to the world or who he really is, just his blind devotion to her and when tragedy inevitably strikes, there’s just no real attachment to any of it. I was thinking about how invested I was in the admittedly more dramatic but even less verbal relationship between Sally Hawkins and the fish man in The Shape of Water. There are ways to make us care in fantastically odd romances such as this, I just don’t think Fischer and Wilson were able to find them.It’s hard to imagine many other working actors taking on the fisherwoman role, Colman often seeming like the rare actor whose career has allowed certain films to exist. I haven’t loved her choices of late (The Roses, Jimpa, Wicked Little Letters) but she’s never less then entirely devoted to often far-out bits and she gives this her all even though I wish the script afforded her more depth. She knows how to oscillate between broad comedy and heart-wrenching drama but the film around her isn’t as adept. Like the dream husband at its centre, Wicker looks the part but there’s nothing underneath.Wicker is screening at the Sundance film festivalExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewOlivia ColmanAlexander SkarsgårdElizabeth DebickiPeter DinklageComedy filmsSundance film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

A young creative couple, an actor and a dancer, coolly take in a performance from a band of street musicians. “This country is so full of artists,” the man, Ali (Farzad Karen), says to Hanna (Hana Mana). She replies warily: “Let’s see if they stay like this.”The remark is delivered casually in Maryam Ataei and Hossein Keshavarz’s stirring new film The Friend’s House Is Here, sprinkled in between airy banter and snippets of various rehearsals, but it’s no trivial matter. Under Iran’s theocratic regime, creative expression is a risky and unstable endeavor. The government tightly polices the contents of all art – visual works, theater, music, film, literature – for strict adherence to state ideology. Failure to receive a permit could result in fines, imprisonment or banishment. The colorful characters amiably populating this loose, organic film, played by a collective of real-life underground artists and improv actors, are liable to be harassed, fined, arrested or disappeared at any moment.Josephine review – Channing Tatum is a knockout in shattering drama of lost innocenceRead moreSo, too, were the film-makers, who operated without government permission, necessitating all outdoor scenes to be recorded in one or two takes to avoid arrest. Their defiant 96-minute film, whose cast were denied visas to attend itsSundancepremiere, was still in post-production when the regime enforced anear-total internet blackoutto dampernationwide protests, forcing the crew to smuggle it out of the country.All of this looms uneasily and implicitly over the proceedings, flickering beneath its scenes of group conviviality and frequent use of an unspecified, ominous “they”. But The Friend’s House Is Here is far from dour, suspicious or even expressly political. This is, against great odds and surely some western expectations, a beguiling hangout film – an invitation to the dinner party, a fascinating window into a group of underground artists who carry on despite the risks, a representation of creativity under surveillance. A snapshot of everyday resistance, the fight for a freedom from the bottom up.And most effectively, a moving portrait of one nutritive, symbiotic friendship in transition. Pari (Mahshad Bahram), an art gallerist by trade and an underground dramatist by heart, and Hanna, the dancer, are the type of roommates who bleed into each other despite their differences – the former more structured and practical, the latter, with her Marilyn Monroe bob and pearls, a flashy, chaotic bohemian. The film takes an unusually elliptical approach to their entanglement, tossing neatly constructed snippets of their intimacy – painting each other’s nails, dashing through the streets, mutually mocking a woman who shames their lack of hijabs – like breadcrumbs. Bahram and Mana, both one degree away from their characters in real life, slip naturally into the duo’s breezy, syncopated rhythm; the women are never more compelling than with each other.Still, the pace of these slice-of-life vignettes is so relaxed as to seem at times stuck in a holding pattern – though that is, to be fair, true to the experience of the characters, whose ambitions are curbed within the many limbos of oppressive governance. Hanna waits for a visa to France; Pari works within an illegal underground. It’s an “uncertain time”. Every creative breakthrough is also a risk, all within a recurring visual motif of purgatory – disorientingly white spaces, repeated compositions, cameras circling around the characters. The latter slyly invokes the omnipresent specter of state surveillance, as does the film’s habit of lulling the viewer with informal, imprecise small talk, only to disorient them with a confusing jump-cut (is this real or imaginary? Flashback or flash forward?). More than once, I found myself lost, looking for guidance where there is none.Wicker review – Olivia Colman is smelly fisherwoman falling for wicker man in uneven fableRead moreBut holding patterns eventually break. The rupture – without spoiling too much, an arrest – comes suddenly and quietly and perhaps too late, as it invigorates the at times too baggy meanderings with acute purpose, and infuses the central relationship with real, pressing questions. (Most distressing: stay, or leave?) Still, The Friend’s House is Here resists over-structuring its political critique; the high drama of incarceration and state-inflicted trauma are the subject of a different film (perhaps, say,exiled auteurJafar Panahi’sIt Was Just An Accident, nominated for two Oscars this year). Instead, Ataei and Keshavarz remain doggedly focused on the smallest units of community and acts of care under authoritarianism, the softness, vitality and uncelebrated expressiveness of Persian people so rarely afforded view to western audiences.The film’s clear-eyed optimism – that at the very least, there is still creative joy and community to be found on the margins – feels bittersweet, as the regime continues itsbrutal crackdownon protestersthat is nowestimatedto have killed more than 5,000 people, many of them similarly young, restless and idealistic. At the film’s Sundance premiere, Keshavarz choked up as he revealed that an ensemble actor from the film had recently been shot in the face by authorities, and risked losing vision in their eye. These unceremoniously heroic characters, one imagines, would be out there, too – keeping the light for each other, looking toward a better future.The Friend’s House is Here is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewDrama filmsIranSundance film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A rigorously well-directed, genuinely funny, relatably messy look at two couples dealing with the maelstrom of non-monogamy, it was the kind of smart, well-crafted film for adults we are constantly complaining we don’t get enough of.I had a similar thrill watching The Invite at its sold-outSundancepremiere on Saturday night. Like that film, it is also about two adult couples negotiating anxieties surrounding sex with other people – and also like that film, it’s really, consistently funny and stylishly directed, made with the kind of care and rigidity that comedies just aren’t afforded now. It doesn’t have the same absurdist slapstick streak – it’s much more of this world – but it made me feel equally energised, a reminder that maybe that mid-sized movie gap is finally being filled. I just hope more people see this one.Wicker review – Olivia Colman is smelly fisherwoman falling for wicker man in uneven fableRead moreMore people probably will, given the star power: the two couples are played bySeth RogenandOlivia Wilde(married and miserable) andPenélope CruzandEdward Norton(unmarried and happy). The film even starts with a leading Oscar Wilde quote – “One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.” – teasing a night that Edward Albee would approve of. The film is also directed by Wilde, her third film after fizzy teen comedyBooksmartand beautiful yet maddeningly stupid thrillerDon’t Worry Darling. She is an actor who hasn’t always found her groove but has quickly become an impressively committed film-maker who collaborates with the finest craftspeople (even when the Don’t Worry Darling script made me want to roll my eyes, I was worried about missing something visually) – and The Invite marks a notably exciting new high for her.It’s a mostly one-location comedy, but Wilde shoots on 35mm (!) and works with Dev Hynes (Blood Orange) on the score, as well as four-time Oscar nominee Arianne Phillips on costumes, Yorgos Lanthimos editor Yorgos Mavropsaridis, and cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra, who previously brought an epic sweep to The Last Black Man in San Francisco and, coincidentally, Splitsville. Not that the sharp and fastidious script from Rashida Jones and Will McCormack needed such elevation to distract (this is no Don’t Worry Darling), but it just gives the film this wonderfully glossy,classicfeeling – a given decades ago but a miracle now.A remake of Spanish comedy The People Upstairs (which has previously been remade four times internationally), it focuses on one disastrous hangout as the married couple downstairs invites the freewheeling couple from upstairs over for drinks. Joe (Rogen) is an unhappy music professor who prefers not to talk about his failed music career, instead focusing on an unending trail of complaints, and as we meet him, he’s complaining about an invite he wasn’t aware of. His wife, Angela (Wilde), is desperate to impress, deeply proud of the jamón she brought for Spanish Pina (Cruz) who she is already jealous of, not just for her effortless sexuality but for the many times she has heard her orgasm through the ceiling (Pina later tells Joe it’s prosciutto and he tells her to keep it to herself as Angela will “commit suicide” if she finds out). Joe is less jealous of the impossibly named Hawk (Norton) – he’s more irritated, but the couple represents a sexually liberated ideal that seems out of reach at this stage of marriage. Maybe tonight is the night to change that.Sundance 2026: the 10 films not to miss at this year’s festivalRead moreThe film does take time to settle. The initial stretch of Rogen and Wilde sniping before their guests arrive is at such a high pitch that I worried the film would be as exhaustingly unrelenting. Some of Wilde’s early directorial choices are a little too fussy, as if she is desperate to let us know that we’re not watching some staid, shoulda-been-a-play chamberpiece. But the pace and the film-making soon relax, and as uncomfortable as the sparring might often be, there is such a graceful expansion of the space and such elegant style to how it all glides that we’re never suffocated. Rather than wanting to leave or at least crack open a window, I found myself eager to stay for longer.There is nimble choreography to how everyone quips, crosstalks, interrupts and trails off, the kind of film that could be easily mistaken as semi-improvised were you not listening intently to the carefully crafted, detail-packed dialogue. Every aside reveals something, (almost) every joke lands, and every actor is working intently at making every moment count (Joe’s sad, reflective face after he refuses to play music for Pina; Angela’s quiet excitement after Hawk suggests tequila). Even if Rogen is playing a barely tweaked version of a type he does often, he is so good at it that we don’t care, while it’s a pleasure to see Cruz and Norton cut loose, the former especially funny as a sexologist who can’t stop meddling. But as director and actor, this is Wilde’s triumph. This past week, she was the vampy saving grace of Gregg Araki’s Sundance sex farceI Want Your Sex, and now she has gifted us with another excellent yet entirely different comedic performance (nervy and unsure without being over-mannered) and the kind of crackling, laugh-to-cringe couples comedy that many of us have been missing.Josephine review – Channing Tatum is a knockout in shattering drama of lost innocenceRead moreIt’s too easy to compare this to a Woody Allen vintage – sophisticated pitter-patter dialogue over wine – especially as that has often become more of a putdown (nothing more uncomfortable than someone trying to limply emulate his style) but there are shades of his best work here. Wilde knows, along with Jones and McCormack, how much we all vicariously enjoy watching couples spar, and it’s impossible not to insert ourselves into the night, turning us all into deeply invested football commentators. Joe and Angela’s rehearsed sitcom schtick has become their learned norm, but when played out in front of others, they start to see how nasty and fatiguing it can seem. As the jokes start to sour and the night shifts to something more serious, Wilde and her dramatically experienced ensemble are able to handle a difficult tonal descent without slipping. I was worried how she would close things out – do we go high or low? – but she nails it, a delicately sad final scene that had theSundanceaudience on their feet applauding. It seems that the chance to watch a genuinely funny and uncommonly intelligent comedy for adults is an invite we have all been waiting for.The Invite is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewSundance film festivalFestivalsOlivia WildeSeth RogenPenélope CruzEdward NortonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Played by equally remarkable newcomer Mason Reeves, Josephine likes playing soccer with her dad Damien (a phenomenal Channing Tatum), with whom she is close – the film’s crisp, near wordless opening minutes, which shift seamlessly from Josephine’s perspective to third party co-conspirator, running with the pair through San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, swiftly convey a tender, playful bond: supportive, teasing father and innocent child.Leviticus review – queer desire is a deadly curse in haunting horrorRead moreThat’s about all we know of Josephine – all we need to know, really – before seeing the incident that ruptures her youth. Having run ahead of her father at the park, Josephine alone witnesses the brutal rape of a female jogger by a man in a distinctive aqua polo. Much to the audible shock of viewers at the Sundance premiere, de Araújo rejects the ellipsis now de rigueur in movies handling sexual assault, how much ofpost-MeToo cinema– Promising Young Woman, She Said, Women Talking, last year’s SundancestandoutSorry, Baby– have skipped over or elided the actual assault, de-emphasizing violence and allowing viewers to fill in the blanks.Not here. We witness all of what Josephine witnesses from her position behind a tree – the screaming, the struggle, every ghastly step of the rape – as well as Josephine herself; cinematographer Greta Zozula captures both the crime and the child’s cherubic face, shaded by both fear and curiosity, in equally naturalistic light. The arresting sequence makes a necessary point: what is beyond appalling to adults is absolutely baffling to the budding mind of a child – intuitively wrong, yes, but also fascinating, alien. To understand Josephine’s confusion and anger, why she begins to act erratically and aggressively, you need to know exactly what horror she replays in her head, trying to comprehend.This is admittedly a lot of setup for an exquisitely sensitive film – the standout drama of Sundance so far — that is predominantly about aftermath, with a solidGemma Chanand a career-best Tatum as her well-meaning but ill-equipped parents. But the intensity of the incident is key, for it underscores the inadequacy of every adult’s response. The police who immediately respond to Damien’s 911 call ignore her, put her in the cop car with the shattered victim (Syra McCarthy) and allow her to see the arrested perpetrator (Philip Ettinger); the camera’s searching gaze – on the woman’s scraped knee, on the man’s near-defiant expression – suggests seared memories. Her mother, sweet and willowy, tries vague platitudes, distractions, psychotherapy (which is inexplicably dropped before any sessions). Her father, a self-described “physical guy”, takes her to self-defense classes. Neither explain to Josephine, who does not know what sex is, what she saw.De Araújo has a keen ear for the maxims and reflexes parents use to defend themselves – “that will never, ever happen to you”, Damien unhelpfully responds when Josephine asks if it will happen to her. And she manages a tricky balance, between sketching in the stymied adults’ triggered responses, and hewing closely to Josephine, who, in an effectively creepy flourish, sees the man from the park in her room at night, especially after she’s called in a trial witness.That balances wobbles occasionally, particularly in the film’s overstretched final third. Wordless sequences of Miles Ross’s score, pulsating with Josephine’s unprocessed feelings, lose their potency with time. Chan is not given many notes beyond concern, ranging from mild to abject; brief moments that suggest her personal experience with the subject, such as a car ride in which Josephine asks if she’s ever been raped, are subtle to the point of too understated. But by and large, de Araújo manages to believably steer the bruised family through near-horror into a bravura final courtroom scene. There’s a chilling but thankfully restrained horror to Josephine’s inward retreat, as her inchoate anger boils over in increasingly erratic, alarming ways.It’s a feat not possible without Reeves – a rare natural, able to both hold her own and disappear into herself – and especially Tatum, whose effortless naturalism somehow still feels underrated and who is simply astonishing as a father far out of his depth. As a movie star, Tatum embodies a certain brand of familiar yet aspirational American masculinity, a hunky, charming everyman. It’s a pleasure, then, to see him take on one of the more fascinating paternal characters in recent memory, a father whose good and bad parenting instincts often coexist within the same sentence, whose confidence in himself and his convictions crumbles in inverse relation with his daughter’s, who must reckon with his own limitations and fear. There’s a beguiling if flawed heart to his Damien – from another actor of his stature, a late-stage scene in which he finally erupts on Josephine could seem menacing, distancing. But Tatum manages to ground the viewer in his abject bewilderment and pain.It’s a instantly memorable performance in a haunting movie, one that I have carried with me in the hours since I’ve seen it. Perhaps that is the best thing I can say about this remarkable feature – for its viewers, as it is for its meticulously rendered subject, the disquiet lingers.Josephine is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewSundance film festivalChanning TatumDrama filmsFestivalsGemma ChanreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was British musicologist Deryck Cooke who first took a proper look, discovering that crucial melodic lines were intact throughout the entire work. His subsequent lithe-limbed “performing version” has been embraced by many – but some have adopted a more interventionist approach, the most popular being Russian conductorRudolf Barshai, whose audacious completion Vladimir Jurowski presented here.As Jurowski admits, Barshai’s orchestrations bring the music closer to Shostakovich and perhaps Britten – both huge fans of Mahler. On its own terms it succeeds, though for those familiar with Cooke’s version it’s a bit of a culture shock. Where the Englishman deployed restraint and a scrupulously Mahlerian palette, in the movements the composer left most incomplete – the second, fourth and fifth – Barshai slathers on the colour. There’s a clattering xylophone, a guitar (miraculously audible amid the orchestral melee), a Wagner tuba, a cornet, a second tuba to beef up the most terrifying passages, a second harp, celesta, woodblocks, tubular bells and a trio of tiny gongs. That these diverse timbral details came over loud and clear was a testament to Jurowski’s textural lucidity and the outstanding playing of the LPO.View image in fullscreenOutstanding playing: the London Philharmonic.Photograph: Mark AllanWe know that Mahler was wrestling with the discovery of his wife’s affair with a young architect while working on the symphony because he etched his anguished thoughts into the very pages of the score. His inner turmoil may even have affected the order of the movements. Jurowski brought out much of that pain, leaning into the gut-wrenching dissonances that burst in upon the serene Adagio. If the fourth movement lost some of its surgical edge, the souped-up Scherzo sparkled and the central Purgatorio was an oasis of ambiguous calm. The funereal finale, with its thwack of offstage drum and desolate flute solo, bore witness to a deftly handled transition from darkness to light. Whether it was Jurowski or Barshai, Mahler’s ultimate glimmer of reconciliation and forgiveness has seldom felt so certain.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicVladimir JurowskiLondon Philharmonic OrchestraSouthbank CentrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s ironic that it’s a song about redemption when you’re being told to clean the house.The song I do at karaokeYou need to have a song that everyone knows, so they can help you sing along, so I’d go for Angels by Robbie Williams or Wonderwall by Oasis.The song I know every lyric toI remember hearing Boombastic by Shaggy in a Wallace and Gromit-style Plasticine advert for Levi’s 501s in the 90s, in an advert break during The Big Breakfast, as I was getting ready to go to school. I loved the lyrics, although I didn’t know what he was talking about because I was only a kid.The song I can no longer listen toIt’s not so much I’ve rinsed it, but Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond felt like it became a vibe during the last [men’s] Euros.

She discusses love, sex and famous fansSun 25 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareMadeleine Gray remembers the first time she had an inkling that her debut novel might become a big deal. When she received news of her advance from her agent, she was “expecting a pittance”; the number was in the six figures. “I thought: holy fuck, there’s been a mistake,” the 31-year-old author laughs. “By the time Green Dot was published last autumn, it had already been hailed as one of the most anticipated novels of the year, and was quickly beloved, drawing comparisons with Bridget Jones, Fleabag and Annie Ernaux. Nigella Lawson and Gillian Anderson posted praise for the book.Were those celebrity endorsements exciting, I ask her. “I’m gay,” she replies, her enthusiasm leaping through the screen; “are you kidding?!I follow Gillian on Instagram, obviously.” When she saw Anderson post a selfie with the book, “the scream that came out of me was primal”.Gray is speaking to me from her Sydney apartment; a late evening sun illuminates the colourful arrangement of vases and books stacked on adjoining shelves. She is chatty and relaxed, her conversation peppered with flashes of humour, which is unsurprising given the profusion of comedy in her novels. Green Dot’s 24-year-old protagonist, Hera, is funny, mean, yet vulnerable, teetering on the knife edge of gen Z nihilism while trying desperately to believe insomething. In this case, that “something” is unfortunately a shy and elusive fortysomething married man with whom she has an affair. It’s a terrible idea, but as Hera, hopelessly self-aware to a fault, tells us: “What is lust, if not generosity persevering?”Gray is grateful for what has been a fairytale debut novel story, though one unforeseen outcome is that her Instagram inbox is filled with confessions from strangers about their extramarital affairs, including from men who tell her the book helped them understand their mistresses. “It’s difficult because I don’t want to be actively rude to anyone,” Gray says, but “I’m not a psychologist, and I shouldn’t be giving advice”. Besides, her novel isn’t an autobiography: “I made it up.” The success of the book also compounded the difficulty of second novel syndrome. “I spent a few months being very dramatically pained, [thinking] I don’t know how to write a book,” Gray says. Her wife, a musician, helped. “She has released many albums, and she said to me: darling, this will never go away. It’s not just your second book; every piece of art you create, you will feel the same way.”I think if my first book had had lesbians as its protagonists, I would have been pigeonholed as a ‘queer writer’Inspiration struck when Gray was having a conversation with a friend about a very thirtysomething topic: babies. Many of her friends, she says, want to have children but don’t have a romantic partner, and aren’t drawn to single parenting. She and her friend started to think: “Why don’t more people have babies with their platonic best friends? The saying goes: it takes a village to raise a family.”The result is her second novel, Chosen Family, which follows two childhood best friends, Eve and Nell, from their painful adolescence to becoming mothers in their 30s. In their case, attempts at platonic co-parenting are complicated by the fact that one party is desperately in love with the other, a nod to another phenomenon that inspired the book. “I myself as a queer person have experienced this – and every queer person I’ve ever met has – of having a really intense friendship breakup in high school,” Gray says. “And then years later, they look back and think: ‘Oh, I was probably in love with that person.’”A saga of life-changing friendship over the decades, the novel moves between several time frames. At a private girls’ school in Sydney in the 2000s, pin-ups of male heartthrobs from TV shows The OC and Gossip Girl fill the lockers, the popular girls are blond menaces and a lesbian is the worst thing someone can be. Cut to 2024 and a 30-year-old Eve has emerged as, Gray tells me, “the lesbian queen of inner west Sydney” while Nell tries to come to terms with her own queerness.“One of my favourite things in life and in literature is when a character meets their match. Finally there’s this magical thing where someone else sees the world as you do,” Gray says.While it can be seductive to imagine that alternative familial arrangements outside the heterosexual nuclear model can be automatically utopian, Gray’s novel complicates the picture by examining the shifting power dynamics between Nell and Eve against the backdrop of Sydney’s lesbian community (fans of Green Dot may spot a cameo from a side character in the new novel). “It’s a big move to name a book Chosen Family,” she says. “It’s a big term in the queer community, and has so many connotations of queer utopianism. I wanted to look at the idea that family is family, no matter what way it’s constructed. And sometimes when you treat your friends as family, you can treat them worse.”Gray attended a private girls’ school in Sydney, similar to the one in the book. The author, who is bisexual, “put my sexuality on hold until I left school” as “coming out was not a safe thing to do”. Writing the novel was an exercise in imagining what it would have been like if someone had been openly queer in that environment (the answer: “horrific”). The youngest of three children, she quickly fell in love with reading during long summers spent on the coast of New South Wales with her father, a barrister. An early lesson in fiction writing came in the final year of school: a story she wrote was awarded the highest marks in the state, but when excited friends and family asked to read it, she refused. “It was just so clearly ripped from my own life. I was quite bitchy about people I knew. It was a good lesson: you should really make things up.”Before she turned to writing novels, Gray was an academic and literary critic, and completed a master’s at Oxford before undertaking a PhD in English and American studies at Manchester. But her plans to live in the UK long-term were cut short when, nine months into her PhD, the pandemic arrived. “I was totally estranged, trying to do the hardest intellectual work that I’d yet done, in a bedroom that had no windows.” She flew back to Sydney, and completed her studies remotely. Soon after Green Dot was published, her life would change again: Gray became a stepmother to her now-wife’s toddler, which has “changed me in every way that could exist”.“It’s been trust-building for years,” she says. “When we met, he didn’t love me. I didn’t love him. Love is something we’ve made together, over time. We should talk about this more with step-parenting.” At the recent wedding, her stepson asked Gray: “Can I call you mama now?” She cried. “It was so cute. Something about the ceremony of [the day] clicked for him.” Becoming a parent has encouraged Gray to use multiple perspectives when writing fiction, “because every day I spend time with this little boy who has such a different way of seeing the world. Also, I write faster, because I don’t have as much time.”Gray is now a full-time writer, and is working on a novel set in a different time period, which she describes tantalisingly as “Germaine Greer meets Monty Python”. She is keen to resist categorisation. “I think if my first book had had lesbians as its protagonists, I would have been pigeonholed as a ‘queer writer’, and wouldn’t have the broader audience I wanted,” Gray says. The success of her debut gave her the confidence to write Chosen Family. That “it wouldn’t just be queer people who read it: that’s my dream for this book – that everyone can read it”. And the secret to her uninhibited writing? “I only ever write sex scenes in public,” she says. “There’s something about that intimacy, that charge, when the person opposite you is Googling KPIs. It feels naughty.” Gray is clearly having a lot of fun. “Writing this was kind of joyous,” she says. “I wanted to have a really beautiful queer time.”Chosen Family is published on 29 January (W&N).

Here’s another one marking the centenary, and, more resurrection than mimicry, it can’t help but be striking to anyone who grew up with the raconteur, diarist and Carry On star as a mainstay of British life. There are ever fewer of us around, mind you: this is “a boomer show”, Benson admits, as strong on nostalgia as it is on insight into what made Williams tick.Indeed the first act is more about what made 13-year-old Benson tick. In 1975, his winning entry in a Jackanory story competition was read by Williams on national TV. We see him relive the moment, mortified that he’d now be associated by school bullies with the campest man in the UK. Elsewhere in act one, Benson recounts his adolescent awakening as an exponent of funny voices, casually deploying his note-perfect Frankie Howerd, Sergeant Bilko and the entire cast ofDad’s Army.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sonja HorsmanIt’s a story that tends towards an explanation of Williams’ lifelong importance to Benson. But that explanation never comes. Instead, the second act features scenes from Williams’ life: a dazzling riff during an audience Q&A about the spiritual history of western civilization; a bleak dialogue with his elderly mum, with whom he was co-dependent; and a dinner with friends at an Italian restaurant. They comprise one day in Williams’ life, and the full spectrum of what made him both beloved and insufferable.The risk with depicting someone so thin-skinned, self-absorbed and permanently performing is that they come across like a bit of a bore. One feels for his fellow diners. Less might have been more of all Kenneth’s chat about haemorrhoids and diarrhoea. But Benson’s Williams is extraordinary: the vocal (and nasal) gymnastics a show in themselves; the facial contortions unmistakable, decades after the man’s death. And there is poignancy, too, in his evident fear of intimacy and feelings of worthlessness. It’s an arresting snapshot of an extraordinary man, and the time he (and a shrinking number of we) lived through.Atthe Arden theatre, Faversham, on 25 January;then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatreKenneth WilliamsCarry On filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

To do so obliquely risks minimising its urgency, but go head-on and you risk hectoring or slipping into cliche. In its UK premiere,Julia Wolfe’s oratorio unEarth ultimately tilted towards the latter, although it made some striking impressions on the way.Produced by Wolfe’s collectiveBang on a Can, unEarth was first performed in 2023 in New York. Wolfe developed some of its text with a local youth choir, who sang in the premiere. Here it was the Finchley Children’s Music Group on stage, ranged behind the BBCSO and conductor Martyn Brabbins along with the men of the BBC Singers and National Youth Voices. All sang from memory, and all were amplified – as was Else Torp, singing a solo line in a lean high soprano that dovetailed into the orchestral sounds.While the singers had moved around in the premiere, here they stayed put, largely leaving the visual spectacle to Lucy Mackinnon’s projections on to a circular screen hanging moonlike over the stage, the music working evocatively with and against the images. When the men sang lines from the Book of Genesis about the annihilation wrought by the Flood, and the night-sky imagery turned to waves and water, the rain arrived violently, the violins ricocheting their bows on the strings. The second movement began with the men singing “tree” in dozens of languages, each word a small, sudden shot of life; these built into cross-rhythms that had the wind players almost dancing in their seats, backed by teeming imagery of plants and fungus.View image in fullscreenMartyn Brabbins conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra.Photograph: Mark AllanBut the final movement, with teenagers staring from the screen and the children on stage intoning lines including “I take the bus”: this felt preachy, as did the list of climate-science buzzwords sung in thudding syllables by the men. Was it meant to suggest the futility of well-meaning actions? Is this another case of putting the onus on children to fix an older generation’s mess?Whatever the answer, it felt heavy-handed – especially given that in the first half of the concert we had heard Copland’s Appalachian Spring. With its beguilingly simple clarinet and flute solos, and its punchy rhythms springing up like unstoppable green shoots, Copland’s score seemed an effortless paean to nature’s resilience.OnBBC Radio 3on 12 February, then on BBC Sounds for 30 days.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicClimate crisisBarbicanBBC Symphony Orchestralive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

This open-hearted solo show, based on Maddigan’s own life, is a love letter to his mum – to all mums, really – told with unguarded love and wicked wit. Tickets should come with tissues.Maddigan plays his cocky 15 year-old-self, who is running from grief on top of dealing with the typical horrors of teenage angst. We start with the important information: how to befriend the cool guy at school, how to secure the strong stuff (cider) for the park, and which porn sites are top of the range. Maddigan’s expressions are elastic as he builds up this teenage world of crass jokes and uncontrollable erections, while anything more serious is pushed away for later. When he first tells us about his mum, he zooms through the fact of her death as if it’s just another detail in his day. Like everything’s totally fine.For all his bullish confidence and adult affectations, Scott Le Crass’s direction constantly reminds us that our arrogant protagonist is only a kid, as Maddigan slumps in a plastic chair in his school uniform and too-short tie, fretting over how to talk to the hot girl in his science class. Lighting director Adam Jefferys’ green strobes are the first signs of grief nipping at Ollie’s heels. Maddigan rapidly papers over the cracks with the next crude gag, his comic presentation deft and self-assured.View image in fullscreenYou’ll fall in love with his cheek … Maddigan.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianGradually, he undoes us with humour. And when he finally gives up all pretense of being okay, his earnest words to his mum are orchestrated by our weepy, percussive sniffs.The shape of the story is predictable, as Maddigan’s irreverent, swaggering confidence shatters into the acceptance of his grief. It’s sweet, neat writing. But the emotional grip and clarity of the telling is what gives this familiar tale such strength, as we fall in love with his cheek, his smarm, and his candid sorrow. Grief can make us insular but this is an incredibly generous performance, as the specificity of Maddigan’s story welcomes in our own reckonings with death, ushering in a line of lost loved ones and inviting them all to take a seat.AtSouthwark Playhouse, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreSouthwark PlayhousereviewsShareReuse this content"

But as storytellers we must never give up,” Knight, 42, told the Guardian. “We have a duty to put our stories out into the world for all to see. I hope this sends a message to any artist who feels their voice isn’t worthy.”The 22-minute film is a heartfelt intergenerational story of loneliness and unexpected friendships. Margolyes plays Dorothy, an elderly widow whose lonely life is transformed after a teenager accidentally kicks his football into her garden.Through their shared love of reading and reciting plays, they strike up an unexpected friendship. Alistair Nwachukwu plays the young neighbour JJ, and Oscar Lloyd plays Dorothy’s grandson.View image in fullscreenMiriam Margolyes plays Dorothy whose life is transformed after a teenager kicks his football into her garden.Photograph: Filthy Gorgeous ProductionsThe film is inspired by Knight’s own friendship with a lonely widow, Shirley Woodham, who lived next door to him and his husband in a former council house until her death in 2022 aged 89.Its title is taken from the code used by gay people during times of persecution, Knight said, noting that it conveyed his early feelings of being an “outsider” as a gay man.He said: “I wanted the film to be an ode to a sanctuary place for someone that’s in the closet. ‘Friends of Dorothy’ was a coded way of describing gay men because Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz and her friends like the Tin Man were all a bit different. They were all misunderstood.View image in fullscreenKnight did not know Margolyes when he wrote his script for her.Photograph: Filthy Gorgeous Productions“For me, being a gay man and being bullied when I was younger and finding sanctuary with older women, I always felt safe with women. This story is an ode to the Dorothys in our lives and safe spaces to ‘be ourselves’. I’d always found that with Shirley.”He added: “Her husband had passed away, her son and daughter lived abroad and she was very lonely. She’d supported theatres her entire life, as a ‘friend’. So we had this wonderful friendship. We took her to the theatre. We also looked after her. We became very close. I wrote this film inspired by that relationship.”Knight spoke of the “power of human connection, regardless of the differences we may perceive between one another”.Stephen Daldry, previously nominated for best directorOscarsfor Billy Elliot, The Hours and The Reader, is the film’s executive producer. He said: “Lee’s an old friend. This is a big career-defining moment for him – his first short film nominated for an Academy Award [is], I think, astonishing.”In a world where there was such a divide between the generations, he said, he found the film “incredibly moving”. He described Margolyes’ performance as “wonderful” and predicted Nwachukwu would be “one of the major actors of his generation”.Daldry said: “I’ve seen him [Nwachukwu] quite a few times, both on stage and on screen. I think he’s phenomenal and a real talent.”View image in fullscreenAlistair Nwachukwu will be ‘one of the major actors of his generation’, according to Stephen Daldry, the film’s executive producer.Photograph: Filthy Gorgeous ProductionsKnight has had acting roles as Rosencrantz to Ian McKellen’s Hamlet and in one of the Harry Potter films. But he did not know Margolyes, another Potter cast member, when he wrote the script. He said he was astonished when she agreed to do it.Asked how his neighbour Woodham reacted when he told her she had inspired a film script, he said: “She thought it was hilarious. She just laughed her head off. I gave her the script. I don’t know if she ever read it.”After her death, her son found the script among her belongings and encouraged Knight to make the film.The production is supported by the charity Age UK, whose chief executive, Paul Farmer, said: “While Dorothy might be a fictional character in this instance, there are so many real older people out there for whom this extremely lonely existence is their stark reality – and many will not be lucky enough to meet a friend like JJ.”The film-makers intend to extend the film’s reach to schools and care homes across the country.Explore more on these topicsOscarsShort filmsAwards and prizesMiriam MargolyesStephen FrynewsShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toNaomi Larsson PiñedaSun 25 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTShareLana, 22I had some messed up ideas around a woman’s role and the influence of porn on thatJake was my first. I was 17 and he was 18. I lost my virginity way later than all my friends; sex had been so far out of my comfort zone. For me it was like social currency and I put a lot of pressure on myself to get it done. Since being with Jake I’ve worked on breaking down that pressure around sex.It’s been a difficult journey. We’ve been together for more than four years now and once in a while I find myself getting into a spiral in my head. I’ve had a couple of panic attacks and worked myself up about sex.Jake has taught me that intimacy can be cuddling and just feeling warm next to each otherPart of the reason I was struggling was because I would hear a lot about other women with super high libidos. I had some messed up ideas around a woman’s role and the influence of porn on that. I’d find myself analysing my beauty next to other women’s, and it just snowballed. When Jake and I had sex, it would be in my mind and affect what I was doing – I’d hold back and not feel good enough. So in the end we’d stick to pretty basic positions.I didn’t properly communicate this with Jake until about a year ago when I had a severe panic attack. We realised that, almost four years in, we’d never had a conversation around sex. But we’ve since had a really open dialogue and both begun talking about it and during sex. We’re now asking, does this feel good? Can you maybe try this?Jake has been really open and supportive. He’s helped me with meditation and breathing techniques to help ease my anxiety. And he taught me that intimacy doesn’t just mean sex. It can be cuddling and feeling warm next to each other, him resting his head on my stomach. And I’ve found that when there’s intimacy, sex just happens. I’m not putting pressure on myself any more – the sex has been so good, and we’ve never looked back.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Being with Lana I’ve learned to be a lot more open and we’ve learned to talk about the things we want or don’t want.It’s taken a while to get here, though. Lana wasn’t very communicative at the start, and I didn’t realise she had anxieties around sex. I thought: is the problem something I’m doing? But when she told me about her panic attacks I suggested we be open with each other. I felt that if I was close to her and made sure I was always available emotionally, then the sexual side of things would get so much better.We both still get embarrassed about ourselves while having sex so we’re trying to do things that make us more vulnerableI think she’d expected a lot from herself sexually and was anxious that if she wanted to stop, I’d react negatively. I reassured her by giving her a lot of extra attention and extra love. I just need to be the best person for Lana in those situations.We had a big discussion about how intimacy doesn’t have to end in someone coming, that we can do stuff that just feels good. For example, if I go past Lana I’ll touch her and kiss her from behind. And she loves it. She’ll touch me while watching a movie or something, and she knows now that I don’t expect more from it.When we do have sex, Lana now feels so much more relaxed. There’s more foreplay, which brings a lot more connection. It feels more fulfilling now, not just about climaxing. I think Lana has found how good sex can be.We’ve also looked at the Kama Sutra to help us become more sexually open. We both still get embarrassed while having sex, so we’re trying to get rid of those fears by doing things that make us more vulnerable in a way. Sometimes when I close my eyes I can get very stuck in my head and feel embarrassed about myself and what I’m doing. But I only have to open my eyes and look at Lana to forget all about that.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not too sweet and, thanks to the apple and carrot, lighter than it sounds, this is a proper winter dessert and the perfect end to a Burns supper, especially when served with custard or ice-cream.Prep20 minCook3 hr 15 minServes8-10110g fresh suet, or dried suet or a vegetarian alternative225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting½ tsp baking powder½ tsp fine salt1 tsp mixed spice1 tsp ground ginger¼ tsp ground allspice¼ tsp nutmeg110g soft brown sugar75g fine fresh breadcrumbs25g coarse oatmeal, or 25g extra breadcrumbs200g currants100g sultanas or raisins– golden ones look especially pretty1 large green apple1 carrotFinely grated zest of 1 unwaxed orange or lemon1 egg, beaten2 tbsp treacleAbout 60ml milk1 Get all your tools readyView image in fullscreenHalf-fill a large saucepan for which you have a lid with water, then bring to a boil (if you have a pan with handles on the side, so much the better). Soak a clean tea towel (a smooth one, rather than anything fluffy or towel-like) or cheesecloth in water. And have ready some butcher’s string, or similar.2 A note on the suetThough suet sounds heavy, its high melting point gives the dumpling dough a fluffy lightness. Fresh suet (the hard fat from around the kidneys, rather than generic beef fat) has the best flavour, but dry stuff, which also comes in vegetarian versions, will do fine. If using fresh, put it in the freezer while you prepare the rest.View image in fullscreen3 Start the dumpling mixPut the flour (if you prefer wholemeal, you may need to use more milk later) in a large bowl with the baking powder and salt. Whisk in all the spices (cinnamon would be a nice addition, or you might just use two teaspoons of mixed spice). Then, whisk in the sugar (dark brown sugar would give a richer flavour, but white is acceptable).4 A note on the breadcrumbsThe breadcrumbs should be the fluffy and fresh variety, rather than the crunchy dried sort sold in supermarkets. To make your own, roughly chop about 200g stale bread (a baker will probably sell or give you some), and remove the crusts. Whizz the cubes in a food processor to turn them into crumbs.View image in fullscreen5 Add the crumbs, oatmeal and fruitAdd the breadcrumbs, oatmeal and dried fruit (again, you can substitute your favourite variety) to the dry ingredients and whisk through until evenly combined. Coarsely grate in the suet, if necessary, the apple (no need to peel it) and carrot (only peel if it looks irredeemably dirty), then add the grated citrus zest and stir in.6 Mix in the treacle and milkView image in fullscreenPut the treacle (a lightly greased spoon, or one briefly dipped in boiling water, is useful here for measuring it out) in a small bowl, add the egg and beat with a fork (this will make it easier to distribute the sticky treacle through the dumpling mix). Stir this into the large bowl. along with just enough milk to create a mixture that drops off a spoon without being runny.7 Wrap the dough in a cloth, then tieView image in fullscreenWring out the soaked tea towel well, then lightly dust one side with flour. Drape the tea towel over a medium bowl, then spoon the dumpling mixture into the centre. Bring the edges of the towel together up and over the top of the dumpling mix, to make a little round bundle a bit like a money bag, then tie the top of the bundle tightly with string, leaving long tails at each end.8 Steam the dumplingView image in fullscreenPut a heatproof saucer or heat diffuser in the base of the pan of boiling water, then lower in the pudding parcel – the water should come about halfway up its sides. Tie the tails of string taut around the handles at each side of the pot (or around the lid), so it doesn’t tip over, then cover the pan and leave to cook at a rolling simmer for three hours, topping up the water as required.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenCarefully lift out the dumpling, then unwrap on to a serving dish or tray. For the full clootie dumpling experience, leave it to cool slightly while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then put the dumpling in the oven for 15 minutes, so it develops an elastic skin. Serve with custard, cream or ice-cream. It’s also delicious sliced and fried in butter the next day.Explore more on these topicsBurns NightFelicity Cloake's masterclassWinter food and drinkFoodDessertBakingFruitBritish food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thoughtful choices can shield you from flimsy soles, cracked faux leather and the disappointment that comes around eventually with impulse buys.A decent boot comes down to three things: comfort, proper fit and durable material.

Red brick walls, greenery throughout, alfresco spaces, allotments growing fresh veg and herbs. Capacious, family-run, dog-welcoming, pocket-friendly. There’s bubble and squeak with hand-cut ham, Korean-style chicken burgers and a vegan burger called, rather brilliantly, “Peter Egan” after, I’m guessing, the animal-loving actor who played Paul in Ever Decreasing Circles.View image in fullscreen‘Down-to-earth dining’: the seafood platter.Could this place be any more adorable? No, but still, brace yourself. “It’s one in, one out,” I was told. “There’s a seated holding pen at the front where you wait for a table. Stand your ground in there. There’s loads of sharp-elbowed garden-centre folk. I think they’re there for the Basque cheesecake.” Ah, yes, the equally vast Claremont garden centre, just a few steps away. Cake, as we all know, is catnip to gardeners. Sends them daft. Come for 20 litres of alkaline topsoil and a terracotta trough, stay for the seasonal pavlova and thick wodges of billionaire’s shortbread. That’s millionaire’s shortbread with an extra layer of caramel decadence. Clearly real billionaires would never eat this shortbread, as they’re all on longevity hunts fuelled by OMAD (one meal a day), that meal being a posh spin on Trill budgie food.Thankfully, at the Tin Roof Cafe there are plenty of customers on hand to eat Bill Gates’ share. Instead of wholesome eating spots like Tin Roof becoming tweely irrelevant as the years pass, it’s evident they’re becoming more necessary. In 2026, eating early, soberly, with multigenerational tables – and, probably most importantly, while trying not to spend £100+ per head – is highly desirable. Once, a social life revolving around stale scones in garden centres was a quiet admission of life’s downwards slope; nowadays, places like Tin Roof have queues out of the door and TikTok hype, while the likes of Pizza Express, or local pubs, beg for daytime trade.View image in fullscreenDressing your own Malaysian chicken salad felt like ‘an arduous task’.Tin Roof Cafe is clearly not earnest, po-faced dining; it completely lacks that Petersham Nursery-influenced pretension where small plates come strewn with petunia leaves and there’s a gift shop with £50 notelet sets. No, this is much more down-to-earth dining, with fish finger baps, doorstep Burnham Bangers sarnies and very good five-cheese toasties on sourdough. Oozy, crisp, buttery and hefty; a shining example. We ordered a seafood sharing platter with prawns in shells, smoked salmon, anchovies on toast, a peppery smoked mackerel paté and a glut of other fishy things. A Malaysian chicken salad appeared in a large bowl with all its components laid out separately: piles of seared chicken, mango, cashew nuts, cucumber, seeds, leaves and a well-balanced sharp-sweet orange-based dressing in a separate dish. It felt princess-like to complain that this was lovely, but that it was a build-your-own salad, the whole thing needed a good stir and adding my own dressing felt like an arduous task. Perhaps modern audiences can’t commit themselves to all the ingredients, so Tin Roof are making it easier to remove terrifying things like avocado or rocket. Still, one couldn’t fault its generosity.View image in fullscreen‘Airy, rich, just sweet enough’: the Basque cheesecake.As we ate, the queues in reception got longer. A motorbike gang arrived – a pleasant one who liked bakewell tarts, not bedraggled, lawless menaces to society as seen in films. Pensioner ladies who lunch, dating teenagers, couples with babies grabbing fresh air and the partners of green-fingered types bribed to carry top soil by a promise of eggs florentine and a round of berry financiers. We took cakes home; their Basque cheesecake is pretty damn good. Airy, rich, just sweet enough, blackened in the right places and with a pleasing crust. The bakewell tart is equally good; albeit of US-style Cheesecake Factory proportions. An enormous slice of coffee and walnut was less impressive, but not upsetting enough to stop me returning to Tin Roof whenever I want to fight for my right to eat banana bread at 2pm between babies, grans and hungry horticulturalists.

On Facebook you see a local gym advertising a discount on membership if you sign up within the next few hours. There are limited spaces so you act quickly.It’s only after you pay that you realise the ad was a fraud: you’ve received no membership details and when you contact the gym it has no record of your payment.The scam is one of a number of fitness-based frauds criminals focus on in January, when people are looking to trim their waistlines or improve their health.Others include nonexistent personal trainers who offer “bespoke” training plans, which are copied from free sites, or fake fitness apps that only harvest users’ data.Marijus Briedis, the chief technology officer at the cybersecurity company NordVPN, says criminals typically clone real ads or sites from legitimate businesses.View image in fullscreenA fake website that claims to offer a training app from Gymshark.Photograph: NordVPNIt can be difficult to discern between the real and the fake, although the web address may have a couple of different characters. Criminals can also use sponsored results on search engines so that if you search online, you will be presented with their fraudulent site.“The new year fitness rush creates the perfect environment for scams, because people are often signing up quickly without taking the time to check who they’re dealing with,” says Briedis.“Gym offers or training plans that rely on urgency, extreme discounts or pressure to ‘sign up today’ should be treated with caution, especially if there are limited contact details or no independent reviews.”NordVPN warns that freely available AI technologies mean images can be altered to make muscles appear more bulked up in order to lure people in with tales of success.How to spot a fitness scamThe first part of the fraud is usually an ad on social media. It may promise a cheap gym membership with a special offer for January, or it could be a personal trainer offering a tailored regime to get you started.There will frequently be a sense of urgency attached to the ad – such as there are only a certain number of places left at the advertised price or the offer runs for a very limited time. This is a typical tactic by fraudsters to try to prompt people into reacting without fully thinking through the purchase.If you hand over your bank details, Briedis says the criminals will take the payment you expect and then store them for use in a future fraud. The tactics are identical to a similar strategy where people are promiseddiscount holidaysonly to have their money stolen.“The first goal is the money. If they cannot do the money goal, the second part is about the data [and to] collect as much information as possible,” says Briedis.What to do about itIf you click on a link, pay close attention to the address of the website you land on. Often one or a few of the letters will be different from a legitimate site, although they may appear similar. For example the fraudsters may use a zero instead of the letter O.Better still, “avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails or social media messages claiming to be from gyms or fitness brands”, says Briedis. “If there’s a problem with a membership or subscription, it’s far safer to go directly to the official website or app rather than following a link.”Beware of anyone asking to be paid by bank transfer – this means you will not be able to use the section 75 protections that come with using a credit card.If you think you have been defrauded, contact your bank immediately. After that, contact Action Fraud, the central hub for fraud and online crime.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Fischer said things had changed: “Now we’re seeing everyone from shift workers to executives, all struggling to sleep,” she said.Kerry Davies, known as the Sleep Fixer, said that while sleep coaches for adults might seem to be an indulgence, many people needed an intense focus to break the cycle.“Sleep coaches look at client’s whole 24 hours – habits, mindsets, daily stressors,” she said.Davies encourages clients to step away not just from online advice but also to strip off the wearables. “Sleep trackers often increase anxiety, which only makes things worse,” she said.UK data shows the scale of the problem: the average adult reports just three days a week of good-quality sleep, with 14% saying they don’t get enough to function on any day – and 38% experiencing mental health impacts at least weekly.Amy Cheseldine of the Good Sleep Method said that personal coaches succeed because they hold clients to account. “People often understand what to do but fail to apply it consistently – or they do loads of thing but miss the one small thing that will really help,” she said.“Coaches also adapt plans to real life – shift work, caregiving, stress. Online advice can’t do that,” she added.Advice online generally focuses on generic sleep hygiene but, said Fischer, misinformation could often be the real culprit.View image in fullscreenSleep coaches see their clients for an average of four sessions.Photograph: Posed by model; Andrii Lysenko/Getty ImagesShe lists common examples of advice that does more harm than good: the insistence that everyone needs eight hours’ sleep, for example. Or that if you’re struggling to sleep, an early bedtime will help. She also says that people unnecessarily cut things out of their lives that they enjoy: caffeine, she said, is not universally harmful to sleep; blue light doesn’t prevent sleep if what you’re reading or watching is calming.Sleep coaches see their clients for an average of four sessions. But Thorsten only needed one: “It took just one session with a coach to realise I was simply going to bed too early,” he said.“I now understand that I only need seven hours of sleep a night, so if I go to bed at 10pm, I’m going to have a disturbed night or I’m going to wake up in the early hours,” he said. “I needed a later bedtime. It really was that simple.”Explore more on these topicsSleepHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the six months I spent working as a telephone psychic, my only supernatural gift was the ability to sound fascinated by a stranger’s love life at 2.17am. Yet for hundreds of billable hours, I sat on my living room floor wearing plaid pyjamas and a telemarketing headset, charging callers by the minute for insights into their lives. Perhaps this made me a con artist, but I wasn’t a dangerous one.When it started, I’d recently quit my job as an editor at a publishing company to write a novel while doing telemarketing shifts from my kitchen table. Instead of knocking off a bestseller, I found myself cold-calling strangers about energy bills while gripped by writer’s block and an inconvenient yearning to have a baby.“Work from home!” an ad popped up one day among remote data entry and content moderation jobs. “Use your intuition to help others find clarity!” The phone psychic description claimed there was a rigorous application process and demonstration of skill was required. I lay awake that night wondering how a psychic job interview would play out. Did candidates need to commune with the interviewer’s dead relatives? When I sent in the application, I was probably looking for meaning just like the people who called the hotlines.My psychic interview the next day was a two-minute conversation with a man in accounts who asked if I had fast wifi, then sent me a contract to sign. There was no trial call, certainly no verification of skill or communion with the dead. Almost as an afterthought, he did ask which method of clairvoyance I would be using. It was not entirely a lie when I claimed a decade of experience reading tarot: but I bought the tarot cards age 12 at Waterstones on Hampstead High Street.I logged on the next morning, nervous about any confusion that may arise from selling magical prophecies and economical energy packages simultaneously. I needn’t have worried. With no testimonials and a stock photo of the moon as my psychic profile photo, for a fortnight nobody called and I continued telemarketing. I can only imagine that the first caller did so by mistake, probably because I was the only psychic stupid enough to be working at 9am on a Monday – I later learned that psychics mostly log in after dark.This first call lasted less than a minute, routed through their system to my headset so I never saw a phone number and nobody saw mine. A man on the other end apologised for calling, said he didn’t know why he was, then mumbled that he hated his job but didn’t know if he should quit or not. “I’m sensing that you’re not … completely satisfied where you are?” I said, insightfully.He rang off before I even finished the sentence. Far from feeling bad that I had pretended to be a psychic, I felt bad that I hadn’t pretended better. This might have been a budget telephone psychic company with a small-print disclaimer that said “for entertainment purposes only”, but this poor man obviously deserved better than being the first psychic outing of a depressed literary editor with writer’s block and baby fever.I got my second caller a week later, this time in the evening. A woman wanted to know whether she ought to give her ex another chance. My teenage years, spent hogging the family landline doing magazine quizzes with school friends while analysing the microexpressions of each other’s crushes, were all the training I needed for that conversation.View image in fullscreen‘It was not entirely a lie when I claimed a decade of experience reading tarot’: Anna Stothard with her cards.Photograph: Elliott MariessShe just wanted to chat. She lived in a small northern town and couldn’t talk to her friends because they all hated her ex. She couldn’t talk to her mum because her mum went to the same church as her ex’s mum. The obvious choice was a stranger on the internet and there I was, anonymous and eager. In person she would maybe have been disappointed by my pyjamas, but all she had to go on was my voice and I barely got a word in between her outpouring of grievances. She was only nominally interested in actual divination, but approved when the “cards” told me that she needed to focus on “nurturing and self-care”. She gave me my first five-star review and called me six more times over the next few months.The pay was 20p a minute, 25p if you kept people on the line for more than 14 minutes. If you worked more than 10 hours in a week, the pay went up slightly, but if you were “online” and didn’t pick up the call, £1.50 was docked from your pay. It was difficult, if not impossible, to make minimum wage, so it wasn’t a con with a great return on time invested – although the accounts department claimed the site’s star employee, Luna, made excellent money. She could astrally project.Istarted getting one or two calls every evening shift, increasing in number each week as my testimonials grew. More than half of the calls opened with, “I don’t know why I’m calling” or something similarly hesitant, frayed and embarrassed. Most people didn’t seem to be looking for magic at all. Most just needed to talk, and I tried to give basic, sensible advice:Maybe don’t quit your job until you have a new one lined up, don’t sleep with your boss, be nice to your ageing parents even if it’s inconvenient.One woman called me every day for a week to discuss the renovation of her flat, twice in one day to analyse the exact placement of a pot plant her ex-husband gave her. She even asked me to look on the Dunelm website and give my psychic opinion on two different patterns of self-adhesive wallpaper.The most common questions were “Is my ex thinking about me?” and “Is my boyfriend/husband cheating?” The callers tended to know the answers on some level. I’d expected to feel guilty about pretending to have supernatural powers but the reality was these people had very little interest in me. They wanted someone to listen to them. Cheap help, basically, untangling the mess of their own thoughts. Callers often apologised for talking too much, then kept going anyway, relieved by the absence of impatience on the other end of the line. As one of the least reviewed psychics on a budget-looking telephone psychic hotline, maybe they knew not to expect Nostradamus on speed dial.So I read between the lines, helped them get their feelings out. Sometimes I made high-probability statements feel personal, but mostly I just made appreciative noises and asked leading questions. And for a few months I didn’t feel guilty about it at all.The telephone psychic industry is more regulated than it used to be when theMiss Cleo adscaused controversy in the early 2000s, leading to the Psychic Readers Network being shut down for deceptive advertising and billing practices. At my company the pricing was clear and the “for entertainment purposes only” disclaimer was blatant. I also wasn’t out there searching for vulnerable people on social media.If future employers weren’t likely to get entirely the wrong impression, I’d happily put my six months as a telephone psychic on my CV: strong interpersonal and communication skills! Highly skilled at managing emotionally sensitive conversations! The ability to build rapport quickly, adjust to the caller’s emotional state, and entertain. I learned to be calm under pressure, gentle with distress, and more self-aware. When private therapy is out of most people’s budgets, I offered strangers a few relatively inexpensive minutes of undivided attention, gentle validation and a sense of guidance.One caller who clearly needed help just wanted to spend £10 to hear about beautiful things the future may have in storeBut slowly the darkness of my new job began to creep in. A few months after I started, a caller asked if her dead mother was disappointed in her. I took a breath and suggested she release herself from her mother’s expectations. She spoke about her for an hour and later wrote in a review that I had known countless impossible details about her mother’s character, none of which I’d mentioned. She said I had given her huge comfort at a difficult time in her life, when all I’d done was listen.Now I felt guilt, and found it difficult to shake off the call. Her pain lingered. After that review people started to expect more of me. One caller relied on psychic advice to soothe her anxiety and make decisions. She was a former veterinary assistant who for a fortnight called me twice a day and got upset if I wasn’t online. She was agoraphobic and clearly needed so much more than I could offer. I tried my best gently to persuade her to refer herself to NHS therapy or tell her GP that she was experiencing anxiety. She didn’t want to hear it, though; she just wanted to spend £10 for someone to talk kindly about beautiful things the future may have in store for her, the tall dark strangers, the exciting travel.She was vulnerable and would have been easy pickings for someone more manipulative. She stopped calling one day and although I like to think it was because she finally contacted mental health services, my intuition tells me she more likely found a mystic who didn’t constantly read her the number of her community mental health team.Twice, I had to tell a client to end the call and contact Samaritans. If anyone mentioned self-harm, suicide, conspiratorial beliefs or paranoia, we were meant to refer them to a professional service and end the call – similarly if anyone was verbally abusive or sexually explicit, although this never happened to me.Iwas probably as lost and depressed as my clients. I’d published my first novel at 19, Isabel and Rocco. By the time I got the psychic job I had four successful novels under my belt, and lots of journalism, but suddenly I could barely muster the enthusiasm to read a shampoo bottle, let alone to write a book. I was broody and sad.The guilt and exhaustion of the job escalated: the melancholy and loneliness that poured out of the phone and into me. The hope and the loss. I started to feel these people’s pain too acutely. Someone would call and I would get a rush of grief, alienation or anger before they’d even spoken. It wasn’t supernatural or telepathic; I’d tapped into an extremely dark wavelength of human need. The more calls I took, the more I really could read between the lines of what they said, feel what they might be unable to articulate. I didn’t stop being a telephone psychic just out of guilt for pretending to be psychic, but because I started to become too attuned to the people who called me. I’m not saying I became psychic, but I began to see how someone might believe they were.The call that made me stop wasn’t dramatic. There were no curses, threats or credit cards maxed out in a single gulp. A woman called from her car, engine idling, and asked if she would get pregnant this month. Her voice had a careful steadiness. I followed the routine, trying to get her talking, listening for the pause, letting silence stretch until she filled it, thinking which choice of words might help her. I said I sensed a baby on the horizon but was having difficulty pinning down the time. She laughed, relieved. She said she didn’t have money for IVF but had been trying for five years now and it was all she wanted in the world.A baby was all I wanted, too, then. I felt her energy so strongly. I could sense her gripping the steering wheel, hear the way her breath kept snagging on itself. Every instinct told me to reassure her – to tell her it would happen, to have hope. I knew how easy it would be to keep her there. To sell her another 10 minutes. Another week. Another month of believing. Instead I told her something vague and kind, and she thanked me. She hung up sounding lighter, which should have made me feel better. But it didn’t.For years I struggled with infertility and loss. Then I had a life-changing call with a psychicRead moreWhat stayed with me was the certainty that she would call again and that next time I would remember her voice. I would recognise the sound of someone pausing their life because I’d given them a reason to. I sat there in my pyjamas, headset warm against my ear, and knew that I was not doing the right thing.In the ancient world, the Oracle of Delphi advised Greek city-states on war and law; Roman augurs read the will of the gods in bird flight; Mesopotamian priests interpreted dreams and entrails. These days we’ve gone past the telephone to TikTok, Instagram and other social networks launching a new breed of influencer psychics, reaching even bigger and more mainstream audiences.I was a telephone psychic 10 years ago and as my testimonials grew the accounts department started badgering me that the best psychics were moving on to webcam. I told them the main perk of the job was that I didn’t need to put real clothes on. The day after the fertility call, though, I told them I was going to log off.I got a free call with another psychic on the site just before I left. Obviously I chose Luna, the site’s star psychic. Unfortunately, when I called it turned out she could only astrally project during a full moon at certain moments in her menstrual cycle, but she could tell, presumably having had a little help from the accounts department, that I was sitting in my pyjamas and at a crossroads in my life. We chatted for a bit about being a telephone psychic, and her life, and she got a strong sense that “the subject of clairvoyance” would be important to me at some point in the future. I remember the phrase exactly; I wrote it down because it was weird. Not the skill of clairvoyance, but the subject.I never finished the novel I was writing then, but I did go on to have three children. Ten years later I am back to writing and about to publish a novel about a toxic friendship between a webcam psychic and a client. It is, I guess, about “the subject of clairvoyance”, exploring the fine lines between charisma, empathy and fraud.Before I stopped signing into the psychic platform altogether, I waited for my first reviewer to call me again so that I could say goodbye. She was in a good place by this point. She’d moved away from the small town where she grew up, had gone back to school to finish her A-levels and just wanted to chat about her new boyfriend. She thanked me for all the advice over the last six months but said that although I’d helped her, she didn’t think I was particularly clairvoyant.That night, saying goodbye to her, I could almost imagine my time as a telephone psychic wasn’t a grift but a small, morally complex act of service.

Meeting Ireland’s leader, Micheál Martin, in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China’s president,Xi Jinping, said a favourite book of his as a teenager was The Gadfly, by the Irish author Ethel Voynich, a novel set in the revolutionary fervour of Italy in the 1840s.“It was unusual that we ended up discussing The Gadfly and its impact on both of us but there you are,” Martintoldreporters in Beijing.China is on a charm offensive with western leaders, a path cleared by Donald Trump’s increasingly erratic and destabilising power grabs on the global stage. Although Europe breathed a sigh of relief this week when Trumpwithdrew the threatof using military force in Greenland and said he would not impose tariffs on opponents of his plans in the Arctic, the US no longer seems like a reliable partner.An editorial in the Chinese newspaperthe Global Timesmade Beijing’s pitch clear: headlined “Europe should seriously consider building a China-EU community with a shared future”, the state media article said the world risked “returning to the law of the jungle” and that China and the EU should cooperate in building “a shared future for mankind”.No country can afford to cut ties or truly antagonise the world’s biggest economy. But in the search for stability, US allies are turning to the country that many in Washington see as an existential threat:China.“With US policy again looking unpredictable – underscored by tensions and tariff threats over Greenland – European leaders are making sure to keep channels with Beijing open,” says Eva Seiwert, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. “The risk is that this approach sustains or even deepens existing dependencies on China at a moment when Europe’s stated goal is de-risking.”Mark Carney, elected as Canada’s prime minister on promises to stand up to bullying from the US, set the tone for western countries’ recalibration with China when hetravelled to Beijinglast week. “Canada is forging a new strategic partnership with China,” Carney said. The global order, he said, was at a point of “rupture … not a transition”.View image in fullscreenCanada’s Mark Carney visits Ritan Park, Beijing, during his visit to China this month.Photograph: Carlos Osorio/ReutersOfficially, China views this rebalancing with caution. Anotherarticlepublished in state media this week explicitly hit back at the idea that China welcomed the current chaos.Song Bo, a fellow at Tsinghua University’s Center for International Security and Strategy, says Chinese policymakers are unwilling to publicly admit that the global order has fundamentally changed.“We have always believed that we are the greatest beneficiary of the international order established after the cold war,” Song says, referencing China’s rapid economic growth that came with the globalisation of the 1990s and 2000s. “It is difficult for us to accept that the current order is undergoing a major transformation.”Another perspective on the matter comes from Ryan Haas, a senior fellow at Brookings. In a post on X, he wrote: “In viewing Trump’s efforts to gain control of Greenland, Beijing appears to be following Napoleon’s maxim: ‘Never interrupt your adversary when he’s making a mistake.’”Because although China pledges allegiance to the international rules-based order, Xi has long talked of the world undergoing “great changes unseen in a century”, echoing Carney’s sentiment of global “rupture”. Seiwert says: “Beijing could use Carney’s language rhetorically to suggest a shared diagnosis of US-centric instability, even if there is no convergence on values, interests or outcomes.”Carney’s pitch for China comes in part from his hostile relationship with Trump. In Trump’s rambling address to Davos, helambasted Carneyfor failing to be “grateful” to the US. “Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark,” Trump raged.2:23What Donald Trump's Davos speech tells us about his Greenland bid – videoRather than kowtow to the southern neighbour, Carney is trying to lessen his country’s dependence on the US. In Beijing, he agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles from 100% to 6.1%, diverting from an alignment with Washington that had left one of China’s key exports in effect blocked from the North American market.Chinese EVs are now on course to make up about one-fifth of Canada’s EV sales, if not more. The deal is a major political win for China, even if it represents only a small share of China’s EV exports. Concerns about economic dependence on China and even Chinese interference in Canadian elections appear to have dropped down the agenda.Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, arrives in China next week with a slightly different set of circumstances. He has a warmer relationship with Trump, although his rhetorichardenedin recent days with spats over Greenlandand the Chagos Islands. And he is under pressure at home to show he is tough on China when it comes to security and human rights, two issues that inflamed the issue of the controversial Chinese mega embassy application in London, which the governmentapproved this weekin the face of intense opposition.“Starmer may not have proved himself an effective prime minister or knowledgable about China, but he is not stupid,” says Steve Tsang, the director of the Soas China Institute. “He will want to improve relations with China to improve the UK’s economy and trade, but he is not going to see China as a more reliable partner to the UK than the US.”‘If you’re flushing the toilet with grey water, people should know’: how China turned rain into an assetRead moreNevertheless, like Carney, Starmer will be hoping to ink deals and drum up much-needed investment in the UK economy. He will be accompanied by representatives from blue-chip British companies and isexpected to revivea UK-China CEO council, despite growing concerns about the national security risks of Chinese investments.The pivot to Beijing is far from straightforward. Song notes that the leadership of the European Commission remains hostile to China, something that Chinese officials and business leaders find hard to square with the supposedly warmer ties between China and individual European countries.According to Song, the bloc’s overall frostiness and the war in Ukraine are the biggest barriers to deepening ties. “Without resolving these two issues, Sino-European relations will not see any significant improvement,” Song says.Ukraine may be particularly high on the agenda for Petteri Orpo, Finland’s prime minister, who lands in Beijing on Sunday. “China’s support for Russia has definitely strained relations with the Nordic states and Finland is no exception,” says Patrik Andersson, an analyst at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. But Andersson notes that Finland’s China relations have typically been more stable than those of Sweden and Norway, and this visit is likely to bolster those ties.In the months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, European countries wrestled with the fact that many were dependent on Russia for key commodities such as fossil fuels. There were calls to avoid falling into a similar situation with China, the world’s most important supplier of clean energy technology. Even back in 2020, the chair of the UK’s joint intelligence committee, Simon Gass,said: “China represents a risk on a pretty wide scale.”Such concerns may be fading into the rearview mirror as middle powers seek to cling on to a world of multilateralism in the face of a wrecking ball swung by the country that was once its greatest defender. China insists Trump’s behaviour is nothing to celebrate. But the outcome may nevertheless strengthen Beijing’s position on the world stage.Additional research by Lillian Yang"

It said at the time it had a 1,200-strong team in its contact centre.Starting pay rates at outsource centres are about $52,800 a year, according to interviews with outsource call centre staff at different private operators, compared with more than $72,000 for many public servants on the same phone lines.Scott’s sister says an unlikely champion saved his life. NDIS changes may stop others getting the same helpRead moreWhile the model relies on private operators delivering call centre functions more efficiently than the public service,experts have warned it’s an illusionto suggest a private operator will deliver the same quality at a lower cost that allows for profit making.Beth Vincent-Pietsch, deputy national secretary at the Community and Public Sector Union, said Australians reaching out for help to the NDIS deserve to speak with a trained, supported and accountable public servant, not a “labour hire worker in a for‑profit call centre who has been thrown in the deep end”.“This is a model that is failing Australians who need sometimes urgent help from the NDIA, and it is failing the workers who are asked to carry it,” Vincent-Pietsch said.“Providing Australians the support they need from the NDIA is core government work that should undoubtedly be done by Australian public service employees.“The NDIA’s longstanding and problematic reliance on outsourcing is undermining service quality and public trust across the scheme, and must be addressed as a matter of urgency.”Do you know more?

The border was supposed to have opened during the initial phase of Donald Trump’s plan to end the war last October.Israel conditioned the reopening on the return of all living hostages held by Palestinian militant factions in Gaza, as well as a “100% effort” byHamasto locate and return the bodies of all deceased hostages. All have been returned except for the body of Gvili, a police officer.The Israeli military “is currently conducting a focused operation to exhaust all of the intelligence that has been gathered in the effort to locate and return the fallen hostage, Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, of blessed memory,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, adding that once this search operation is “exhausted” Israel will open the Rafah crossing.On Thursday, Ali Shaath, head of a transitional Palestinian committee backed by the US to temporarily administer Gaza, said the Rafah Crossing would open this week. It is effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there.The Gaza side of the crossing has been under Israeli military control since 2024.While Israel has carried out search efforts before for Gvili, more detail than usual was released about this one. Israel’s military said it was searching a cemetery in northern Gaza near the “yellow line”, which marks offIsraeli-controlled parts of the territory.Separately, an Israeli military official said Gvili may have been buried in the Shuja’iya-Daraj Tuffah area, and that rabbis and dental experts were on the ground with specialised search teams. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing an operation still under way.Gvili’s family has urged Netanyahu’s government not to enter the ceasefire’s second phase until his remains are returned.But pressure has been building, and the Trump administrationhas already declared in recent days that the second phase is under way.Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas in a statement Sunday said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili’s remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.Meanwhile, the shuttered headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in East Jerusalem was set ablaze overnight, days afterIsraeli bulldozers demolished parts of the compound.It was not known who started the fire. Israeli settlers were observed at night looting the main building for furniture, said Roland Friedrich, the agency’sWest Bankdirector. He said holes were cut in the fence.Israel’s fire department said it sent teams to prevent the blaze from spreading. In May 2024, Unrwa said it was closing its compound aftersettlers set fires to its fence.Unrwa’s commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, told the Associated Press the incident was the “latest attack on the UN in the ongoing attempt to dismantle the status ofPalestinerefugees”.Unrwa’s mandate is to provide aid and services to 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel, including East Jerusalem.Israel has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and alleging that some of its employees were involved in the 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. Unrwa leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaWest BankMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineUnited NationsHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The release of videos showing the violence of the protests was “something we will have to face sooner or later”, Yousef Pezeshkian added. “Shutting down the internet will not solve anything, we will just postpone the issue.”The sporadic lifting of restrictions is leading to a slow and painful inquest into how many protesters, including children, have died. Authorities launched a violent crackdown under cover of the internet blackout, with rights groups documenting several thousand dead. The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights says the final figure could be as high as 25,000. Thousands more people are still being detained.Pictures of many of the dead children are appearing on internet sites inside Iran, while the director of Farabi eye hospital in Tehran, Dr Ghasem Fakhraei, said staff at the specialist ophthalmology centre had operated on more than 1,000 patients requiring emergency eye surgery since the protests. Hospital wards were overflowing, he said.View image in fullscreenIn this photo obtained by the Associated Press, Iranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran on 9 January.Photograph: APMolavi Abdolhamid, a prominent Sunni cleric and outspoken Friday prayer leader in Zahedan, south-east Iran, referred to the violent killing of protesters during January as an “organised massacre”.Yousef Pezeshkian, a government adviser, said the risk of keeping Iran cut off from the internet was greater than that of a return to protests if connectivity were restored. He said security institutions must ensure security with the existence of the internet, which he called a necessity in life.Pezeshkian, echoing comments of his father, said the protests had turned violent only because of professionally trained groups affiliated with foreigners, but added: “In the meantime the security and law enforcement forces may have made mistakes and no one is going to defend wrongdoing and that has to be addressed.”Graphic of internet connectivity in IranIranian journalists were openly reporting a dispute with government about whether it was safe to relax the internet, with the president and the communications minister, Sattar Hashemi, backing the move but the measure being opposed by Ali Larijani, the head of the supreme national security council.A graphic showing Iran’s internet networkTehran’s stock market on Sunday was in the red for the fourth day in a row, and the Iranian currency, the rial, continued to fall against the dollar, one of the causes of the protests. The Central Bank of Iran said a debt issuance had only been 15% subscribed, a development that will require further government spending cuts or result in a rise in inflation, the official rate of which was more than 42% last month.Although shops have opened, even newspapers close to the security services admit trading is low.Iran’s computer trade organisation said the internet shutdown was costing $20m (£15m) a day, with lorry drivers also reporting it was difficult to cross borders because of the lack of electronic documentation.One frustrated trader said they were being given 20 minutes of supervised access to the internet a day, enough to answer a small number of emails, but not enough to conduct business.With the limited lifting of the restrictions, it is now possible to see pressure being applied to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) narrative that the death toll is so high purely because of subversive activities of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency.Gholamhossein Karbaschi, a reformist former mayor of Tehran, said: “People are in shock and amazed … If the agents of Mossad and foreign countries are at work, how did they suddenly carry out these disasters throughout the country? Where did they come from?”He condemned the failure of the Pezeshkian administration to improve the economy. “The government in Iran is losing its original meaning. In no area can it be said the government is active, present and solving problems. All the other forces in the country are active and doing what they want except for the government. This government does not show any power in any area,” Karbaschi said.View image in fullscreenA screen grab show people blocking an intersection during a protest in Tehran on 8 January.Photograph: APSome of the protesters contacted by the Guardian in Iran blamed Donald Trump for failing to provide the help he had promised.“He betrayed us,” said one. “Trump is more hateful to me than the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei because the ideology of Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is clear. Trump promised and kept saying he would shoot the person who shot you. Trump is the lowest of leaders the world has seen.”Another said: “Bodies are intact, but hearts and minds are shattered. For a moment you feel happy that you have finally managed to get access to the internet. Then instantly guilt hits – what are you happy about it? Why are you still breathing, you useless person?”They added: “We are honestly sorry for ourselves because first, God does not exist. Second, we have become so miserable that we are impatiently waiting for another country to attack our country, hoping it will save us.

Many days I wake up terrified to check my phone, afraid of seeing bad news or learning that someone I love has been arrested, injured, or killed, Fereshteh said, adding that many Iranians they speak with “believe that peaceful protests alone are no longer enough”.“The regime has shown that it will respond only with bullets, prisons, and executions,” they continued. “In this situation, international military intervention may be the only realistic way to stop the killing and dismantle this system of repression. If intervention can end this dictatorship and give people a chance to live freely, many of us believe it is a price worth paying.”Ellie, 33, described feeling “an intense sense of survivor’s guilt” being in the US and is “emotionally paralyzed and often speechless” by the news from Iran.“A regime that suppresses its own people through violence, fear, and isolation does not remain a local problem,” she said. “It destabilizes regions, fuels extremism, drives forced migration, and normalizes brutality. Ignoring this does not create peace – it postpones a larger crisis.”Many respondents said they believed some form of international intervention in Iran was necessary.“I believe words and sanctions have failed for decades,” said Luna Houshmand, a software engineer in her 30s. “If they worked, this regime would not still be killing people in the streets. If the world truly believes in human rights, it must move beyond statements and take real action.”A woman in New York, who asked to remain anonymous, said her family in Iran told her that people feel “desperate and helpless, and their only hope is foreign assistance”.“President Trump promised the people of Iran that he would come to save them, and the people have counted on that promise,” she said. “Our only concern right now is that he may not follow through.”Maryam Tehrani, in Seattle, said she believes Iranians need “not empty statements, but meaningful pressure on the Islamic Republic”.“Sanctions targeting officials, international isolation, and real accountability matter,” she said. “Military intervention is complicated and risky, but indifference is not an option. The priority should be protecting civilians and supporting the Iranian people’s right to decide their own future without repression.”Sahar Haddadian, a civil engineer in Florida, said that “no one wants war” or “foreign intervention or to see innocent lives lost” but “history has shown that some regimes leave the world with no good options – only difficult ones”.“You cannot negotiate with a regime that rules through terror,” Haddadian, 36, said, adding that “dialogue, appeasement, and empty diplomacy have failed”.Haddadian also said the US must “make it clear that it stands with the Iranian people”.“That means real consequences for regime leaders, full isolation of those responsible for crimes against humanity, and unwavering support for the people of Iran who are bravely demanding freedom,” they said.Ellie, 42, in Colorado, said that while she is “strongly against war,” the “situation in Iran has reached a point where people are being killed for demanding basic rights” and that “without some form of international intervention, whether political, diplomatic, economic, or strategic pressure, it is difficult to see how this regime can be stopped.”“If President Trump or any other world leader is willing to take meaningful, non‑military action that helps end the ongoing repression, I would welcome that support,” she said.An Iranian in California, who asked to remain anonymous, said they have long opposed “foreign military intervention in Iran”, “do not trust US intentions” and are “deeply aware of the damage outside interference has caused in the region”, but now feel torn.“We are now at such a deadlock that I honestly don’t know what to feel anymore,” they said. “When a regime responds to peaceful protests with mass bloodshed, when civilians are gunned down and hospitals overflow with the injured, it forces people like me into impossible moral contradictions.“I find myself torn between my long-held beliefs and the sheer desperation of watching my people slaughtered with no protection and no voice.”Tara, a 36-year-old engineer, also described herself as “deeply conflicted” about US intervention.“I can’t predict what would happen to my family, and I fear that any intervention could lead to more death and devastation,” she said. “At the same time, I see no clear alternative for ending the Islamic regime’s grip on power. I wish there were a way to remove those responsible without harming ordinary people or destroying our beautiful country.“I’m worried this could turn into a never-ending war.”Explore more on these topicsIranUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 80-year-old has beendetained since she was ousted, and her party, the National League for Democracy, which won sweeping victories in previous votes,has been banned.“Whether the international community recognises this or not, we don’t understand their perspective. The people’s vote is the recognition we need,” Min Aung Hlaing told reporters on Sunday, according to video broadcast on state TV.View image in fullscreenPeople arrive to vote in Yangon on Sunday.

China, a key military ally, is backing the vote, which it considers the best path towards stability.In Mandalay, Myanmar’s second most populous city, voters were reluctant to be interviewed, saying it was not safe to speak publicly about politics. “We miss our former government, we don’t want this military government,” said a man who was voting on Sunday in the city.

A new election protection law was also enacted in July, under which any criticism of the vote can lead to a minimum sentence of three years in prison, and even the death penalty.Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said the vote had been orchestrated by the military to deliver a landslide for its political proxy, the Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP).“It took no chances, banning credible opposition parties, jailing popular political figures, muzzling the press, crushing fundamental freedoms, and using fear and coercion to drive a reluctant electorate to the polls,” Andrews said.“The junta is banking on the world’s fatigue, hoping that the international community will accept military rule dressed up in civilian clothing,” he added. “Governments must not allow that to happen.”Fightingcontinued in many areas throughout the election period. Just days before voting, 21 people were killed and 28 injured in a military airstrike on a village where displaced people from the northern township of Bhamo were sheltering in Kachin state, Associated Press reported.View image in fullscreenA police officer standing guard in front of a polling station in Mandalay.Photograph: Aung Shine Oo/APThe election took place in three stages, with the first phase held in December and a second phase held earlier in January. In total, 57 parties competed, though only six did so nationwide, and analysts said none of the parties on the ballot paper were perceived as offering a meaningful opposition to the military. The USDP ran by far the largest number of candidates, and had secured a majority of seats in previous rounds, winning 193 of 209 seats in the lower house and 52 of 78 seats in the upper house.According to election monitoring group Anfrel, 57% of the parties that ran in the 2020 general election no longer exist, even though they received more than 70% of votes and 90% of seats.Malaysia has said the regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), would not endorse the poll or send observers. However, it is unclear whether individual member states will increase their engagement with Myanmar’s leadership after the vote.Turnout has been low, at 55%, compared with about 70% in the 2020 election, when the public queued at polling stations despite the pandemic, and thehistoric 2015 votethat swept Aung San Suu Kyi to power. The pre-election period has also lacked the large rallies and excitement of previous votes.Voting took place in populous cities such as Mandalay and Yangon on Sunday, but analysts estimate about a third of the country’s territory has been excluded from the process because it is under the control of anti-junta groups or gripped by fighting.Themilitary coup in 2021, which marked an abrupt end to the country’s democratic transition, triggered a escalating conflict as civilians began to take up arms to fight against the junta. The army is battling a diverse patchwork of opposition groups, in what Acled, which tracks conflicts globally, has described as “the most fragmented conflict in the world”.Su Mon, Acled’s senior analyst for Asia Pacific, said that while the military had sought to portray elections as a managed exit from political crisis and conflict, its counter-offensives had only increased in the run-up to the vote. “In an effort to regain territory, the military continued its repeated airstrikes on civilian areas throughout 2025, leading to the highest number of airstrikes and associated fatalities in any single year since 2021,” she said.Estimates of the death toll from Myanmar’s post-coup conflict vary, though Acled has recorded 92,000 deaths since 2021. The monitoring group places Myanmar second on its conflict index, which measures conflicts based on their deadliness, danger to civilians, geographic diffusion and the number of armed groups involved.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaAung San Suu KyinewsShareReuse this content"

Forces with slow response times would be sent senior officers from faster forces to advise on improvements, the Home Office said.Police Federation criticises plans for mandatory ‘licence to practise’ for officersRead moreMahmood said in a statement: “People are reporting crimes and then waiting hours or even days for a response. By the time the police arrive, the perpetrators and witnesses are long gone. I will restore neighbourhood policing and scale up patrols in communities to catch criminals and cut crime.”John Hayward-Cripps, the chief executive of Neighbourhood Watch, welcomed the new national standards. “It’s a very basic expectation that police will respond when you report a crime, and quickly when it is serious,” he said. “When that doesn’t happen, it’s not just frustrating, it is very stressful and damages trust.”Police and crime commissioners have warned, however, that some forces will struggle to meet the targets without additional investment.Matthew Scott, the police and crime commissioner for Kent, and Clare Moody, the commissioner for Avon and Somerset, said: “While a rapid police response is desirable, we know that many forces will struggle to meet these targets without significant investment, as they may require additional staff and upgraded control room technology to deliver.”The home secretary has also said she will cut “red tape” and “unnecessary admin” that prevents officers from spending more time on the beat.To fight everyday crime, the government will ramp up its pledge to restore visible policing and patrols in communities through an extension of its neighbourhood policing guarantee.In a white paper entitled: “From local to national: a new model for policing”, Mahmood is expected to outline changes that will include:A reduction in the number of police forces.Local policing areas to deal with everyday crimes such as shoplifting.Home secretaries to be given the power to sack chief constables.An FBI-style National Police Service to lead on terrorism, fraud and organised crime.Every police officer in England and Wales to hold a licence to serve.A fast track for professionals and experts so they can take senior police roles.A new police commander to lead on violent disorder and rioting.A new national forensics team to help catch rapists and murderers.While some senior officers have voiced support for the plans, rank and file officers have questioned whether the changes will make a difference.One Labour MP and former Home Office minister questioned whether the government should be pushing through wholesale reforms rather than concentrating on tackling visible street crimes such as shoplifting and mobile phone thefts. “These may be necessary reforms in the long run but they might not be good politics, given our position in the polls,” the former minister said.Explore more on these topicsPoliceHome OfficeShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Another called the decision a “huge mistake”, while a third said the leadership was “mad” not to make more of the self-styled “King of the North”.Andrea Egan, head of the huge Unison union, a major Labour funder, said members would be “disappointed and angry”. A series of unions are understood to be in discussions about what they may do jointly to try to change the decision. “This is blatant gerrymandering,” one union source said. “It will not do.”In a brief statement, Burnham said he was “disappointed” by the NEC’s decision, hitting out at “the way the Labour party is being run” under Starmer and raising concerns about the impact of the decision on the byelection. Labour figures across the north-west are concerned that Reform UK could take the seat.Starmer has faced near-constant internal unrest in recent months, with the party trailing in the polls and many MPs spooked by political misjudgements and the prospect of being wiped out by Reform UK at the next election.His allies hope that keeping Burnham away from Westminster will shore up the prime minister’s position and avoid damaging internal conflicts dominating the agenda in the run-up to the May elections. It also prevents a potential leadership coup if those go badly – although Burnham had denied this was his intention – and Starmer still faces threats from elsewhere.But they acknowledge the decision comes at a cost by deepening internal rifts and further eroding party discipline, and that the prime minister could ultimately take the blame if Labour loses the byelection, eroding his position still further.The decision will also cause disquiet among senior Labour figures, with Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, and Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader, having called in recent days for Burnham to be allowed to stand in the seatvacated last weekfor health reasons by the ex-minister Andrew Gwynne.View image in fullscreenThe former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner called for ‘no stitch-ups’ in the process during a speech in Liverpool on Sunday.Photograph: Ryan Jenkinson/Getty ImagesA similar call came fromAngela Rayner. Speaking at a party event on Sunday, shortly before the NEC decision, the former deputy leader said: “I know my friend, the mayor, has put his name forward, and I believe the local members should get the choice, no stitch-ups.”Powell was the only person to support Burnham’s case in the NEC vote, which he lost eight to one. The home secretary,Shabana Mahmood, who praised Burnham earlier on Sunday as “an exceptional politician”, abstained because of her neutral role as NEC chair.The decision would appear to completely stop Burnham’s attempts to return to parliament in the short term, where he would be seen as a major rival to succeed Starmer in the event of a challenge against the prime minister, whose personal poll ratings are disastrous.A Labour statement said that under party rules, sitting mayors or police and crime commissioners must seek permission to stand for parliament. “The NEC has decided not to grantAndy Burnhampermission to stand,” it said.“The NEC believes that causing an unnecessary election for the position of Greater Manchester mayor would have a substantial and disproportionate impact on party campaign resources ahead of the local elections and elections to the Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd in May. Although the party would be confident of retaining the mayoralty, the NEC could not put Labour’s control of Greater Manchester at any risk.View image in fullscreenThe home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, was the only one of 10 NEC members to abstain from the vote.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APSteve Reed, the communities secretary, defended the decision. “Voters don’t like elections that come midterm,” he told the BBC. “People voted in Greater Manchester overwhelmingly for Andy Burnham to be their mayor two years ago, for a four-year term.”But a series of MPs condemned the move, among them Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary, who called it “an incredibly disappointing decision”, adding: “The leadership should not feel threatened by having one of the most popular politicians in the country as part of the national team.”Simon Opher, the Stroud MP who is part of Labour’s 2024 intake, called it “petty factionalism” from Starmer’s aides.“The voters of Gorton and Denton are being denied the opportunity to choose a brilliant candidate to represent them in parliament, and this risks gifting the seat to Reform in the run-up to the local elections,” he said. “We desperately need to be better than this.”One source on the party’s soft left said: “No 10 have chosen factionalism over what’s right for the party. They will have to change course, not least once they realise they will lose the byelection without Andy.”Team player or captain? Labour wrestles over Andy Burnham’s ambitionsRead moreThere was no immediate reaction from Burnham. But Mainstream, the left-leaning Labour group associated with the Greater Manchester mayor and other senior figures such as Powell, said: “Labour must reverse this decision if it is serious about putting country before party. We urge the party to reconsider in the interests of taking on Reform and building the strongest possible team in Westminster.”Another Labour source said the NEC meeting, described as “respectful and collegiate”, had heard concerns about the cost of holding a mayoral byelection to replace Burnham two years into his term, and worries about a divisive campaign by Reform UK.Supporters of Starmer had argued that Burnham running for parliament would destabilise the government. “At a time of great geopolitical tensions and in the middle of a cost of living crisis, the country would be aghast if the government turned inwards,” one Starmer ally said.“The chaos and psychodramas of the Tories saw them kicked out of office. The country wants us to get on with governing. We don’t have time for endless speculation.”“Politically, we would be giving up the certainty of a Labour mayor for the next two years,” the Starmer ally said. “We would be confident of winning again, but Reform would massively out-spend us and it would become a nasty, divisive contest. It would mean gambling with communities and people’s lives.”Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamLabourKeir StarmerGreater ManchesterByelectionsAngela RaynerEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

His flurry of events also kicked off withan interviewin which Burnham breezily recounted how some Labour MPs had contacted him during the summer to ask if he would try to replace Starmer.For all that Burnham has pledged his loyalty to the prime minister, not even his close allies doubted that his decision to formally seek permission to become the candidate in the forthcoming Gorton and Denton byelection was anything but the first stage in a likely challenge.While allies of the prime minister spoke scathingly on Sunday of“Andy Burnham’s ambition”being at the centre of the plan, supporters of the mayor argue that with Starmer’s personal poll ratings dismal, Labour needs to change course if it is to prevent a Nigel Farage-led government.So what next? For all that Burnham will be aggrieved at the swift and comprehensively organised quashing of his plans by No 10, he can settle back into the role of the heir presumptive, the king over the water, the vessel for hope rather than the bearer of prosaic actuality.This also involves not having to actually fight a byelection where, notwithstanding the 13,000-plus majority enjoyed by Andrew Gwynne, the departing MP, Labour nowfaces a political street fightagainst Reform UK, the Greens and possibly a pro-Gaza independent candidate.The news that Zack Polanski, the charismatic Green leader, will not be standing takes away some of the Green threat, but the party is hugely bullish about its chances, and could at the very least dilute Labour’s vote enough to ensure it loses.Burnham can now watch all this from his mayoral office, with allies ready to brief the media, in the event of a Labour loss, how his local popularity would have made the difference.While some of Burnham’s allure to Labour MPs has been a product of his absence from Westminster, as a mayor he has carved out a distinct if occasionally woolly left-leaning ethos, certainly more distinctive than his philosophy as an MP, where he twice unsuccessfully stood for Labour leader, in 2010 and 2015.As set out in a Guardian opinion piece only last week,what Burnham calls “Manchesterism”is a growth-based vision combining government investment and intervention with wholesale devolution, something best exemplified by the region’sBee network, an integrated travel system taking in trains, buses, trams and bike routes.Whether this, combined with Burnham’s low-key, easy-going charisma, would be enough to turn around Labour’s polling nationally is a question to which we do not, for now, have an answer.But with a general election as distant as mid-2029, and Starmer showing few signs of recovery, at some point we may.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerLabourManchesterGreater ManchesteranalysisShareReuse this content"

Similar concerns hamper such conversations with children, including that they may develop disordered eating habits as a result.The complex factors that explain obesity, including poverty, lack of access to nutritious food, and children having limited opportunities to be active, means GPs approach conversations about children’s weight “with care and empathy for families under pressure”, Holden said.“When parents feel judged or blamed, conversations can quickly become emotionally charged and, as our members tell us, can lead to complaints from distressed or angry parents,” he added.Katharine Jenner, the executive director of theObesity Health Alliance, a coalition of 65 health and children’s groups, said that the large numbers of GPs who had seen obese infants and young children “is another sign we’re letting children down before they even start school. If we’re serious about prevention, it has to begin in the earliest years, otherwise the damage follow them through life.”She called for reformulation of food and drink products to make them healthier, restrictions on the marketing of products high in fat, salt and sugar, and better support for families.GPs also disclosed in the survey that adult patients who should not be using weight loss drugs are putting themselves at risk by obtaining them through deception from private pharmacies. They include people with eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia, and those already taking other medications that may interact badly with “fat jabs” and pose a risk to their health.Most of the estimated 1.5 million people in Britain using GLP-1 drugs to lose weight have obtained them privately, with only a small minority receiving them on the NHS, which has strict eligibility rules.One GP said GLP-1s are being “accessed privately pretty indiscriminately by many people whose body mass index is not in the obese category”. Another told how a patient with a history of anorexia nervosa had also obtained the drugs privately. Two-thirds (67%) of family doctors have seen patients who have done so despite not meeting eligibility rules.The findings raise questions about how rigorously private pharmacies are conducting proper checks on people who want to start using GLP-1s, such as checking what other drugs they already take.Large majorities of GPs surveyed said that obesity was likely to be a defining public health challenge in their career (92%), and that it would significantly affect the NHS’s ability to deliver care (95%). But 59% believe weight loss jabs will save the NHS money – only 22% disagree.The Department ofHealthand Social Care did not comment directly on MDDUS’s findings. But a spokesperson said: “Every child deserves the best possible start in life, which is why this government is taking decisive action to tackle childhood obesity.“We are restricting junk food advertising on television before 9pm and online, a move expected to remove up to 7.2bn calories per year from children’s diets; while giving local authorities new powers to stop fast food shops opening outside schools.“Through our ten-year health plan, we’re shifting the focus from sickness to prevention to create a healthier nation.”Explore more on these topicsObesityChildrenHealthDoctorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The former president and former first lady said these tactics had now resulted in the fatal shootings of two US citizens – Pretti andRenee Good, both in Minneapolis. Yet, they said, Trump and other administration officials appeared eager to escalate the rhetoric before an investigation had been undertaken – and despite the fact that they “appear to be directly contradicted by video evidence”.The Obamas called on Americans to support the wave of peacefulprotestsin Minneapolis and other parts of the country.View image in fullscreenStill image of a video of the moment when Alex Pretti’s firearm is retrieved from waistband holster by a federal agent as another agent draws his weapon before Pretti was fatally shot.Photograph: Video Obtained By Reuters/Reuters“They are a timely reminder that ultimately it’s up to each of us as citizens to speak out against injustice, protect our basic freedoms and hold our government accountable,” they said.Another former Democratic president,Bill Clinton, followed witha statementthat also condemned the killings of Good and Pretti amid the “horrible scenes” of the immigration crackdown.“All of this is unacceptable and should have been avoided,” Clinton said. “To make matters even worse, at every turn, the people in charge have lied to us, told us not to believe what we’ve seen with our own eyes”.Republican US senator Bill Cassidy said the “credibility” of ICE and the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were “at stake”.“There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,”Cassidy wrote in a post on X, after an ICE officer shot Good to death on 7 January and border patrol officers fatally shot Pretti on Saturday. “We can trust the American people with the truth.”Other Democrat lawmakers, including US House member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, both of New York, also issued calls for federal immigration authorities to leaveMinnesota. They urged Senate Democrats to vote against funding the US Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and border patrol, during budget negotiations in the coming days.“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny,” Ocasio-Cortezposted on X.On Sunday morning, US senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Adam Schiff of California, both Democrats, said they would vote against the impending department of homeland security funding.View image in fullscreenPeople take part in a demonstration on Sunday, a day after Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters“When they’re killing two constituents in my state, and they’re taking two-year-olds out of the arms of their mom, and they are taking an elder Hmong man out of his house and putting him out there in his underwear, and then figuring out they have the wrong man … no, I am not voting for this funding,” Klobuchar told NBC’s Meet the Press, alluding to incidents involving federal immigration agents that have drawn heavy media scrutiny.Schiff said he was “not giving ICE or border patrol another dime, given how this agency, these agencies are operating”.Schumer, the Senate minority leader, first announced on Saturday that he and his fellow Democrats would not provide the necessary votes if DHS funding remains in the measure. A spokesperson for Senate majority leader John Thune said DHS and other government funds will be voted on as a single package. Without a compromise, the government faces a partial shutdown at the end of January.Schiff warned that a government shutdown would result if Republicans “insist” on combining immigration enforcement funding with other government appropriations. “It will be a Republican decision,” he said. “They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”Connecticut US senator Chris Murphy, also a Democrat, told CNN’s State of the Union that Democrats “can’t vote to fund this lawless Department of Homeland Security … that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls all across the country, in violation of the law.”View image in fullscreenPeople gather on Sunday at a makeshift memorial at the site where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: Tim Evans/ReutersThe New Jersey governor, Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, told CNN that the confrontations inMinneapoliswas not about sanctuary cities.“This goes far beyond that,” she said. “This is about a basically Stasi-type force of secret police that wear masks, that are unidentifiable, that are unaccountable, that have leadership in theTrump administrationblatantly lying about what’s going on, when the American people can see the video.”Meanwhile, Pretti’s parents, Michael and Susan, called for “the truth” to be told about their son.“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” they said. “The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.”Alex Pretti did not brandish gun, witnesses say in sworn testimonyRead moreThe family’s statement came after US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem made the claim that Pretti brandished a gun before agents fired “defensive shots” at him. None of the ubiquitous video evidence shows Pretti brandishing a gun.Klobuchar also said that the Trump administration had described the shooting, which is shown in several eyewitness videos circulating widely on social media, “in ways that simply aren’t true.“I just keep thinking, your eyes don’t lie,” Klobuchar said. “Law enforcement is based on trust, and we have had a total breakdown of trust.”She called for a “transparent” investigation into the shooting and called for the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agents to leave Minnesota.The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, told Meet the Press that “there’s obviously an investigation that’s ongoing”.“Secretary Noem talked about that yesterday, which is what we would expect anytime a tragedy like this occurs,” Blanche said.But he disagreed with the premise that the videos of the encounter told the whole story. “We don’t know what happened in the minutes leading up to what we just watched. We don’t know what ICE saw, what ICE heard,” Blanche said of Pretti’s killing by federal agents. “That’s part of the investigation that’s going to be happening.View image in fullscreenOfficers from Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA) at the scene on Sunday where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents on Saturday, in Minneapolis.Photograph: Adam Gray/AP“You see a violent interaction with the man who was shot. And so we don’t know. No matter how many times you look at it, no matter how many different angles that we see, there’s a lot that we don’t see.”Blanche re-iterated the government’s position that the anti-immigration enforcement protesters were not peaceful. “They are trying to impede and obstruct ICE, and it makes the job that our men and women have to do virtually impossible to do without interactions like that,” he said.But, alluding to Minnesota governor Tim Walz and his fellow Democrat Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, Blanche added: “Make no mistake about it. This was entirely avoidable if we had a governor, if we had a mayor, if we had leadership in Washington and over in Minnesota that actually cared about their citizens.”FBI supervisor resigns after trying to investigate agent who shot Renee GoodRead moreBorder patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino was asked why federal agents shot and killed Pretti.“You don’t know he was unarmed,” Bovino told CNN’s Dana Bash. “I don’t know he was unarmed. That’s freeze-frame adjudication of a crime scene via a photo. That’s why we have investigators.“The facts are going to come to light as to what exactly happened with an investigation.”When asked by Bash whether he was blaming the victim, he said, “The victims are the border [atrol agents.”During a Sunday afternoon press conference, Bovino was asked about the videos that show Pretti was unarmed before being shot and killed. He said there are, “Many videos out there, many different accounts that you may see that I may see.”“Folks, this is why we have something called an investigation, to take what you’re talking about, to take those videos, to take witness statements, to take, officer statements, all those minute details that will paint a true picture, not a freeze frame concept, and paint a larger picture of what really happened.“That is why we investigate, so we can get to the truth, so there’s not speculation.”He added that they still don’t know how many shots were fired. And he said “all agents that were involved in that scene are working, not in Minneapolis, but in other locations that’s for their safety”.View image in fullscreenA man leads the crowd in the Pledge Of Allegiance at a makeshift memorial for Alex Pretti in south Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Sunday.Photograph: Craig Lassig/EPABovino had pushed that the operation in Minneapolis had really been about targeting Jose Huerta-Chuma, someone they described as an undocumented immigrant who needed to be taken off the streets. He said Huerta-Chuma was in the process of being taken into custody when “agitators, rioters and anarchists” prevented the arrest.But Minnesota’s Department of Corrections (DOC) contradicted Bovino’s characterization of Huerta-Chuma as having a “significant criminal history”. According to DOC records and Minnesota court data, the individual identified by federal officials has never been in the state’s custody and has no felony commitments.DOC records also indicated that someone with Huerta-Chuma’s name was previously held in federal immigration custody in a local Minnesota jail in 2018, during Trump’s first presidency. The decision to release him from federal custody would have been made by Trump administration officials. DOC said it had no information explaining why Huerta-Chuma was released. And Bovino had no explanation when asked by a reporter on Sunday.He instead remarked about Pretti, saying: “When someone makes the choice to come into an active law enforcement scene, interfere, obstruct, delay or assault a law enforcement officer, and they bring a weapon to that, that is a choice that individual made.”View image in fullscreenMakeshift memorial at the site where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal immigration agents, in Minneapolis.Photograph: Tim Evans/ReutersRepublican US senator Lindsey Graham also took the line that “an armed man trying to impede a lawful arrest is a recipe for disaster”. The South Carolina Republican said he expects law enforcement officers to use good judgement “but not to foolishly risk their lives or the lives of others”.“If you go to such events with a loaded gun, bad things can happen,” Graham added, though it is legal in Minnesota to possess guns in public places with a permit. Permit holders who don’t have both the document and a license on them can face a misdemeanor $25 fine.Late Saturday, a federal judge issued an order blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Pretti’s killing, after Minnesota officials sued DHS.The Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, said the suit demanded “a full, impartial, and transparent investigation into [Pretti’s] fatal shooting at the hands of DHS agents [that] is non-negotiable”.Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara, meanwhile, said information about what led up to the shooting was limited. As protests erupted in Minneapolis on Saturday, federal officers impeded state investigators from accessing the scene of Pretti’s killing.Trump responded to Pretti’s shooting with his typical combativeness. The Republican president accused Walz and Frey of “inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous and arrogant rhetoric”.Vice-President JD Vance for his part claimed events in Minneapolis were “engineered chaos” resulting from “far-left agitators, working with local authorities”.ICE and border patrols officials were scheduled to hold a news briefing early Sunday afternoon in Minneapolis.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsMinnesotaBarack ObamaMichelle ObamanewsShareReuse this content"

Another statement from Edwards on Sunday said he had managed to get GoFundMe to make Pretti’s father, Michael, the beneficiary of the campaign – “so their family now has direct access to the funds raised”.Calls mount on Trump administration to fully investigate Alex Pretti’s killingRead more“Thank you all so much for your support,” Edwards also wrote as donations came in from about 18,500 users.GoFundMe didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.Pretti, 37, was a registered nurse working in the intensive care unit at the Minneapolis VA healthcare system, which serves veterans.Videoscirculating online on Saturday showed Pretti directing traffic and filming federal immigration agents who descended on Minneapolis at the behest of the Trump White House.In one of the videos, Pretti held up his phone in his right hand, with his left hand empty. Other videos show him coming to the defense of a legal observer who was shoved to the ground by a federal officer. That officer then sprays Pretti with a chemical agent, repeatedly, before tackling him to the street with other agents.As the officers held him down and hit him, one of them reached to Pretti’s lower back and stepped away with what appeared to be a gun. Video captured one of the agents then shouting: “Gun! Gun!”Another officer pulled a gun out and evidently shot Pretti once at close range. A second officer pointed a gun at Pretti as he and his colleagues stepped back, and a volley of 10 more shots erupted, video evidence showed.Pretti was legally permitted to carry a gun, and none of the video evidence – taken from multiple angles – depicted him ever brandishing one.Man killed in Minneapolis by federal agents identified as VA nurse Alex Pretti: ‘He wanted to help people’Read moreIn a statement to Minneapolis news outletKare 11, Pretti’s father and mother, Susan, described themselves as “heartbroken but also very angry”. They dismissed what they called “sickening lies” from Trump administration officials after US homeland security secretaryKristi Noemon Saturday floated the observably false accusation that Pretti was shot dead upon approaching federal officers while brandishing a gun.Noem also accused Pretti of harboring an intent “to kill law enforcement”, prompting his parents to say in their statement: “Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly [immigration] thugs.“Please get the truth about our son. He was a good man.”Pretti’s killing came 17 days afterRenee Nicole Good, also a 37-year-old American citizen, was shot dead in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer, with video showing her trying to drive away from him. A GoFundMe campaign meant to financially support Good’s familyraisedmore than $1.5m before organizers closed it two days after her shooting death.Street protests met both Good and Pretti’s slayings, along with widespread calls for the officers at the center of the cases to be held accountable.Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisUS immigrationUS politicsTrump administrationMinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

We stand shoulder to shoulder with our fellow Minnesotans in the face of a hostile federal government.”On Friday, labor unions, community leaders, and faith leaders organized aDay of Truth & Freedom,calling foran economic blackout of no work, no shopping and no school.Minnesotans strike to protest ICE surge in state: ‘No work, no school, no shopping’Read moreOrganizers of the Day of Truth & Freedom have been targeting large corporations in demanding they take stands against ICE, including ceasing economic activity with the agency, and banning the agency from entering work sites.Target, Home Depot, Enterprise, Delta Airlines and Hilton weretargetedwith actions leading up to the 23 January economic blackout. Hundreds of Target workers signed onto aletteraddressed to the company’s CEO and other leaders criticizing the company’s silence on the ICE operations in Minnesota. None of the companies responded to multiple requests for comment.“It’s so sad to see Target so silent,” said Sheletta Brundidge, an activist andorganizerin Minneapolis whostarteda Target boycott with activist Nekima Levy Armstrong against the companyrescindingtheir diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Levy Armstrong was recentlydetainedby the FBI for an anti-ICE protest at a Minnesota church. Brundidge’s marketing companypreviously workedwith Target.“That Target CEO should be out in the street talking to people. He should be part of the protesting. He should make sure that the neighbors to his company’s headquarters are taken care of. Has he gone out to the site where Renee Good was killed and dropped off water or hand warmers? Have they done anything for her children? Has he stepped out of that ivory tower to look around and see what is going on?” added Brundidge.View image in fullscreenSheletta Brundidge and Nekima Levy Armstrong in front of Target in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Photograph: photo courtesy of Cameron Brundidge“There was a protest that marched right in front of his headquarters on Friday. They didn’t even mention it, they are silent, and silence says something. Silence doesn’t mean I don’t know what to say. Silence says I don’t give a damn. I don’t care about the people that shop here. I don’t care about the people who work here. I don’t care about the people in this community. I don’t care. Keep spending your money.”Target’s executives reportedly met with clergy in Minneapolis last week who protested in the company’s lobby.

Immigrant workers and business owners generate $41bn annually in economic output for Minnesota.“We want ICE out of Minnesota. In construction, they are causing harm and chaos. People can’t work,” said a construction worker in Minnesota, a member ofCentro de Trabajadores Unidos en La Lucha(CTUL), who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation to their immigration status.The worker and several of his co-workers and allies delivered a petition to thelargestUS house developer by volume, DR Horton, at their regional office in Lakeville, Minnesota, on 21 January.They are demanding the developer prevent ICE from entering job sites without a valid warrant and to demand an end to the ICE violence and raids. The worker said no one came to speak with the group, but the police were called to ask the group to leave, which they did peacefully.“The police said we need to leave because it is private property, and a few community members pointed out that this is precisely what we are asking of DR Horton – to not allow ICE on their private job sites without a signed and valid judicial warrant,” said Jac Kovarik, the communications coordinator for CTUL, in a statement on the action.DR Horton did not respond to multiple requests for comment.‘We have to stand together’: Minnesota economic blackout organizers push to take demonstrations nationwideRead more“Me and my coworkers haven’t been working for a month now,” added the worker. “ICE agents are going to construction sites, they’re circling around, apprehending people, assaulting people without a warrant.”He noted his church has been providing food and helping to cover rent for him and his co-workers as ICE’s operations have halted construction projects for the contractor where he works.A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security called the actions of labor unions and workers “beyond insane. Why would these labor bosses not want these public safety threats out of their communities?”They added, “these are the criminals these labor bosses are trying to protect,” citing 23 unnamed photos of claimed undocumented immigrants arrested inMinnesotawith criminal records.Under the Trump administration, thousands of peopletargetedby ICE havenocriminalrecord, and numerousUS citizenshavealsobeendetained.

Don’t believe me? Look at the numbersGene MarksMultiple small-business indexes show an uptick in optimism as well as an easing of cost pressures and uncertaintySun 25 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 10.02 ESTShareRegardless of all the challenges they face, small businesses have been doing pretty well in this country across the board. Don’t believe me? Take a look at some of the latest numbers.For more than 50 years, the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) has published a monthly report ofsmall-business economic trends, based on a random sample of the organization’s approximately 300,000 member firms. This survey is one of the longest and most consistent of any I follow, using the same questionnaire since 1973. So where do things stand?Last year ended with a second consecutive monthly uptick in small-business optimism, with small-business owners anticipating that economic conditions would remain generally favorable going into 2026. Business owners reported that their cost pressures moderated, employment challenges eased (for most) and capital investments picked up.“The December data also delivered good news on a major 2025 pain point, with a welcome improvement in uncertainty,” reported the study’s economists.Afraid to take vacation? The problem isn’t your boss – it’s how you workRead moreFiserv’sSmall Business Index, which aggregates consumer spending activity from point-of-sale transaction data across some 2m US small firms, highlighted that monthly sales rose over the prior month in December.“December’s sales gains show the resilience of small businesses during a competitive holiday season,” said Prasanna Dhore, chief data officer at Fiserv. “Consumers focused on essentials and made selective discretionary purchases, driven by ongoing cost pressures. These patterns, resulting in modest monthly sales growth, highlight how small businesses continue to adjust in a challenging economic climate.”Comerica Bank’sSmall Business Pulse Index, a survey of more than 1,000 small-business owners across the US, found 80% of respondents in mid-November were “somewhat or very confident” about their business outlook for the next 12 months, with 79% anticipating revenue growth in 2026 – and an average projected increase of 7.9%. Technology and construction firms led in optimism, while sole proprietors and retail businesses showed more caution. Some 57% of the businesses in the survey said they were planning to make capital expenditures, and more than half said that recent Federal Reserve rate cuts had positively affected their business.Intuit, the maker of QuickBooks, publishes its own monthlySmall Business Index, drawn from transactions across more than 420,000 small businesses in its database. The company’s January numbers show that small-business employment increased modestly, with upticks in eight of 12 industry sectors. The company also reported that small-business employment increased in all eight US regions and that hiring increased in 13 of 20 states tracked. The index also showed reported revenue was up in all US regions compared with November.This doesn’t mean that everyone’s doing great. We live in a big country. There are 33m small businesses. We all have different challenges.The NFIB reports that members in the agricultural industry are struggling with tariffs and dramatically higher costs, some retailers are seeing slower sales (and increased competition from big box stores), many truckers are struggling with increased regulations and some service firms are struggling to convince consumers to spend money when other prices remain high.Comerica says small businesses are still very much concerned with inflation, tariffs and regulations, with “most expecting tariff impacts to persist or worsen in 2026”.Among the small businesses that I work for, finding talent remains a persistent issue. And the rising cost of healthcare – a critical employee benefit – is creating huge pressures, for both companies and their employees.But no one said that running your own business was easy. If it were, more people would be doing it. And more of the people who choose to be business owners would stay in business longerthan just a few years.But, for the most part, US small businesses fared pretty well in 2025, and a significant majority are optimistic about the coming year. Maybe that’s the glass-is-half-full attitude of the American entrepreneur. We’ll see.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessUS economySmall businesscommentShareReuse this content"

He is, though,a fast-emerging and special talentspearheading a versatile and resilient group that adjusted effectively after early struggles against Denver, defended stoutly and did just enough to beat under-strength opponents who did not make the most of their chances in what devolved into a dour contest in awful weather.Maye will be the youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl since Dan Marino in 1985. “What an atmosphere out here, battling the elements. Love this team,” Maye told CBS Sports after the game. “It wasn’t ideal; the defence have been stepping up all play-offs. We are going to play better.”By reaching the Super Bowl in his first season as head coach, Vrabel is joining a club with onlyseven other members. The 50-year-old former Patriots linebacker, a three-time Super Bowl winner as a player, spent six seasons as head coach of the Tennessee Titans,losing the AFC championship gameto Kansas City six years ago. Now he has the opportunity to win as a Patriot once again and become the first man to take the title as a player and a coach with the same team. “From day one he’s been the same guy, coaches hard but at the same time cares about us a lot,” Maye said.Vrabel paid tribute to his players’ ability to adapt. “We have found different ways [to win] this entire season. Today was different conditions and we did what we had to do to win a football game,” he told CBS.New England are the firstNFLteam ever to go 9-0 on the road and equalled the San Francisco 49ers’ record of 40 all-time playoff wins with this success. The script-flipping Patriots had endured two 4-13 regular seasons then surged to 14-3 in this campaign.They were pre-game favourites, especially after comfortable victories over the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans in the wildcard and divisional rounds. It was clear, though, that the prior week’s victory owed much to a miserable afternoon for CJ Stroud, the Texans’ mushy-armed, possibly blindfolded, quarterback.And in Denver they profited from the absence of Bo Nix, Denver’s first-choice quarterback,who suffered an ankle fractureat the end of a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills a week earlier in the divisional round. He was watching from an Empower Field executive box after surgery and initially liked what he saw from his replacement, Jarrett Stidham, an obscure 29-year-old journeyman thrust into the spotlight and making his first start for 749 days.Stidham and Joe Webb of the Minnesota Vikings (in January 2013) are the only quarterbacks since 1950 to start a playoff game without a passing yard to their name during the same season, according to ESPN. Entering the afternoon with 20 NFL regular-season appearances and four starts, Stidham had the fewest career starts of any quarterback in a conference championship game since 1970.View image in fullscreenJarrett Stidham had to contend with tough conditions on Sunday.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APPrior to Sunday his main contribution to the team appeared to be providing a portable stereo nicknamedMr Turtlethat he uses to “keep the vibes high in the locker room.” But it did not take him long to find his rhythm against the Patriots. Strutting, winking and smiling, acting as if he had been out on centre stage every week, the back-up blossomed.Naturally, New England attacked Stidham from the first seconds. But a 52-yard throw to Marvin Mims early in the first quarter set up the opening touchdown, with Stidham then finding an open Courtland Sutton in the end zone.Perhaps getting carried away with the strong start, Denver head coach Sean Payton – the 62-year-old former New Orleans Saints boss, who led the franchise to its only Super Bowl title in February 2010 – made a characteristically aggressive decision. Denver ran on a fourth down rather than bank a field goal and increase the lead to 10-0. This backfired when an incomplete pass returned possession to the visitors and ultimately proved fatal in a game the Broncos lost by three points.At the time, though, it sent a confident signal. And what did Maye and the Patriots have in response? Very little. New England were bamboozled and on the back foot, with Denver looking crisp, purposeful and positive until it all crumbled in a couple of seconds. An unforced error from Stidham late in the second quarter led to a third-down loss of possession as he back-pedalled and flung the ball backwards when tackled, with the officials ruling it a fumble. Maye then sauntered a short distance into the end zone for a touchdown. The smiles stopped. It was quite a vibe shift.Wil Lutz missed a 54-yard field goal for Denver with 20 seconds left at the end of the half; there was still time for a 63-yard kick attempt by Andres Borregales for New England that drifted wide.Borregales did give the Patriots the lead in the third quarter with a 23-yard field goal to conclude a lengthy drive as snowflakes fluttered then flurried. With visibility reducing by the minute in blowing snow, and the Patriots’ white uniforms increasingly camouflaged, the New England kicker veered a 46-yard effort wide to the right.Denver toiled despite that reprieve and the mood in Mile High transformed from sparkling to flat as they were suffocated in the slippery snow. The Broncos were comeback experts this season but this game became an arctic battle of attrition: far from pretty, not that anyone could see what was going on with much clarity, let alone plot a forward path.With under five minutes on the clock, Lutz’s potentially equalising 45-yard goal attempt was tipped wide. And with 2 minutes and 11 seconds left, Stidham went long but his overly risky throw was intercepted. Denver’s last best chance was gone, and the back-up quarterback’s good vibes were a distant memory. A new Patriots generation, meanwhile, seems to be slipping back into the franchise’s storied old routine.Explore more on these topicsNFLNew England PatriotsDenver BroncosUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Senior Trump administration officials have claimed Pretti intended to “massacre” federal officers with a handgun but video of the killingappears to contradict those claims.Two-time NBA All-star Tyrese Haliburton, one of the best young players in the league, posted about the killing on Saturday. “Alex Pretti was murdered,”the Indiana Pacers guard wrote.Alex Pretti did not brandish gun, witnesses say in sworn testimonyRead moreThere were strong reactions from the WNBA. Two-time WNBA MVP Breanna Stewartheld a signreading “ABOLISH ICE” before her team’s game in Unrivaled, the league she co-founded. Another WNBA star, Angel Reese,posted“Praying for our country” on X.Stewart later expanded on her decision to hold the sign. “We’re so fueled by hate right now instead of love, so I wanted to have a simple message of ‘Abolish ICE,’ which means having policies to uplift families and communities instead of fueling fear and violence,” she said.Stewart said her wife, Marta Xargay, is in the process of applying for US citizenship and the immigration crackdown has become a personal issue.“It’s scary. You see it on social media, you see it splitting up families and dissecting communities and kids are being involved. It’s the worst in all ways,” Stewart said. “And to be married to Marta ... we’re working to get her citizenship, and she is a legal permanent resident and all of that. But it seems like it doesn’t matter. And I think that that’s why these policies need to be put in place, that reform needs to happen, because it doesn’t seem to be affecting the right people.

United scored with outstanding strikes from distance by Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha in the second half to stun the leaders.Arteta’s team of ruthless cyborgs malfunction in way that is all too human | Jonathan WilsonRead more“The first half an hour we’re very dominant,” Arteta said, “playing the areas that we wanted, scored a goal, had two fantastic chances to score another one. And after that, we gave them the goal.”Zubimendi’s mistake was not the only Arsenal error, perhaps a result of the successive goalless draws in the previous Premier League games ramping up a sense of anxiety.“The first error leads to the second one,” Arteta said. “There were three or four, which is very unusual today – but they are part of football and today we got punished. In the end, we have to show the mental strength we have on matchdays.”Arteta resisted the temptation to complain about two possible handballs – the ball may have brushed Dorgu’s hand before he lashed in the goal that put United 2-1 up, although replays were not conclusive, while a shot hit Harry Maguire’s hand which was presumably deemed not to be an offence because it was breaking his fall.Cunha’s stunner earns Manchester United thrilling late win at ArsenalRead moreArteta said: “With the changes, we managed to shift the energy, scored the second goal, and you could feel that everything changed and the game was there to go and win it. In the next action, Noni [Madueke] is one v one in the six-yard box. We don’t get anything out of that. It goes to a goal-kick … one pass, win the duel, and Cunha puts it in the perfect angle to lose all the momentum, all the good energy that we were building up and to go and win the game for them.”The Arsenal manager also refused to be critical of fans who gave the home side a smattering of boos at half-time. “We have to do more, and when we do that we can rest in peace.”Michael Carrick, who has overseen impressive wins against the top two in his first two matches in interim charge of United, praised the game intelligence of his players. “We understood the flow of the game,” he said. “At times we were going to be a little bit up against it and digging in. You’ve got to take a bit of control and calm things down a bit. And we got two fantastic goals.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaMichael CarrickManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

The rest of the field, led by Germany’s Emma Aicher, trailed by more than two seconds.Shiffrin’s victory came a day aftershe earned her first giant slalom podiumin two years. But the 30-year-old was reluctant to read too much into those results and how they may translate to her form for the Olympics, where she plans to start in slalom, GS, and the team combined.“At the Olympics is a totally different challenge,” said Shiffrin, who won Olympic slalom gold in 2014 and GS gold four years later, but didn’t finish any of her technical events in 2022.“I’ve had great Olympics, I’ve had tough Olympics, I try to go in with an open mind, good spirit, trusting my team,” she added. “We’re coming in with strong athletes, so it’s time to enjoy that.”This weekend’s races took place at the Czech venue of Shiffrin’s World Cup debut at age 15 in March 2011.“It just feels amazing to be here. I feel like when I was 15 years old still, like, I don’t know, just love skiing. I just love skiing. That’s the best feeling to be here,” Shiffrin said.Clinching the slalom globe and setting yet another record was not on her mind during the race, she said.“It’s actually hard to think about that today because there was so much to think about on the race course,” Shiffrin said. “So now it’s like a nice surprise.”Shiffrin won her first slalom globe at the age of 18 in March 2013,her most recentcame two years ago. Last season, she led the standings but thenmissed two months of racing after a crashand Zrinka Ljutic of Croatia took the title.Shiffrin’s 71 career race wins in slalom and 108 overall are both records for men and women.“I’m motivated by like the ability to ski faster. In slalom, I’m right up against actually the ceiling or the limit of how fast I believe that I can ski,” she said. “With GS, I feel that there is still room to grow and still room to move. For me, that’s the motivating thing, it’s like ‘What can I do better or more consistent or more athletic?’”Shiffrin’s seven wins from eight slaloms give her an insurmountable 288-point lead over second-placed Rast in the season standings. There are two more slaloms scheduled after the Olympics, with a race win worth 100 points. Rast triumphed in the only slalom Shiffrin didn’t win this season, in Slovenia three weeks ago.The women’s World Cup continues in Crans-Montana with a downhill and a super-G next weekend, the last races before the Olympics.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Jovic’s third-round win against the No 7 seed, Jasmine Paolini, was the first top-20 win of her career. Still, Jovic rejected the notion that she is swinging freely with nothing to lose.“I don’t really feel like there is a lot of house money or underdog mentality that I’m feeling, because I don’t feel like I have been playing anything outside of my comfort zone or outside of my normal level,” Jovic said.Australian Open 2026: De Minaur sets up Alcaraz clash, Svitolina beats Andreeva – as it happenedRead more“I have come from two other tournaments where I was playing every day and winning a lot of matches, as well. So this week and the level that I’m showing right now doesn’t really feel much different than that. So it’s just another week that I’m winning more matches, which is nice to see.”Jovic’s supreme performances have afforded her the biggest match of her young career as she will face Aryna Sabalenka, the No 1 seed and two-time champion, in the quarter‑final. In one of her most impressive performances at the tournament, Sabalenka elevated her level after a late surge from the immensely talented 19-year-old Victoria Mboko to win 6-1, 7-6 (1) andadvance to her 13th consecutive grand slam quarter-final.Shortly after their matches on Sunday, Jovic returned to the court in doubles alongside Mboko, where the pair competed for 2hr 39min against the fourth seeds, Elise Mertens and Zhang Shuai, before losing 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (10).“Me and Vicky signed up for this doubles for fun. We went to the first match, and we were not sure if there was [advantages]. So we were asking the ref: ‘Do we play ads? What’s going on here?’ Then we realised there were ads, and I didn’t realise until today that there was a third set. So I was like: ‘Oh my God, what? This is going to be three times longer than my singles match.’ Then it went six in the third.“But at that point I was like: ‘All right.’ One of the most unbelievable doubles matches I’ve ever played. It was outrageous. The crowd was going crazy. There were so many long points. It was a lot of fun. My soul is a little hurt that we lost that one, because it got so close, and I wanted that win.”Coco Gauff and Elina Svitolina will face each other in the other top‑half quarter-final after Gauff, the third seed, survived the challenge of the 19th seed, Karolina Muchova, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.

The challenge had originally been scheduled to take place on Saturday but was postponed because of rain.Cheers erupted from a gathered crowd as Honnold, 40, began to climb the 101-floor building in Taiwan’s capital city, and again when he paused at one point and turned around to face them.Alex Honnold’s made-for-Netflix free solo of Taipei 101 draws awe – and uneaseRead moreThe 91-minute ascent was broadcast globally onSkyscraper Live, Netflix’s latest foray into live sports programming.“It was like what a view, it’s incredible, what a beautiful day,” Honnold, also known for his ropeless ascent of the mountain El Capitan in Yosemite national park, said after scaling the building. “It was very windy, so I was like, ‘don’t fall off the spire’. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.”Netflix and Honnold drew a backlash from some in the climbing community over the ethical implications of broadcasting such a high-risk endeavour live. Critics, including a Wall Street Journal columnist, have pointed to the high number of free-solo deaths and to Honnold’s role as a husband and father. They called the event “voyeuristic, ghoulish and irresponsible”.Honnold said he hoped people would be inspired in their own path after seeing his achievement. “I think that people often find the inspiration that they need to pursue their own challenges or their own goals. It’s often the kick they need to do whatever it is that they want to do in their life,” he said.“Often they’ll watch something like this and it’s a reminder that their time is finite and they should use it in the best way, the most meaningful way that they can. If anything, I hope that that’s what people take from it.”Honnold needed the full support and permission of Taipei 101 and the city’s government before embarking on the challenge.Taiwanese politicians thanked Honnold and Netflix on social media for putting the country – more accustomed to featuring in global headlines for its semiconductor prowess or Chinese military threats – in the international spotlight with such a different perspective.“Congratulations to the brave, fearless Alex for completing the challenge,” the island’s president, Lai Ching-te, wrote on his Facebook page.“Through Netflix’s live broadcast cameras, the world didn’t just see Taipei 101 – it also saw the warmth and passion of the Taiwanese people, and the beautiful hills and scenery of this land.”There is a long tradition in the US of live-broadcast daredevil feats, from Evel Knievel’s motorcycle jumps in the 1970s to Red Bull’s modern-day record attempts.Honnold is not the first climber to ascend Taipei 101, but he is the first to do so without a rope. France’s Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004 as part of the grand opening of what was then the world’s tallest building.Robert, who was covering Honnold’s ascent for CNN,offered his congratulationson Sunday, saying he could understand what he must be feeling. “For me, it felt incredible. Although I was not risking my life because I had a rope, the weather conditions were so horrible it took me four hours.“I know Alex, all along I was confident … I didn’t worry at all.”Taipei 101, which dominates the city’s skyline and is a major tourist attraction, was the tallest building in the world between 2004 and 2010 before being eclipsed by Dubai’s Burj Khalifa.Having a cheering crowd was unusual and a bit unnerving at first for Honnold, whose climbs are usually in remote areas.“When I was leaving the ground, you’re like ‘oh it’s kind of intense, there’s so many people watching’,” he said. “But then honestly, they’re all wishing me well. I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.”The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section – the “bamboo boxes” that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.Explore more on these topicsSportNetflixTaiwanRock climbingAsia PacificShareReuse this content"

The clubs are focused on the payment structure of the deal and it is understood that it is moving in the right direction.Fernandes and Bowen boost West Ham survival push in win over SunderlandRead moreIt remains to be seen if West Ham alter their position of being willing to sell Paquetá only if he returns to them on loan for the rest of the season. Paquetá is desperate to return to Brazil and Flamengo want him in their side as soon as possible. West Ham, though, are in 18th place in the Premier League and feel the 28-year-old should help them in their bid to stay up.Paquetá has grown disillusioned with life in England since being accused of spot-fixing by the Football Association.He was cleared of the chargesby an independent disciplinary commission last summer but has made it clear that he wants to leave West Ham during this transfer window. The former Lyon player has missed West Ham’s past three games. He is nursing a minor back injury.Nuno Espírito Santo, West Ham’s manager, has said he believes Paquetá will play for the club again. However, there are some figures within West Ham who think the best solution would be to grant Paquetá his wish to go home. The Hammers, who are five points below 17th-placed Nottingham Forest, remain in talks with Fulham over a deal for Adama Traoré.Selling Paquetá would give West Ham funds to reinforce their squad.They have spent up to £47.5m on the strikers Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos. Nuno wants to bring in a goalkeeper, a defender and a midfielder.A replacement is needed for the Argentina midfielder Guido Rodríguez, who is joining Valencia after agreeing to terminate his contract by mutual consent. Nuno believes that West Ham, whose mood has lifted after three consecutive wins in all competitions, need to rebalance his squad after years of poor recruitment.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowWest Ham UnitedFlamengonewsShareReuse this content"

It’s frustrating. Our crossing was poor.”Howe employs so many analysts these days that there is a suspicion Newcastle have become a little too formulaic, a bit overly data driven.Here the off-the-cuff brilliance of Rogers and Buendía in particular made the difference on a day when consistently intelligent defending from Ezri Konsa and company, not to mention some excellent goalkeeping on Emiliano Martínez’s part, also proved pivotal.View image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez saves a header from Newcastle’s Lewis Miley.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAGranted, Newcastle might have taken an early lead had Martínez, making his 200thPremier Leagueappearance, not done extremely well to deny Sandro Tonali with an outstretched foot. Nick Pope, though, was soon performing similar wonders to divert a Watkins shot away for a corner after Jadon Sancho’s fine through pass.Pope, though, had no answer to Buendía’s swerving, dipping and thoroughly stunning opening goal dispatched from just outside the area after a lovely team move featuring, inevitably, a pivotal contribution from Rogers.Villa had conceded 12 goals on their previous three visits to St James’ Park alone and were without a win here since 2005 but, as they played through Newcastle almost at will in the first half, this felt different. “My players were extraordinary,” Emery said. “The individual and collective discipline was so high.”Although Martínez was again required to excel when saving Lewis Miley’s header following Anthony Gordon’s cross, a home midfield lacking the injured Bruno Guimarães struggled to help subdue Rogers’s disorientating change of pace and sheer invention in possession.This was only the 11th top‑tier game Guimarães had missed since arriving from Lyon four years ago and, ominously for Howe, Newcastle have won none of them. “Bruno was a big miss for us,” the home manager said. “He’s the focal point for a lot of our buildups; we missed his ability to pass forwards.”There is a chance the Brazilian’s injured ankle will have healed in time for the trip to Paris but that was of little consolation here – particularly on a day when Joelinton needed to temper his aggression after collecting an early yellow card and Tonali, although influential, did not have things all his own way against the similarly smart Youri Tielemans.It all dictated that the invitations presented by Emery’s sometimes riskily high defensive line were not being accepted by Yoane Wissa and friends.When Joelinton succumbed to a groin injury early in the second half, he was replaced by a Villa old boy, Jacob Ramsey. “It was a big blow to lose Joelinton,” Howe said. “We hope it’s not too serious.”At least Ramsey played quite well, his arrival coinciding with a mini home resurgence. Were Villa starting to feel the effects of their flight back from Istanbul in the early hours of Friday morning after aEuropa League win at Fenerbahce? Was the absence of the key midfielders John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara with knee injuries hurting them as much as feared?Perhaps and possibly, but Pope still needed to prove equal to a curling, counterattacking shot from Rogers and Howe felt it necessary to replace the underwhelming Wissa and Gordon with Nick Woltemade and Anthony Elanga.Not that it ultimately changed much. Watkins’s pace and movement had troubled Newcastle all game and, shortly after forcing Pope into a stellar save, he scored Villa’s second.View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa grabs the ball in delight after Ollie Watkins’ late goal for Aston Villa.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersHitherto, the principal visiting threat had been menacing long‑range shots but Villa’s second goal derived from a set piece. Or more specifically, Newcastle’s failure to clear a corner. The ball eventually dropped to Lucas Digne and his half‑volley across the box was met by Watkins’s diving header, prompting wild celebrations.“I am so, so happy,” Emery said. “My players were fantastic.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’m very happy to be here. But it’s two-way – I have to earn that and I hope over time they will see that something good might happen here.”View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro (second left) scores Chelsea's second goal, set up by Estêvão.Photograph: David Cliff/EPAGlasner was given a hearty reception when he emerged before ­kick‑off in Palace’s first home match since announcing he would leave at the end of the season. Any ill-feeling towards Jean-Philippe Mateta was also put aside by most until he was ­substituted late on after a week when the France striker also made no secret of his desire for a new challenge.There had been familiar groans when Mateta failed to capitalise on Benoît Badiashile’s error early on. It was the sort of chance that the 28‑year-old should be taking if he has aspirations to play at the World Cup and proved to be a turning point on an afternoon when his side really could have done with a victory.“We are in transition and there are going to be some tough periods,” said Glasner, who insisted he is not concerned that his side are only eight points clear of the bottom three. “But what characterisesCrystal Palaceand our fans is that we always stick together. That’s why it’s important to remember what JP has brought to the club. It would be unfair to blame him. Now is a moment to support everyone.”Chelsea had to make do without Cole Palmer because of a minor thigh problem, although the England forward is expected to be fit for the crucial Champions League game at Napoli on Wednesday. Ably supported by Fernández, Estêvão stepped into Palmer’s shoes seamlessly and the visitors should have gone ahead when the former fired over from inside the area after João Pedro failed to connect with Marc Cucurella’s cross.Palace also went close when Ismaïla Sarr volleyed just wide after a long throw-in caused panic in the Chelsea box. Moisés Caicedo was fortunate to escape a second yellow card when he pulled back Sarr on the break and it seemed as if the hosts were building up a head of steam. Yet Canvot – who had played only a handful of games in Ligue 1 for ­Toulouse before joining Palace for £23m in the summer – showed his inexperience when he badly underhit a back-pass that was seized upon by Estêvão. Tyrick ­Mitchell did his best to catch up with the 18‑year‑old but he was able to create the angle to beat Henderson.It could have been even worse for Palace by half-time if Estêvão had managed to hit the target when a poor cross from Chris Richards gave him another chance to stretch his legs.The away supporters did not have to wait long to celebrate again after the restart. Mateta was dispossessed by the former Palace loanee Trevoh Chalobah and he was able to find João Pedro. He exchanged passes with Estêvão before leaving Wharton on his backside as he beat Henderson.View image in fullscreenEnzo Fernández scores from the spot past Dean Henderson.Photograph: David Cliff/EPARosenior punched the air in delight as Glasner looked to the heavens. His expression changed to surprise when Darren England opted to award Chelsea a penalty after João Pedro’s shot was blocked by the unfortunate ­Canvot’s arm. The video assistant referee ruled that because it had been accidental, there was no red card, but Canvot was replaced immediately anyway after ­Fernández slammed home from the spot.Wharton was given his marching orders after flying into a challenge on Caicedo to pick up a second ­yellow in the space of six minutes. To their credit, Palace’s persistence was rewarded when Richards scrambled home from close range. But it was far too little, too late as their ­winless run goes on.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Manchester United were far superior in the second half with a clinical display as Elisabeth Terland, Jess Park, and Hanna Lundkvist – on her debut – all got on the scoresheet to claim the three points.Strikes from Verena Hanshaw and Shekiera Martinez helpedWest Hampick up a much needed second victory of the season with a 2-1 win againstLeicesterwhich stopped them from slipping to bottom spot.Rita Guarino also saw her team win for the first time since taking over in December and goals from Hanshaw and Martinez kept West Ham a point clear of safety despite a late own goal from Eva Nystrom which set up a grandstand finish.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Asked about his side’s sizeable advantage over the defending champions, Jeglertz remained level‑headed as usual, as he replied: “Of course I am very happy to be nine points ahead of Chelsea but, on the other hand, there are nine games left to play, you know the ball can bounce in different directions. There are no easy games in the league.“I’m not worried about the players [getting ahead of themselves]. We always talk about ‘take the next game, take the next game’. That’s the only way.”This was by no means an easy win. Nonetheless, Jeglertz’s team could have opened the scoring through Shaw when she was picked out at the back post by Kerolin’s hooked cross, but she appeared to lose her footing and knocked an effort wide from close range, in a first half the visitors dominated.View image in fullscreenKerolin scores Manchester City’s first goal.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAKerolin then raced on to a through ball and rolled it home superbly to make it 1-0, but Eder Maestre’s side struck back valiantly in the second half and played the majority of the second period deep in City’s defensive third.The hosts’ gradual pressure was rewarded when Freya Godfrey lashed in a rising strike in front of the home supporters, from a difficult angle, and anyone who thought Manchester City were going to canter to the finish line in May was having a rethink.The home side were watched from the stands by their owner, Michele Kang, as well as the former Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellas and her Barcelona teammate Patri Guijarro, who were attending as guests of friends and teammates. They watched the WSL newcomers go close when Kosovare Asllani fired over earlier in the second period, as they improved markedly after the break.Shaw, the WSL’s top scorer, nearly won it after being fed by Vivianne Miedema, but she lashed over. The Jamaican’s moment was still to come, however, and the away side celebrated the victory in a manner that made it clear they knew how important her late strike could be.View image in fullscreenFreya Godfrey celebrates scoring London City Lionesses’ equaliser.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters“It was a relief, almost. It was a tough game,” Jeglertz said. “We had control partly of the game but they were lethal in the transitions and, after they scored for 1-1, the game was very open. That says something about the league, also, that there are no easy points. If we are not on our absolute top level, teams will challenge us, and London City were doing that.“Even though the game was not the most beautiful game, we have players that can finish off the game. The players were just focusing on ‘How can we score?’ and making sure we got the three points.“In the end, there is something in this group, that ‘finding a way to win’ is crucial, and [our] winning mentality is great. I believe so much in the players and how we are playing. If we keep on doing that, this season will end in a good way.”It was Maestre’s first defeat since taking over during the WSL winter break but he was pleased with the improvements he feels his side are making, as he said: “We started a little scared. It’s not easy facing the first team in the league but, as the match moved forward, we were getting confident that we were able to get something more. I am very proud of the team.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLondon City LionessesManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But the intensity with which Forest set about their task was a far cry from the insipid efforts that led to boos from the away support in Braga on Thursday night. It wasBrentfordwho were off this pace on this occasion, and a second consecutive defeat had Keith Andrews calling for his team to be “ruthless and clinical”.Buendía and Watkins stun Newcastle to keep Aston Villa’s title hopes aliveRead moreDyche said: “I thought we did well, with and without the ball. We looked creative in the first half. In the second, we had to manage the game differently. The resilience of the side, I think, is improving. We’ve just taken six points away from home and a point against the league leaders. ThePremier Leagueis not just about having technical talent. It’s about learning the game. That’s a talent in itself, and it’s a big learning curve.”For Andrews, the disappointment was contained but real. His side had the greater number of chances, even if clearcut opportunities were at a premium, and things would surely have been different had the ball rolled obligingly for Igor Thiago in just the second minute of the match, but his stretched finish bobbled inches beyond the far post.“Really frustrating is the honest answer,” Andrews said of watching opportunities being spurned. “I want us to keep pushing and not just be content with a good performance. We have to be ruthless. We have to be clinical because games at this level are decided on those moments. They’ve had two shots on target and come away with three points.”Having weathered Brentford’s initial flurry, Forest took the lead in the 12th minute, after Ola Aina deflected a cross against Rico Henry and up into the west London air. With his marker, Kristoffer Ajer, pinned behind him, Igor Jesus watched the ball drop, controlled it off his shoulder, left Ajer in a heap, and buried a dagger of a shot back across goal. It was a strike that sent Jesus into a frenzy, just his second league goal of a frustrating debut season. It also sucked the breath out of the stadium, such was the decisive way in which it was taken.View image in fullscreenIgor Jesus’s early goal sucked the life out of the home crowd at the Gtech Community Stadium.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesForest settled into the game from there, Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson dictating the tempo for Dyche’s side. Brentford meanwhile looked to be something at a loss, their lightning transitions hampered by Forest’s happiness to dig in out of possession. An enforced double substitution on the 35th minute, with Mikkel Damsgaard and Ajer injured and replaced by Dango Ouattara and Sepp van den Berg, allowed for a change of shape, with a midfield three closing up space in the centre and allowing a shift back to parity, in terms of possession at least.The second half was a dull watch. Perhaps as a result of Brentford’s first‑half switch, play was condensed in the middle and space was at such a premium that only the quickest of interchanges could hope to create space, and they rarely did. Brentford had the better of the ball, and were able to maintain possession 30 yards out from the Forest goal but Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic refused to let anything beyond them, be it ball or man, and the sight of Brentford forwards being flung to the ground (legally) became commonplace.View image in fullscreenTaiwo Awoniyi celebrates with his crucifix-bearing shinpads.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAny sense of expectation appeared to be drained from both home players and supporters alike as Igor Thiago failed to make the most of two half-chances and another flick-on in the box was missed by Nathan Collins on the six‑yard line. With the hosts running out of ideas, Forest began to emerge from their shell and, with 10 minutes of normal time remaining, Gibbs-White took the ball out of the air to send Awoniyi away down the right.Making only his ninth appearance of the season, after the Nigerian’s recovery from abdominal surgery was complicated by further injuries, Awoniyi bested Van den Berg in a foot race, cut inside, watched Michael Kayode slide past him in a failed attempt at a late block, and finished smoothly past Caoimhín Kelleher. By way of celebration, Awoniyi removed his shinpads, which were both marked with a crucifix, and placed them over his eyes.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Oviedo defender David Carmo hesitated while attempting to clear, allowing Lamine Yamal to press and deflect the ball into Olmo’s path.The midfielder calmly slotted into the bottom corner in the 52nd minute to give the home side the lead, with Raphinha extending their advantage five minutes later thanks to another self-inflicted wound by Oviedo.Lamine Yamal put the result beyond doubt in the 73rd minute with a moment of brilliance.

The club held crunch boardroom talks on Sunday before deciding to relieve the manager of his position.The Foxes slumped to a humiliatinghome defeat against a struggling Oxford Unitedon Saturday and have won only one of their past five matches. Andy King, the club’s former Premier League-winning midfielder who has been first‑team coach since last season, will take interim charge but Leicester are expected to appoint an external successor.Soap, wifi, but no football: a room without a view at Blackpool’s stadium hotelRead moreLeicester appointed Cifuenteson a three-year contract last summerwith designs on an instant return to the Premier League, but they have failed to establish themselves as promotion contenders. The club have lost faith in the Spaniard, who spent the previous two seasons at QPR, after a series of inconsistent results and particularly poor recent performances.Leicester’s owner, Aiyawatt “Top” Srivaddhanaprabha, attended the defeat against Oxford at the King Power Stadium, during which supporters chanted against Cifuentes and also the club’s hierarchy. Fans have grown disillusioned with the ownership after being relegated from the Premier League in 2022-23. The director of football, Jon Rudkin, is under fierce scrutiny.Srivaddhanaprabha said in a statement released on Sunday afternoon: “This has been a difficult decision and not one I have taken lightly. I would like to thank Martí for the total commitment he has shown during his time at Leicester. He gave everything to the role and worked tirelessly to help us achieve our targets. However, I believe this is the right step at this time to improve performances and results, and to act in the best interests ofLeicester City. Martí leaves with our thanks and our best wishes for the future.”Quick GuideLeague Two: Fleetwood sack head coach Pete WildShowFleetwood Town have sacked head coach Pete Wild. His departure comes after the team were beaten 2-1 by Colchester on Saturday, taking their winless run to seven matches in all competitions, and leaves them 15th in the table.A statement from the League Two club said: \"Following six defeats in the last seven games the club felt now is the right time to make a change to the first team management.\"Assistant head coach Adam Temple will also depart and everyone at the club would like to place on record their thanks to Pete and Adam for their hard work and professionalism during his time at the club. The club will issue a further update on the first team staff in due course.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The club, who are close to appointing a technical director to work with Rudkin as well as a new chief executive, are hamstrung by profitability and sustainability regulations and face a points deduction this season for allegedly breaching rules. They are limited to signing loan players in this transfer window, which ends on Monday 2 February.The Foxes are without a clean sheet in 23 league games and have struggled to find consistency. Leicester return to league action at home against Charlton next Saturday. Cifuentes inherited an experienced squad but was unable to strengthen. They have not paid a transfer fee for a player this season despite selling about £50m of talent last summer.After the defeat by Oxford, Cifuentes said: “It’s not a pleasant situation as a manager and as a person because you want to do well for them and it’s sad that they feel this way. At the same time, I know football is about results. At the moment, there’s a number of fans who are not happy with a lot of things. But as the manager you need to be accountable and responsible.”Explore more on these topicsLeicester CityChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

Rangers moved to within four points of Hearts after the league leaders missed the chance to put considerable distance between themselves and Celtic.A three-horse race for the titleshould enthral.A contender must land a con­vincing blow to dethrone a champion but despite equalising twice, facing 10 men for the final 21 minutes and creating several clearcut openings, Hearts were unable to overcome Martin O’Neill’s tiring team.Celticimpressed sporadically but made their flashes of quality count through Benjamin Nygren’s free-kick and the incisive break that created a second for Yang Hyun-jun.Pressure firmly on Celtic in Scottish title race finally worthy of the nameRead moreThe visitors’ vulnerability at set pieces was punished by Stuart ­Findlay and Cláudio Braga. Blair ­Spittal, on as a substitute, almost won it for Derek ­McInnes’s team in the 97th minute, 20 minutes after Auston Trusty had been sent off, but his ­rising drive kissed the top of the Celtic crossbar.“It’s not the worst point when you come from behind twice but I still feel there was something more out there for us,” theHeartsmanager said. “The fact there’s a disappointed dressing room in there illustrates how far we’ve come.”Quick GuideRöhl talks up 'statement' Rangers win in title raceShowDanny Röhl, the Rangers manager, felt \"great\" following the \"statement\" 3-0 win against Dundee which narrowed the gap on Hearts, the Scottish Premiership leaders, to four points.James Tavernier, the Rangers captain, scored from the spot early in the second half before the substitutes Danilo and Djeidi Gassama added further goals in stoppage time for an eighth successive win in all competitions.Hearts' 2-2 draw with Celtic at Tynecastle meant that Rangers leapfrogged their Glasgow rivals to sit behind the Jambos as the title race heats up.Röhl said: \"Yeah, it feels great, but hopefully the feeling will be better and better during the second half of the season because there is still a long way to go. We know this.\"I know at Rangers the demand is high to get a lot of wins. But for me, it's also eight wins in a row. It's a statement, especially from the point we were at. And if you can continue this and you do your homework and you go again, then yeah, it's on.\"We knew before the game, it's not an easy one. Everyone expected us to win. Then you face an opponent who are on a small run. They're well organised, you have to break them down first.\"In the first half, we tried but in some moments we had too many players behind the ball instead of in the right areas. This was the topic at half-time. Then you come out fantastic, make the goal, then you have two or three good moments so you can score for 2-0 or 3-0 and then in some transition moments we were not clinical, we lose the ball, and we were a little bit too open.\"But finally, then the 3-0, for me, is a statement as well.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The roar that reverberated around Tynecastle at kick-off screamed ­volumes about the importance of the fixture. But the occasion appeared initially to get to Hearts, whose approach was too forced and too rushed. Cooler heads eventually improved the home team’s performance.There were debutants on both sides with the Birmingham loanee Marc Leonard starting in central midfield for Hearts and Tomas Cvancara, the towering Czech forward signed on an initial loan from Borussia ­Moenchengladbach, leading the line for Celtic.Leonard’s influence grew after a difficult start in which he dragged Nygren to the ground just outside the area. Nygren took the free-kick and swept a powerful shot past Craig Gordon. McInnes took exception to something said during the celebrations that followed in front of the Celtic bench and he had to be pushed back by the fourth official. The assistant managers Paul Sheerin and Shaun Maloney had a tête-à-tête later, too. “It was nothing to do with ­Martin or Shaun,” McInnes said. “One of their inexperienced coaches got a bit carried away and that’s all I’m going to say.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Nygren opens the scoring for Celtic in the seventh minute.Photograph: Mark Runnacles/ShutterstockHearts could have levelled almost immediately when Braga broke into the Celtic area but he shot tamely at Kasper Schmeichel. An ineffective display in front of goal was under way for the hosts. Alexandros Kyziridis should have equalised when a defensive howler by Trusty put him clean through on Schmeichel’s goal. The winger had to score but the Dane stood tall and made a crucial save with his leg.Kyziridis missed another excellent chance in the second half, taking an eternity to size up a shot inside the area and enabling Liam Scales to intercept. Hearts were level by then.Leonard delivered a corner to the back post where Findlay rose above two Celtic players to bury a header past Schmeichel. Celtic had shown little in the final third following their early lead but burst into life when Cvancara headed against the bar and then led a break down the left. ­Having sprinted clear of Craig Halkett, the striker rolled a perfect cross along the face of goal for Yang to convert from close range.Plenty of spice was added to the mix. Cvancara was booked for needlessly barging into Leonard. The on-loan midfielder then dissected the Celtic defence to release Pierre ­Landry Kaboré, who was hauled to the ground by Trusty. The referee, ­Steven McLean, enraged Tynecastle by ­initially showing only a yellow card to the Celtic centre-half, presumably on the basis the Hearts striker was running away from goal. McLean was advised to review the incident on the pitchside ­monitor and he returned with a red card in his hand. Trusty was on his way to the tunnel by the time it was brandished.Celtic played for almost an hour with 10 men in Bologna on ­Thursday. Hearts tested their energy ­levels to the limit. Braga somehow failed to beat Schmeichel from point-blank range when Sabah Kerjota’s cross landed at his feet but made amends with four minutes of normal time remaining.A set piece was again Celtic’s undoing, this time a free‑kick sent deep into the box by Harry Milne. Oisin McEntee headed down perfectly for Braga to lash home through a crowded area.McInnes was relaxed about the title race. “We are confident and enjoying where we are,” he said. “But we are well aware that some big clubs are desperate to be where we are and so we have to keep improving.”O’Neill’s take was equally pragmatic. “We knew at one minute to three today that we had a tough time and we still have a tough time because another game has gone past, but we’re still in it.”Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipHeartsCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The home hope blitzed his bogeyman Alexander Bublik in just 92 minutes on Sunday night to book a place in his seventh grand slam quarter-final – and a tantalising showdown with the top seedCarlos Alcaraz.Sunday’s match finished in a blink, 6-4, 6-1, 6-1, before the sun went down over a surprisingly chilly Rod Laver Arena that left the Kazakhstani cussing to his coach about the conditions.Carlos Alcaraz serves up lesson with Australian Open dismissal of PaulRead moreDe Minaur said he “wanted my revenge” against an opponent who had come back to beat him twice in 2025 and who is already a tournament winner in 2026. “I was very pleased with getting over the line and not getting into trouble,” the No 6 seed said. “He can so easily get back into a match, slap a couple of winners, and all of a sudden, the match just goes sideways.”Alcaraz now stands in front of Australia’s highest Melbourne Park men’s seed in two decades. The career-best form of De Minaur only builds anticipation for a clash that had already been circled when the draw was released 10 days ago.Famously, De Minaur has never gone beyond the quarter-finals of a grand slam despite getting there six times, including last summer in Melbourne when he washelpless against a rampant Jannik Sinner. He has not beaten Alcaraz in five meetings.The Australian said he recognised Tuesday would be his “toughest test yet”, and he believed Alcaraz was becoming more focused in matches. “In the past, he’s maybe had times where he’s maybe been able to give you a couple of cheap points here and there and let opponents get into the match, and he’s been working on that, so he’s going to only make it harder.”De Minaur seems to be a different player at Melbourne Park this year, too, after trouncing first No 29 seed Frances Tiafoe and now Bublik. The latter had already won a lead-in tournament in Hong Kong three weeks ago and, at No 10, is at a career-high rank. Now, he is also the first top 10 player De Minaur has beaten at his home slam. “I’m just showing the people that I have improved, right?” De Minaur said. “I’ve got more to give. I got tired of the narrative that these big hitters can take the racket out of my hands.”A packed Rod Laver Arena was just settling into his contest with Bublik when the score was 4-4 in the opening set. They weren’t expecting De Minaur to find an entirely new level. But he won 14 of the next 16 games to end the match as a contest.View image in fullscreen‘It was my fault, I didn’t adjust to the conditions as fast as I usually would do,’ reflected Alexander Bublik.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/ReutersMidway through the barrage, Bublik was caught on a microphone complaining about the speed of the court, saying to his team: “How can I hit? It’s a fucking ping pong ball, it doesn’t fly.” To the awaiting press afterwards, he repeated the point more eloquently, but was also gracious towards his opponent. “It was my fault, I didn’t adjust to the conditions as fast as I usually would do,” he said. “That’s tennis, he played a great match, he deserved to win. Definitely, he was the better player.”The De Minaur v Alcaraz match is set to be played on the hottest day in Melbourne since 2020. The Australian doesn’t mind the heat – “I mean, I’m Aussie,” he said – but he seems resigned to the roof being closed, as it was on Saturday when the temperature topped 40C.Whether the area is open or not, De Minaur will go into the match as the clear underdog. After his victory on Sunday, he was adamant that it is not his responsibility to tell people – despite his record in grand slams and against Alcaraz – that he has a chance. Rather, he just wants to show it.“I’m not going to come out here and plead Australia to believe in me, [that] I can do it,” he said. “I’m going to go out there, I’m going to compete. I’m going to go after the match, I’m excited for the battle.”“Yeah, ultimately it’s something that I have never done, but, you know, there is always a first time for everything. I’m hoping that will be on Tuesday.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenAlex de MinaurCarlos AlcarazAustralia sportTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Neither can play on the PGA Tour because of their LIV membership. The PGA Tour has a significant deal to underpin prize funds on this, the DP World Tour, until the end of next year. The DP World Tour continues to accommodate LIV rebels, which can lead to eye-catching scenarios such as the one that played out on the Majlis Course.With the PGA Tour now bullish about seeing off LIV and its Saudi Arabian riches, a theory endorsed byBrooks Koepka’s recent swapping of domains, it is hardly a leap of faith to suggest those in Florida might ask the DP World Tour to reassess tournament entry rules if the dollars are to keep flowing across the Atlantic. When criteria was created to allow Koepka’s return, it was carefully created so that the likes of Reed need not apply. Yet here he was, departing the Emirates Club with $1.5m that essentially comes in part from the PGA Tour. Golf remains in a weird and wonderful place. Reed used his press conference to reveal his LIV deal has expired.“We’re still finalising the contract,” Reed said. “We’re not complete on that yet. I don’t like to talk business and stuff while I’m playing, and so it’s like Monday through Wednesday is the only time to really talk about it.”Reed even floated the idea of finishing inside the top 10 of Europe’s order of merit, therefore potentially earning a path back to the PGA Tour. “If I ended up not playing on LIV this year, obviously I would be out here playing more on this tour and trying to secure one of those spots in the top 10,” Reed said. He is suddenly in a useful bargaining position.View image in fullscreenDavid Puig was handed a two-stroke penalty after grounding his club in a bunker behind the 18th green.Photograph: Ali Haider/EPAEarlier Reed, one of this sport’s truly global performers, eased to his four-shot success, achieved at 14 under par with a closing 72. The finish was anticlimactic in nature. Reed has thereby scratched an itch, created bymissing out by one to Rory McIlroyin the Desert Classic’s 2023 staging.Reed’s advantage over Puig was four at the start of play. The deficit was cut in half by the turn thanks to Puig birdies at the 8th and 9th. Reed, though, was to steady himself. Shots collected by the former Masters winner at the 10th and 13th, offset only marginally by a bogey at the 11th, came as Puig toiled. Puig played the closing eight holes in three over before it became five thanks to that penalty and a seven on the 18th. Sullivan’s inward half of 33 was sufficient for second. Julien Guerrier took third. Francesco Molinari, Nicolai Højgaard and Jayden Schaper shared fourth.McIlroy signed off with a 73 for the most unusual of things, a finish outside the top 20 in Dubai. “I was stuck in neutral for most of the week,” the Masters champion said.Explore more on these topicsGolfLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourEuropean TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In one clip she is harangued by bearded man in Islamic attire for eating a pork sausage.The message is one well rehearsed on far-right social media, but it is the AI invention of Amelia that has made her endlessly adaptable, creating a viral internet trend that anyone with access to a mainstream chatbot can take part in. Users of X have turned to its Grok AI tool to create so many Amelia memes, she is now breaking out of niche online silos.The origins of the character are ironic, to say they least. An early iteration of Amelia began life in a counter-extremism video game funded by the UK Home Office and created to deter young people aged 13-18 from being attracted to far right extremism in Yorkshire.0:09AI-generated Amelia far-right meme – videoPathways: Navigating the Internet and Extremismis a simple multiple choice format game with basic animation. Its players are taken on a journey as characters at a college. They are invited to make decisions in scenarios including whether or download potentially extremist content or join an Amelia character on a rally organised by “a small political group” protesting against changes in society and the “erosion in British values”.Certain scenarios simulated in the game result in a referral under the British government’s Prevent counter-terrorism programme.However, it is a subversion of the Amelia character that has exploded across social media channels in a way that has astonished even the creators of the original game.Among the plethora of increasingly sophisticated AI-generated iterations are a Manga-style Amelia, a Wallace and Gromit version and AI-generated “real life” encounters between her and the characters of Father Ted or Harry Potter, accompanied by racist language and far-right messaging.Analysis provided to the Guardian by Peryton Intelligence, a UK company that monitors disinformation, indicated that an anonymous account known for skilfully disseminating far-right messaging started the Amelia meme on X on 9 January with a post that has since been viewed 1.4m times.The volume of “Ameliaposting” has since gone from an average of 500 a day when that account first introduced it to the world to roughly 10,000, starting on 15 January as it hit international audiences. On Wednesday, it hit 11,137 posts on X alone.In one of the most surreal twists, an Amelia cryptocurrency has emerged, with social media users seeking to leverage its value on the meme’s rising profile. On Wednesday, Elon Musk retweeted an X account promoting an Amelia cryptocurrency token.“What we’re seeing is the monetisation of hate,” said Matteo Bergamini, the founder and CEO of Shout Out UK, a political and media literacy training company that created the original game.“We’ve seen Telegram groups all messaging each other in Chinese about the meme coin and talking about how to artificially inflate its value, so a lot of money is being made.”The company itself has been the target of a deluge of hate mail, including threats that have now been reported to the police.Bergamini points out that the original initiative was never meant to be a stand-alone game. Rather, it was intended to be used in the classrooms alongside a suite of teaching resources, a fact he says coverage and commentary has ignored.“There has been a lot of misrepresentation unfortunately,” he said. “The game does not state, for example, that questioning mass migration is inherently wrong.”Others have suggested the initiative had backfired, not least by casting a “cute goth girl” as a negative character, leading to her inadvertently becoming a focus of admiration. But Bergamini said the game – which used feedback from focus groups with young people and was developed with a specific local threat picture in mind – continued to be used and feedback from schools and others was positive.Nevertheless, the speed and sophistication surrounding the creation of supposedly subversive Amelia memes online has taken him by surprise.“This experience has shown us why this work is so immensely important, but also gives us pause for thought about our safety in conducting this work due to the highly sophisticated coordination of those who profit from hate,” he said.Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said: “We have seen the meme having a remarkable spread and proliferating among the far right and beyond, but what’s also been of note is how it is now international.“In a way it gets to the heart of what we might term the ‘dissident’ far-right – individuals who position themselves outside of the mainstream political scene – whether that’s ‘shitposters’ who are just into provoking, others who are in twee memes. A whole ecosystem has embraced it. Clearly, the sexualised imagery is also key to this. The target audience is almost exclusively young men.”The Home Office said Prevent had diverted nearly 6,000 people away from violent ideologies. It added that projects such as the Pathways game were designed to target local radicalisation risks and were created and delivered independently of government.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Deer would occasionally wander into our neighbourhood and nibble on the blossoms in our front yard. In that neck of the (literal) woods, mountains and deeralso mean cougars.My sister and I would play at a local park, then walk home along a track parallel to a dense forest. My older sister, being three and a half years ahead of me in life and therefore lightyears ahead of me in wisdom, would helpfully declare that if we encountered a cougar it would attack me, not her, as I’m the smaller prey.Older siblings are nothing if not educational, so frequent park outings meant frequent reminders of my potential death. The butterflies in my stomach would whirlpool then drop to a flutter each time we neared the top of the street away from the woods. Was it fear? Yes. Excitement? That too. Disappointment? Strangely, also yes. We never once spotted a cougar.There’s a subreddit that fosters this particular combination of excitement and fear,r/animalid, where users share photos of unfamiliar wildlife for others to identify. The most popular posts are colourful lizards and rare birds: YAWN. SNOOZEFEST. For me, the top-tier posts have little engagement at all: I’m looking for poor-quality photos with a handful of comments. I’m talking trailcam snapshots with captions like “this wolf has been stalking my family” accompanied by several comments of “that is a coyote with mange”. And, reader, it’salwaysa coyote with mange.View image in fullscreen‘Reader, it’s always a coyote with mange’ … the r/animalid subreddit.Photograph: RedditWe’ll see ablurry photo of a ratwhich the poster insists isnota rat, actually, despite its size, shape, colour and rat-like behaviour.

A cougar?! Those ones make me bolt upright in bed, phone screen pressed against my eyeball. A real-life cougar?! Those lucky bastards. Except … it never is a cougar, merelya fat tabby. Or a coyote with mange.Few people in this sub are clout-chasers; they are simply hopeful and curious. There is a distinct earnestness that comes with posting a photo of a blurry blob with helpfully added scribblespointing at said blob. We squint and wonder if that blob is dangerous. Or even an animal.View image in fullscreen‘There is a distinct earnestness that comes with posting a photo of a blurry blob with helpfully added scribbles.’Photograph: RedditExtreme sports, illicit drug taking, dating emotionally unavailable and annoying artists: humans long for thrill, even if – orbecause– it’s dangerous. This subreddit allows us to microdose that adrenalin rush in everyday encounters, turning them into Rorschach tests. Every print in the snow becomes a potential bear. We’re reminded that, in those rare places humans haven’t destroyed, we are not the apex predators – nature is. Maybe something greater and more powerful than us was here, mere moments ago.“That is very clearly a human footprint,” people might rush to comment. But still the original poster remains hopeful.Everyday life can be very ordinary and this subreddit exemplifies our desire for someextraordinary spectacle. What if that pigeon actually was a hawk? What if, today, the rat in my bathroom wasn’t a rat, but something more exotic, or even sinister? I’m thrown back to childhood: what if just once – only one single time – a mountain lion actually did emerge from the forest and attack me? Not fatally, but enough for me to be The Girl Who Survived A Cougar Attack.

As CEO of OpenAI, the world’s most valuable privately owned company, he has in recent months announced plans for $1tn of investment into datacenters and struck multibillion-dollar deals with several chipmakers. If completed, the datacenters are expected to use more power thanentire European nations. OpenAI is pushing an aggressive expansion – encroaching on industries like e-commerce,healthcareand entertainment – while increasingly integrating its products into government, universities, and the US military and making a play to turn ChatGPT into the new default homepage for millions.Altman’s long bid to make himself the power broker of a new, AI-powered society has started to look closer to reality as a large portion of the US economy now rides on the success of his vision. There are reports the company is preparing togo publictowards the end of 2026 with up to a $1tn valuation in one of the biggest initial public offerings in history.OpenAI and Altman’s burgeoning empire is not going unchallenged. Google’s rival Gemini AI chatbot is advancing fast enough that Altman last month issueda company-wide “code red”to refocus on ChatGPT. Many analysts have become concerned that OpenAI may be becoming too big to fail as it expands its infrastructure and computing spending, whilecircular funding dealswith partners have not assuaged those fears. Then there is the fact that OpenAI isburning through tens of billions of dollars, with even its own optimistic forecasts showing the startup is years from becoming profitable.In an effort to maintain investor confidence in this profit-free spending spree and avoid regulatory crackdowns, Altman has intensified a charm offensive over the past year, deepened his political connections and promised even more fromOpenAI– with the company claiming that AI will soon be a utility “on par with electricity, clean water, or food”. The CEO has also expanded his personal portfolio, backing new energy and neuroscience technologies just as other tech moguls have. This year will test: can he maintain the relentless balancing act?Altman and OpenAI get politicalAsOpenAIsought to shift its main business to a for-profit corporation in 2025 and faced down attempts from states across the US to pass AI regulation, it greatly expanded its efforts to influence lawmakers. The company spent $2.99m on lobbying efforts in 2025, according to Lobbying Disclosure Act filings, with its spending ramping up in the latter half of the year. That number is up from $1.76m in lobbying the previous year and just $260,000 in 2023. The push for friendly policies continues after Trump handed the industry a victory with an executive order that preempts and precludes any state-level regulation of AI. Other AI companies have followed suit, with Anthropic spending a little over $3.1m during that same period.View image in fullscreenSam Altman at the AI safety summit in Bletchley Park, UK, in 2023.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesOpenAI also hired consultants and lobbyists from across the political spectrum, including those who have worked for California governor Gavin Newsom and former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. They have also brought on the former deputy chief of staff for Republican senator Lindsey Graham and a former staffer from the Senate foreign relations committee.The company’s most effective campaigner does not hail from K Street, however. It has been Altman himself, who has joined other tech moguls in ingratiating themselves with Donald Trump and allying themselves with the current administration. He has dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and appeared at the White House for an event touting the administration’s ties with the tech industry. In September, Altman was one of several tech CEOs who joined Trump and King Charles for a state dinner in the UK.‘If we get it wrong, that’s on us’As investorsincreasingly warn the AI industry is a bubble, with excessive investment in tech infrastructure for unclear payoff, Altman has conceded that some parts of the industry “are kind of bubbly right now”. Yet he has continued to emphasize that OpenAI remains on steady ground and that its $1.4tn commitment to build out datacenters and computational power is necessary.His message is part of a longstanding emphasis on scaling computational power and pursuing growth that has been a fixture of OpenAI since its early breakthroughs in the mid-2010s. It is also in keeping with a sentiment that Altman has expressed for years – that technological progress is inevitable despite the harms that it may create.“We should understand that as a consequence of technology and an economy of ideas, the gap between the rich and the poor will likely increase from its already high-seeming levels,” Altman wrote in 2013, in a blog post that thanked his friend Peter Thiel for ideological input. “There is good and bad to this, but we should be careful not to legislate against it, which will hurt growth.”More than a decade later, Altman’s views on how technological change may affect society seem consistent.View image in fullscreenAltman with Nicholas Thompson, CEO of the Atlantic, at the International Telecommunication Union’s AI for Good global summit, in Geneva, on 30 May 2024.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images“There will be very hard parts like whole classes of jobs going away,” Altman wrote in a July blog post. “But on the other hand the world will be getting so much richer so quickly that we’ll be able to seriously entertain new policy ideas we never could before.”In alengthy post on Xin November, Altman defended OpenAI against accusations it was becoming “too big to fail” or seeking government backstops for its investments. Altman went on the defensive after the company’s CFO Sarah Friar spooked analysts witha suggestion that OpenAI could seek government aid, which she then hastily reversed amid widespread pushback. Altman predicted that OpenAI would generate hundreds of billions in revenue by 2030, potentially branching into consumer devices and robotics amid “massive demand” for AI. He also downplayed the fallout if the company were to fail, which analysts fear would havea devastating effecton the economy.“That’s how capitalism works, and the ecosystem and economy would be fine,” Altman posted. “We plan to be a wildly successful company, but if we get it wrong, that’s on us.”Turning toward TrumpAltman’s appearances and apparent friendliness are a stark turnaround from his earlier view of Trump, which he expressed in a mid-2016 blog post that likened Trump’s rise to Hitler’s.“To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it’s chilling to watch Trump in action,” Altman wrote in 2016 prior to Trump’s election win. “He is not merely irresponsible. He is irresponsible in the way dictators are.”But as Trump’s second term began, Altman posted a message lauding the president and recanting his previous opposition.“Watching @potus more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him (i wish i had done more of my own thinking and definitely fell in the npc trap),” Altman posted on X days after Trump’s inauguration. “I’m not going to agree with him on everything, but i think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!”Altman and OpenAI have found a warm welcome in the Trump administration. The White House’s attempts to show off economic growth and win in a technology race with China have led it to embrace OpenAI, while the Department of Defense awardeda $200m contract to the companyin June for it to develop AI solutions for “warfighting and enterprise domains”.“The AI future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety,” JD Vance said in a speech at a summit on artificial intelligence in February. The White House has not leant a friendly ear to lawmakers calling for the regulation of AI.View image in fullscreenAltman with Donald Trump at the White House on 21 January 2025, in Washington DC.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesOpenAI CEOSam Altman(R), accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, speaks during a news conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on 21 January 2025 in Washington, DC. Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesAltman’s shift on Trump has come not only as tech has lurched to the political right but also as OpenAI faces growing pushback, including lawsuits from families alleging that its ChatGPT serviceencouraged users to commit suicide, numerous copyright infringement lawsuits andconcern over data centers’ rising energy costs.While Altman has long made broad calls for some form of regulation on AI, he has eased off calls for oversight over the past year andsaid that requiring governmentsign-off to release AI models would be “disastrous”. In friendlier environments, the CEO has framed mitigating AI’s harms as something that is a burden for regulators and users. Shortly after the launch of OpenAI’s video app Sora, which drew sizable backlash over generating deepfakes of historical figures such as Martin Luther King Jr and its potential for creating misinformation at scale, Altman seemed unconcerned with AI video’s implications.“Very soon the world is going to have to contend with incredible video models that can deepfake anyone or kind of show anything you want. And that will mostly be great,” Altman said on the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz’s podcast in October. “There will be some adjustment that society has to go through.”He did not speak much about regulation, which he said “probably has a lot of downside”.“I expect some really bad stuff to happen because of the technology, which also has happened with previous technologies,” Altman said.“All the way back to fire,” Ben Horowitz, the firm’s co-founder, replied.Nuclear energy, longevity pills, brain scansWhile Altman has been traveling the world as a frontman for OpenAI and generative AI writ large, he has also been building out his own portfolio of investments, which offers a sense of where he thinks the world is heading.Altman is a big proponent of nuclear technology and has called past bans on nuclear energy over safety concerns “incredibly dumb”. He has financially backed the nuclear energy startup Helion, which in July announced it hadbegun construction on a nuclear fusion power plantintended to feed Microsoft’s enormous data centers – despite the fact that thefusion technology that will presumably fuel the plant is still unproven. Altman also served as chair of the board for nuclear energy startup Oklo until April of last year, withthe firm’s COO announcingthat his departure meant the company could potentially partner with OpenAI in the future.Biotech, a common interest among Silicon Valley elites, has also attracted Altman.

Work brings dignity and purpose to people’s lives. That’s what makes the AI transformation so consequential.”Business surveys suggest that outside the tech sector, leaders are enthusiastic about the potential of AI, but are not yet feeling the benefits. A PWC poll of UK chief executives, published to coincide with the start of the WEF, for example, showed that 81% were making AI their top investment priority but only 30% had seen any cost reductions as a result.That means in the months ahead, there will be intense pressure to find savings, with the focus likely to be on the wage bill.Chairing a WEF session on “jobless growth”, Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford’s digital economy lab, pointed torecent work he and colleagues did, suggesting workers in the US aged 22-25 are already experiencing AI-related job losses, especially in sectors where AI “automates rather than augments labour”.Brynjolfsson believes that this dichotomy is a crucial one, which gets to the heart of why Musk’s robot dreams have a dystopian edge.Four years ago Brynjolfsson wrotea paper called The Turing Trap. He argued that the Turing test, which posited that the ultimate accolade for a technology was to replicate human intelligence by seeming human, was the wrong goal.Instead, he argues, “as machines become better substitutes for human labour, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, then humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created.”Young will suffer most when AI ‘tsunami’ hits jobs, says head of IMFRead moreBrynjolfsson urges policymakers to use tax incentives and regulation to nudge companies towards developing technologies that enhance humans’ abilities – putting powerful tools in their hands – rather than replacing them completely.That was broadly the picture presented by the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, in an upbeat session about the future of AI, in which he talked up the benefits for the global south, describing a world in which doctors are freed up by tech to spend more time with patients, for example.Nevertheless, he warned that the technology risked losing its “social permission” if it could not be shown to be making people’s lives better, rather than just enriching a small number of powerful tech firms.“We, as a global community, have to get to the point where we’re using this to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries, right? Otherwise I don’t think this makes much sense,” he mused.Certainly, “social permission” for AI to swallow up energy, water and capital may be hard to come by, if the way many people encounter it – aside from in a sea of misogynistic online slop – is as the reason for their career going off the rails.And that’s why trades unionists are rightly calling for an urgent conversation about how the benefits of increased productivity, if indeed they materialise, can be shared with society, not hoarded by the tech bros.As Liz Shuler, president of the US union federation the AFL-CIO put it, “if we can all agree that this is to make our jobs better and safer, easier, more productive, then we’re all in. But if you’re looking to just de-skill, dehumanise, replace workers, put people out on the street with no path forward, then absolutely you’re going to have a revolution.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Viewpoint columnRobotsElon MuskGrok AIMetaEconomic policyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Emulating India’s response might helpSun 25 Jan 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 16.31 ESTShareWhen the centre-left French politicianAurore Lalucqposted a warning last Wednesday that Donald Trump could cut off Europe from international payment systems, the clip wentviral. To many, her message made sense. After all, if Mr Trump waspreparedto test allies’ boundaries over Greenland, it is not far-fetched to imagine Visa and Mastercard becoming used against a recalcitrant Europe.The US can turn off payment systems it controls. Russia learned this first-hand after sanctions were rightly applied for its invasion of Ukraine. As up to 60% of Russian retail transactions depended on Visa and Mastercard for authorisation, the ban left many ordinary people stranded withoutaccessto funds andunableto buy goods. Under Mr Trump, America’sgoalis to “help Europe correct its current trajectory”. Given such talk, Ms Lalucq, who chairs the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, is not wrong incallingfor an “Airbus of European payments” to protect the EU.If the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is serious about the bloc’s “independence”, then during her visit toIndiathis week she might ask New Delhi for advice. Within a decade, India has built a digital public infrastructure designed to reduce reliance on foreign-controlled payment networks and insulate its domestic payments fromexternal pressure or sanctions.India’sUnified Payments Interface(UPI) could be the answer Ms Lalucq is looking for: a state‑backed, universal payment system. The plumbing does not need Visa or Mastercard to be involved. UPI has near‑zero fees. It is not a wallet but a public standard: banks, fintechs and apps compete on top of it. Card networks never took deep root in India. But UPI has meant the country has leapfrogged straight to mobile app “e-cash” – with shoppers using QR codes for everyday payments.The biggest players are US companies –Google Pay and Walmart’s PhonePeaccount for 80% of transactions – but they don’t control UPI. India now processes billions of transactions a month, with instant settlement between shoppers’ bank accounts and merchants’. UPI made digital payments ubiquitous amongpoor households. Meanwhile, credit cards’market sharein India’s digital payments fell to 21% in 2024 from 43% in 2018.Creating a European UPI would not be easy. The EU is institutionally complex. Banks would resist change. Companies such as Stripe already provide cross-border wiring. But this is about state and bloc autonomy. Ms Lalucq’s curtdismissalof Wero – Europe’s bank-led payments wallet – makes sense as it is aprivate sector product, not public infrastructure. India’s experience raisedcivil libertyquestions. It could be argued that Europe has a mature privacy framework to address them.Would-be world powers aren’t waiting. China’s paymentecosystemhas been built to be governed domestically. India shows that this was not a one‑off. Both want to export their models. India’s UPI is built as an open, decentralised public standard. China’s Digital Silk Road, by contrast, locks partners intoBeijing’s technology and authoritarian governance.A European payments system that bolsters the continent’s sovereignty is a good idea. Ms Lalucq ought to be thanked for raising it. For the EU to look to India for answers would also be a practical expression of the call byMark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, for deeper ties betweenmiddle powers. Strategic autonomy may begin not with grand strategy, but with how we shop.Explore more on these topicsMoneyOpinionCredit cardsBankingBanks and building societiesIndiaEuropean UnionEuropeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The caveat? The patients are seen by medical assistants who use artificial intelligence (AI) to listen to the conversations, then spit out potential diagnoses and treatment plans, which are then reviewed by a doctor. The company’s goal, its chief technology officer told the MIT Technology Review, is to “pull the doctor out of the visit”.This is dangerous. Yet it’s part of a larger trend where generative AI is being pushed into healthcare for medical professionals. In 2025, asurveyby the American Medical Association reported that two out of three physicians used AI to assist with their daily work, including diagnosing patients. OneAI startup raised $200mto provide medical professionals with an app dubbed “ChatGPT for doctors”. US lawmakers are considering abillthat would recognize AI as able to prescribe medication. While this trend of AI in healthcare affects almost all patients, it has a deeper impact on people with low incomes who already face substantial barriers to care and higher rates of mistreatment in healthcare settings. People who are unhoused and have low incomes should not be testing grounds for AI in healthcare. Instead, their voices and priorities should drive if, how, and when AI is implemented in their care.My friends in Italy are using AI therapists. But is that so bad, when a stigma surrounds mental health? | Viola Di GradoRead moreThe rise of AI in healthcare didn’t happen in a vacuum. Overcrowded hospitals, overworked clinicians and relentless pressure for medical offices to run seamlessly, shuttling patients in and out of a large for-profit healthcare system, set the conditions. The demands on healthcare workers are often compounded in economically disadvantaged communities where healthcare settings are often under-resourced and patients are uninsured, with a greater burden of chronic health conditions due to racism and poverty.Here is where someone might ask, “Isn’t something better than nothing?” Well, actually, no. Studies show that AI-enabled tools generate inaccurate diagnoses. A2021 studyin Nature Medicine examined AI algorithms trained on large, chest X-ray datasets for medical imaging research and found that these algorithms systematically under-diagnosed Black and Latinx patients, patients recorded as female and patients with Medicaid insurance. This systematic bias risks deepening health inequities for patients already facing barriers to care.Anotherstudy, published in 2024, found that AI misdiagnosed breast cancer screenings among Black patients – the odds of false positives for Black patients screened for breast cancer was greater than for their white counterparts. Due to algorithmic bias, some clinical AI tools have notoriously performed worse on Black patients and other people of color. That’s because AI isn’t independently “thinking”; it relies on probabilities and pattern recognition, which can reinforce bias for already marginalized patients.Some patients aren’t even informed that their health provider or healthcare system is using AI. A medical assistanttold the MIT Technology reviewthat his patients know an AI system is listening, but he does not tell them that it makes diagnostic recommendations. This harkens back to an era of exploitative medical racism where Black people were experimented on without informed consent and often against their will. Can AI help health providers by speedily giving them information that may allow them to move on to the next patient? Possibly. But the problem is that it might come at the expense of diagnostic accuracy and worsening health inequities.And the potential impact goes beyond diagnostic accuracy.TechTonic Justice, an advocacy group working to protect economically marginalized communities from the harms of AI, published a groundbreaking report that estimates92 million Americanswith low incomes “have some basic aspect of their lives decided by AI”. Those decisions range from howmuch they receive from Medicaid to whether they are eligible for Social Security administration’s disability insurance.A real-life example of this is playing out in federal courts right now. In 2023, a group of Medicare Advantage customerssuedUnitedHealthcare in Minnesota, alleging they were denied coverage because the company’s AI system, nH Predict, mistakenly deemed them ineligible. Some of the plaintiffs are the estates of Medicare Advantage customers; these patients allegedly died as a result of the denial of medically necessary care. UnitedHealth sought to dismiss the case, but in 2025, a judge ruled that the plaintiffs can move forward with some of the claims. A similar case wasfiledin federal court in Kentucky against Humana. There, Medicare Advantage customers alleged that Humana’s use of nH Predict “spits out generic recommendations based on incomplete and inadequate medical records”. That case is also ongoing, with a judge ruling that the plaintiffs’ legal arguments are enough to move forward, surviving the insurance company’s motion to dismiss. While the final decision for these two cases remains pending, they indicate a growing trend of AI being used to decide the health coverage of people with low incomes – and its pitfalls. If you have financial resources, you can get quality healthcare. But if you are unhoused or have a low income, AI may bar you from even accessing the healthcare entirely. That’s medical classism.We should not experiment on patients who are unhoused or have low incomes for an AI rollout. The documented harms are greater than the potential, unproven benefits promised by start-ups and other tech ventures. Given the barriers that people who are unhoused and have low incomes face, it is crucial they receive patient-centered care with a human healthcare provider who listens to their health-related needs and priorities. We cannot create a standard where we rely on a health system in which health practitioners take a backseat while AI – run by private companies – takes the lead. An AI system that “listens” in and is developed without rigorous evaluation by the communities themselves disempowers patients by removing their decision-making authority to determine what technologies, including AI, are implemented in their health care.Leah Goodridge is a lawyer who worked in homeless prevention litigation for 12 yearsOni Blackstock, MD, MHS, is a physician, founder and executive director of health justice, and a Public Voices Fellow on technology in the public interest with The OpEd ProjectExplore more on these topicsUS healthcareOpinionAI (artificial intelligence)HealthcommentShareReuse this content"

It is now up to them to curtail his despotic reignSun 25 Jan 2026 08.27 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 12.49 ESTShareDonald Trump is a monster, and a stupid one at that – as hisfoul slanderof British soldiers who served in Afghanistan shows. His bid to seize loyal ally Denmark’s sovereign territory; his norm-shattering,profoundly ignorant speechin Davos last week; and hiscontemptuous bullyingof UK and EU leaders have definitively demonstrated what an existential, unappeasable, unspeakable menace the 47th US president truly is.All the post-Davos talk is about what the UK, the EU and Nato must do in future to resist and constrain Trump, and how to counter hisattempts to demolishthe global rules-based order. Yet a sense of proportion is required. If his policies and posturing are removed from the equation, it’s clear that the unedifying but familiar postwar world of great power rivalries and de-facto spheres of influence remains largely unchanged. Continuities outnumber ruptures. It’s also clear this crisis is not ultimately one Europe can solve.Trump and Trump alone is the principal, pressing problem. And Trump is a made-in-America monster. It’s up to Americans to un-make him and set things straight – which they surely will, sooner or later.The still-festering Greenland crisis is the latest example – after Venezuela, Gaza and Iran – of Trump’s neo-imperial overreach. If he honestly wanted to boost Arctic security, he only had to ask. Denmark isalready treaty-boundto accept more, bigger US bases. Nato allies and the EU are keen to help. But what Washington’s kraken really wants is to gobble up the entire territory and its resources, regardless of Greenlanders’ wishes.Trump’s excruciatingly undignified, whingeing performance in Davos revealed a man whose egotism knows no limits, whose overweening ambition to boss the world is spinning out of control. This is no exaggeration. How else to understand his new “board of peace” – a $1bn club for dictators, with himself as chair-for-life, that is plainly intended to supplant the UN?Trump’s strong-arm tactics, including the usual tariff threats, caused something close topanic among European leaders. The reaction of the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen was typical. “The shift in the international order is not only seismic, it is permanent,” she warned. The broad consensus – Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, waseloquently apocalyptic– is that the world has changed, for ever and for the worse, and that the only remaining rule is “might makes right”.View image in fullscreenMark Carney speaking at a news conference at the Citadelle, Quebec, 22 January 2026.Photograph: Mathieu Belanger/ReutersThis doomsday lament is exaggerated, lacking in perspective. Historically speaking, the UN-led rules-based order has always been a take-it-or-leave it choice for the great powers of the day. The illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 is a case in point. What made the system work, most of the time, was the rational pursuit of national self-interest. The key difference today is that Trumpbehaves irrationally, imperilling US interests and values and those of its allies.Most Americans now appear to share Europe’s view of Trump as a dangerous embarrassment. On almost every issue, domestic and foreign, hisdisapproval ratingsare hitting new highs. In Davos, Trump regurgitated the lie that he won a “landslide” in 2024. In truth, he edged the election with 1.5% of the popular vote. Out of a registered electorate of 174 million, about 97 million voted for somebody else or not at all. Today, theanti-Trump majorityis vastly larger.What’s to be done? November’s midterm elections may rein him in – although they feel a long way off. Trump’s mishandling of the economy, particularly his tariff wars, is fuelling an“affordability” crisiswhose existence he denies. His violent anti-migrant paramilitary assaults on US cities are producing scenes reminiscent of the 2024 movieCivil War. Trump tramples daily onthe US constitution, the separation of powers, representative democracy and civil liberties.Americans did not vote for this. Nor did US allies such as Britain. Despite its unfailingly polite, patient diplomacy and personal hospitality towards Trump, Keir Starmer’s government has beenrepeatedly betrayedor undercut over Ukraine, big-tech regulation, trade, climate policy, Gaza aid, Palestinian statehood and now the UK record in Afghanistan.It’s easy to understand why western politicians fret. Greenland isfar from settled. Trump and Nato are at breaking point. The struggle for a just peace in Ukraine is at dire risk of being lost. Trump’s “historic” Middle East peace plan fatally ignores the central issue: Palestine’s independence. His personal disdain for sovereign borders, the UN charter and international law encourages fellow autocrats everywhere.As the world finally punches back, was this the week Donald Trump went too far? | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreLast week’s traumas may have been formative. It is now widely agreed that Europe must do much more to defend and promote its own security and values as a front-row geopolitical player. In public, the anti-Trump tone toughened considerably. Appeasers took a back seat as shock and anger turned to defiance. Europepushed back hardagainst Trump’s “coercion”. One diplomat called it a “Rubicon moment”. But there are limits to what it can do.Hope lies in the fact that most Americans agree Trump is a mistake, if not an outright, repulsive aberration. Polls show most remain firmlypro-Europe and pro-Nato. And most surely realise this all-round damaging White House travesty cannot continue unchecked.For the sake of their friends, for the sake of global order, for their own sanity, the US’s silenced majority must now move with speed, determination, unity – and, if required, an unaccustomed degree of constitutional flexibility – to curtail his despotic reign before matters deteriorate further.Citizens of the Republic! Impeach Trump. Declare him unfit. Rise up, rebel and overthrow him as, 250 years ago, George III was overthrown. Do whatever you must to peacefully rid the world of this gaudy, gormless usurper and dethrone this would-be king – but do it fast. Spike his guns. Shut him down. Lock him up. Exorcise the monster.Since 1945, Americans have assumed the role of global freedom’s standard-bearer. Now they must liberate themselves. The US in 2026 requires a second revolution. To escape the nightmare, to rescue democracy, to rebuild the city on the hill, the tyrant must fall.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionNatoUS foreign policyUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to build on themMichael ShankThe US was founded on boycotts of British imports. As we mark the country’s 250th anniversary, that spirit is alive and wellSun 25 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 07.02 ESTShareThis year, as the United States commemorates the 250th anniversary of the nation’s founding and the signing of the Declaration of Independence, it’s worth remembering the substantial role boycotts played in the American resistance and independence movement.The founders’ sustained protest of Great Britain’s Stamp Act and Townshend Duties –which taxed printed materials, glass, lead, paper, paint and tea in the colonies – placed enough pain and pressure on British merchants and the parliament that the majority of these taxes were repealed. And while the colonists were boycotting taxed British imports, they built an alternative made-in-America marketplace in the process, becoming domestic producers of homespun clothing, paper and other necessities. This building of alternative institutions and self-reliance were an essential complement to their boycott. They divested from British goods while investing in homemade goods. Both types of actions were necessary.This legacy of effective boycott is relevant 250 years later because it illustrates the power of nonviolent action in targeting the pillars that support the most intractable autocratic rule. And Americans appear to be getting back into boycotting: 2025 was a banner year for such protests in the United States.Big box stores likeTargetandWalmart, for example, faced boycotts for rolling back their commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion. Shoppersboycotted Home Depotafterimmigration raidsnear its locations.Amazonwas boycotted over itsdonations to Donald Trump’s administration, treatment of workers and growing monopolization of the market.Teslawas boycotted due to Elon Musk’s role in government dismantling and far-right saber-rattling. And recurring movements, like theBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions(BDS) movement to undermine Israel’s military actions in Palestine, also grew inimpact.This year will see a continuation of these boycotts – asTarget is back in the sightsof boycotters – but the financial and reputational costs are already visible.Target has seenlayoffs, decreased sales, lower store traffic andplummeting stock prices. Walmartwarned investorsof the rising deleterious impact from these boycotts.Tesla’s stocksandsales plungedas the brand became a liability for many current owners and prospective buyers. And even McDonald’s acknowledged its markets weresignificantly affectedby BDS boycotts. In contrast, Costco, which was lauded by activists for doubling down on its commitments to DEI, reported a7%increase in net sales in April compared with a year earlier.As these boycotts aim to increase their impact in 2026, there is a larger ecosystem of actions and campaigns to consider. Three imperatives come to mind: to communicate and grow the movement, to strategically create alternative institutions, and to sustain participation and morale.First, how can boycotts build community and identity? The colonists’ protests against the Stamp Act and Townshend Duties were a unifying sinew across a diverse set of regions and actors. Protest actions like spinning yarn together, instead of importing it, became a source of community pride and “spinning bee” competitions. The carpooling that was required for the Montgomery bus boycotts during the civil rights movement similarly brought communities closer together, creating a sense ofunity, collective action and agency. Today,TargetFast.orgis trying to do the same. All of this is a helpful prerequisite for boosting morale, withstanding backlash and creating the foundation for self-reliance.Second, how can boycotts create parallel institutions? Most boycotters will still need the services and goods that they’re protesting. When divesting from one institution, it’s essential to simultaneously build or invest in an alternative. That’s why the colonists started making their own fiber and clothes. That’s why the Montgomery bus boycotters created an entirely new transit system to ensure that everyone could work, shop and play without relying on the bus system. All of this takes strategy, of course.For the boycotters of today, creating alternatives to Target, Home Depot, Walmart and Amazon requires planning. Divestment alone is insufficient. And while Costco, as one alternative, witnessed a boost in consumer spending last year, campaigns that encourage shoppers visit local brick-and-mortar stores will need additional movement support if the boycotted big-box stores are to experience sustained financial and reputational cost.Third, how can boycotts maintain patience and perseverance? For companies or countries to feel the pain of economic noncooperation, it requires sustained discipline and diligence. A one-day boycott probably won’t hurt the pocketbooks of most billionaire owners of these big businesses. A multi-month or multi-year boycott that involves an entire community might, however, especially if there’s a compelling identity holding the movement together and the alternative institutions to support it.The colonists’ protests against the Townshend Duties spanned several years, starting in late 1767 until the taxes were repealed in 1770. That same kind of sustained commitment was visible in the civil rights movement when the Montgomery bus boycott lasted a year and involved about 40,000Black residents. The United Farm Workers-led boycott against grape growers in the late 1960s, in response to poor wages and working conditions, lasted five years. While shorter efforts have sometimes been effective – like the recent successful weeklong boycott of Disney+ and Hulu, after Disney canceled comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show – most boycotts require longer engagement.UShistory is richwith case studies. For new movements, including emerging proposals for boycotting theWorld Cup in the US, assessing the vulnerability of a target is a key first step, as is an analysis of how a boycott will be perceived by the public. But the nation’s founders set a precedent – effective nonviolent boycott is replicable. Yes, it takes people, parallel institutions, and perseverance., but it’s what is built during the boycott that has the most lasting impact. And that’s the new history to be made, and celebrated, in 2026.What’s giving me hope nowWe’re witnessing new critical consciousness emerging everywhere and in the unlikeliest of locations. More and more people – who have never spoken out – are now speaking up. More and more people – who have never resisted – are now mobilizing. More and more people are ready to challenge oppressive systems and are hungry for anonviolent playbookto do so. I’m witnessing this all around me, including in my own circles, and it’s incredibly inspiring. This is what gives me hope.Michael Shank is director of programs at the Albert Einstein Institution and adjunct faculty at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs and George Mason University’s Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution.Explore more on these topicsActivismFighting BackProtestProtest (US)commentShareReuse this content"

Here is why it mustNeal LawsonGood politics is about collaboration and contestation. The NEC’s ruling means the party has turned its back on thatNeal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation CompassSun 25 Jan 2026 09.37 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 21.30 ESTShareThis government has become very adept at U-turns. Apparently it is time to turn again. By deciding toblock Andy Burnham’s candidacyfor the Gorton and Denton byelection, the Labour NEC has turned its back on a different and better form of politics, one that Labour and the country so desperately need. The decision today has implications far beyond personality or faction: instead, it is about how a modern and effective government operates to meet the complex and interrelated challenges our society now faces.Francis Crick once said: “A good scientist values criticism almost higher than friendship.” This is equally relevant to politics. Any progressive party needs agility to navigate an endless onslaught of events beyond its control. What therefore matters most are systems and cultures that allow constant feedback, and different views and voices to be heard. Governing is always a mix of professional expertise, top-down control and open debate and negotiation. It is the latter trait that needs to become predominant for any organisation to survive, let alone thrive, given the complexity, even chaos, of governing today.What has all this got to do with Andy Burnham? Three things. First and most simply, he doesn’t hold exactly the same views on everything asKeir Starmer. Some see this as a threat, as though nothing but a North Korean level of leader-worship is acceptable. But a high-functioning 21st-century organisation sees difference as a strength, in which only through contestation can better government emerge. This kind of healthy political contestation shouldn’t be blocked by the NEC.Second, Burnham doesn’t just have differences of opinion, but rather a viable if small-scale version of government that the Labour leadership could learn from. His mayoralty in Greater Manchester is showing that pluralism works. By emphasising place before party he brings everyone except the national populist right with him. Rarely if ever do the Greater Manchester combined authorities have votes, because everything is consensually agreed. And it works. This openness has allowed Burnham and his team to plan for the long term with a greater level of certainty. Among other things, they have created thefastest growing city regionin the UK. And when, at the end of last year, Burnham made aspeech in Manchestertalking about how this growth can be replicated and scaled across the country, he was introduced by the Liberal Democrat leader of Stockport council.Burnham does not have all the answers to all the problems that face Britain – neither does Starmer – but U-turns may be less frequent and better long-term decisions may be made if they and others worked together. I think Starmer and Burnham want to get to very similar places but have different paths – let them and others work out together how best to achieve that through collaboration and contestation. That’s politics.And third, if Starmer reverses this decision and lets Burnham run, it would signal the biggest and best possible reset forLabour. Thousands of people energised by the ideas around Burnham may stay on as Labour members, and many more could rejoin or join for the first time. A big and energetic byelection can take place in which the forces of progressivism go head to head with the forces of regressivism. The tide of Reform UK could be turned back.It’s Andy Burnham, the man who could be king. Will he, won’t he – are we really still watching this movie? | Marina HydeRead moreBut this moment is much bigger than Burnham, Starmer or even Labour itself. Beyond all this febrile talk inside the party and the media about people’s intentions, ambitions, the supposed rivalries and gamesmanship, this is a moment for Starmer to signal a new way of behaving and doing politics. It is nonsense to suggest that everyone should simplyshut up and be loyal, that no one who aspires to better things for their party or their country should make speeches and write articles and develop their thinking and their networks. Or stand for their party. If we want future leaders, we can’t expect them to say and do nothing to prepare themselves for leadership. This isn’t how all other relationships, families, organisations or companies work, and it shouldn’t be how our political system works. This is a moment for all of us to grow up.Finally, this is a moment for Labour to reestablish the principles of internal pluralism. Every political party needs to protect its borders from those out to wreck it, or those with offensive or extreme views. But outside those cases, healthy debate is the only route to a healthy party. No debate, no alternatives and the absence of nuance mean any organisation will wither and eventually die. Ultimately, the left and the right in Labour need each other.This is not a call for disagreement to end, but for honest, constructive and respectful disagreement to fuel the reset that everyone knows the party, the government and the country need. Just when public cynicism and contempt for politics couldn’t seem to get any worse, this decision makes the world feel a little darker. For our prime minister to look his best, to show who is in charge and signal the change Britain voted for in 2024, he should reverse this decision.Neal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation CompassExplore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamOpinionLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

I had missed the time slot for tourist visits and could only enter for the Evensong program. Being a practising Muslim, I was not familiar with Anglican liturgical rites, but curiosity prevailed and so I entered.As I walked in, my gaze was seized by the sacred art, the high vaulted ceilings, the looming majesty of a place that, over the past nine centuries, has witnessed the coronation of every English king.A thought strolled through my mind; not a unique one but one that weighed more heavily in that moment: how many prayers have been offered here over the centuries? What dead hopes and unlived dreams hover in the air? How many hushed prayers have been uttered in communion with God, seeking good in this life and salvation in the next?Some would have walked away and later felt that their prayers were answered. Others would have felt that they sought but did not find, that they knocked but found no open doors. And yet, the faithful continue to pray.Since my visit to Westminster Abbey, I have thought more consciously about the nature of prayer. Prayer occupies a unique space: all communication is directed outwards but prayer is directed inwards, to a being that the Qur’an describes as being closer than our jugular veins. It is fainter than a whisper, yet it echoes resoundingly in the depths of the heart. Prayer is that which recentres our relationship with God, rekindling the flame that flickers within us that reminds us of the evanescence of life and its sorrows.As the year begins, don’t look away from the headlines, look better and deeper | Justine TohRead moreIn wanting to learn more of prayer, I consulted How to Pray: Reflections and Essays, by one of my favourite thinkers and writers, CS Lewis. In this work, Lewis tackles a variety of questions concerning prayer, such as why one should pray if God is all-knowing; whether prayer can be proven to “work”; and how one can pray with delight. Some may find these topics fascinating, but I am not interested in theological quandaries; I leave that to theologians and philosophers. I am interested in beauty, not in comprehending the divine but in adoring it.Lewis has a remarkable knack for explaining complex concepts in elegant and accessible prose. In a book brimming with beautiful passages, one stood out for me:“Don’t bother about the idea that God ‘has known for millions of years exactly what you are about to pray’. That isn’t what it’s like. God is hearing you now, just as simply as a mother hears a child. The difference His timelessness makes is that this now (which slips away from you even as you say the word now) is for Him infinite. If you must think of His timelessness at all, don’t think of Him having looked forward to this moment for millions of years: think that to Him you are always praying this prayer.”This passage blew me away. A single, uttered prayer becomes timeless. What, then, of all the prayers that have ever been uttered? Is prayer not that which unites different faith traditions and stretches across the vast expanse of history? Has there ever been a person who did not pray, at least once in their life, to a higher being?The world, then, becomes something entirely different: the Earth, with all its lands and seas, is transformed into a vast arena of perpetual worship. Prayers are drastically altered; words uttered and cried in every conceivable language merge into an unending song that fills the air with the praises of the divine; the solitary and individual becomes communal and universal. And suddenly the brittle barrier that we have erected between the sacred and the mundane begins to crumble, slowly at first, until it shatters before the piercing power of prayer.In Westminster Abbey, I wondered why the faithful continue to pray. Perhaps it is because they always have.Ali Hammoud is a PhD candidate at Western Sydney University. He is broadly interested in Shia Islam and Islamicate intellectual history.

But all nations tell stories to themselves – and this is the national narrative of the (white Australian) federation of 1901 that grew from violent dispossession after the tall ships arrived as the apex of invasion in 1788.‘Serious mistake’: there’s no benefit for Australia in joining Donald Trump’s ‘board of peace’ – only riskRead moreWere we to celebrate the national birthday at federation we’d have just turned 125. Hardly part of the old world to be sure, though still disappointingly in too many ways one of its colonial extensions politically and culturally.Australia is hardly a neophyte nation either. Celebrated from federation as a new beacon of bold democracy within the British empire and a bastion of rights (not least for workers and female voters but never for Indigenous people), but 125 years later we seem more empirically shackled than ever.Australian republicans have long sought to break the chains with Great Britain, as largely symbolic as they remain – although on 26 January England and its first fleet by definition takes awkward centre stage in the celebrations and, for First Nations peoples and their supporters, the mourning.And yet today as Australia stops to celebrate itself, more progressive citizens will be uncomfortably preoccupied with their country’s obsequiousness and ever-deeper indebtedness to another more powerful empire with its rapidly eroding democratic institutions, and its threat to global order and peace.The US under its 45th and 47th president increasingly operates in a mist of White House untruths, with a mob mentality and in a moral vacuum. It functions with waning regard to international law. It has become impossible to predict internationally, as evidenced by its military intervention in Venezuela and the president’s erratic gameshow charade ofwill I or won’t I?invade Nato ally Greenlandin order to “take”.It should be no small matter when two respectedformer (Labor) foreign ministerswarn that Australia ought reconsider its commitment to the US alliance under the current “fiercely unpredictable” administration which raises a “colossal challenge” for Australia.And yet strategically – even as the US sabre-rattles at Europe and seeks to supplant the United Nations (an organisation in whose establishmentAustralia was formative) with a pay-to-playboard of peace including dictatorsof rogue nations and led by Donald Trump – our political leaders remain pretty well mute, the countryhocked to America militarily and strategicallyby the $368bn Aukus submarine deal.Slavish, unquestioning dedication to Washington by the federal government and the opposition parties lends a bipartisan shield to Aukus, despite serious privately held reservations about it within government and the defence and intelligence establishments.Where is that much-vaunted ruggedly individual self-sufficiency when it’s needed?You have to wonder, given the threateningCaligula-like ramblingsemanating from the White House, what it would actually take for middle power Australia to ditch Aukus, dispense with its little America cloak and publicly countenance rethinking the alliance under the present US administration.Given the federal government’s deafening silence (which can, let’s face it, easily be interpreted as another pathetic appeasement of the emperor), we’ve got a long way to go. Indeed, Australia shows no sign of heeding the wake-up call to middle powers by the Canadian prime minister,Mark Carney, at Davosthat no longer will “compliance buy safety” amid America’s disruption of the rules based order.Political race callers may find it instructive that Treasurer Jim Chalmers was initially a lone government voice in his veryenthusiastic praiseof Carney’s “stunning speech’’ criticising Trump’s US and the need for middle powers to seek more reliable, safe multilateralism elsewhere. His praise for Carney’s sentiments are bound to resonate with the Australian public and theirrapidly evaporating faith in America, its capacity to behave with global responsibility and the reliability of its president to back an Australia in need. PM Anthony Albanese has since said he agrees with Carney’s assessment (although his enthusiasm was notably less effusive than Chalmers’.)Jim Chalmers says Canadian PM’s ‘stunning’ denunciation of Trump is being widely discussed in Australian governmentRead moreYet sadly Australia’s official threshold for sycophancy towards a country that deploys paramilitary force against its own people on racial grounds (resulting inshooting dead apparent innocents) and strongman threats to use the US military against American citizens remains starkly at odds with public concern.In his quest for Greenland, Trump, it should be remembered, cited America’s craving for its natural resources. Ring any alarm bells in the resources richwide brown landwhich has already entered acritical minerals dealwith the US president? It should.This 26 January – amid the First Nations protests against the settler state whose founding document doesn’t recognise them and which celebrates national identity on the anniversary of invasion, amid all of the hollow political talk about some supposedly unique Australian individualism, self-sufficiency and rugged anti-authoritarianism – perhaps it pays to ponder just where the nation might actually sit as a global citizen right now.It’s hard to ignore the discomfiting voice that responds: in the lap of a superpower sliding into tyranny.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralia DayOpinionAustralian foreign policyIndigenous AustraliansAustralian politicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

What happens when they start to speak out?Sun 25 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 06.05 ESTShareAchild is born. Before they even landed “Earthside”, in the language of Instagram, a scan of them as a foetus in utero was uploaded to a waiting audience. The room in which they will sleep – the pale pastel paintwork, the carefully curated nursery furniture – is all there, ready, waiting: an advertorial empty of its model. Then comes the photo of the baby being born, held aloft to their audience while still covered in vernix, eyes not yet open, their mother smiling, hair perfect.From now on, their every moment and milestone is documented for the camera and monetised. That first smile, first word, first step, all mediated by a device and sent to an audience of strangers, many of whom have formed a parasocial relationship with that mother, that father, that child. The child comes to know and understand the black mirror that is regularly put in front of them. There will be days when the child happily performs for the camera; others when they push it away, when they don’t want to be filmed. A natural feeling, but one they may well have learned to suppress. Because performing for the camera makes mummy and daddy happy, although they don’t call it performing. They call it authenticity.One day, after years and years of this, that child rebels.That child isn’t Brooklyn Beckham, who was born before the advent of Instagram, so started his life beingmonetised in print instead. But they may as well be. To paraphrase one Mumsnet user, the Beckham family feud could spark a #MeToo moment for the children of celebrities and influencers. The Beckhams walked so that influencers could run – they’ve learned from the best. So inured to this mass monetisation of childhood have large swathes of the public become that many no longer see anything wrong with it. They no longer see the truth, which is that we are in the midst of a giant social experiment, with children as the guinea pigs. Never before in the history of humanity have children seen their right to privacy so violated, and by the adults who are supposed to care for and protect them. And anyone who watches or engages with this kind of mass content is complicit.View image in fullscreenBrooklyn and David Beckham during a charity match, Old Trafford, Manchester, 14 November 2015.Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd/Getty ImagesCall me pious, or jealous, or a luddite if you like, but I know I am not the only one to whom this all just feels so, so wrong. Yesterday I watched a reel of a newborn baby who had been outside their mother’s body for a mere 20 minutes before their face was beamed around the world, and I thought – excuse my language – “this is fucked”. I felt grubby in my spectatorship, mere days after Brooklyn’spublic denunciationof his family system, and the psychological damage that he claims public exposure has caused him. I don’t follow these people, but they still, somehow, appear.Children of 1990s and 2000s celebrity culture – Prince Harrybeing another– are the canaries in the coalmine of this mass experiment. Those damaged boys – now men – have tried to tell us in their own words how difficult it is to construct your own identity when you grow up in the glare of spectacle. For this they are called ungrateful, because in this economy, isn’t fame and fortune the best thing a parent can give a child?Only if you’ve lost touch with what a child needs – food, water, love, attention, interaction, a feeling of safety – can you think this life is preferable to a normal, private childhood. “Brand partnerships” do not appear on Maslow’shierarchy of needsfor a reason. Brand partnerships don’t give a child the freedom they need to be themselves without self-scrutiny, an essential freedom for psychological wellbeing in adulthood. Nor does being constantly photographed and shared.The problem is that so much of it just seems so wholesome. Smiling children in matching pyjamas, blowing out birthday candles, paddling at the beach, dancing. Sometimes, their tears and their tantrums are shared, too (I havewritten aboutthat cruelty before): all the better to share these moments of vulnerability. Soauthentic.Teachable, even.There are of course the shocking cases of neglect and abuse, such as that of theYouTube vlogger Ruby Franke. The vast majority of content creators are not like this. However, uncomfortable though it is to state, any influencer who centres their children in their content operates on the same continuum, and some people – myself included – judge them for it. Not that they, with their hundreds of thousands of followers, probably care about that.When they might start to care, though, is when their own children inevitably speak out. I believe that these parents are heading for a painful reckoning. So, albeit to a lesser extent, are the people consuming it, who have somehow found themselves able to detach from the reality of what they are doing, which is looking at other people’s children on the internet. After all, the children seem happy enough, don’t they?As far as I’m concerned, it’s all very creepy and wrong. It amounts to a deprivation of a child’s freedom to enjoy their childhood unobserved. And look, I’m not perfect: I have written about my child, shared photos of the back of his head. Perhaps your kid’s face is on the internet. Maybe you feel uneasy about that, and about the accounts that you follow. All I ask is that you examine that feeling, listen to it. Maybe consider pressing unfollow, locking your account.

But so much still stands in the way of Labour’s vision for social housingSun 25 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 25 Jan 2026 14.22 ESTShareImet Carole Guscott, a retired former carer, on a clear winter’s morning in the Somerset town of Minehead. She was walking her whippet, Gracie, on the way back to her new flat, past the local Premier Inn and on to a cul de sac called Rainbow Way. “I knew as soon as I saw it,” she told me. “I just thought: ‘I can make this place my home.’”Up until recently, she was living in a private rented place near the centre of town and paying £780 a month in rent. For four years she had known thatRainbow Way was being built. She also knew that its houses and flats were an example of something that is vanishingly rare in post-Thatcher Britain: new council housing, which meant security for the people chosen to be the tenants but also intense competition for places.But she then got a call, and an invitation to come and have a look. “I was stunned,” she said. She instantly decided to move in, paying just over £500 in monthly rent, and delighting in the views of the surrounding hills and townscape. “The flat is just so open and bright,” she told me. “I feel blessed that I’m here.” She also said: “Without a council house, there just isn’t the security.”There are 54 new council homes on Rainbow Way: 33 flats and 21 houses – the first such dwellings to be built in this part of Somerset in 30 years. Aroundhalf the peoplenow living here were recently “homeless, facing harassment, being moved on from supported accommodation or urgently needing two or more bedrooms due to family circumstances”. Of the new tenants, 89% were already resident in Minehead and 11% had “strong local connections”: an important point, because the town is a byword for deprivation andlow social mobility, with an economy centred on seasonal employment – symbolised by its renowned and vast Butlin’s – and a dire level of local housing need.View image in fullscreenSome of the new houses at Rainbow Way.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianAnd so here it all is: gently contemporary architecture, a compact children’s playground and homes designed to be zero carbon. On the morning I visited, a party of councillors and their officers werehaving their photo takenin front of one of the four-storey apartment blocks as they cut a length of ceremonial ribbon. As gulls cawed, a van pulled in, dropping furniture off at one of the new flats. Ushered into the sole flat still awaiting tenants, I flicked through a dossier of instructions and suggestions about how to get the best out of the garden, and local walking routes. There was a tangible sense of calm, wellbeing and lives that have taken a welcome new turn.How did this happen? Somerset has a new unitary council, which has absorbed four district councils that were once responsible for housing. Two of those councils had long since sold their stock to housing associations, but the others had stuck with providing and maintaining homes. Here, then, was an opportunity for the ruling Lib Dem administration to both sustain 10,500 existing council homes and build as many new ones as possible. At the last count, there were11,644 householdson the Somerset waiting list – what can currently be done may only scratch the surface, but that does not make the drive to build any less urgent.As far as national politics is concerned, the warm glow emanating from Minehead triggers a couple of obvious questions. Amid the bitter, resentful public mood and a housing crisis that grips so many parts of the country, why are there not far more Rainbow Ways? And given that the government has talked repeatedly of “the biggest increase insocial and affordable housebuildingin a generation”, how long will we have to wait for some kind of breakthrough moment?Which brings us to Labour’s record so far, and aspects of policy that ministers do not talk about nearly enough. Thanks chiefly to Angela Rayner’s time at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the government hasdrastically restrictedthe right-to-buy scheme that made the economics of council housing almost impossible, limiting discounts, allowing councils tokeep all the receiptsfrom any sales and announcing plans to exclude new properties from the scheme for the next 35 years. In stark contrast to past periods when budgets were squeezed by rents being capped and reduced, they can nowincrease annuallyby up to the rate of inflation plus 1%. And then there is the biggest move of all: £39bnset asidefor affordable housing over 10 years, which will apparentlypay for 180,000 homesfor social rent by 2035, although no one expects the results to even begin to become apparent until the end of the current parliament.The housing charity Shelter gladly acknowledges how significant this is, but also points out that 18,000 new council homes a year is way short of the90,000 annual completionsit says are needed to get a grip on the housing crisis. And there is one other glaring problem: the legacy of a labyrinthine agreement struck between central government and local authorities back in 2012, whichtransferred £13bnof historic housing debt from Whitehall to councils on the basis of guarantees and assumptions – that rents would steadily rise and right-to-buy sales would continue at pre-2012 levels – that did not hold. Somerset now carries £190m of that debt, which it says it can service, though if it were free of that burden it would be able to build much more.View image in fullscreenCarole Guscott in her new home.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianOther local authorities are in much more difficult circumstances. When I got back from Minehead, I had a conversation with Sarah King, the leader of Southwark council, whichaccording to them built 600 new homes in its chunk of London last year but is held back from doing more by its £408m share of the same burden, as well as fire and safety demands that – entirely correctly – arrived in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster (“The commitments put new demands on us without any new money,” she said). Unlike with some other councils, the cost of servicing its housing debt means Southwark can no longer borrow to build. “And this is the depressing bit,” she said. “We have sites with planning permission, but we can’t build on them because of the state of our finances.”Labour faces costs of £50bn to replenish affordable housing after right to buy, report saysRead moreMinisters, she said, understand her predicament, but she and her colleagues – along with the people who run scores of other councils – are still demanding the kind of meaningful action that would begin with central government writing off at least some of that debt on the basis that doing so would open the way to much more housing investment. And asthey campaign, they feel the need to restate some obvious truths. “If you invest in council homes, you save massive amounts on the housing benefit bill,” King told me. “You make savings on people’s health because people are living in homes that are warm, safe and dry. You provide space for children to do their homework.”This, of course, was the source of the lovely, life-affirming feeling I got that morning in Minehead – accompanied by a nagging sense of unfinished policy, time fast running out, and yet another example of one of this country’s most tragic habits: patiently and anxiously waiting, even though we all know what urgently needs to be done.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionSocial housingRenting propertyLocal governmentcommentShareReuse this content"

Now 26, she says she’s finally making music for herself and happy to wear her heart on her sleeveSun 25 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareMadison Beer may only be 26, but she is something of a veteran in the pop industry. She got her start at 13, after Justin Bieber tweeted a link to a YouTube video of hercovering Etta James’s At Last, and has spent the intervening decade-plus toiling away in mainstream pop, amassing a huge gen Z fanbase in the process – including more than 60 million followers between Instagram and TikTok. It’s an understatement to say that her career has been a slow burn: the day before we speak, it’s announced that her single Bittersweet, released in October, has become her first song to reach the US Hot 100 chart, entering at No 98. When I suggest congratulations are in order, she shrugs off the achievement. “I’m obviously super excited and thankful whenever a song performs well, but I think I’m at the point where I love what I make, and I’m proud of it regardless,” she says amiably, before laughing. “Only took me like,15 years! But it’s cool.”Beer’s attitude is indicative of someone whose career has progressed in fits and starts, a far cry from the kind of meteoric rise that fans and onlookers sometimes expect to see in aspirant pop stars. As she prepares for the release of her third album, Locket, she is in prime position to break through to pop’s upper echelon: Her 2023 album Silence Between Songs featured the sleeper hits Reckless and Home to Another One, the latter a sorely underrated Tame Impala-inspired cut, and in 2024 she released Make You Mine, a Top 50 single in the UK which was nominated for a best dance pop recording Grammy.But those successes, she says, came relatively recently, and she spent many years freeing herself from the idea that things such as charts and awards define an artist. “It was definitely hard for years to detach from that ideology, but I feel so much better off now that that’s not something I drive myself crazy over,” she says. “I don’t want to diss myself here, but I haven’t had No 1s, I haven’t had gigantic songs – actually, that’s not true, I think Ihavehad gigantic songs, but [not] to people’s criteria. I’m like: if I can still sell out a tour and perform for crowds and enjoy it, then clearly I’m OK.”Bullying a 15-year-old is unacceptable, whereas when I was 15, that wasn’t really a conversationBeer was raised in Long Island, New York; after that first burst of publicity via Bieber, her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she was signed as a management client by Scooter Braun, Bieber’s then-longtime manager. The early years of her career followed a time-worn format: she recorded tie-in songs for doll brands; collaborated with more established teen idols such as Cody Simpson; and treaded water until it was time to record an album. Beer started working during a transitional phase for the pop industry, when social media was a powerful force that labels still didn’t really know what to do with. She attracted a lot of hate online, as is common for young female stars, and felt wholly unsupported by the infrastructure around her.“People are so quick to be like: ‘This is what’s wrong with this person,’ and attack someone’s character. The first boyfriend I had [Jack Gilinsky of pop-rap duo Jack & Jack] … I got so much hate from his fanbase and all of these people online. I learned, very early, that people can be quite cruel,” she says matter-of-factly. “I definitely feel protective [of younger stars] and I fear for people. I would hope that people are now like, ‘Bullying a 15-year-old is unacceptable’, whereas when I was 15, that wasn’t really a conversation. I didn’t really feel very protected.”View image in fullscreenBeer here now … Madison on stage in Fort Worth, Texas.Photograph: Omar Vega/Getty/iHeartRadioAt 16, Beer was dropped by Braun and her then-label Island Records; in a recentCosmopolitan interview, she said she felt that Braun and her label “stole years of my childhood that I’ll never get back”. I ask how it’s felt to witness him part ways with clients such as Justin Bieber andAriana Grande, and receive criticism in the press for his acquisition and sale ofTaylor Swift’s masters, but Beer sidesteps the topic. “I feel like I’m just at a point in my life where I’m doing my thing, and I’m focusing on my music and my career. I’ve done a lot of therapy, especially regarding those early years, and I’ve really tried to let go of it all,” she says. “Holding animosity, hatred and negativity towards things like that [doesn’t] do me any good. I’ve completely let go of it, and I don’t care. That’s not my issue, not my circus.”That perspective, and sensitivity to her own emotions, comes to the fore on Locket. The album pairs raw, provocative lyrics with lush, dreamy pop music that sits somewhere between Lana Del Rey and Sabrina Carpenter – the latter of whom is another star who, like Beer, worked for a decade in pop’s trenches before breaking through in her 20s. Beer says she couldn’t have made a record like Locket, which is direct and freewheeling in its approach, without her more introspective sophomore effort. “With Silence Between Songs, I really let people get to know me – that was really what I wanted to get out of that album, whereas with this one, I kind of felt like I didn’t need to go crazy over explaining myself and my story so much,” she says. “I was more so creating music that I loved. It’s a new chapter, it’s a new energy – I’m older, wiser, in a really good place.”View image in fullscreenDress to impress … Beer at last year’s Grammys.Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagicOn Silence Between Songs, Beer didn’t “care if it [didn’t] do well, because it’s weird – I’m pulling influence from the Beach Boys, from the Beatles, all these different areas of my life”, she recalls. With this album, she wanted things to be a little more “digestible to my fanbase” – and, as such, the sound fits a more traditional mould; it is, for the most part, a plush R&B record studded with throbbing dance-pop tracks such as Yes Baby and Make You Mine. “With this one, it was more so just like, ‘I want to have fun’.”Silence Between Songs was released in 2023, after a few difficult years for Beer, during which she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and attracted widespread criticism online for a variety of fairly trivial snafus, including an incident in which she said she “romanticised” the relationship in Lolita, and another in which she was accused of staging photos of herself at a Black Lives Matter protest (which both she and the photographer deny). In 2023 she also released a memoir titled The Half of It, in which she opened up about her struggles with mental health, the sexualisation she experienced as a teenager and much more. Both projects were made out of a desire for fans and more casual observers to see her as human, rather than just another internet celebrity.“I’ve been online since I was 12, and some people have their minds made up about me – they judge me, which is all OK, I’ve made my peace with that,” she says. “But at the end of the day, I felt with writing a book, at least the people who do want to take the time to get to know me … I [had] to give them an opportunity. I wanted to showcase the truth of things I’ve been through, and show my vulnerability, and hopefully inspire other people. I was at a place where I was like: ‘See me, please, I’m begging you.’ Now that I know the right people have read it and resonated with it, I don’t feel like I need to spend my hours and days sitting online being like: ‘No no, that thing you think about me is not real.’”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Morgan MaherBeer’s newfound peace with how people perceive her comes through on Locket, whose lyrics can be disarmingly honest in its assessment of totalising, dissociative infatuation. “Some days I barely respond to my own name,” she sings at one point; at another, “I only exist in the moments you’re talking to me.” Beer dated TikToker Nick Austin from 2020 until spring 2025, and is currently dating the Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. She says the album chronicles “a pretty up and down, intense relationship” she was in while writing the record. “I feel very deeply, and I get spirally, I guess I could say, and kind of find myself being someone that dwells on things. I’m the kind of person that’s like: if I’m in a fight with my partner, I feel like I literally don’t have a place in the world.”She continues: “There were times where I would shelter how intense I am – I was like: ‘I don’t want people to deem me crazy or obsessive’, but that’s how I am. When I love, I love fucking hard, and that is the truth,” she says. “I definitely have abandonment issues, attachment issues, I know I have these things that I try to work through, but it’s just my nature of feeling things super deeply.”Beer’s ability to freely admit her flaws, she says, comes from all the work she’s done on herself in the past decade. “I’ve done every kind of therapy – I’m talking about everything all the time, and I think I’ve come to a point where I can acknowledge these things about me without feeling shame,” she says. “I acknowledge that I am not perfect, and I have my own issues, and I do shit sometimes that I look back on and I’m like: ‘Why did I do that?’ As long as you can do that and work through it, I think it’s OK.”The downside to writing so openly about a relationship, of course, is that fans will inevitably try to ascribe certain lyrics to certain people, which Beer describes as “a really difficult thing, especially for me”, given how much hate she’s received on social media. “It’s scary for me to release an album like this. It would be pretty easy for me to go online and be like: ‘This is what happened [in my last relationship]’ and I don’t like that. I think that it’s totally inappropriate in regards to people’s privacy,” she says. “I dated this person for a long time, and I don’t want anybody to go and attack them or rip them apart. I don’t wish ill upon literally anybody.”It seems as if Beer will be able to stand by Locket as a piece of music, beyond any commercial success, critical praise or fan reaction. She’s grafted to get to this place, and won’t likely let it go any time soon. “Those things are out of my control,” she says. “To me, the true meaning of success is being able to feel peace and happiness, no matter what.”Locket is out now.

There’s body horror Saccharine, about a diet craze that involves eating human ashes, midnight movieBuddy, about a Barney-esque kids TV star who starts murdering children and then there’s Mum, I’m Alien Pregnant which, well, you can probably imagine.Josephine review – Channing Tatum is a knockout in shattering drama of lost innocenceRead moreBut the annual “wait, what?” prize easily goes to offbeat fable Wicker, the story of a smelly spinster fisherwoman who commissions herself a husband made of, that’s right, wicker. While the film does have its expected amount of audience-provoking moments – wicker-fucking bringing the most noise both on and off the screen – to its credit, there’s an attempt to give us more than just easy shock value, something that can’t always be said for films in this often tedious category. Writer-directors Alex Huston Fischer and Eleanor Wilson, who previously brought mostly likeable alien invasion comedy Save Yourselves! to the festival, use their far-out premise to touch upon more of-our-world issues like the patriarchal cruelty of marriage and the special fury reserved for those who dare to live outside of the accepted rules. They succeed in brief flashes but ultimately, there’s too much here that doesn’t gel, a tonally uneven mix of mostly unfunny bawdy humour, dark fantasy and unlikely romance, too much wood but not enough fire.Olivia Colman, who has had mixed results at Sundance ranging from The Father to Jimpa, is Fisherwoman, whose smell is as remarked upon as her singledom. She’s largely immune to the insults though, happily removed from the archaic gender roles that curse the local village. But after she sneers through another comically awful wedding, the jabs start to have an effect and rather than laughing it away, she asks the local basket-maker (Peter Dinklage, forever seeming like he’s on the verge of breaking into song) to make her a husband. A month later, he arrives.There’s admirable ambition to the film-making, an intricately built world that meshes mostly old with bits of the new. Like many a fairytale, it’s a society built around the importance of men and the deference of women. Men are known by their profession and women by their relationship to their husband. The wedding ritual sees the man not offer his wife a ring but insist a collar upon her. Fisherwoman’s flagrant refusal to play by the rules, to take charge of her own life as breadwinner, throws the community into disarray. The women, led by Elizabeth Debicki’s spiralling queen bee, are both horrified and perhaps a little jealous, maybe even aroused by her new husband, played byAlexander Skarsgårdin impressively handsome wicker (the effects work here is top notch). The men are worried about what his sexual and domestic perfection means for them and how their wives see them. Can anyone be happy anymore?The central relationship is taken seriously enough for us to want more than we’re ultimately given. His arrival asks so many questions – what does he know, what does he want, what does she need, what was she missing – yet their early scenes are mostly based around comically vigorous sex (questions about splinters are also never answered) rather than any real development. He’s a commission designed to love her but there’s no exploration of what this means for their relationship and any agency he might want or need. These might sound like silly thoughts to have while watching a film like this but we’re meant to be emotionally invested in what happens. When conflict comes it’s mostly simple and soapy – has he shagged anyone else in town – and while there’s an effective scene of Colman breaking down while explaining the difficulties of sharing a life that had previously been lived alone (she remains one of our great criers) it’s too little too late. We don’t know anything of his reaction to the world or who he really is, just his blind devotion to her and when tragedy inevitably strikes, there’s just no real attachment to any of it. I was thinking about how invested I was in the admittedly more dramatic but even less verbal relationship between Sally Hawkins and the fish man in The Shape of Water. There are ways to make us care in fantastically odd romances such as this, I just don’t think Fischer and Wilson were able to find them.It’s hard to imagine many other working actors taking on the fisherwoman role, Colman often seeming like the rare actor whose career has allowed certain films to exist. I haven’t loved her choices of late (The Roses, Jimpa, Wicked Little Letters) but she’s never less then entirely devoted to often far-out bits and she gives this her all even though I wish the script afforded her more depth. She knows how to oscillate between broad comedy and heart-wrenching drama but the film around her isn’t as adept. Like the dream husband at its centre, Wicker looks the part but there’s nothing underneath.Wicker is screening at the Sundance film festivalExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewOlivia ColmanAlexander SkarsgårdElizabeth DebickiPeter DinklageComedy filmsSundance film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s ironic that it’s a song about redemption when you’re being told to clean the house.The song I do at karaokeYou need to have a song that everyone knows, so they can help you sing along, so I’d go for Angels by Robbie Williams or Wonderwall by Oasis.The song I know every lyric toI remember hearing Boombastic by Shaggy in a Wallace and Gromit-style Plasticine advert for Levi’s 501s in the 90s, in an advert break during The Big Breakfast, as I was getting ready to go to school. I loved the lyrics, although I didn’t know what he was talking about because I was only a kid.The song I can no longer listen toIt’s not so much I’ve rinsed it, but Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond felt like it became a vibe during the last [men’s] Euros.

Played by equally remarkable newcomer Mason Reeves, Josephine likes playing soccer with her dad Damien (a phenomenal Channing Tatum), with whom she is close – the film’s crisp, near wordless opening minutes, which shift seamlessly from Josephine’s perspective to third party co-conspirator, running with the pair through San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, swiftly convey a tender, playful bond: supportive, teasing father and innocent child.Leviticus review – queer desire is a deadly curse in haunting horrorRead moreThat’s about all we know of Josephine – all we need to know, really – before seeing the incident that ruptures her youth. Having run ahead of her father at the park, Josephine alone witnesses the brutal rape of a female jogger by a man in a distinctive aqua polo. Much to the audible shock of viewers at the Sundance premiere, de Araújo rejects the ellipsis now de rigueur in movies handling sexual assault, how much ofpost-MeToo cinema– Promising Young Woman, She Said, Women Talking, last year’s SundancestandoutSorry, Baby– have skipped over or elided the actual assault, de-emphasizing violence and allowing viewers to fill in the blanks.Not here. We witness all of what Josephine witnesses from her position behind a tree – the screaming, the struggle, every ghastly step of the rape – as well as Josephine herself; cinematographer Greta Zozula captures both the crime and the child’s cherubic face, shaded by both fear and curiosity, in equally naturalistic light. The arresting sequence makes a necessary point: what is beyond appalling to adults is absolutely baffling to the budding mind of a child – intuitively wrong, yes, but also fascinating, alien. To understand Josephine’s confusion and anger, why she begins to act erratically and aggressively, you need to know exactly what horror she replays in her head, trying to comprehend.This is admittedly a lot of setup for an exquisitely sensitive film – the standout drama of Sundance so far — that is predominantly about aftermath, with a solidGemma Chanand a career-best Tatum as her well-meaning but ill-equipped parents. But the intensity of the incident is key, for it underscores the inadequacy of every adult’s response. The police who immediately respond to Damien’s 911 call ignore her, put her in the cop car with the shattered victim (Syra McCarthy) and allow her to see the arrested perpetrator (Philip Ettinger); the camera’s searching gaze – on the woman’s scraped knee, on the man’s near-defiant expression – suggests seared memories. Her mother, sweet and willowy, tries vague platitudes, distractions, psychotherapy (which is inexplicably dropped before any sessions). Her father, a self-described “physical guy”, takes her to self-defense classes. Neither explain to Josephine, who does not know what sex is, what she saw.De Araújo has a keen ear for the maxims and reflexes parents use to defend themselves – “that will never, ever happen to you”, Damien unhelpfully responds when Josephine asks if it will happen to her. And she manages a tricky balance, between sketching in the stymied adults’ triggered responses, and hewing closely to Josephine, who, in an effectively creepy flourish, sees the man from the park in her room at night, especially after she’s called in a trial witness.That balances wobbles occasionally, particularly in the film’s overstretched final third. Wordless sequences of Miles Ross’s score, pulsating with Josephine’s unprocessed feelings, lose their potency with time. Chan is not given many notes beyond concern, ranging from mild to abject; brief moments that suggest her personal experience with the subject, such as a car ride in which Josephine asks if she’s ever been raped, are subtle to the point of too understated. But by and large, de Araújo manages to believably steer the bruised family through near-horror into a bravura final courtroom scene. There’s a chilling but thankfully restrained horror to Josephine’s inward retreat, as her inchoate anger boils over in increasingly erratic, alarming ways.It’s a feat not possible without Reeves – a rare natural, able to both hold her own and disappear into herself – and especially Tatum, whose effortless naturalism somehow still feels underrated and who is simply astonishing as a father far out of his depth. As a movie star, Tatum embodies a certain brand of familiar yet aspirational American masculinity, a hunky, charming everyman. It’s a pleasure, then, to see him take on one of the more fascinating paternal characters in recent memory, a father whose good and bad parenting instincts often coexist within the same sentence, whose confidence in himself and his convictions crumbles in inverse relation with his daughter’s, who must reckon with his own limitations and fear. There’s a beguiling if flawed heart to his Damien – from another actor of his stature, a late-stage scene in which he finally erupts on Josephine could seem menacing, distancing. But Tatum manages to ground the viewer in his abject bewilderment and pain.It’s a instantly memorable performance in a haunting movie, one that I have carried with me in the hours since I’ve seen it. Perhaps that is the best thing I can say about this remarkable feature – for its viewers, as it is for its meticulously rendered subject, the disquiet lingers.Josephine is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewSundance film festivalChanning TatumDrama filmsFestivalsGemma ChanreviewsShareReuse this content"

This open-hearted solo show, based on Maddigan’s own life, is a love letter to his mum – to all mums, really – told with unguarded love and wicked wit. Tickets should come with tissues.Maddigan plays his cocky 15 year-old-self, who is running from grief on top of dealing with the typical horrors of teenage angst. We start with the important information: how to befriend the cool guy at school, how to secure the strong stuff (cider) for the park, and which porn sites are top of the range. Maddigan’s expressions are elastic as he builds up this teenage world of crass jokes and uncontrollable erections, while anything more serious is pushed away for later. When he first tells us about his mum, he zooms through the fact of her death as if it’s just another detail in his day. Like everything’s totally fine.For all his bullish confidence and adult affectations, Scott Le Crass’s direction constantly reminds us that our arrogant protagonist is only a kid, as Maddigan slumps in a plastic chair in his school uniform and too-short tie, fretting over how to talk to the hot girl in his science class. Lighting director Adam Jefferys’ green strobes are the first signs of grief nipping at Ollie’s heels. Maddigan rapidly papers over the cracks with the next crude gag, his comic presentation deft and self-assured.View image in fullscreenYou’ll fall in love with his cheek … Maddigan.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianGradually, he undoes us with humour. And when he finally gives up all pretense of being okay, his earnest words to his mum are orchestrated by our weepy, percussive sniffs.The shape of the story is predictable, as Maddigan’s irreverent, swaggering confidence shatters into the acceptance of his grief. It’s sweet, neat writing. But the emotional grip and clarity of the telling is what gives this familiar tale such strength, as we fall in love with his cheek, his smarm, and his candid sorrow. Grief can make us insular but this is an incredibly generous performance, as the specificity of Maddigan’s story welcomes in our own reckonings with death, ushering in a line of lost loved ones and inviting them all to take a seat.AtSouthwark Playhouse, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreSouthwark PlayhousereviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s another one marking the centenary, and, more resurrection than mimicry, it can’t help but be striking to anyone who grew up with the raconteur, diarist and Carry On star as a mainstay of British life. There are ever fewer of us around, mind you: this is “a boomer show”, Benson admits, as strong on nostalgia as it is on insight into what made Williams tick.Indeed the first act is more about what made 13-year-old Benson tick. In 1975, his winning entry in a Jackanory story competition was read by Williams on national TV. We see him relive the moment, mortified that he’d now be associated by school bullies with the campest man in the UK. Elsewhere in act one, Benson recounts his adolescent awakening as an exponent of funny voices, casually deploying his note-perfect Frankie Howerd, Sergeant Bilko and the entire cast ofDad’s Army.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sonja HorsmanIt’s a story that tends towards an explanation of Williams’ lifelong importance to Benson. But that explanation never comes. Instead, the second act features scenes from Williams’ life: a dazzling riff during an audience Q&A about the spiritual history of western civilization; a bleak dialogue with his elderly mum, with whom he was co-dependent; and a dinner with friends at an Italian restaurant. They comprise one day in Williams’ life, and the full spectrum of what made him both beloved and insufferable.The risk with depicting someone so thin-skinned, self-absorbed and permanently performing is that they come across like a bit of a bore. One feels for his fellow diners. Less might have been more of all Kenneth’s chat about haemorrhoids and diarrhoea. But Benson’s Williams is extraordinary: the vocal (and nasal) gymnastics a show in themselves; the facial contortions unmistakable, decades after the man’s death. And there is poignancy, too, in his evident fear of intimacy and feelings of worthlessness. It’s an arresting snapshot of an extraordinary man, and the time he (and a shrinking number of we) lived through.Atthe Arden theatre, Faversham, on 25 January;then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatreKenneth WilliamsCarry On filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

To do so obliquely risks minimising its urgency, but go head-on and you risk hectoring or slipping into cliche. In its UK premiere,Julia Wolfe’s oratorio unEarth ultimately tilted towards the latter, although it made some striking impressions on the way.Produced by Wolfe’s collectiveBang on a Can, unEarth was first performed in 2023 in New York. Wolfe developed some of its text with a local youth choir, who sang in the premiere. Here it was the Finchley Children’s Music Group on stage, ranged behind the BBCSO and conductor Martyn Brabbins along with the men of the BBC Singers and National Youth Voices. All sang from memory, and all were amplified – as was Else Torp, singing a solo line in a lean high soprano that dovetailed into the orchestral sounds.While the singers had moved around in the premiere, here they stayed put, largely leaving the visual spectacle to Lucy Mackinnon’s projections on to a circular screen hanging moonlike over the stage, the music working evocatively with and against the images. When the men sang lines from the Book of Genesis about the annihilation wrought by the Flood, and the night-sky imagery turned to waves and water, the rain arrived violently, the violins ricocheting their bows on the strings. The second movement began with the men singing “tree” in dozens of languages, each word a small, sudden shot of life; these built into cross-rhythms that had the wind players almost dancing in their seats, backed by teeming imagery of plants and fungus.View image in fullscreenMartyn Brabbins conducts the BBC Symphony Orchestra.Photograph: Mark AllanBut the final movement, with teenagers staring from the screen and the children on stage intoning lines including “I take the bus”: this felt preachy, as did the list of climate-science buzzwords sung in thudding syllables by the men. Was it meant to suggest the futility of well-meaning actions? Is this another case of putting the onus on children to fix an older generation’s mess?Whatever the answer, it felt heavy-handed – especially given that in the first half of the concert we had heard Copland’s Appalachian Spring. With its beguilingly simple clarinet and flute solos, and its punchy rhythms springing up like unstoppable green shoots, Copland’s score seemed an effortless paean to nature’s resilience.OnBBC Radio 3on 12 February, then on BBC Sounds for 30 days.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicClimate crisisBarbicanBBC Symphony Orchestralive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Not too sweet and, thanks to the apple and carrot, lighter than it sounds, this is a proper winter dessert and the perfect end to a Burns supper, especially when served with custard or ice-cream.Prep20 minCook3 hr 15 minServes8-10110g fresh suet, or dried suet or a vegetarian alternative225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting½ tsp baking powder½ tsp fine salt1 tsp mixed spice1 tsp ground ginger¼ tsp ground allspice¼ tsp nutmeg110g soft brown sugar75g fine fresh breadcrumbs25g coarse oatmeal, or 25g extra breadcrumbs200g currants100g sultanas or raisins– golden ones look especially pretty1 large green apple1 carrotFinely grated zest of 1 unwaxed orange or lemon1 egg, beaten2 tbsp treacleAbout 60ml milk1 Get all your tools readyView image in fullscreenHalf-fill a large saucepan for which you have a lid with water, then bring to a boil (if you have a pan with handles on the side, so much the better). Soak a clean tea towel (a smooth one, rather than anything fluffy or towel-like) or cheesecloth in water. And have ready some butcher’s string, or similar.2 A note on the suetThough suet sounds heavy, its high melting point gives the dumpling dough a fluffy lightness. Fresh suet (the hard fat from around the kidneys, rather than generic beef fat) has the best flavour, but dry stuff, which also comes in vegetarian versions, will do fine. If using fresh, put it in the freezer while you prepare the rest.View image in fullscreen3 Start the dumpling mixPut the flour (if you prefer wholemeal, you may need to use more milk later) in a large bowl with the baking powder and salt. Whisk in all the spices (cinnamon would be a nice addition, or you might just use two teaspoons of mixed spice). Then, whisk in the sugar (dark brown sugar would give a richer flavour, but white is acceptable).4 A note on the breadcrumbsThe breadcrumbs should be the fluffy and fresh variety, rather than the crunchy dried sort sold in supermarkets. To make your own, roughly chop about 200g stale bread (a baker will probably sell or give you some), and remove the crusts. Whizz the cubes in a food processor to turn them into crumbs.View image in fullscreen5 Add the crumbs, oatmeal and fruitAdd the breadcrumbs, oatmeal and dried fruit (again, you can substitute your favourite variety) to the dry ingredients and whisk through until evenly combined. Coarsely grate in the suet, if necessary, the apple (no need to peel it) and carrot (only peel if it looks irredeemably dirty), then add the grated citrus zest and stir in.6 Mix in the treacle and milkView image in fullscreenPut the treacle (a lightly greased spoon, or one briefly dipped in boiling water, is useful here for measuring it out) in a small bowl, add the egg and beat with a fork (this will make it easier to distribute the sticky treacle through the dumpling mix). Stir this into the large bowl. along with just enough milk to create a mixture that drops off a spoon without being runny.7 Wrap the dough in a cloth, then tieView image in fullscreenWring out the soaked tea towel well, then lightly dust one side with flour. Drape the tea towel over a medium bowl, then spoon the dumpling mixture into the centre. Bring the edges of the towel together up and over the top of the dumpling mix, to make a little round bundle a bit like a money bag, then tie the top of the bundle tightly with string, leaving long tails at each end.8 Steam the dumplingView image in fullscreenPut a heatproof saucer or heat diffuser in the base of the pan of boiling water, then lower in the pudding parcel – the water should come about halfway up its sides. Tie the tails of string taut around the handles at each side of the pot (or around the lid), so it doesn’t tip over, then cover the pan and leave to cook at a rolling simmer for three hours, topping up the water as required.9 Finishing touchesView image in fullscreenCarefully lift out the dumpling, then unwrap on to a serving dish or tray. For the full clootie dumpling experience, leave it to cool slightly while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then put the dumpling in the oven for 15 minutes, so it develops an elastic skin. Serve with custard, cream or ice-cream. It’s also delicious sliced and fried in butter the next day.Explore more on these topicsBurns NightFelicity Cloake's masterclassWinter food and drinkFoodDessertBakingFruitBritish food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Red brick walls, greenery throughout, alfresco spaces, allotments growing fresh veg and herbs. Capacious, family-run, dog-welcoming, pocket-friendly. There’s bubble and squeak with hand-cut ham, Korean-style chicken burgers and a vegan burger called, rather brilliantly, “Peter Egan” after, I’m guessing, the animal-loving actor who played Paul in Ever Decreasing Circles.View image in fullscreen‘Down-to-earth dining’: the seafood platter.Could this place be any more adorable? No, but still, brace yourself. “It’s one in, one out,” I was told. “There’s a seated holding pen at the front where you wait for a table. Stand your ground in there. There’s loads of sharp-elbowed garden-centre folk. I think they’re there for the Basque cheesecake.” Ah, yes, the equally vast Claremont garden centre, just a few steps away. Cake, as we all know, is catnip to gardeners. Sends them daft. Come for 20 litres of alkaline topsoil and a terracotta trough, stay for the seasonal pavlova and thick wodges of billionaire’s shortbread. That’s millionaire’s shortbread with an extra layer of caramel decadence. Clearly real billionaires would never eat this shortbread, as they’re all on longevity hunts fuelled by OMAD (one meal a day), that meal being a posh spin on Trill budgie food.Thankfully, at the Tin Roof Cafe there are plenty of customers on hand to eat Bill Gates’ share. Instead of wholesome eating spots like Tin Roof becoming tweely irrelevant as the years pass, it’s evident they’re becoming more necessary. In 2026, eating early, soberly, with multigenerational tables – and, probably most importantly, while trying not to spend £100+ per head – is highly desirable. Once, a social life revolving around stale scones in garden centres was a quiet admission of life’s downwards slope; nowadays, places like Tin Roof have queues out of the door and TikTok hype, while the likes of Pizza Express, or local pubs, beg for daytime trade.View image in fullscreenDressing your own Malaysian chicken salad felt like ‘an arduous task’.Tin Roof Cafe is clearly not earnest, po-faced dining; it completely lacks that Petersham Nursery-influenced pretension where small plates come strewn with petunia leaves and there’s a gift shop with £50 notelet sets. No, this is much more down-to-earth dining, with fish finger baps, doorstep Burnham Bangers sarnies and very good five-cheese toasties on sourdough. Oozy, crisp, buttery and hefty; a shining example. We ordered a seafood sharing platter with prawns in shells, smoked salmon, anchovies on toast, a peppery smoked mackerel paté and a glut of other fishy things. A Malaysian chicken salad appeared in a large bowl with all its components laid out separately: piles of seared chicken, mango, cashew nuts, cucumber, seeds, leaves and a well-balanced sharp-sweet orange-based dressing in a separate dish. It felt princess-like to complain that this was lovely, but that it was a build-your-own salad, the whole thing needed a good stir and adding my own dressing felt like an arduous task. Perhaps modern audiences can’t commit themselves to all the ingredients, so Tin Roof are making it easier to remove terrifying things like avocado or rocket. Still, one couldn’t fault its generosity.View image in fullscreen‘Airy, rich, just sweet enough’: the Basque cheesecake.As we ate, the queues in reception got longer. A motorbike gang arrived – a pleasant one who liked bakewell tarts, not bedraggled, lawless menaces to society as seen in films. Pensioner ladies who lunch, dating teenagers, couples with babies grabbing fresh air and the partners of green-fingered types bribed to carry top soil by a promise of eggs florentine and a round of berry financiers. We took cakes home; their Basque cheesecake is pretty damn good. Airy, rich, just sweet enough, blackened in the right places and with a pleasing crust. The bakewell tart is equally good; albeit of US-style Cheesecake Factory proportions. An enormous slice of coffee and walnut was less impressive, but not upsetting enough to stop me returning to Tin Roof whenever I want to fight for my right to eat banana bread at 2pm between babies, grans and hungry horticulturalists. A not-so-hidden gem. More power to its gardening elbow.The Tin Roof Cafeteria and Bakery, Bryants Lane, Maldon, Essex CM9 6TB, 01245 204666.
