That came from John Cage’: Paul McCartney on the Beatles’ debt to great avant-garde composersIn the mid-60s, the Beatles tuned in to the world’s most audacious experimental musicians. Paul McCartney reveals how many of the Fab Four’s ‘far-out’ masterpieces were inspired by their sonic breakthroughsElizabeth AlkerTue 19 Aug 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt is a sunny October afternoon and I am sitting in a long wood-panelled hallway in an old converted townhouse in London waiting to be called into the office ofPaul McCartney. I am dressed in my best clothes and trying not to let nerves get the better of me. I am here to ask him about an aspect of his career that is rarely discussed but which, I believe, helped cement his reputation as a world-conquering compositional force and which made the Beatles the most interesting and influential band of all time.In the mid-1960s, as well as topping the charts, turning a generation of teenage girls hysterical and finding themselves the focus of obsessive media attention, the Beatles were also engaged with, and educating themselves about, the work of classical music’s most audacious and important composers.My plastic bag full of tape loop sounds took Tomorrow Never Knows to another placeMcCartney watched the communist and free improviser Cornelius Cardew play the prepared piano at the Royal College of Art in London. He saw Karlheinz Stockhausen deliver an address about the development of synthesised sound. And he went to meet Delia Derbyshire (“She was in a shed at the bottom of her garden full of machines”) to ask if she wanted to write an electronic score for Yesterday. He attended a lecture by the Italian composer and electronic experimentalist Luciano Berio, who later arranged a series of songs by the Beatles for his first wife, the mezzo-soprano Cathy Berberian.View image in fullscreenClassical student … McCartney at a lecture by electronic experimentalist Luciano Berio.Photograph: Les Lee/Getty ImagesThe Beatles, McCartney tells me, also took their cue from the 1956 piece Radio Music by John Cage for one of the band’s most famous songs: “Cage had a piece that started at one end of the radio’s range,” he says, “and he just turned the knob and went through to the end, scrolling randomly through all the stations. I brought that idea to I Am the Walrus. I said, ‘It’s got to be random.’ We ended up landing on some Shakespeare – King Lear. It was lovely having that spoken word at that moment. And that came from Cage.”On a purple velvet sofa in his office, McCartney talks to me with the same irrepressible energy that has driven his contribution to music for more than 60 years. He also has a very endearing way of never assuming knowledge and very politely checks, for instance, that I know about his friend, John. “You know, John Lennon?” (I do.) And did I know the Beatles had “this song called Yesterday?” (I did). He seems delighted to talk less about his own achievements and more about the people who helped broaden his scope.View image in fullscreenAlchemy … musique concrète pioneer Pierre Schaeffer.Photograph: INA/Getty ImagesTwo men who certainly did that were French composer-engineers Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaeffer who, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, pioneered a style of composition calledmusique concrète. Working in Parisian studios set up for propaganda broadcasts during the second world war, the pair used turntables and tape machines to forge an entirely original method of composing which, in line with French movements in art and philosophy at the time, sought to deconstruct established ideas and build from scratch a new means of making music.This was iconoclasm driven by an erosion of trust in a ruling class that had led millions to their deaths during two brutal international conflicts. Schaeffer and Henry recorded natural or found sounds on to magnetic tape – the bark of a dog, the whistle or chugging of a train, a cackling voice – and then, using tape machines to slow down, speed up or reverse the original sound, they created collages of altered or “manipulated” recordings that are completely bewildering and mesmeric. Our ear is lured by that which is familiar and then unsettled by its abstraction. The suggestion is that all is not what it seems – the very essence of psychedelia.“Not everything we see is clear and figurative,” McCartney says to me, pointing to a Willem de Kooning painting next to us on the wall. “Sometimes when you’re asleep or you rub your eye, you see an abstract: your mind knows about it. We know about this stuff. It was the same with music. We were messing around, but our minds could still accept it because it was something that we already kind of knew anyway. Even though we were in another lane to more classical composers, we were kind of equal in that we also wanted freedom.”You think: ‘Oh well, our audience wants a pop song.’ Then you read about William BurroughsAfter buying a pair of his own Brenell tape machines, McCartney set about looping and spooling these ideas into the work he had to do for “his day job”. He describes the recording ofTomorrow Never Knows, “which was shaping up to be kind of a far-out Beatles song”. McCartney remembers carrying a plastic bag full of tape loops – on which he’d recorded various sounds at home – to Abbey Road during sessions for Revolver. “I set up the tape machines to create popping, whirring and dissolving sounds all mixed together. There could have been a guitar solo in it – straightforward or wacky – but when you put the tape loops in, they take it to another place because when they play, you get all these kind of happy accidents. They’re unpredictable and that suited that track. We used those tricks to get the effect we wanted.”The result is a myriad of strange musical textures and meditative drones, a sonic vacuum into which all our troubling thoughts and feelings are swallowed up and disappear. It’s a big part of what made the Beatles as colourful as the recreational substances that were so popular at the time. It’s also the alchemical element in their work that helped put them in a different league, in terms of their legacy and influence.Eventually John Lennon also procured a pair of Brenell machines and entered new realms of experimentalism. This produced the hypnotic track Revolution 9: “John was fascinated and he loved the craziness of it,” McCartney says. He, meanwhile, preferred to use these new studio gadgets “in a controlled way”, working within the pop-song format, cherrypicking interesting stylistic elements and twisting them into the Beatles’ established song-writing template.Together the pair fashioned a new, intelligent and avant garde-informed kind of pop music – a reminder, as if we need it, of the magic of the Lennon-McCartney partnership. The push and pull of two genius creatives working together to upend the status quo. “You think, ‘Oh well our audience wants a pop song,’” McCartney says. “And then you might read about William Burroughs using the cut-up technique and you think, ‘Well, he had an audience, and his audience liked what he did.’ And eventually we decided that our audiences would come along with us, rather than it being down to us to feed them a conventional diet.”View image in fullscreen‘John loved the craziness’ … McCartney with Alker in his office.Photograph: Courtesy: Elizabeth AlkerMy quest into the roots of this trippy magic in the Beatles’ music is just one of many explorations I made into the way the 20th century’s most innovative pop musicians borrowed from the classical avant garde, for my book Everything We Do Is Music. In it, I draw a line from John Cale’s drone in the Velvet Underground to the extraordinary Indian classical-inspired sounds in music by La Monte Young; and connect the blistering microtonality of Polish sonorism to the angst-ridden rock of Radiohead. The feminist philosophies of Pauline Oliveros formed a blueprint for techno, meanwhile, and US composers such as Edgard Varèse, John Cage, Steve Reich and Philip Glass found ways to reflect the energy and freneticism of the urban metropolis in their work. In each case, I found that artists on both sides of the pop/classical divide reached across it, disregarding those things that usually separate us – education, class, nationality, gender – to do something epochal.At the end of our conversation, I ask McCartney if he ever felt restricted by the expectations of fans, or limited by his schooling and background. Actually, he says, he always felt a real sense of freedom to engage with the open-minded atmosphere of the time. This was largely thanks to his late wife Linda. “She used to say, ‘It’s allowed.’ And that lit up the skies for me. I’d think, ‘Yeah, it’s allowed.’”Everything We Do is Music by Elizabeth Alker (Faber & Faber, £20) is published on 28 August. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

BF Skinner,the psychologist who first demonstrated this effectin 1947, described the birds adopting “a sort of superstition … as if there were a causal relation between its behaviour and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking”.It would be unkind to compare that bird-brained affliction to the behaviour of European leaders trying to make sense of Donald Trump’s erratic distribution of favours. Their diplomatic manoeuvres are more rational. And they get results. But there is also an element of superstition. Visiting politicians make lavish gestures, strike unusual poses, cultivate White House contacts, looking for the sequence of steps that will unlock a steady supply of American amity. The causal relation is not lacking, but it is unreliable.In February, Keir Starmer wooed Trump with an invitation to visit Britainas a guest of his majesty the king. The prime minister was rewarded with relative leniency under the White House’s punitive tariff regime. In March, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, impressed his US counterpart withtechnical prowess on the golf course. Between shots, he seeded the conversation with warnings not to trust Vladimir Putin. There followed a discernible dip in Trump’s patience with the Russian president.Trump warns Putin of ‘rough situation’ if he does not move towards peace in Ukraine but tells Zelenskyy to ‘show flexibility’ – liveRead moreAt a summit in June, Nato leaders presented hikes in their national defence budgets as tributes paid in honour of the US president’s superior statecraft. The alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, performed a rhetorical kowtow,praising “daddy” Trump, thanking him for making Europe pay more for its own defence. Choreographed sycophancy seemed to work. Trump spoke of Nato with uncharacteristic warmth. His tone towards Russia turned chillier.It didn’t last. Putin countered withhis own campaign of flattery. Trump emerged from last week’s bilateral summit in Alaska with a roadmap to peace in Ukraine that followed twisted Kremlin directions – no imminent ceasefire and cessions of unconquered land to Russia.And so the ritual dance began anew. A flock of European pigeons raced to Washington, cooing and flapping in support of the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, hoping to generate a fresh portion of transatlantic solidarity.The result could have been a lot worse. There was no repeat of the notorious ritual humiliation that Trump inflicted on Zelenskyy for the cameras in February. In place of bullying there was bonhomie. On the substance of a peace settlement, there is talk of security guarantees forUkraineresembling but not replicating article 5 – the mutual assistance clause of Nato’s founding charter. What that really means, how it might be enforced, whether it will be underwritten by US military might and therefore how deterred Russia would be from any renewed landgrabs are all questions left hanging.The next stage is a proposed face-to-face meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, followed by atrilateral summit with Trump. The Russian president is reported to be open to the idea of direct talks with his Ukrainian enemy, but there is no enthusiasm for such an encounter in the Kremlin.View image in fullscreenEuropean leaders led by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, follow Donald Trump in the Cross Hall of the White House, Washington DC, 18 August.Photograph: ShutterstockTo justify full-scale invasion, Putin cast Zelenskyy as the despised boss of a drug-addled, neo-Nazi junta preventing Ukraine’s eager reintegration into the greater slavic motherland. When that fiction proved hard to sustain, the emphasis shifted to presenting the Ukrainian leader as a pawn in a long-running western campaign to diminish and humiliateRussia. That story was meant to end with Zelenskyy’s death or surrender. It will not be easy for Moscow propagandists to narrate a different denouement where the Ukrainian president talks terms with Putin as his unvanquished peer.Avoiding such a scenario had been one of the Russian president’s two big achievements in Alaska. First, by insisting on a bilateral meeting, Putin was able to bounce Trump into endorsing a template for peace that contains no hint of rebuke or reparation for flagrant territorial aggression.Second, by recreating the optics of cold war detente – a superpower summit to settle the fate of lesser nations – Putin signalled to his domestic audience that Soviet-style parity with the US was restored. To European democracies he hoped to prove that their efforts at isolating Russia as a thuggish pariah state would come to naught.The notion of Russia as America’s equal on any measure of power (except the size of nuclear arsenal) was a delusion even before the USSR unravelled, but one that Trump willingly indulges. It is a corollary of his obsession with making America great again, and doing so by authoritarian measures. It predisposes him to denigrate the accomplishments of 20th-century US democracy and project greatness on to regimes that showcase despotism under a personality cult.Putin is skilled at manipulating that attraction. While European leaders lobby Trump in the style of supplicants at the court of a king, Russia’s modern tsar cultivates him as something more like a protege – a recruit to the exclusive club of world historical figures who dictate the destiny of millions. They are the kind of men who redraw borders and parcel out land among themselves, not the kind that whines when the territorial allocation is unfair. It is a concept of geopolitics that despises international law and denigrates multilateral alliances as crafty games that minnow countries play to trap the big fish.That speaks to Trump’s narcissistic personality and aversion to any institutional constraint on his power. It means the Russian president is communicating with the White House on his own special channel, on a higher frequency.European counter-signals aren’t blocked. The evidence shows real success in shifting Trump away from a policy of unthinking pro-Kremlin alignment. But there is a perverse imbalance of influence. Just when the leaders of America’s oldest and most loyal allies think they have mastered the art of Trump-whispering, they find his ears have been thoroughly bent by Russian disinformation.In the short term, there isn’t an obvious alternative but to carry on with the current method, using force of numbers and repetition to persuade Trump that his route to greatness goes by way of durable Ukrainian independence with muscular security guarantees.It is certainly feasible that the Europeans’ diplomatic dance can nudge the president’s position in a more equitable direction on the road to a peace deal. But they will not effect any revision of his view of a world divided between mighty power players, to whom no rules apply, and vassal states.The challenge then is to develop European capacity as a coherent and autonomous power player – to evolve and coordinate the continent’s economic and military heft with confidence and on a scale to command respect in the only language the US president understands.The current approach isn’t exactly failing. But Trump-whispering is an unstable and inherently transient method at best. At worst it starts to look like a superstitious belief that performing the rituals of an old alliance will conjure it back into being. The right pigeon steps can win vital favours from the US president. The idea that he could ever be the true friend Europe wants him to be is for the birds.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinTrump administrationUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyKeir StarmerNatocommentShareReuse this content"

Is it having the fastest internet? The sharpest screen? The perfect keyboard? No. When you’re spending most of your day sitting on your bottom, the most crucial element is what’s directly underneath.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.With a good office chair, you can handle a long working day without any feelings of discomfort. With a bad one, you can expect backache, neck ache, tender glutes and assorted nagging pains. Who wants to return to work when the last day left you feeling achy and decrepit?Many decent chairs are available, and while you don’t want to go cheap, you also don’t have to spend a fortune. I’ve spent the past three months trying six of the best office chairs – including some lower-cost alternatives – to help you make a better choice.At a glanceBest office chair overall:Slouch Task OneFrom £289 (with arms) at SlouchBest budget office chair:Habitat Beck£95 at ArgosBest for all-day comfort:Herman Miller AeronFrom £1,385 at Herman MillerBest for style:Ikea HattefjällFrom £199 at IkeaWhy you should trust meI’m a hard-working writer who spends long days (and often nights) sitting at a desk. I’m prone to spending even more time at my desk after working hours, playing video games and working on personal projects. Basically, I’m a world-class endurance sitter, and I demand a lot from my office chair.I’m also an experienced reviewer, covering consumer technology, PC hardware, ergonomic office accessories and a wide range of home and garden products. I’ve got a strong idea of what works, what is going to drive you crazy, and what you need to think about before you buy.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach chair was used for at least five hours daily for a fortnight.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianI’d like to say I spent hours running automated pressure and wear simulations, but in truth, I simply spent a lot of time sitting on each chair. I assembled each model where assembly was required, noting any issues with the process, the supplied instructions and the fixtures and fittings provided. I then spent up to a fortnight using each as my everyday office chair, sitting in blocks of up to five hours, two or three times a day.I also roped in my wife for further testing. She’s a freelance illustrator and similarly inclined to spending long days at her desk. We rotated the chairs between us, occasionally bickering over who got to sit in the most comfortable option and who would be hit with the chair with the immovable backrest and less cushioning.I also put each office chair’s adjustments through their paces to see what could and couldn’t be moved, checked for safety issues and noted any mechanisms that didn’t feel built to last. When we’d finished with a chair, it was dispatched back to the manufacturer, or a branch of Devon charityHospiscare, so that it could go on living a useful life at someone else’s desk.The best office chairs in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Compact and attractive’: the Habitat Beck.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianBest office chair overall:Slouch Task OneView image in fullscreenFrom £289 (with arms) at SlouchThe Slouch Task One may not have the wow factor of the Herman Miller Aeron featured below, but it still gives you everything you’d want from an office chair. It comes unassembled, but can be put together in 20 minutes because of clear instructions, complete with videos to help. Once assembled, it feels solid, with none of the cheap plastics or creaky fittings found on the budget chairs.It looks good, too, in a choice of black or light grey for the frame and seats in beige, charcoal, pink, light grey and blue. Most importantly, it’s hugely comfortable, making light work of even the most epic working days.Why we love itSlouch has got the seat spot on, with enough padding to keep your posterior from encountering any hard surfaces, and a moulded shape that holds up well under pressure. The mesh backrest keeps the spine upright while allowing for a degree of tilt, with a four-stage lock and synchronised mechanism to keep you balanced.Just about everything is adjustable, from the seat height and depth to the tension of the backrest, the height and position of the arms and the placement of the lumbar support. The gas lift has a smooth action that makes it easy to get the height right. Slouch also offers the chair with a choice of casters, covering soft and hard floors (though there is an additional cost of £19 for the hard floor option).It’s a shame that…you have to pay £39 extra if you want a forward seat-tilt mechanism, although it’s still a bargain compared with most other chairs. Some may hanker for more padding on the soft-feel armrests or find the colour options bland.Dimensions:70 x 65 x 108cmSeat depth and height:42-48cm; 42-54cmAdjustments:seat depth, seat height, arm height and position, back-tilt tension, lumbar supportBest budget office chair:Habitat BeckView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart Andrews/The Guardian£95 at ArgosHabitat’s chair does a good job of fitting into your average home-office setup. It’s compact and attractive, with a white frame, a pink mesh backrest and a sunny light orange seat. Clear instructions make it easy to assemble – I had it ready within 15 minutes – and it feels solid once that’s done. There are, sadly, no adjustments for the back or arm rests, but the seat height can rise from 44cm to 52cm, and it tilts backwards and forwards as you move.Why we love itIt’s less than £100, but the Beck looks and feels like a more expensive chair. The seat has better cushioning than you’ll find on other budget options, and it’s neither too soft nor too firm. You may want more support from below for all-day working, but it’s fine for a few hours here and there. The tilt mechanism is also more responsive than on some cheap models, though the fixed back means you don’t get the same flexibility as on the Slouch, Herman Miller and Ikea chairs.The Beck is a great chair for slouching at your desk while you’re engaged in deep thought or otherwise procrastinating, but not so great when you’re sitting up and trying to get work done. The backrest feels slanted backwards, suggesting a relaxed posture rather than the more ergonomic vertical stance.It’s a shame that …the back isn’t adjustable, and neither is the seat depth or the height of the armrests, so you’re stuck with what you’ve got. If it were my own money, I’d really try to find the extra to get the Slouch.Dimensions:65 x 60x 92cmSeat depth and height:48cm; 44-52cmAdjustments:seat height, back-tilt tension, tilt lockBest for all-day comfort:Herman Miller AeronView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianFrom £1,385 at Herman Miller£1,399 at John LewisThe Aeron is a high-end office design classic, and you only need to sit on one for an hour or two to understand why. Counterintuitively, the mesh seat is gentler on the glutes than any conventional padded effort, sloping down and curving off to support your thighs at just the right angle without digging in behind the knee. You can’t even feel the hard plastic edge at the front, which is where so many copycats fall down. It looks and feels like the seating equivalent of an executive saloon car, mixing tough plastics with the occasional bit of chrome.Why we love itIt comes already built, so there’s no pain there, and it’s incredibly adjustable. It’s the only chair where I needed to refer to the instructions to figure out all the controls. However, once you spend an hour or so tweaking all the heights, depths and angles, it fits the body like a glove, effortlessly tilting forwards and backwards in perfect synchronisation as you move.If you absolutely have to spend long days and nights beavering away to hit a deadline, this is the chair to do it in. While getting up to move and stretch is recommended, your back and neck won’t be accusing you of torture when you do finally get away. Make sure you buy it in the right size, with smaller and larger A and C options as well as the standard B fit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Really, though, the only reason not to buy it is the price.

You’ll feel like you’re working at an upmarket consultancy, even when you’re sitting in your faded T-shirt and jogging bottoms because you haven’t got a video call that day.Why we love itAs with pricier chairs, it has a synchronised tilt mechanism, so you can shift backwards and forwards to keep the body moving, and the casters lock in place when there’s no weight on the chair, so it won’t skid around when you sit down or stand up.The Hattefjäll is more than just a great-looking chair; it also has a strong set of features for the price. The backrest is adjustable to five different heights, and you can tweak the seat depth and the lumbar support. The armrests are height- and width-adjustable, reducing strain on the shoulders, and you can lock the tilt to avoid excessive slouching. It’s among the most ergonomic options at this price.It’s a shame that …the levers to adjust the height and tilt are a bit too small for comfort, making these adjustments tricky. I also had a serious problem with assembly. The arms attach with bolts that screw into a slit in the fabric of the seat, but these were a nightmare to align, and one bolt refused to screw cleanly into place.Yet the long-term issue here is a seat that’s thin and firm, which I found uncomfortable as I neared the end of every day. Do our Swedish friends have something against cushioning?Dimensions:68 x 68 x 114cmSeat depth and height:40cm; 46-56cmAdjustments:seat height, seat depth, arm height and position, backrest height, back-tilt tension, tilt lock, lumbar supportThe best of the restDunelm ArchieView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart Andrews/The Guardian£48.30 at DunelmBest for:a very low budgetThe Archie is affordable for a mesh-backed office chair, but you lose a lot in terms of flexibility. The backrest bolts on to the arms, meaning neither can be adjusted, and there’s no way to move the lumbar support up and down. I found the backrest solid and supportive, but if you’re taller or shorter than average, you may find the lumbar support in the wrong place.On the plus side, I found this chair easy to assemble with straightforward instructions, and it’s relatively comfortable if you’re sitting for only an hour or two. You can tilt backwards and forwards to shift your spine around, with an adjustable tension knob and a handy lock on the height adjustment lever.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s just not enough padding on the seat, and the foam used doesn’t do a great job of holding its shape under pressure. After a few hours, you can feel the stiff board underneath the seat from your bottom to your lower thigh. I managed to spend more than a week with the Archie as my main office chair, but only because I had a memory foam cushion I could stick on top.Dimensions:61 x 60 x 102cm;seat depth and height:46cm; 44-56cmadjustments:seat height, back-tilt tension, tilt lock.T-Three office chairView image in fullscreen£38.99 at AmazonBest for:a cheap desk chair for occasional useIt’s no mystery how this chair can be found at such an astoundingly low price. Everything inside the box needs to be assembled, including the base, involving 30 slightly agonising minutes of Allen-key action before you get a chance to sit down. The arms and backrest are fixed in place, as is the lumbar support, and while you can tilt forwards and backwards, the chair creaks and groans if you push it too far.Despite this, I found the chair surprisingly comfortable for short periods. The arms felt too low to keep my shoulders level while typing, though – a problem when there’s no way to shift them up or down.It didn’t make the final cut because …of its insufficient padding, with the seat feeling brutally hard and unforgiving within the space of three or four hours. I might consider it as a desk chair for lightweight offspring or for occasional evening use, but you need to spend more if you work from home.Dimensions:59 x 46 x 100cm;seat depth and height:46cm, 45-55cm;adjustments:seat height, back-tilt tension, tilt lockWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianHow to choose the right office chairLooks are important, but what’s vital is that an office chair is comfortable. And that’s not just what you feel when you first sit down, but how it supports your body and posture over longer periods. Ideally, you should be able to adjust the chair so that you can sit with your feet flat close to the desk, with your thighs close to horizontal and your back vertical and straight. Your arms should be able to sit parallel to the desk and be supported by the armrests.Chairs that help you achieve this working posture will be more comfortable when you’re sitting in them for most of the day. This is what makes adjustments so important. The more you can move the backrest, the arms, the seat and any lumbar support, the better chance you have of finding the right fit.DesignBeyond that, the design and structure of the seat and backrest make a difference. Foam backrests can be solid and supportive, but they can affect your posture if they’re too soft. Mesh backrests are usually cooler in the summer, while still providing plenty of support. The seat will always be subjective, but you want enough cushioning to relieve pressure on your thighs and buttocks, without it being so soft that your posture suffers or you can feel any hard surfaces below. Look out for hard surfaces near the front or edges that might end up digging in an inch or two behind the knees.TiltSome degree of tilt is great. It means you can push back in your seat and rest for a minute, and that the chair will support you as you shift around. However, there needs to be control if you want to adopt a better posture while you’re working. The best office chairs offer a synchronised tilt, where the seat and backrest tilt independently, but still move in unison to support you as you move. A degree of forward tilt can also be useful if you want to avoid pressure behind the knees.SafetyWatch out for safety aspects of the design. Office chairs have to conform to British standards for fire resistance, but it’s also worth checking for rough edges or sharp points that may poke you as you move around your workspace, and for any mechanisms that might trap a finger while you’re leaning back. Don’t go cheap on a chair you’re going to spend a lot of time in; you’ll regret it later on.Stuart Andrews is ajournalist with more than three decades of experience in computing and consumer tech.

In time, these bakers will become like a second family to their audience. But for now, it’s fair to say, we have no clue who any of them are.So, in time-honoured tradition, here’s my predicted ranking of the 2025 Great British Bake Off intake. The usual qualifications apply: I am basing this solely on the imageless press release that Channel 4 sent out, plus in all the years I have been doing this I have never once been right about anything. You’re welcome!12. Toby, 29, WarwickshireView image in fullscreenHomemaker baker … Toby.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsToby works for a fitness startup, and uses his contestant biography to reveal that he is three years into a home renovation project that was scheduled to last just six months. This leads me to believe that he initially applied to appear on Grand Designs, and is only on Bake Off due to a catastrophic clerical error.11. Lesley, 59, KentView image in fullscreenShort, back and bake … Lesley.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsIt has to be said that Lesley sounds absolutely lovely in her biography. However, she is a hairdresser who insists on giving a slice of cake to all her customers. So now I am fixated on what a terrible hairy cakey biohazard her floor must be, which is why I have ranked her so poorly.10. Nadia, 41, LiverpoolView image in fullscreenKitchen disco … NadiaPhotograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsI’ve been doing this for long enough to know a red flag when I see one, and Nadia is absolutely buried in them. Exhibit A: she is described as a “chatterbox”, which is code for “annoying”. Exhibit B: there are repeated mentions of her performing dance breaks, which is code for “attention seeking”. Exhibit C: like Lesley, she is a hairdresser, which is code for “I, Stuart, am bald and need to take out my insecurities on someone.”9. Iain, 29, BelfastView image in fullscreenRaising his fame … Iain.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsThe big concern with a show such as Bake Off is that it has been around for so long that it tends to attract people so desperate for fame that their personas have solidified into rigid caricatures. Enter Iain, a powerlifting influencer who refers to himself as the Yeastie Boy. However, let me remind you that at the time of writing, I don’t know what any of the contestants look like. If it turns out that Iain is big enough to beat me up, please ignore everything I just said and put him in the top three.8. Aaron, 38, LondonView image in fullscreenHobby crafter … Aaron.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsLots to worry about here. Aaron, who moved to London from Manchester four years ago, uses his contestant bio to make two controversial statements. One is to call himself The King of Hobbies, which makes him sound like a dilettante who never sticks with anything long enough to reach a point of basic competency. The second is that he refers to hotdogs as a snack, which genuinely beggars belief.7. Leighton, 59, SurreyView image in fullscreenMixing it up … Leighton.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsLeighton is a Welshman who lives in Surrey with his California husband and has a mathematical mind, which tends to be an advantage on a show like this. However, Leighton’s bio also reveals that he specialises in a fusion style of baking that doesn’t sound particularly delicious. One of his favourite dishes, for instance, is a victoria sponge with key lime pie filling. Honestly.6. Tom, 31, LondonView image in fullscreenBake it to make it … Tom.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsTom is a “creative entrepreneur”, which means that he founded an advertising agency then left it. The worrying part of his bio, though, is the bit where he citesNadiya Hussainas an inspiration, because she has dealt with a level of fame that he thinks he will soon experience. I’m worried that getting eliminated from a cooking show one week before the quarter-final is going to turn the poor man into an absolute monster.5. Jasmine, 23, LondonView image in fullscreenPass the cake slice … Jasmine.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsJasmine is a Scottish medical student. This would be the most interesting thing about her, except she is clearly so competitive that she used her bio to blow Aaron out of the water. Forget hotdogs; Jasmine thinks that “a big bowl of pasta” qualifies as a snack. Wild.4. Jessika, 32, LondonView image in fullscreenFahrenheit rising … Jessika.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsA few of the bios hint at someone’s showstopper going dramatically wrong in the upcoming season. My money is on the culprit being Jessika. A Cornish drag king, Jessika mentions that one of her showstoppers was “wildly heavy” and that she had to cover it in tempered chocolate in a panic.3. Hassan, 30, South YorkshireView image in fullscreenRecipe master … Hassan.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsI’ve got a very good feeling about Hassan. This is purely because he is an analytical research and development scientist by trade, so is statistically much less likely to get into a tizzy and dump a litre of milk into a bread dough or whatever. However, let me temper this enthusiasm by pointing out that, in his bio, he states that he’d like to make a book-shaped cake one day. You have to worry about a man whose flight of fancy involves baking something in the shape of a rectangle.2. Pui Man, 51, EssexView image in fullscreenDessert designer … Pui Man.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsPui Man was born in Hong Kong and spends her free time distributing surplus supermarket food around her Essex community. As well as sounding extremely nice, she is also ambitious, stating that she wants to be the first Bake Off contestant ever to receive a hug from Paul Hollywood. Hopefully she can back up this ostentatious aspiration or, like Icarus before her, she will plummet back to Earth unhugged.1. Nataliia, 32, East YorkshireView image in fullscreenIcing on the cake … Nataliia.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsNataliia sounds like one of those fairytale Bake Off contestants who represent the very best of the country. A Ukrainian, she moved here a year before the war began, and her family followed as refugees. She has the potential to demonstrate that British people are more welcoming than headlines would have you believe. She also says that a cheese straw is an acceptable snack, which if nothing else clearly puts her head and shoulders above the pasta woman from earlier.The Great British Bake Off is back on 2 September at 8pm on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe Great British Bake OffFood TVBakingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As his ‘requel’ gets its world premiere, he talks Hammer horror, soundtrack heaven – and how his dad got him into Edgar Allan PoeTue 19 Aug 2025 10.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareWelcome to the celluloid jungle. Guitar legend and Guns N’ Roses axeman Slash is getting into movies, producing a “requel” of the 1983 cult Roger Corman trash classicDeathstalker. The film has its world premiere at the Locarno film festival in Switzerland, where Slash – aka Saul Hudson – is talking up this new addition to his CV.It turns out that Slash’s affection for Deathstalker goes way back. “When I was working at Tower Video, we had it on the monitors all the time. It was a real popular popcorn movie,” he says.“I’ve been producing movies for a little while now. I work with these Canadian producers and I did another film [The Breach] with them back in 2020. They managed to get the IP for Deathstalker, and they asked me about it, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, yes.’ I thought the script was great and Steve Kostanski, a director I love, was into doing it.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a real popcorn movie’ … Slash.Photograph: Randy Holmes/ABC/Getty ImagesKostanski previously co-directed the wonderfully Lovecraftian The Void and the utterly bonkersPsycho Goreman, which with its kooky comedy and OTT splatter is similar in tone to the nostalgic delights and gunky gore of Deathstalker. “It’s all practical effects. I’m not a big CGI guy,” says Slash. “Steve was totally into doing it that way. He had no interest in making it a CGI movie, so we hit it off right away. I knew that Steve could make it better than the budget.”Other fantasy films from the period proved an inspiration. “I loved Krull and the originalConan the Barbarian,” says Slash. “And I loved Deathstalker. It was sort of tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated and low budget, and it had this great theme song. My whole interest in getting to do this new one – which isn’t a remake, it’s sort of another version of it – was really nostalgic for me. Once we got the script, I thought ‘Man, we could really make a great movie.’ And Daniel Bernhardt coming in and being the lead was awesome because he played the part so perfectly. It was really a passion project.”I loved horror from as early as I can remember. That kind of film music was my first real introduction into scoringVeteran stunt performer Bernhardt, who has more than a passing resemblance to Hugh Jackman, plays the not-too-bright hero Deathstalker with a straight face.In the original movie, Deathstalker goes on a quest to collect magical objects and defeat evil wizard Munkar. “It’s got a great sense of humour to it, but it’s still effective as an action movie with a sort of fantasy element to it,” says Slash. “It ticks a lot of boxes.”Slash was born in the UK and spent his early childhood in Stoke-on-Trent before moving to the US at six years old. “I really grew up steeped in British Hammer movies. James Bond – seriously,” he says. “I loved horror from as early on as I can remember. That kind of film music was my first real introduction into scoring. And I don’t know if that had any influence on my tastes or not.” No doubt it did: Guns N’ Roses covered Paul McCartney and Wings’s Live and Let Die on their 1991 album Use Your Illusion I. “As far as visuals and storytelling, those were the first movies. And then there were the Edgar Allan Poe films of Roger Corman and more literary stuff that my dad turned me on to.”View image in fullscreenAxl Rose and Slash on stage with Guns N’ Roses in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, 1991.Photograph: Kevin.Mazur/WireImageSlash’s handlers say strictly no questions about music, so I ask him about how the movies influenced his work. “There’s a lot of different angles to how I got into music and movies and the combination thereof,” he says. “When I was a kid, I always loved movie theme songs and scores, and that’s always been a huge influence on me. I don’t know if it had any influence on me picking up the guitar, I was more of a straight ahead rock’n’roll guy. But when I started getting into the idea of producing movies, one of the things that I was really into was the fact that I’d have some say on the music for whatever movie I was working on.”Slash’s first producer credit was on the 2013 Anne Heche horror movie Nothing Left to Fear; more recently he was involved in producing Scandi-thriller-adapted TV seriesThe Crow Girl, and contributed score music for Nothing Left to Fear and the aforementioned The Breach.“Prior to producing, I’d done a lot of recordings for different movies. So when I pick a movie to produce, the first thing I think about is what the music is going to be like, and whether there’s going to be a theme song; what the vibe is going to be. It speaks to me in a different way than when I just think about writing a rock’n’roll song. I use a completely different part of my musical brain. It’s very satisfying.”Deathstalker is due for release in the US in October.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsSlashGuns N' RosesHorror filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Home Office lawyers warned the court that the decision could “substantially impact” the government’s ability to house asylum seekers in hotels across the UK.There were about 200 hotels housing about 30,000 asylum seekers at the end of March.Insiders at the Home Office admitted the department had been left “reeling” by the ruling. The department is obliged to house asylum seekers until their cases are assessed.Reacting to the judgment, the border security minister, Angela Eagle, said: “We will carefully consider this judgment. As this matter remains subject to ongoing legal proceedings it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.”Mr Justice Eyre granted the injunction after hearing the local council’s complaints that planning law had been breached in changing the site’s use.Epping district council also cited disruption caused by the protests and concerns for the safety of the asylum seekers themselves.Sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice on Tuesday, the judge agreed with the council that an urgent order was required to stop the hotel housing asylum seekers. He said the hotel’s owner, Somani Hotels, had until 12 September to comply.The hotel has been at the centre of violent far-right protests since an asylum seeker was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu has denied charges against him and is due to stand trial later this month.A second man who was staying at the site, Mohammed Sharwarq, a Syrian national, has separately been charged with seven offences, while several men have been charged over alleged disorder outside the hotel.Before the ruling was handed down, the judge declined a last-minute application from the home secretary to intervene.A barrister for the home secretary argued that a ruling in the council’s favour would have a substantial impact on her statutory duty to house asylum seekers while their cases are considered, among other concerns. But the judge said the home secretary’s intervention was unnecessary and would merely use up court time.Speaking after Tuesday’s ruling, the council’s leader, Chris Whitbread, said: “I am delighted. This is great news for our residents. The last few weeks have placed an intolerable strain on our community but today we have some great news. This is not the end of the matter. Having obtained an interim provision, the next stage is for the council to return to the court and seek a permanent injunction.”View image in fullscreenChris Whitbread, the leader of Epping Forest district council, speaks to the media outside the Royal Court of Justice on Tuesday.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPASince 2020, there has been greater reliance on hotels to house asylum seekers, with 32,345 being housed temporarily inEnglandand Wales at the end of March this year. Labour has promised to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029 by cutting small boat crossings and building new government-owned accommodation.Enver Solomon, the Refugee Council’s chief executive, said: “The use of hotels is completely unsustainable – and this ruling shows that the government’s plan to wait until 2029 to end their use is not viable.“Through our frontline work we see how protests and hostility leave people who have fled war and persecution feeling terrified and targeted in the very places they are forced to live. This makes an already traumatising situation worse and robs people of any sense of safety.“Instead of relying on costly hotels, the Home Office should partner with local councils to provide safe, cost-effective accommodation within communities. But to end hotel use for good, the government needs to think differently about how we can speed up and improve asylum decision-making.”The council said last week it was seeking the injunction due to “unprecedented levels of protest and disruption” in connection with asylum seeker accommodation. Whitbread had said the situation “cannot go on” but the government was not listening.At a hearing on Friday, barristers for the council said the site’s “sole lawful use” was as a hotel and that Somani Hotels had breached planning rules by using it to house asylum seekers. Philip Coppel KC, for the authority, said the situation was “wholly unacceptable” and had provided a “feeding ground for unrest”.He said: “There has been what can be described as an increase in community tension, the catalyst of which has been the use of the Bell hotel to place asylum seekers. It is not the asylum seekers who are acting unlawfully. It is the defendant, by allowing the hotel to be used to house asylum seekers.” He added: “It really could not be much worse than this.”One council leader said he would gather “more detail about what Epping has done” before considering a bid to shut down another hotel thought to be housing asylum seekers.Corina Gander, the Conservative leader of the borough of Broxbourne council, said crowds had gathered in protest outside the Cheshunt Marriott hotel in Hertfordshire, about six miles from the Bell hotel in Epping.Gander said the high court’s decision had set a “massive precedent” and added: “It’s just given us this massive boost and precedent that we can do something now.”Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, hailed the high court decision in Epping as a victory and said he hoped it “provides inspiration to others across the country”.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, suggested those housed at the hotel “need to be moved out of the area immediately”, while the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said “residents should never have had to fight their own government just to feel safe in their own town”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLocal governmentEssexEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It can’t be Nato,” he said, ruling out Ukraine’s admission to the transatlantic bloc. “They’re willing to put people on the ground. We’re willing to help them with things, especially, probably, if you could talk about by air.”The White House spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said Putin andVolodymyr Zelenskyyhad both expressed “a willingness to sit down with each other”. She added: “I understand accommodations for that meeting are under way.”Bloomberg reported that Hungary has expressed interest in hosting such a meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had proposed Geneva, with the Swiss foreign minister promising “immunity” to Putin despite an indictment by the international criminal court.Russia has said it views the deployment of troops from Nato countries to Ukraine as a red line in negotiations. Trump dismissed that concern on Tuesday and said he was still optimistic about the potential to reach a deal with Putin.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy, who met Trump and European leaders at the White House on Monday, is said to have declined an invitation to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Photograph: ShutterstockNato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, had described Trump’s pledge on Monday to provide security guarantees to ensure Russia would abide by a peace deal as a significant breakthrough, as Zelenskyy and European leadersconvened at the White Housefor an extraordinary summit.In a press conference during the summit, Trump declined to say whether US troops could be deployed to Ukraine in what could provide a “tripwire” to prevent Russia from resuming the conflict in the future.European leaders held fresh talks on Tuesday after their White House meeting with Zelenskyy amid uncertainty over Putin’s readiness to meet the Ukrainian president.Sources close to the talks told Agence France-Presse that Putin had proposed meeting with Zelenskyy in Moscow, hostile territory for a Ukrainian president who has reportedly survived a number of Kremlin assassination plots. Zelenskyy was said to have declined the invitation.It is unclear if or when the two leaders will meet. Putin is scheduled to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organization security bloc meeting in Tianjin, China, at the end of August, complicating plans to hold a bilateral summit in the coming two weeks.The European “coalition of the willing” first met virtually, co-chaired by Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, before joining a video conference hosted by the European Council president, António Costa.Europe’s flurry of diplomacy is aimed at pushing Trump to take a tougher line with Putin, days after their friendly summit in Alaska.Recent Russian advancesTrump, along with several European leaders in Washington on Monday, said Putin had agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy in the coming weeks in an attempt to end the three-and-a-half-year war in Ukraine. Moscow, however, has yet to confirm that any such meeting – which would be the first between the two leaders since the invasion – is in the works.Four key takeaways from Trump’s White House summit on UkraineRead moreThe Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov has said only that Putin and Trump discussed the idea of “raising the level of representatives” in Ukraine talks. In remarks late on Monday, Ushakov did not clarify what that would entail and made no mention of a possible trilateral meeting with Trump and Zelenskyy.On Tuesday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told state TV that any meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents would have to be prepared “very thoroughly”.In his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Trump conceded it was possible that Putin did not want to make a deal. “We’re going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks … It’s possible that he doesn’t want to make a deal,” the US president said, adding that Putin would face a “rough situation” if that were the case.At the heart of Tuesday’s talks among European allies was the question of what security guarantees could be offered to Ukraine. On Monday, Zelenskyy described security guarantees as “a key issue, a starting point towards ending the war” and he appreciated Trump’s indication that the US was ready to be part of that guarantee.Zelenskyy said those guarantees would be “formalised in some way in the next week or 10 days”, which could prove to be a long time when it comes to diplomacy involving Trump’s White House.In a social media post late on Monday, Trump said the White House talks included plans for European countries to provide security assurances to Ukraine with the US acting as “coordinator”.Britain and several European allies have floated the idea of a “reassurance force” that could be sent to Ukraine under a future peace deal to deter renewed Russian aggression. Their plans would need firm US backing and Trump has been resistant to deploying US troops as guarantors of any settlement.Moscow issued a statement on Monday evening rejecting any prospect of Nato personnel being deployed in Ukraine. “We reaffirm our categorical opposition to any scenarios involving the stationing of a Nato contingent in Ukraine,” Russia’s foreign ministry said.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron takes part in a video meeting of the ‘coalition of the willing’ from Fort de Brégançon in Bormes-les-Mimosas, southern France.Photograph: Christophe Simon/EPAOther proposals for security guarantees include western allies offering Ukraine article 5-style protection, similar to Nato’s collective defence pledge that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all.In a statement after Monday’s White House meeting, Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that while Ukraine would not be joining Nato, western allies would commit to “a collective security clause that would allow Ukraine to benefit from the support of all its partners, including the United States, ready to take action if it is attacked again”.Zelenskyy has made clear that Ukraine would reject any deal limiting the size of its armed forces, insisting that “a strong Ukrainian army” must be part of the country’s security guarantees. These proposals run counter to the conditions Putin has previously outlined as acceptable for ending the war.While western leaders adopted an upbeat, congratulatory tone toward Trump at the White House, the gulf between Russia’s demands and Ukraine’s willingness to concede remains vast. There remains widespread confusion over what exactly Trump proposed and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the Alaska summit. Some fear Trump may have overstated the outcome and misjudged Moscow’s willingness to compromise.Monday’s White House meeting shed little light on Putin’s territorial terms. The Russian leader has demanded Ukraine’s withdrawal from Donetsk and Luhansk, but Zelenskyy has set a firm red line against ceding land beyond the present occupation or legitimising Moscow’s control.Some observers say that for all the diplomatic manoeuvring, there has been little real movement towards ending the war. “Nothing had happened in Anchorage on Aug. 15th. Nothing happened yesterday in Washington DC,” Gérard Araud, the former French ambassador to the US, wrote on X. “Putin, Zelenskyy and the European leaders were all relieved: they had avoided Trump taking unwelcome decisions. It was the triumph of empty vagueness and meaningless commitments.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.”The researchers concluded that although it was not yet possible to definitively say vaping leads children to smoke, precautionary policies to restrict sales and marketing of vapes to young people were needed.Dr Ronny Cheung, of the Royal College of Paediatrics, said the study “adds to the mounting evidence that youth vaping is a serious threat to health and wellbeing, with strong links to smoking and other harmful behaviours”.Cheung urged the government not to further delay implementing the tobacco and vapes bill, which will limit the flavours, packaging and marketing of vapes.The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described the rise in children vaping around the world as alarming. Figures compiledby Action on Smoking and Healththis year showed that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain had tried vaping, amounting to an estimated 1.1 million children, triple the levels in 2020.For the new study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control, researchers examined 56 reviews, most of which suggested that young people who vape are about three times as likely to start smoking as those who do not vape.Asthma was the most common respiratory health condition, with consistent associations of between 20% and 36% increased risk of being diagnosed with the condition, and a 44% risk of worsening symptoms.The researchers acknowledged that the umbrella reviews were of variable quality and that it was difficult to prove a causal relationship since the evidence was mostly observational. They urged further research to better understand whether vapes are genuinely acting as a gateway to smoking.Last month,researchersat the University of Michigan established that a third of UK teenagers who vape will go on to start smoking tobacco, meaning they are as likely to smoke as their peers in the 1970s were.Hazel Cheeseman, the chief executive of Action onSmokingand Health, said: “The rise in teen vaping in recent years is very concerning and needs urgent action from government. Vapes are effective quit aids for adults who smoke and while they are less harmful than smoking, they are not risk free and should not be used by children.”Dr Stephen Burgess, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said the research showed “that vaping users are more likely to engage in certain behaviours, but whether vaping is truly a cause of these behaviours is beyond the scope of the data”.He added: “The associations demonstrated are both extensive in scope and strong in magnitude – it is clear that vaping users are at higher risk of many diseases than non-users. A causal explanation to the findings is both plausible and consistent with the evidence provided but such a finding can only be made conclusively by a randomised trial.Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London, noted that many of the studies on which the researchers drew for the study were “rated critically low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making any conclusions”.She said there could be other reasons for the consistency of the relationship between vaping and cigarette smoking – for example, a young person having a sensation-seeking or impulsive personality. Other research looking at population-level trends in vaping and smoking had found that as youth vaping increased in a population, smoking reduced, she said.John Dunne, UK Vaping Industry Association director general, said: “We have seen a lot of research from the scientific community about vaping which does not stand up to scrutiny and this latest study seems to fit the bill.“We need to stop demonising vaping because until the relative risks of cigarettes and vaping are understood by smokers then 220 people will needlessly die in the UK of smoking-related illnesses every day.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Our health advice is clear, while vapes are less harmful than smoking and can be an effective quit aid for smokers, children and non-smokers should never vape.“The worrying rise in youth vaping requires attention – that’s why we commissioned this research, the largest comprehensive review of the health impacts of youth vaping to date.“We are taking decisive action through the landmark tobacco and vapes bill and single-use vape ban, which will put an end to the cycle of addiction and stop the next generation getting hooked on nicotine.”Explore more on these topicsVapingSmokingYoung peopleChildren's healthHealthTobacco industrynewsShareReuse this content"

OpenAI is in talks to sell $6bn in shares, which would boost its valuation to $500bn,according tomultiple reports. The artificial intelligence startup’s stock would be sold to investors by current and former employees.OpenAI has seen exponential growth over the past year. Investors, including Microsoft and SoftBank, have poured at least $40bn into the startup, giving it a valuation of $300bn as of March. Last October, it was valued at $157bn.If OpenAI achieves a $500bn valuation, it would surpass Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which currently holds the title of world’smost valuable privately held company, at $350bn.The reported cohort of investors now eyeing OpenAI’s share sale include three firms that have already invested: SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group and Thrive Capital. According to Bloomberg, the talks are in early stages and the numbers could change. OpenAI declined to comment.OpenAI leads a crowded and competitive race, with the world’s most powerful companies battling to beat out one another on AI. Meta, Google, Amazon and Microsoft have all been spending enormous sums on AI development – hiring engineers and building data centers. The four companieshave spent a combined $155bnon AI development in 2025 alone.Although artificial intelligence has improved since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI received a lukewarm reception at thedebut of its latest version of the AI that underpins its chatbot, GPT-5, earlier this month. Users said the new AI model’swriting was worseand that it lacked the personality of previous iterations.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said his company is pursuing “artificial general intelligence”, or an AI that can outdo a human at most tasks, but at the recent launch, he said GPT-5 was “generally intelligent”, but was not yet able to “continuously learn”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the government fails to keep up with EU environmental legislation, the chasm has widened to 28.There are a couple of “bright spots” identified by IEEP in which the UK has begun to improve its environmental protections compared with the EU, including the ban on sand eel fishing that could stop puffins from starving. The UK has also designated more marine protected areas than the EU, and is making farming payments contingent on protecting areas for nature.However, these are outweighed by the lack of regulation around some of the most important environmental areas, experts said.Of most concern is the decision of the UK government to overrule the EU-derived habitats regulations that protect the habitats of rare creatures including dormice, red squirrels and nightingales. The Office for Environmental Protection has warned that the planning and infrastructure bill, which contains the legislation that would overrule the habitats regulations, is a “regression” of environmental law. The OEP is the watchdog set up after Brexit to replace EU oversight of the implementation of environmental regulations in the UK. However,although Labour promised in its 2024 manifestoto “unlock the building of homes … without weakening environmental protections”, the government has ignored its recommendations.View image in fullscreenThe ban on sand eel fishing to stop puffins from starving is one of only a couple of ‘bright spots’ in UK environmental protections since Brexit.Photograph: Steve Allen/Science Photo Library/Getty Images/Science Photo Library RFMichael Nicholson, the head of UK environmental policy at IEEP, said: “It is one thing deciding not to keep pace with the EU in actively strengthening our environmental laws but quite another to actively go backwards and remove environmental protections that we inherited from our EU membership.”The EU has also been rolling back some of its planned environmental legislation, as politicians globally deprioritise environment and climate action. In the first six months of the new European Commission mandate, the EUdelayed a law to stop deforestationin supply chains by one year, gave carmakerstwo extra yearsto meet pollution targets and downgradedthe protection status of wolves. Environmental NGOs have found themselves in the crosshairs of afunding freezethey argue undermines democracy. After farmers’ protests swept across Europe last year, lawmakers and member states nearly killed off anature restoration lawthat EU institutions had already negotiated.Nicholson added: “Five years on from Brexit, we can now see that the UK has chosen not to keep pace with the EU in strengthening its environmental laws and policies.“The EU is no nirvana for environmental protection, but the UK is falling behind and should be looking to use its post-Brexit independent policymaking powers to go above and beyond what the EU is doing. Sadly, it is losing this race to the top and has ceded leadership to the EU.”In some areas, Northern Ireland has had to implement EU laws under the Windsor framework that keeps the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, soft. These include the urban wastewater treatment directive, chemicals regulation and pesticide rules.Labour using Brexit to weaken nature laws, MPs sayRead moreBefore the UK left the EU, politicians including the former environment secretary Michael Gove promised the UK would be “world leading” on the environment, using its newfound freedom to strengthen its regulations. However, the opposite has happened in most cases.Richard Benwell, the chief executive ofWildlifeand Countryside Link, said: “The UK shouldn’t just match the EU on environmental standards, it should lead. In many areas where the UK is falling behind – like banning toxic chemicals – aligning with the EU would save time, money and wildlife. In other areas, the government could put a bold UK slant on an EU idea. The polluter pays plans in the urban wastewater treatment directive should go economy-wide. Where we’re leading, like nature-friendly farming and banning bottom-trawling, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs should have Starmer’s backing to be braver, to turn the tentative steps forward into a confident plan for a nature-positive economy.”The Green MP Ellie Chowns said: “The Green party warned that Brexit could see the UK reduce regulations in a race to the bottom. Unfortunately, the election of aLabourgovernment a year ago hasn’t prevented that happening.“Of course, it doesn’t have to be like this. We could have clean rivers, breathable air, farmers encouraged to work with nature and consumer products designed to last and be recycled. We could work more closely with our EU neighbours and join the customs union to better align our regulations upwards. And that is what it boils down to – a political choice. The government has made the wrong choices and needs to change direction.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We’re rebuilding the water network with a record £104bn investment to halve sewage spills by 2030, banning bee-killing pesticides, banning single-use vapes, creating the first National Forest in 30 years, releasing the first wild beavers in centuries, investing billions into nature friendly farming, and we will continue to deliver win-wins for the environment and development through our new Nature Restoration Fund.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsPollutionWildlifeLabourEuropean UnionBrexitRiversnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite ample smiles and enjoyment on the court, they were outclassed in a battle of British No 1s by a sharp Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper, the top seeds, who reached the quarter-finals of the revamped mixed‑doubles competition with a 4-2, 4-2 win.With one win under their belt and their confidence growing, Pegula and Draper then rolled through their quarter-final against Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev, easing into the semi-finals with an emphatic 4-1, 4-1 victory. They will face Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison on Wednesday afternoon for a place in the final, which takes place on Wednesday night.US Open mixed doubles: Draper/Pegula v Alcaraz/Raducanu and more – liveRead moreIn a draw filled with surreal scratch partnerships, the first bracket was particularly striking. Draper and Raducanu have known each other since their childhood days when they were rising up the national rankings in Great Britain while dreaming of becoming professional players. When in February the US Open announced its “reimagined” mixed‑doubles competition, the two British players pairing up seemed like a logical option. Instead, they found themselves facing each other inside the biggest tennis stadium in the world.Raducanu had played just three doubles tournaments in her entire career before this week and the match started with a reminder of her inexperience as she sprayed a backhand drive volley far wide. That first point set the tone for a difficult day as she was continually vulnerable at the net. Draper and Alcaraz have not spent much more time on the doubles court, either, but it was Draper who tackled the contest with total aggression. He played two great matches, constantly looking to close down the net and punching holes in his opponents with his heavy topspin forehand. He also showed his old friend Raducanu no mercy at all, successfully targeting her throughout their match.Perhaps the most significant result on Tuesday was Draper’s mere presence on the court. He has not competed since his second‑round defeat at Wimbledon last month after opting to withdraw from both the Canadian Open and the Cincinnati Open because of a left forearm injury.After his blistering start to the season, the past few months have been tough with injury and two difficult defeats at the French Open and Wimbledon. One year after his breakthrough semi-final run in New York, he looks fit and ready again.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz celebrate after winning a point.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the partnership between Raducanu and Alcaraz has dominated the headlines since it was announced, the pairing of Draper and Pegula is a result of numerous withdrawals but they have now formed a formidable team. Pegula is one of the most accomplished players across both singles and doubles, the current singles No 4 and a former doubles No 1. Pegula’s solid baseline play and intelligence on the court provided Draper with the platform to continually attack the net, and they have put themselves in position to compete for the title.On Monday night, after hertriumph against Jasmine Paoliniat the Cincinnati Open, Iga Swiatek did not finish her media duties until around 10pm. She and Alcaraz, the men’s champion, travelled from Cincinnati together on a private jet and arrived in New York at 12.50am. Just over 13 hours after finishing her work in Ohio, she was on Grandstand training with her new doubles partner, Casper Ruud. No matter, she put together two brilliant performances to deliver her second and third wins in less than 24 hours.Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the defending champions and the only doubles specialist team in the draw, marched through the rounds in pursuit of another title – and justice for the doubles specialists who have been squeezed out of the competition in order to accommodate the singles stars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Yellowstone star seeks to have LaBella’s suit dismissed or kneecapped under anti-Slapp laws, measures that are supposed to protect against intimidation lawsuits.Kevin Costner and Horizon producers sued by stunt performer over ‘violent unscripted’ rape sceneRead moreLaBella, the stunt double for lead actor Ella Hunt, alleges that on 2 May 2023, Costner improvised a scene in which their character Juliette is raped, one day after Hunt and LaBella filmed a scripted scene in which a different character rapes Juliette. Hunt declined to perform the scene, and LaBella was allegedly then summoned to set without knowledge that Hunt refused and left.According to her complaint, LaBella was not warned that a new male actor would mount her, pin her down and “violently” rake up her skirt. LaBella claims that Costner told her to “lay down” before he directed the male actor “to repeatedly perform a violent simulated rape” on her while Costner “experimented with different takes of the rape action”.LaBella argues that the scene violated contractual protocols negotiated by the performers’ union Sag-Aftra, which stipulates that performers be given 48 hours notice and consent to any scenes involving nudity of simulated sex. She also claims that the film’s intimacy coordinator was not present, as mandated under Hunt’s contract, which applied to LaBella as her stand-in.In an amendment filed in June, Celeste Chaney, an intimacy coordinator for the film, supported LaBella’s account, and called the incident an “unscheduled, unplanned violent rape scene” that “was unexpectedly sprung on the actors and stunt professionals”. Chaney added that LaBella “did not consent to the action that was directed once she was in place”; and “she did not have the appropriate modesty garments to ensure adequate coverage, safety, or protection”.Costner’s declaration tries to paint a different picture. The lengthy filing opens with an upbeat text from LaBella to her supervisor nine days after the alleged incident: “Thank you for these wonderful weeks! I so appreciate you! I learned so much and thank you again. I’m really happy it worked out the way it did too. Have a great rest of the shoot and yes talk soon!”“There was no anger or resentment, only enthusiasm and gratitude,” reads the filing from Costner’s lawyer Marty Singer. “The reality, as supported by the sworn testimony of a dozen respected, veteran film crew members with personal knowledge of the facts at issue in this dispute, real-time photographs of the shot in question, and LaBella’s own words at the time, is that LaBella’s opportunistic and salacious lawsuit is just as fictional as the motion picture at the center of this dispute.”The filing goes on to call LaBella’s claim of an unscripted rape scene “patently false”, describing the incident instead as “build-up and foretelling of two violent rapes that occur off-screen”.LaBella’s lawsuit claims that she complained to colleagues about the experience but felt she “had to continue working and keep up a professional attitude” as production was still under way.She seeks unspecified damages for career disruption and “permanent trauma that she will be required to address for years to come”. She also wants the court to order that an intimacy coordinator be on set for all of Costner’s future films and that the defendants attend anti-sexual harassment or anti-sexual violence training by a “reputable organization”.Costner left a lucrative role on the hit show Yellowstone to film Horizon, a passion project intended to be a four-part series. He poured $38m of his own money into the estimated $100m budget for the first two films, period westerns set in the late 1800s that Costner directed and co-wrote with Jon Baird.Chapter 1was released in June 2024, but flopped at the box office, making $38.7m globally. Chapter 2 premiered at theVenice film festivalin September 2024, but a general release date is yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsKevin CostnerRape and sexual assaultLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

A second suspect was arrested for alleged theft of a motor vehicle and assisting an offender.VideoNpas’s air crew had been deployed to assist Merseyside police following reports of a man riding a scrambler bike in a dangerous and reckless manner near Carr Mill Dam in St Helens.Police air crew normally fly at a safer height of at least 60 metres during routine patrols but can descend when pursuing a vehicle or conducting surveillance.Following an internal review of the incident, which occurred on 13 August, the Npas said: “We are satisfied that the crew acted appropriately, conducted a dynamic risk assessment and operated within the parameters and regulations for our operational deployments.”Ch Supt Fiona Gaffney, chief operating officer for Npas, said: “Our crew tracked the motorcyclist for over an hour, providing continuous updates to ground officers. This was a legitimate policing task in support of public safety and crime prevention.“Once in a safe location, the crew recorded the decision to lower altitude with the intention of landing. As the motorcyclist continued to make off, the landing was discontinued and the aircraft accelerated before climbing away. This is an accepted takeoff manoeuvre.”Gaffney added: “The fast-paced and unpredictable nature of vehicle pursuits can require crews to make rapid decisions to ensure public safety. We have robust procedures in place to support these decisions and safety remains our highest priority.”A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said it is aware of the incident, which is the subject of a police investigation, adding: “The Civil Aviation Authority will review the outcome and the processes that were followed.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers may be forced to rip up that plan and move at a rapid pace because of the ruling’s implications.Tory MPs complain party attack ad on asylum hotels ‘makes us look silly’Read moreIf councils take to the high court to complain about the use of a hotel for housing asylum seekers – and many will be under immense political pressure from the public to do so – it could force officials to find alternative housing for thousands of people.View image in fullscreenAnti-migrant protests have been growing outside hotels housing asylum seekers.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/ReutersLegal sources believe that there will be similar grounds to launch applications for interim injunctions from a number of councils. This case has centred on an alleged breach of planning laws by owners of the Bell hotel, who it was claimed did not get permission to switch use from a hotel to hostel-style accommodation.Other hotel owners are thought to be in similar positions to Somani Hotels Limited, which originally housed families in the Bell, but faced a legal challenge after the asylum seekers were switched to single men.Ominously for the government, the Reform UK deputy leader, Richard Tice, said his party would look at pursuing similar cases regarding hotels within the 10 council areas it controls, which include both North and West Northamptonshire councils, Doncaster, and Kent and Staffordshire county councils.And the high court rulings can require a rapid response. Epping’s application for an interim was launched on 12 August. By 4pm on 12 September, all asylum seekers will have to be removed from the Bell hotel.There may yet be a lifeline for the government. They could convince the court of appeal to overturn the decision. The fact that the Home Office was not allowed to intervene in a case that was directly related to the home secretary’s duties to house asylum seekers could well be seized upon by government lawyers.Targeted by the right, Britain’s asylum hotels are places of fear and disorder. Bad political decisions made it so | Daniel TrillingRead moreIf they fail to overturn the decision, they will face the same dilemma as successive Tory home secretaries going back to Priti Patel, who promised and failed to find alternatives to hotels to house asylum seekers.The number of asylum hotels soared to 400 under successive Tory home secretaries because of a shortage of housing, a growing backlog in asylum applications, and a failure to establish large accommodation sites in buildings such as disused military barracks.Since coming to power, Labour has increased the speed at which applications are processed, and used more “dispersal accommodation” such as flats and housing in the community.Questions will no doubt be asked inside the department as to why it took the Home Office until Monday to try to intervene in the case. If it had done so last week, when the case came to court, it would have stood a better chance of preventing the injunction.The political implications of the ruling will continue to unsettle Cooper and No 10. The government has been caught flat-footed on an immigration-related issue, as it struggles withsoaring numbers of small boats crossing the Channel.Anti-asylum seeker protesters will see this as a victory in response totheir demonstrations across the country this summer. Reform UK and its leader, Nigel Farage, currently leading in most polls, will be buoyed by the prospect of further embarrassment for the government.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperLabourEssexanalysisShareReuse this content"

This did nothing to ease parents’ fears about sending their children away for a week, he said.“Parents are much more frightened these days of letting children out of their sight, so far too many of our kids, in the summer holidays, they’re confined to their bedrooms with a laptop because people think they’re safe there,” he said.Green has been involved in the movement for British summer camps since the 1960s, after visiting Frenchcolonies de vacancesand feeling that British children would benefit from the chance to meet people from different areas and social classes.“In the world of today, it’s needed even more. Because the opportunity to put away your mobile phones and get away from social media, to simply be kids, playing in a green space, laughing, having a nice time together, is sickeningly rare,” he said. “We’re letting our kids down so badly at the moment in this country by not providing that.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s such a break from the stress of normal life,’ said Nina, 15, left; she is geocaching with Margot Leys, 24, right, a monitor or youth leader.Photograph: John Robertson/The GuardianAt the ATE camp, all children hand their phones in at the start of the week, and the focus is on creating an “authentic childhood experience” with songs and games, and children of all ages mixing together.“Not having a phone means you don’t have access to your old life, but you also aren’t aware of who’s got what and who’s in what, and who can talk to who,” said Margot Leys, a 24-year-old chef from Glasgow. “It makes it feel like we are the only 80 people in the whole world.”Leys has trained to become one of the volunteer youth leaders – known as monitors – who lead small groups of children for the duration of the week, while a broader team including a director, matron and general assistants keep the whole show on the road.“There’s a feeling here that’s hard to describe. It’s playing, and it’s a place where anyone can be silly. I think it’s really nice seeing a bunch of 16-year-olds slowly shed that self-consciousness and just let it all go,” Leys said.“It’s such a break from the stress of normal life,” said Nina, 15, from London, attending the camp for the fourth time. “I get to do stuff that I don’t usually do, and it’s nice just expanding out of the little bubble that I live in.“At the beginning, you might feel like, oh, I don’t know what I’m going to do without my phone, but there’s so much to do, and you sort of forget about your phone, about technology.”View image in fullscreenThe week involves crafts and activities which can easily be recreated at home: Sophia, 19, a monitor, leads children aged eight to 15 in making felt animals.Photograph: John Robertson/The GuardianThe week is less about assault courses and wall climbing and more about crafts, games, hot chocolates and long walks, with a focus on activities that can easily be recreated at home.This helps keep costs down, but this year ATE has had to cut its superweeks from eight to seven days to keep the £519 fee the same, and it is increasingly difficult to get funding to subsidise places for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who used to make up a third of the attendees.ATE uses venues such as boarding schools and outdoor activity and education centres, all of which are seeing higher running costs.View image in fullscreenATE uses venues such as boarding schools and outdoor activity and education centres.Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian“We’re the least expensive [summer camp] on the market.

Here we consider how the current system works and how it could change.Reeves considers replacing stamp duty with new property taxRead moreWhat, in simple terms, are they considering?Two things, essentially.First, sources said Treasury officials were initially examining a potential new tax that would replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes.It would be paid by homeowners on properties worth more than £500,000 when they sold them. The amount paid would be determined by a property’s value.Such a change would be a big deal because under the current system, stamp duty is paid by buyers, not sellers. It could be a bigger concern for some people living inLondon, the south-east and other areas where property prices are particularly high.Second, officials are also said to be studying whether, after a national tax was brought in, a local property tax could then replace council tax in the medium term.While a new national property tax could in theory be implemented during this parliament, overhauling council tax would take longer and would almost certainly require Labour to win a second term in 2029.How does stamp duty work, and what’s wrong with it?You must pay stamp duty land tax (SDLT) – to give it its full name – if you buy a property over a certain price in England andNorthern Ireland. There are different approaches to some land taxes in Wales and Scotland.Stamp duty rates vary depending on whether someone is a first-time buyer, and are banded in steps upward depending on the value of the property. They can also vary as a result of stamp duty “holidays” benefiting some buyers that are brought in from time to time.The rates changed in April this year, and (first-time buyers excepted) where this is the only residential property someone will own, the tax is now zero up to £125,000, then 2% on the portion from £125,001 to £250,000, and 5% on the portion from £250,001 to £925,000. There are then two more bands so that it tops out at 12% on the portion above £1.5m.However, economists and others have long criticised stamp duty as outdated – SDLT is based on a tax first introduced in England in 1694 – and arguablythe biggest barrier to moving house.Paul Johnson, until recently the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has said that of all the taxes levied at present, stamp duty on homes “has a pretty good claim to bethe most damaging and pernicious of the lot”. He added: “The more often you move, the more tax you pay. It gums up the housing market and, by extension, the labour market.”How much stamp duty do people typically pay? Do most people pay it?The average stamp duty bill has risen to £9,935, according to research issued earlier this year by Coventry building society. It was £6,235 in 2014, according to its data. But of course, individual amounts vary hugely.It is estimated that the majority of property transactions – about 60%-plus – are affected by stamp duty.property price chartTell me more about this stamp duty ‘replacement’It has been suggested it would be paid by owner-occupiers on houses worth more than £500,000 when they sell up. The rate would be set by central government. This tax would not replace stamp duty on second homes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theaverage price of a homein the UK is £272,664 or £298,237, depending on whether you believeNationwide’s orHalifax’s latest data.But tough luck if you are in London: according to the Halifax’s latest data, the average house price in the capital is £539,000.The Guardian reported that the new tax (if it happens) would only affect about a fifth of property sales.Stephen Perkins, the managing director at the home loans broker Yellow Brick Mortgages,said: “Financially, unless the property tax is ridiculously high, this will raise less money than stamp duty, as fewer homes will be affected.”He claimed: “Initially, sellers will just build this into asking prices, sending [property] prices up.”Sources said Treasury officials were, in part, drawing on the findings ofa 48-page reportfrom the centre-right thinktank Onward, which was published in August last year.This put forward the idea of a 0.54% tax, with a 0.278% supplement on the portion of any value that exceeded £1m, which it said “would raise the same amount as stamp duty”. The tax would be levied only on properties valued at £500,000-plus, and only on the portion of value above £500,000. The thinktank proposed that someone who had only recently bought their house and paid a substantial sum in stamp duty would not be asked to pay this tax in addition.What about this idea of getting rid of council tax?Council tax has been described as “a deeply broken system”, and in its report, Onward said the way it worked meant “an average home in Blackpool contributes more to the public purse than a mansion in Kensington”.Council tax bands in England are still set using property values from 1 April 1991, ranging from band A, for homes worth up to £40,000, to band H, for those worth £320,001 and above. The system of funding local government is different across the UK.The average band D council tax set by local authorities inEnglandfor 2025-26 was £2,280 – an increase of £109, or 5%, on the 2024-25 figure of £2,171.The idea of a new local annual property levy to replace council tax was also proposed by Onward. That plan – for a “local proportional property tax” – would result in the owners, rather than the residents, of a property worth up to £500,000 paying varying rates of tax dependent on the value of the home. They would pay a minimum of £800 a year. A rate of 0.44% “would raise the same amount of revenue as council tax”, said the report.What are people saying about all this?The TaxPayers’ Alliance was quoted as saying: “If these reports are true, then taxpayers are facing a wealth tax in all but name.”Craig Fish, the director at the mortgage broker Lodestone, said he was concerned that such a shake-up would stop people selling or moving home, especially in high-value areas. “The result is less income overall,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPropertyStamp dutyCouncil taxTaxHouse pricesTax and spendingLondonexplainersShareReuse this content"

The matinee coach parties may need to brace themselvesStuart HeritageTue 19 Aug 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 10.16 EDTShareIf the last few days have taught us anything at all, then it is this: if you want Quentin Tarantino to open up about anything, invite him on to a podcast calledThe Church of Tarantino. This is what happened recently, and the slew of new information offered up has been remarkable.Thanks to the podcast appearance, we knowwhich of his movies he likes the best(Inglourious Basterds), why he didn’t make The Movie Critic (it would have been too easy) and who the best director is (him, along with David Fincher). And now comes the most exciting news of all – there will soon be a Tarantino West End play. Tarantino told the podcast that “the play is all written. It is absolutely the next thing I’m going to do. We’ll start the ball rolling on it in January … It’s probably going to take up a year and a half to two years of my life.”In truth, this news doesn’t come as a total surprise. As per the myth he has built around himself, Tarantino’s next movie will be his last. As a way to prolong his career as a film director, he has recently turned his hand to other mediums. He has written books, both fiction and nonfiction, and a script for aOnce Upon a Time … in Hollywoodsequel that will bedirected by Fincher. And now a play.At present, very few details about Tarantino’sWest Enddebut are available. But using what’s known about both Tarantino and the West End landscape, this is more than enough for some rampant speculation.Option one: a musicalView image in fullscreenStuck in the middle … of a row? Reservoir Dogs.Photograph: Rank Film/AllstarMusic has always been integral to Tarantino’s work as a director, plus musicals are the bread and butter of the West End, so it makes perfect sense that this would be his first option. Imagine a version ofReservoir Dogswhere the cast walks out on stage in slow motion belting out a chorus of Little Green Bag, or Mr Blonde performs a soaring version of Stuck in the Middle With You as he hacks that guy’s ear off. Wouldn’t that be great?Or maybe he’d rather start a new musical from scratch. One of the surest ways to make a fortune is to produce a jukebox musical centred around the work of a popular artist. Tarantino must be aware that Mamma Mia! has grossed almost £5bn globally since it debuted. All he’d need to do is pick a singer, string a loose plot based on the titles of their best-known songs and the money would automatically start rolling in. Picture this:Quentin TarantinoPresents the Shape of You, Based on the Music of Ed Sheeran. People would watch that, right?Option two: a murder mysteryView image in fullscreenTarantinodunnit … the 2021 cast of The Mousetrap.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianTarantino has long been able to build a story around specific locations, be it Los Angeles for Once Upon a Time or Japan for Kill Bill. When you think about the history of the West End, you tend to think of The Mousetrap. Wouldn’t it make sense for Tarantino’s work to pay tribute to the heritage of London theatre by making a detective story of his own? It’s a sure way to secure one’s legacy. Just think, 70 years from now the play could still be performed to endless coachloads of elderly tourists and dozing schoolchildren.Option three: a movie adaptationView image in fullscreenMight need a rewrite … Maid in Manhattan.Photograph: Barry Wetcher/APCurrently showing in the West End are plays based on Harry Potter, The Devil Wears Prada, Hercules, The Lion King, Clueless and Back to the Future. The message here is clear: if you want your play to get bums on seats, then adapt it from a film that people are vaguely nostalgic about. Might I be so bold as to suggest that Tarantino tries his hand at aMaid in Manhattanmusical? There’s plenty of room for him to flex his dramatic muscles – the moment where Jennifer Lopez reveals that she was actually a maid all along, probably some other bits – while ensuring that the play is a financial success. Sure, he’d need to make sure that his fingerprints are all over it, so perhaps he could rewrite the ending to have the Lopez character slitting someone’s throat, but it’s worth considering.Option four: a comedyView image in fullscreenProbably where this is heading … The Play That Goes Wrong.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianActually, this is probably where this is all heading. Tarantino has spoken of his desire to write a comic play in the past, saying that he’s intrigued by the challenge of making the audience part of the story. If that’s the case, then the West End is wide open for him. Maybe he could make The Play That Goes Wrong (Because a Gunfight Breaks Out and Everyone Dies in Screaming Blood-Soaked Agony)?Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoTheatreWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the band announced it on Facebook last month, they received critical questions asking: why? The band’s response was a piercingly honest multi-page statement. Brewis wrote of Field Music’s sincere love of the band, the high levels of skill required to do such a job proficiently – and how doing one tribute gig a month could help their “dire finances”, having accepted that after nine albums, they have “quietly passed into contemporary irrelevance”. He had an emphatic signoff: “Why the hell should I be embarrassed?”They were flooded with hundreds of comments of support from other professional musicians in similar scenarios. “Our situation is not unusual at all,” says Brewis. “There are tons of musicians who subsidise work by playing in some kind of entertainment band but mostly don’t talk about it because it’s seen as naff or embarrassing. It’s like a dirty secret. But me saying it out loud, because I have no shame, illustrated something unspoken.”The Fire Doors performing live – videoIt’s been 20 years since Field Music’s self-titled debut album was released, a milestone they will be celebrating with a live run in November. In that time, they’ve toured the world, released three Top 40 albums, have Spotify streams in the millions,found a fan in Princeand mostly made a living from their music. To many, Field Music are the definition of a successful band. “To have kept going without ever compromising is incredible,” concedes Brewis. “We’ve never had a hit, so we’ve never had to conform to anyone’s expectations. We’ve continued to make weird music just for us. But the world has changed.”An ageing audience, combined with an inability to neatly fit into the modern world of genre playlists, along with post-Covid industry changes, has hit them hard. “We’ve always worked on the tiniest of margins,” says Brewis. “So to then be selling three-quarters of the records we used to sell, while having to do twice the amount of promo, and finding it doubly hard to sell the same number of tickets for a gig – those are the things which turn our tiny margin of sustainability into catastrophic financial doom.”They see this necessary shift into cover-band territory – a move they say will sharpen their skills and benefit Field Music – as being symbolic of a wider cultural landscape. “Everyone in the creative industries has a portfolio career and juggling that is now the reality,” Brewis says. “But juggling that so you feel like you’re doing something worthwhile and not compromising your principles – that’s the game. That’s survival.”His brutal honesty has inadvertently paid off. “I only posted on Facebook because I thought, oh, this might sell, like, 10 tickets for our gig,” Brewis says. “And then it kind of blew up. Prior to that, I’d maybe sent 50 emails to venues and had only managed to book three gigs. We’re now booked until next September.”View image in fullscreenThe full Fire Doors band.Photograph: Ian WestAnd with good reason. This isn’t a half-arsed side project by any means. The band – made up of Andrew Moore; Brewis’s brother and bandmate, Peter; and the Futureheads’ David Hyde – are a genuine force and pull the Doors’ hits off with clout and conviction. The result achieves that magic combination of being so tight they almost sound loose. “I’m taking it very, very seriously,” says Brewis, before listing the books, documentaries and live footage he’s been studying. “It feels like a research project. Every little element of it we are digging into. Which is maybe why it doesn’t feel cheesy and naff. It feels like academia. Or like an acting role. But it’s also justsomuch fun.”Brewis is the band’s Jim Morrison and, on stage, he looks the part: long hair, necklace, leather trousers (faux – he’s vegetarian). He mimics the outre singer with subtlety, singing for prolonged periods with his eyes closed, twisting himself around the mic stand before bending himself in half. His voice is the most remarkable aspect. For those familiar with Brewis’s high-register offerings in Field Music (a Talking Heads cover band may have seemed more likely) it’s a shock to hear such a deep, raspy voice bellowing from his chest. “It is quite throat-shredding,” he admits.For Brewis, aside from having fun with his mates, this is simply some clear transparency and communication of what life as a professional musician entails for many people now. “The music industry is selling a lifestyle,” he says. “A kind of aspiration. A lot of money is made based on the perception of success, glamour or cool. I don’t think what we’re selling is very appealing, but this is authenticity.”Field Music’s 20th anniversary shows run from 7-14 November.

Now 20, he is the president of Verdis, but has been forced to live in exileLucy KnightTue 19 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 07.55 EDTShareMost presidential residences feature a grandentrance, security guards, perhaps a few pillars. They also tend to be inside the country of which the occupant is president. Yet when I arrive at the home of Daniel Jackson, president of theFree Republic of Verdis, it is neither magnificent, nor on the Serbian-Croatian border, where his country is situated, but on a small street round the back of a bingo hall in Dover, Kent.Jackson, 20, was born in Australia to British parents, and lived in Melbourne until he was 17. He was only 14 when he and a group of friends decided they “wanted to do something that was unique”. While most others their age were scrolling TikTok, Jackson and his friends – some from south-east Europe who he had met online, some from Waverley Christian College, the Melbourne private school he attended – scoured maps, and discovered an unclaimed strip of forest that falls outside the borders ofCroatiaand Serbia. They thought it would be fun to see if they could make it into a country, and named it Verdis. The “micronation” (a largely unrecognised small country, as opposed to officially recognised “microstates” such as Andorra and Monaco) is just 1.6 hectares larger than Vatican City and has never been inhabited. It has not been part of a nation since the dissolution of Yugoslavia. “Obviously that was more than 30 years ago,” says Jackson. “So we believe we’re rightful to it under international law.”Though there is no single, universal way to acquire sovereignty over a territory, Jackson and his fellow Verdis enthusiasts have formed a government, established laws, mapped out the area, planted a flag (pale blue and white stripes; very similar to Argentina’s) and attracted 15,000 applications for citizenship, 400 of which have been accepted. Legal experts have told Jackson that “under international law, the oldest active claimant to the land is the rightful claimant”, he says. “Which is us, because Croatia andSerbiahave never claimed this land.”Verdis is the result of a border dispute in the region. Serbia considers its border to be the centre line of the Danube (this has mostly been the accepted border since the Croatian war of independence ended in 1995). But Croatia wants the border to be “cadastral” – based on old border maps. The discrepancy has resulted in a few unclaimed pockets of land, such as Verdis (which sits on the Croatian side of the Danube, but outside Croatia’s self-defined border).It was a bit of an experiment – we wanted to do something unique. And I thought: let’s make it a realityJackson and his government have always had a “positive experience” in Serbia, but Croatian authorities have refused to recognise Verdis, presumably seeing it as an unhelpful presence in this border dispute. In October 2023, when Jackson and a group of citizens attempted to settle permanently in Verdis, they were forcibly removed by the Croatian police. Jackson and his vice-president, Hector Bowles, who lives between Dover and Bulgaria and was introduced to Jackson via a mutual friend, were issued lifetime bans from Croatia. This is a significant setback, given that it is difficult to access Verdis without entering Croatia.And so Jackson is now, as he puts it, “in exile”, living with a family friend in Dover, where he works from home as a freelance game developer for the online platform Roblox. Still, when I show up at his door, the 20-year-old is in full president mode, dressed in a suit and tie, a tiny metal Verdisian flag pinned to his lapel, and another, much larger fabric flag stretched across a display stand that has been placed in the corner of the otherwise very ordinary living room.View image in fullscreenDaniel Jackson is now 20, a Roblox developer living in the UK.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianI can’t help but feel slightly bemused that Jackson has gone to this effort to prepare for my visit – and even more so when he insists on checking the bathroom has been left in a good condition before allowing me to use it. It’s all very endearing, but it feels more like a roleplay of a meeting with a politician.Jackson admits that, at first, Verdis wasn’t something that he took too seriously. “It was a bit of an experiment,” he says, inspired byLiberland, a larger pocket of previously unclaimed land 20km north of Verdis. That micronation is similarly unclaimed by Croatia and Serbia and was declared an independent country by Czech rightwing politician Vít Jedlička in 2015, who intended the nation to be a tax haven.“We liked the idea of Liberland, but we didn’t agree entirely with its ideology,” Jackson says – so they decided to see if they could create their own version. The name Verdis was chosen for its similarity to the Latin word for green –viridis– and the initial concept for the new country was that it would focus on environmental concerns. For several years, Verdis remained little more than an idea; until 2023, when interest in the micronation began to grow. Jackson, then 18, made several trips to the territory with some of its other supporters. “We were bringing in tree surgeons. We were doing a lot of cadastral [surveying] work. We camped there for quite a long time if you put all the trips together,” he says. “I thought: let’s make it a reality.”View image in fullscreenMap showing the Free Republic of Verdis, with Croatia to the west and Serbia to the east of the Danube.Photograph: Supplied imageWhile I can just about get my head around the idea of a hare-brained teenage scheme that got out of hand, I am finding it difficult to understand why Jackson is still pouring so many resources into a project that is a constant struggle – spending hours learning Serbian and Croatian (Verdis’s two other official languages, as well as English), constantly raising awareness, and creating passports that you can’t even use to travel. (You can, at least, use them as ID in bars, which Jackson says he has done “many times”.) There is also the matter of funding – though Verdis’s government positions are voluntary, the nation pays ministers’ travel costs to Verdis and to any political forums for which they are able to secure invitations, as well as paying to host its website (using a third-party hosting company was deemed too insecure). Jackson and his government have come up with a number of ways to raise money, from sellingVerdis merchandiseto asking for donations and setting up a citizenship-by-investment scheme. This month the countryreceived a donation of more than $37,000 USD, raised by cryptocurrency enthusiasts through an unaffiliated coin known as $Verdis.Clearly there are people who can grasp Jackson’s motivation better than I can. It’s possible that part of the reason for this is my gender – just as it tends to be the male halves of Grand Designs couples who have a stronger desire to build themselves a palace, whatever the cost, it seems that men are more inclined to start a new country: 70% of Verdis’s citizens, and all seven of its government ministers, are men. This is not because of any kind of meninist agenda, Jackson assures me, and it is something he would like to address, but “it’s a lot harder to find women who are interested in getting involved”.While he awaits the day he can attempt to turn these plans for a settlement into reality, Jackson has been spreading the word about Verdis in his local area: he loves a kebab, and his loyal patronage has got the staff at Dover Kebab posting stories about Verdis on Instagram. Jackson moved to Dover after dropping out of school at 17. Australia’s “quite severe” lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic “killed a lot of my motivation to continue to attend school”, he says. He wanted a “fresh start”, and had “always preferred being in the UK” to Australia, having visited many times throughout his childhood to see family. He initially secured a job with ferry company DFDS, on the Dover to Dunkirk route. Though freelance work suits him much better these days, given his frequent trips to south-eastEurope, he still loves the ferries, and plans to treat himself to a short trip to Calais soon. He’s had a “full-on July” travelling to Serbia to raise awareness about Verdis, and briefly to Verdis itself, where he was once again chased off the land by Croatian police.View image in fullscreenA Croatian police patrol boat near Verdis in July 2025.Photograph: Supplied imageJackson says he has been assured that the territory is rightfully his under international law, but “it’s hard for us to take legal action against Croatia when they’re not allowing us to access their legal system”, he says. He tells me about a recent instance when citizens of Liberland tried to take a Croatian police officer to court after he injured one of them, and “the judge threw the case out because it didn’t happen in Croatian territory”. Any attempts by Verdisians to make similar cases would probably be discarded in the same way, he thinks. “And in order to take a case to the European court of human rights, “we have to exhaust all resources in Croatia, which is hard for us to do”. The Croatian authorities were approached but have made no comment on Jackson’s case.Croatia still insists Verdis is not part of Croatia. So we believe it’s a matter of when, not if, we’re back on the landResuming a settlement on the land is Jackson’s primary goal – a presence there will release funding that has been agreed with an NGO (he can’t tell me which one, as he has been made to sign an NDA), and will vastly improve Verdis’s chances of becoming an officially recognised state. But he says Croatia has “now installed cameras all along Verdis’s coastline, so if you even hover your boat for 10 minutes in the territorial waters, a Croatian police boat will be on its way very quickly”. And Jackson and his affiliates have to be careful – after the 2023 deportation, some of Verdis’s boats went missing – he suspects they were taken by the Croatian authorities.View image in fullscreenJackson (right) with DomagojBudetić, Verdis foreign minister since 2022.Photograph: Supplied imageHe is remarkably hopeful, however. “Croatia still insists Verdis is not part of Croatia,” he says. “So we believe it’s a matter of when, not if, we’re back on the land.” He hopes that with enough pressure from publicity, or perhaps a change of Croatian government, the country will come to recognise Verdis – and even become open to working together. “Even though we’re not happy with what Croatia’s done, especially their violation of international law and the way they’ve treated our citizens, we still want good relations with them in the future,” Jackson says.I’m not sure if his relentless optimism is simply due to his age or rooted more deeply in his character, but Jackson seems convinced that he will one day live in Verdis, and has plenty of dreams for what the country might eventually look like. Though the original environmental focus has taken a back seat (“We still want to be environmentally conscious … but as Verdis’s population builds up we will have to relocate a lot of wildlife”), he envisions the country as a neutral state; “a middleground between other countries” and “a good hub for NGOs”. Humanitarianism is a priority for Verdis’s government. Most of its cabinet members have previously undertaken aid work – Bowles, for example, set up the Dover-based charityDIY Ukrainein 2022, delivering supplies to Ukrainians, and Verdis previously ran its own Ukrainian aid programme via this charity.Though Jackson says Verdis “would want to be part of the eurozone”, EU membership is not a goal: “I am a very pro-EU person, but the EU is not designed for small countries.” A Eurovision song contest entry, on the other hand, very much is. “We would love to, honestly,” Jackson says, adding that Verdis has “quite a good few connections with Eurovision contestants anyway” – namely Luke Black, Serbia’s 2023 entry, who Jackson has met and says is “quite a big supporter” of Verdis. When approached by the Guardian, the singer said he had found Jackson’s vision for Verdis “interesting, especially given he’s in his early 20s and leading such an initiative”. Though he is “not affiliated with Verdis in any way”, the singer added: “I wish them well in their efforts.”Welcome to Slowjamastan! The desert micronation with no Crocs and no taxesRead moreAstonishingly, given all the time he has dedicated to Verdis’s creation and his hopes for its future, Jackson plans to step down from the presidency the moment the country becomes an established state. “I just want to be a normal citizen by then,” he says. His own politics are “centrist”, but he would accept the result of an election. “Even if I don’t agree with the next president’s views, that’s up to the Verdisians to decide, which I would always respect.”Some of his cabinet members may be interested in running for president, he thinks; but others, like him, have already become “exhausted” by the workload involved. “It would be nice to have a break,” he says. “But we won’t give up.”I can’t help but wonder again why he is bothering to go through all of this when it’s such an uphill battle, and the reward – a sliver of land that is currently uninhabitable – seems so small. “You have to be nuts to start something like this, of course,” he concedes. “But the world is boring without trying something crazy.”This article was amended on 19 August 2025. Croatia is west of Verdis and Serbia to the east, not the other way around as stated in the caption of the map in an earlier version.Explore more on these topicsEuropeCroatiaSerbiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now in its third year and approaching a final 10 nights at Wembley Stadium – though it’s expected to return from 2027 – Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres tour is now the highest attended in rock history with more than 12m tickets sold.It’s easy to see why. Over the Springsteen-esque shimmer of Higher Power, Chris Martin and co offer up a dizzying dose of Technicolor funk-pop with a level of production that is as impressive as it is overwhelming. At times it’s like being plugged into a VR version of a “good vibes only” LSD trip, including sections with the band dressed as cute aliens and the audience wearing 3D glasses that turn everything into lovehearts.There’s nokiss-cam dramatonight and Martin is in effusive form, gushing praise for Hull and the crowd to almost sycophantic levels. It’s arguably futile to criticise the cloying earnestness and heavy-handed sentiment of Coldplay, given how baked into their DNA and appeal it is by now, but it’s laid on so thick it can feel exhausting.View image in fullscreenEruptive energy … Coldplay at Craven Park.Photograph: Andrew Benge/Getty Images‘The Black experience is more than just London’: Chiedu Oraka, the Hull rapper handpicked to support ColdplayRead moreHowever, it is lapped up thirstily. When Martin tells the audience to “dance like nobody’s watching” over the EDM stomp of A Sky Full of Stars, to wave at someone in the crowd as if they are “a best friend you’ve not met yet” during the eruptive surge of Yellow, or to send positivity to the people of Sudan through wiggling their fingers as pyrotechnics pop, they do just that.Fix You is turned into an almost candlelit mass-type singalong as the audience’s wristbands turn into a warm yellow glow, and from a pounding version of Clocks to the gentle acoustic hum of Sparks, the band command, control and own every inch of the vast space as they move around it.An attempt at a karaoke-style singalong with the crowd to All My Love as a finale falls flat but it matters little. Fireworks are soon exploding again, bookending an evening that is pure visual extravaganza and intoxicating spectacle – like a rush of sugar to the head.Explore more on these topicsMusicColdplayPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Rothman is a mathematician interested in the behaviour of complex systems, and in the Earth he has found a worthy subject. Specifically, Rothman studies the behaviour of the planet’s carbon cycle deep in the Earth’s past, especially in those rare times it was pushed over a threshold and spun out of control, regaining its equilibrium only after hundreds of thousands of years. Seeing as it’s all carbon-based life here on Earth, these extreme disruptions to the carbon cycle express themselves as, and are better known as, “mass extinctions”.Worryingly, in the past few decades geologists have discovered that many, if not most, of the mass extinctions of Earth history – including the very worst ever by far – were caused not by asteroids as they had expected, but by continent-spanning volcanic eruptions that injected catastrophic amounts of CO2 into the air and oceans.Put enough CO2 into the system all at once, and push the life-sustaining carbon cycle far enough out of equilibrium, and it might escape into a sort of planetary failure mode, where processes intrinsic to the Earth itself take over, acting as positive feedback to release dramatically more carbon into the system. This subsequent release of carbon would send the planet off on a devastating 100-millennia excursion before regaining its composure. And it wouldn’t matter if CO2 were higher or lower than it is today, or whether the Earth was warmer or cooler as a result. It’s the rate of change in CO2 that gets you to Armageddon.This is because the carbon cycle is happy to accommodate the steady stream of CO2 that issues from volcanoes over millions of years, as it moves between the air and oceans, gets recycled by the biosphere, and ultimately turns back into geology. In fact, this is the carbon cycle. But short-circuit this planetary process by overloading it with a truly huge slug of CO2 in a geologically brief timespan, beyond what the Earth can accommodate, and it may be possible to set off a runaway response that proves far more devastating than whatever catastrophe set off the whole episode in the first place. There could be a threshold that separates your run-of-the-mill warming episodes in Earth history – episodes that life nevertheless absorbs with good humour – from those that spiral uncontrollably toward mass extinction.While it has been more than 60m years since the planet surpassed such a threshold, by Rothman’s calculation we are about to set the planet on just such an ancient and ominous trajectory, one that may take millennia to eventually arrive at the destination of mass extinction, but that may be all but inevitable once we have pushed off from shore.It turns out that there are only a few known ways, demonstrated in the entire geologic history of the Earth, to liberate gigatons of carbon from the planet’s crust into the atmosphere. There are your once-every-50m-years-or-so spasms of large igneous province volcanism, on the one hand, and industrial capitalism, which, as far as we know, has only happened once, on the other.Mass extinctions aren’t just very bad things. They are not civilisation-halting pandemics, like Covid-19, that kill far less than 1% of a single species of primate. Mass extinctions are not what happen when the world loses a quarter of its vegetation and a third of North America is sterilised, as happened only 20,000 years ago when mile-thick ice sheets ploughed over Canada. They are notYellowstone super eruptions, three of which have detonated in a little over the past 2m years – each of which would have devastated modern agriculture and industrial civilisation, but none of which had any effect on global biodiversity. These are part of the bargain of living on Earth. Life wouldn’t have made it this far if it were vulnerable to the sorts of routine indigestion that are part of the workaday operation of a volcanic planet.But while ours is a sturdy planet, resilient to all manner of unthinkable insults to which it is regularly subjected, once every 50-100m years, something truly very, very bad happens. These are the major mass extinctions when conditions on Earth’s surface conspire to become so vile everywhere that they exceed the adaptive capacity of almost all complex life.View image in fullscreenA burning area of Amazon rainforest reserve, south of Novo Progresso in Para state, Brazil.Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty ImagesFive such times in the history of animal life this devastation has reached (and inone case far exceeded) the somewhat arbitrary cutoff of wiping out 75% of species on Earth, and so garnered the status of “major mass extinction”. These are known in the paleontology community as the big five (though dozens of other minor mass extinctions of varying severity appear in the fossil record as well). The most recent of the big five struck 66m years ago, a global catastrophe sufficient to end the age of gigantic dinosaurs.It left behind a110-mile crater, one discovered in 1978 under Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula by geophysicists working for the Mexican state oil company Pemex. The size and shape of the crater implied that a six-mile-wide asteroid instantaneously put a 20-mile-deep hole in the ground, followed, three minutes later, by an (extremely temporary) 10-mile-high mountain range of exploding molten granite – 76% of animal species were taken down in the maelstrom.By comparison, the devastation wreaked by humans on the rest of the living world is relatively mild, perhaps clocking in less than 10%. Well, at least for the time being. According to an influential2011 Nature studyby palaeobiologist Anthony Barnosky, if we keep it up at our current rate of extinctions, we could jump from our (still horrifying) ranks of a minor mass extinction into the sixth major mass extinction anywhere from three centuries to 11,330 years from now, indistinguishable to future geologists from an asteroid strike. Even worse, there could lurk tipping points along the way, in which the world’s remaining species fall away almost all at once, like the nodes of a power grid failing in concert during a network collapse.Given how catastrophic the impact of humans on the biosphere has been already, it’s chilling to think that the crescendo of our mass extinction might still lie in front of us.In our planet’s history, one stretch of time stands as uniquely instructive – uniquely hapless, volatile and deadly – when it comes to CO2 overdoses. Three-hundred-million years ago, the planet repeatedly lost control of its carbon cycle and suffered 90m years of mass extinctions, including two of the biggest global catastrophes of all time – both CO2-driven nightmares. In one case, it nearly died. It was felled, in the words of the palaeontologist Paul Wignall, by “a climate of unparalleled malevolence”. At the very end of the Permian period (252m years ago), enough lava erupted out of Siberia and intruded into the crust that it could have covered the lower 48 US states a kilometre deep.A kilometre deep.The rocks left behind by these ancient lava flows are known as the Siberian Traps. Today, the Traps produce spectacular river gorges and plateaux of black rock in the middle of Russia’s boreal nowhere. The eruptions that produced them, and that once covered Siberia in 2m square miles of steaming basalt, are in a rare class of behemoths called Large Igneous Provinces (Lips).Lips are by far the most dangerous thing in the Earth’s history, with a track record far more catastrophic than asteroids. These once-an-epoch, planet-killing volcanoes are of a different species entirely than yourgarden-variety Tamboraor Mount Rainier or Krakatau, or even Yellowstone. Imagine if Hawaii was created not over tens of millions of years and scattered across the Pacific, but in brief pulses in less than 1 million years, and all in one area (and sometimes emerging through the centres of continents). Lips are the Earth’s way of rudely reminding us that our thin rocky surface, and the gossamer glaze of green goo that coats it, sits atop a roiling, utterly indifferent planetary drama. It’s one in which titanic currents of rock draw down entire ocean plates to the centre of the world to be destroyed and reborn. When this process suffers a hiccup, Lips gush out of the crust like tectonic indigestion, leaving gigantic swaths of the Earth buried in volcanic rock. Depending on the pace and size of these eruptions, if they’re big enough and fast enough, they can destroy the world.At the end of the Permian, in the greatest mass extinction of all time, these eruptions would have featured terrifying explosions, no doubt inducing brief volcanic winters and acid rain. There was also widespread mercury poisoning, and toxic fluorine and chlorine gas, which would have been familiar to suffocating soldiers in the first world war trenches. Most importantly – and most unfortunately, for life – billowing out of the Earth in the biggest catastrophe in history was a planet-deranging amount of carbon dioxide.View image in fullscreenThe Putorana plateau, formed about 250m years ago, in Krasnoyarsk Krai, northern Russia.Photograph: Amazing Aerial/AlamyCuriously, as the Siberian lava has been dated ever more precisely, it turns out that it wasn’t until 300,000 years into the eruptions – and after two-thirds of this lava had already erupted, flooding the northern reaches of Pangaea in steaming rock miles thick – that this worst mass extinction of all time actually began. This is strange. These volcanoes would have been pumping out all the usual nightmare stuff this entire time, putting industrial polluters to shame – and doing so for hundreds of millennia before the mass extinction began. There would have been uncountable, unthinkably violent eruptions, and noxious storms of acid rain. But the biosphere is tough. And as bad as it was, turning a third of Russia into a volcanic hellscape, it doesn’t explain why, after all those countless centuries of misery, life suddenly winked out en masse, even at the bottom of the ocean, on the other side of the planet.What was the mechanism for the mass extinction? “You can rule the lavas out,” says Seth Burgess, a geologist at the US Geological Survey. But something about these Siberian volcanoes must have dramatically changed after 300,000 years, when the world quickly disintegrated. So what was it?The planet started burning fossil fuels.The result was a flux of carbon into the system so massive that it overwhelmed the planet’s ability to regulate itself and pushed the world out of equilibrium.All on their own, volcanoes emit lots of CO2: as much as 40% of the gas from a venting volcano can be carbon dioxide. But after Siberia had been smouldering at the surface for countless generations, something far more menacing began to cook below. Colossal 1,000ft-thick sheets of magma, stymied in their ascent to the surface, instead started spreading sideways into the rock far underground, like incandescent rhizomes, baking through the underworld. This is when everything went to hell.These massive magma roots were burning through an old layer cake of Russian rock eight miles thick. The quarter-billion-year pile of strata had accumulated in the vast Tunguska basin: the remnants of bygone salt flats and sandstones, but more catastrophically, carbon-rich limestone and natural gas deposits from ancient seas, and coals from ages past. The magma cooked through all these fossil fuels and the carbon-rich rock underground on contact, and detonated spectacular gas explosions that shattered the rock far above, erupting at the surface as half-mile craters that spewed carbon dioxide and methane into the air by the gigaton.After hundreds of thousands of years of familiar surface eruptions, the volcanoes had suddenly started burning through the subterranean world on a massive scale and began acting like enormous coal-fired power plants, natural gas plants and cement factories. “The burning of coal,” one scientist writes of the end-Permian extinction, “would have represented an uncontrolled and catastrophic release of energy from Earth’s planetary fuel cell.” The Siberian Traps suddenly started to emit far too much CO2, and far too quickly for the surface world to accommodate it.Here’s a plausible sequence of events at the end of the Permian. First, and most simply: the excess CO2 trapped more energy from the sun on the surface of our planet – a simple physical process that was worked out by physicists more than 150 years ago. And so the world helplessly warmed – models and proxies both point to about 10C of warming over thousands of years – pushing animal and plant physiology alike to their limits. It’s also a simple physical fact about our world that for every degree it warms, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more water, so, as the temperature climbed and the water cycle accelerated, storms began to take on a menacing, drowning intensity. As the ocean warms as well, it holds less oxygen.Unfortunately, living in hot water is hard work, so the luckless animals in it required more oxygen to live, not less. Thus, as the ocean got hotter and more stagnant, the creatures in it began to fall away, and the seas began to empty. Making matters worse, the carbon dioxide in the air diffused into these gasping seas as carbonic acid (H2CO3). The entire global ocean became more acidic as a result, and the water was robbed of the chalky carbonate dissolved in it, and which animals used to build their shells. In these souring seas, the creatures became brittle and sickly, or even failed to form shells in the first place.As this sea life was decimated, the global marine food web began to teeter and collapse. Meanwhile, the ecosystem on land was being destroyed by wildfire (themselves spewing even more CO2 into the air) and lashed by violent storms. Terrestrial wreckage washed into the ocean, blasting the coastal seas with decaying vegetation and minerals weathered out of the land, such as phosphorus, that acted as plant food, fuelling massive algae blooms offshore. The oceans, already wanting for oxygen from the heat, now began to suffocate in earnest as algae blooms died and decomposed.View image in fullscreenTengiz, one of the world’s largest oilfields, on the north-easte shore of the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan.Photograph: Reza/Getty ImagesAs the CO2 continued to issue from the Siberian Traps in massive and unrelenting belches, the planet became hotter still, and the oceans didn’t have a chance in hell. CO2 was now pushing the planet outside the limits of complex life. And just as these lifeless, anoxic, hot seas began to spread, a spectre from the Earth’s ancient past was renewed on this dying planet.Unlike most life on Earth with which we’re familiar, primitive anaerobic bacteria, having evolved aeons ago on an all-but-breathless world, don’t need oxygen to burn their food. For some, sulphate will do the trick. And on this rotting, suffocating world, this microbial life became ominously ascendant, breathing out hydrogen sulphide (H2S) as exhaust. Unfortunately, hydrogen sulphide is mercilessly toxic, instantly killing humans (and creatures like us), as it sometimes does today in manure pits, or around oil padslike those in Texas’s Permian basin. And so this dark cloud of primeval life spread insidiously through the deep and even into the shallows. The world was now very, very hot, very stormy, almost totally denuded of vegetation, with acidifying, anoxic oceans that belched unsparingly poisonous gas from an ancient microbial metabolism that killed anything that came near it.On the other side of the planet from the eruptions, once-forested polar South Africa became so denuded of life that rivers that once happily curved and twisted – their banks anchored by living plant roots – now rushed straight over the scoured landscape in braided, sprawling arroyos. Unearthly hot and dry seasons razed the forests with fire, then alternated with apocalyptic superstorms that washed it all away. The animals that had stocked the now-vanished forests for millions of years vanished as well. In the rocks, fungal spores strangely appear in the fossil record all over the world, heralding the collapse of the biosphere. Even insects, whose sheer numbers usually cushion them against mass death, struggled to hold on.While the heat devastated life at the poles, the Earth’s searing midsection had become plainly unearthly. As CO2 sent global temperatures soaring, the ocean in the tropics became as hot as “very hot soup”, perhaps sufficiently hot, even, to power outlandish 500mph “hypercanes” that would have laid waste to the coasts. In the continental interiors, the temperature would have leaped even further off the charts. In the planet’s most miserable hour, much of its surface came to resemble less Earth as we know it than the feed from a lander probe on some hopeless and barren exoplanetary outpost. Earth, in its darkest hour, was losing its Earthiness. In fact, the postapocalyptic ocean was so vacant that carbonate reefs all over the world came to be built again in the recovery not by animals such as the archaic corals and lamp shells that were driven extinct, but by calcified mounds of bacterial slime.Everywhere. Even a short hike from my apartment in Boulder, Colorado, brings me face-to-face with this stromatolite rock from the end of the world, left behind by foul microbial mats. In the Colorado Front Range, where Earth history has been lifted out of the ground, tilted sideways and ornamented with ponderosa pine, one encounters this hummocky red rock laid down, layer by layer, by microbes in a deathly sea 252m years ago. It is wedged between more prosaic sandstones from the Carboniferous before it, and the dinosaur-trampled beach sands of the Mesozoic after it, hogbacks of which loom like a backstop behind Denver – the geology of happier times. But the implications of this brief wedge of bacterial rock, and a global ocean momentarily dominated by mounds of calcifying slime, are truly frightening.Before long, almost every living thing on the planet was dead. The interiors of the continents were silent except for hot, howling winds that swept over the wastes – a dry desolation that alternated with punishing, unearthly storms that smelled like death. The oceans, whose open seas once flashed iridescent with shoals of bobbing spirals and tentacles, and whose nearshore reefs were once dappled fire-engine red to ultraviolet by life, were now putrid, asphyxiating, empty and covered in slime. Every gear of the grand, intricately interlocking biogeochemical machinery of this planet became jammed, decoupled or spun hopelessly out of control. Complex life, as a subset of this global geochemical churn, unravelled as well. All from adding too much CO2. If there is a geologic precedent for what industrial civilisation has been up to in the past few centuries, it is something like the volcanoes of the end-Permian mass extinction.Now let’s pull back from the brink. However similar to this era our modern experiment on the planet might first appear, it’s worth acknowledging, even stressing, that the end-Permian climate catastrophe was truly, surpassingly bad. And on a scale unlikely ever to be matched by humans. Upper estimates for how much carbon dioxide the fossil-fuel-burning Siberian Traps erupted, ranging up to 120,000 gigatons, defy belief. Even lower estimates, of say 30,000 gigatons, constitute volumes of CO2 so completely ridiculous that matching it would require humans to not only burn all the fossil fuel reserves in the world, but then keep putting ever more carbon into the atmosphere for thousands of years. Perhaps by burning limestone for fun on an industrial scale for generations, even as the biosphere disintegrates. As it is, industrial civilisation could theoretically generate about 18,000 gigatons of CO2 if the entire world pulled together on a nihilistic, multicentennial, international effort to burn all the accessible fossil fuels on Earth.But while the sheer volume of CO2 generated by the Siberian Traps dwarfs our present and future output, that total was achieved over tens of millennia. What is alarming, and why it’s worth talking about the Siberian Traps in the same breath as industrial civilisation, is that even in comparison with those ancient continent-spanning eruptions, what we’re doing now seems to be unique. It turns out that the focused, highly technological effort to find, extract and burn as much of the world’s fossil-fuel reservoir as is economically feasible, as fast as possible, has been extremely prodigious at getting carbon out of the crust – even compared to the biggest Lips in Earth history. In fact, the best estimate is that we’re emitting carbon perhaps 10 times faster than even the mindless, undirected Siberian volcanoes that brought about the worst mass extinction ever.This matters because it’s all about the rate. There’s almost no amount of carbon you can pump into the atmosphere that, given enough time, Earth couldn’t buffer itself against. Volcanic CO2 is supposed to enter the system. Without it, none of this works: the climate wouldn’t be habitable, life would run out of raw material, and oxygen would run out. But everything in moderation. To maintain its homeostasis, the planet continuously scrubs CO2 from the atmosphere and oceans so that it doesn’t build up and cook the planet. But this process is very slow on a human timescale. It buries this CO2 in coals, oil and gas deposits, and, most importantly, ocean sediments that turn to carbonate rock over millions of years. When more modest-sized eruptions inject a massive slug of CO2 to the atmosphere, threatening to overwhelm this process, the Earth has several emergency handbrakes.The oceans absorb the excess carbon dioxide, becoming more acidic, but in their millennial overturn they bring these more acidic surface waters to the seafloor on the downdraft of the planet’s great ocean currents. There they dissolve the seafloor’s carbonate sediments – the massive carpeting of tiny seashells at the bottom of the ocean, laid down by life over millions of years – and buffer the seas in the exact same way that a Tums settles an upset, acidic stomach. This is the first line of defence in the carbon cycle, and it works to restore ocean chemistry over thousands of years. Eventually, these forces work to restore the carbon cycle and coax the Earth back from the edge. On a world without humans or especially catastrophic Lips, these feedbacks usually suffice to rescue the planet. The excess CO2 is removed and transmuted to rock; the temperature eventually falls; and the pH of the ocean is restored over hundreds of millennia.So it’s not just the amount of CO2 that enters the system that matters, it’s also the flux. Put a lot in over a very long time and the planet can manage. But put more than a lot in over a brief enough period of time and you can short-circuit the biosphere.The Anthropocene epoch: have we entered a new phase of planetary history?Read moreUnfortunately, the rate at which humans are now injecting CO2 into the oceans and atmosphere today far surpasses the planet’s ability to keep pace. We are now at the initial stages of a system failure. If we keep at it for much longer, we might see what actual failure really means.If you want to overwhelm the system in a shorter time frame and shove the carbon cycle dangerously out of equilibrium, you need a much more intense infusion of CO2 into the oceans and atmosphere – faster than biology or weathering can save you. The modern global industrial effort to find, retrieve and burn as much ancient carbon buried in the Earth’s crust as possible in a matter of mere centuries might be up to the task.Adapted from The Story of CO2 Is the Story of Everything: A Planetary Experiment, published by Allen Lane on 26 August.

It’s hard to maintain a healthy relationship to food in a society obsessed with weight lossTue 19 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 03.12 EDTShareWhen I was a teenager suffering from anorexia, I thought it was a life sentence. I genuinely believed slogans like “every woman has an eating disorder” and couldn’t imagine a future where calories didn’t make me sweat. With this in mind, you must understand that I’m boasting when I write this next sentence: in November 2024, I was diagnosed with “very high” cholesterol.After years of restriction, I spent my 20s unable to understand why every meal shouldn’t be the maximum amount of delicious. This means that last year, I was regularly melting a packet of white chocolate buttons on my morning porridge before heading out for a white chocolate matcha with cream, followed by a cheese and egg sandwich in a brioche bun, a slice of cake, fried chicken and chips, to say nothing of the bread and butter before dinner and dessert. In short, I was smashing through my recommended daily allowance of saturated fat and loving every second of it. “Treats”, to my mind, are not something that have to be earned.I went up a couple of dress sizes and while it would be a lie to say I did so “happily”, I didn’t really care too much about it – certainly not enough to change my eating habits or move my legs.But what is mentally healthy isn’t always physically healthy – and perhaps I wasn’t as mentally healthy as I believed. My recovery had become almost as performative as my disorder. While I once thought I was superior for starving, I soon felt superior for never saying “no” to ice-cream and never ordering salad without a side of chips. I viewed healthy eaters with suspicion. Maybe I no longer believed that every woman had an eating disorder, but I certainly had the wrongheaded belief that every woman who worked out did.It’s hard to shake this mindset, which is, of course, entirely defensive – hence why I just masked my high cholesterol diagnosis with the word “boasting”. The truth is that my cholesterol results scared me: my family has a long history of strokes and heart attacks, and although I don’t have a pension, I am – on the whole – into the idea of reaching old age.I was first diagnosed with high cholesterol in 2023 when I had a health check as part of theOur Future Healthscheme, and made some half-hearted attempts to swap brownies for flapjacks. I only accepted that I would really have to change my diet and start exercising after the numbers jumped to “very high” a year later.I have now spent about half a year eating a healthier, lowersaturated fatdiet, and have reduced my total cholesterol to “normal” levels (although I’m only within them by 0.1 of a point, so I still have a way to go). The past six months has made me reflect a lot on our – and my – attitudes to food and health. I feel very happy about where I am mentally now, but quite despondent about the way we all remain imprisoned by contradictory and reductive health messaging.To start with, my doctor couldn’t have cared less when I was diagnosed with high cholesterol in 2023, and I don’t believe he would have been as flippant if I was overweight. We’re told the problem with being fat is that it’s unhealthy, but there are people who are heavier than I amwho have far better cholesterollevels. I’m certain my doctor would have been sterner if I was “fat”, which is ridiculous because the number on the scale should matter less than the numbers on my blood test results. Yet I was barely asked about my diet.I’m also angry that this all happened because I was taught – and women are still taught! – to focus on calories at the expense of nutrition. A “bad” food, to many minds, is a calorific one – but there are high-calorie foods that are very healthy, and low-calorie foods that are shockingly high in saturated fat, or low in nutrients in general. Once I recovered from my eating disorder, I saw no reason to limit myself – after all, the world told me that the scariest consequence of eating what you liked was gaining weight, and I was very proud to no longer be scared of that. Of course, I didn’t forget that too much saturated fat, salt and sugar are bad for you, but our culture repeats that “being fat is unhealthy” rather than “being unhealthy is unhealthy”. The world loves nothing more than a thin woman who can house a burger with extra bacon. Can you blame me for internalising that?But I think I’m most angry that society is set up so that if you want to be healthier, it’s assumed you must also want to lose weight. Because here is the sad truth: while total recovery is possible, anorexia never stops waiting for its next opportunity. At the start of the year, I downloaded an app to monitor my saturated fat intake and naturally, obviously, it also counted calories. At first I wished there was a way to remove this feature and then – comically quickly – I became very into it. I didn’t eat anywhere near enough for a week, until I confessed to my husband, deleted the app and broke the spell (which I want to let everyone know can be surprisingly easy to do if you break your silence).Again and again, I’m reminded that society seems set up to invite me back to my disorder. I was recently on holiday and averaging 30,000 steps a day because I adore exploring new places on foot. But while I didn’t connect my step count to my energy expenditure, my phone did – it sent me a cheery alert that I was burning more calories than usual. Why tell me that? Don’t tell me that. Why is the default assumption that I should care?And when I had an appointment with the nurse after my “very high” diagnosis, she handed me a sheet of paper banning me from eating “fancy breads”. It seemingly didn’t occur to anyone to approach things more sensitively because of my eating disorder history.It’s ironic that trying to save myself from a heart attack could have given me one – if I had allowed anorexia to take over my life again in the pursuit of “health”, I would have become unhealthier than ever before. The rise of “skinny” jabs is driving home these messages like never before: because weight loss is still seen as the ultimate, most desirable goal. Seemingly no one cares if some jabbers taking them for that reason alsolose their hair, experience painfulgastrointestinal side-effects,don’t get enough nutrientsto sustain their body, and evenreduce the efficacy of their contraception. That’s not to mention the risk ofvision loss. Once again, weight is seen as the most important marker of health, even though pursuing weight loss can and does make people very unhealthy.My Good Bright Wolf by Sarah Moss audiobook review – a life shaped by anorexia and literatureRead moreBut, in the end, it’s not just society I’m shaking my fists at – I’ve been forced to confront myself, too. Post-anorexia, it wasn’t healthy for my eating habits to still be such a huge part of my identity. I hated asking pals to swap a pizza reservation for sushi when I got my diagnosis, and I cringed at saying “no” to a slice of birthday cake at a party in a pub – I especially detested that when I ordered salad at lunch a friend copied me with the words: “Oh, I should be good too!” There’s still a defensive, confrontational part of me that thinks eating healthily and exercising is inherently disordered and unenlightened, and a mean little part of my brain that wants me to whisper, “Get a life!” at people who eat five fruits and vegetables a day.No matter how I started this article, this isn’t actually a healthy attitude. Though it’s painful to disclose, I do now actually enjoy exercising. And though it is against my political beliefs to admit this, treats actually are more enjoyable if you’re not having them on the hour, every hour.I’m slightly sad that my diagnosis means I once again have to go through life thinking about what I eat – but if I’m honest, maybe I never stopped thinking about it, even when I thought I was completely free. I’m still stuck in a strange middle ground where (sadly) I can feel a little burst of happiness if my trousers seem looser and yet, simultaneously, I can fill a stamp-able sweet shop loyalty card in two weeks. I don’t have all the answers. But if there’s one thing that I wish I could change … it’s my cholesterol. And if there’s a second thing, it’s our attitudes to diet and health.Amelia Tait is a freelance features writerIn the UK,Beatcan be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

A wounded Asda, with the corporate hero Allan Leighton back at the helm 25 years after leading the last turnaround, was out to restore the chain’s “DNA” as the price-setter among the traditional groups.A “pretty significant war chest” would be dedicated to the task,he promised. The group’s owners – the private equity firm TDR Capital and the remaining Issa brother fromthe 2021 leveraged buyout– were prepared to suffer a “material reduction in our profit” in the coming year in order to get the sales line moving again. Even shares in the mighty Tesco shuddered in the face of this apparent sudden shift in competitive conditions.So how’s this price war going? Well, you’d struggle to tell it exists. Tuesday’s scoreboard of market shares from the research group Worldpanel, formerly Kantar, told a familiar tale. Tesco and Sainsbury’s, the two FTSE 100 firms, enjoyed a red-hot summer.Asdaand Morrisons, the duo carrying heaps of buyout debt, did not.In Asda’s case, sales were down for the 15th month in a row. In a trade where a movement of a single percentage point in market share counts as significant, the remarkable statistic is that Asda’s slice of the grocery market has declined from 14.8% at the time of the buyout to 11.8%. In the old days, Asda used to jostle with Sainsbury’s (15% today) to be second to Tesco. Now a still-expanding Aldi is on its heels, with 10.8%. Over at Morrisons (8.4%), there are more signs of stability, but it is still about to be passed by Lidi, on 8.3%.The moral looks simple and unsurprising: it is hard to throw punches when you’re loaded up with buyout debt and face better-financed rivals. Tesco and Sainsbury’s always have the option of dialling down their share buybacks, which are currently chunky, if more financial ammunition is required. Meanwhile, the UK operations of Aldi and Lidl are part of enormous, privately owned international groups that define the long-term in terms of decades, as opposed to private equity’s half-decade.To be fair to Leighton,he always said a turnaround at Asda would take three to five years, so one shouldn’t write him off. There is still plenty he can do, beyond price-cutting, to fix the basics. One suspects he’ll stop the bleeding in the sales line soon enough when the benefit of an £800m investment in new IT systems kicks in.But the notion that a resurgent Asda could seriously imperil the progress of Tesco and Sainsbury’s, which was the stock market’s worry in March,always felt fanciful– and still does.The point about the 2021 buyout of Asda is that TDR and the Issa brothers used so little equity that they could de-risk their investment via various shuffles with petrol stations and sale-and-leaseback property transactions. Their original gamble is probably a winner even if Asda merely stabilises from here. By contrast, sustaining a serious price war might require a fresh injection of equity, meaning fresh investment risks for them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If so, you (and me!) really ought to be entitled to compensation. We may not have had to deal with social media influencers giving their Labubus butt implants (this isa thing now), but it was a toxic time to be a woman. British tabloids were full of topless Page 3 girls, and we were fed a steady diet of body-shaming magazines, heroin-chic fashion and the idea that Bridget Jones, who weighed only 62kg (9st 10lb), was disgustingly fat.If you’ve forgotten how awful things were, just look online: reminders keep going viral. Last week, for example, clips of shock jock Howard Stern’s infamous 2000s “Buttaface Competition” started circulating onsocial media. This was a contest to find the “best” body and “ugliest” face, which involved women parading around in bikinis with paper bags on their heads. In one clip the crowd starts mock retching as a very conventionally attractive woman takes the bag off her head. I don’t know where that woman is now, but I hope she is living her best life.Anotherrecently viralmemento from the bad old days: an 18-year-old article from the lad mag Maxim, listing the “Unsexiest Women Alive”. Sarah Jessica Parker, labelled a “Barbaro-faced broad”, was described as the “least sexy woman in a group of very unsexy women” by the 2007 list. Parker was quite understandablyupset by this, later saying: “It’s condemnation, it’s insane. What can I do?”The Maxim piece, which has been scrubbed from the internet, also took aim at Britney Spears, saying she had “lost the ability to perform, but gained … about 23 pounds of Funyun pudge”. While cruel, that sort of commentary was not unusual: it’s really no wonder that Spears, sexualised and picked apart her entire life, had a breakdown in 2008. In a memoir that came out in 2023, Spears wrote that shaving her head in 2007 and acting out were her ways of “pushing back”.Spears isn’t the only star who has spoken out about the way she was treated by journalists back in the day. Last year, Kate Winslet broke down during a TV interview when shediscussed being body-shamedas a 22-year-old actor during the Titanic era. Winslet was bullied relentlessly: the Titanic director James Cameron reportedly nicknamed the actor “Kate Weighs-a-Lot” and the late comedian Joan Rivers, a real piece of work,joked: “If Kate Winslet had dropped a few pounds, the Titanic would never have sunk.” Rivers had form on the body-shaming front: she also once wagged her finger at Oprah Winfrey and instructed her tolose 15 pounds.Now it seems Victoria Beckham is to speak out about the scrutiny of her body during her Spice Girls era in an upcoming Netflix docuseries. “When you look back in hindsight at the media environment in the 90s, it was super hard,” an industry insidertold Page Sixof the series, which comes out next month. Sources also told the outlet that the documentary “looks back on archival footage including when TV presenter Chris Evans pushed [Victoria] to be weighed live on air in 1999 – just two months after she gave birth to Brooklyn”. (His verdictafter she got on the scales: “Not bad at all.”)“Can you imagine doing that nowadays?” Beckham askedVogue Australiain 2022, about that televised post-partum weigh-in. Not really, no. A quarter of a century after that Evans stunt, there isn’t as much overt body shaming on mainstream media as there used to be. But that doesn’t mean that things have drastically changed for the better. Nor does it mean, as Beckham said in 2022 to Grazia, that being thin is “old-fashioned”.On the contrary, while we had about a decade of body positivity in the 2010s, it feels as though we’re now regressing. Plastic surgery has become scarily normalised, with young women getting their buccal fat removed for amore gaunt look. We’re also, of course, in the age of Ozempic. The boom in GLP-1s is helping to bring extreme thinness back in vogue and has ushered in what one Guardian writer recently described as “shrinking girl summer”. Except this time around, what’s aspirational isn’t the heroin chic figures of the 90s, it’s a thin but perfectly toned ‘pilates princess’ body. It doesn’t matter what the trend is – policing women’s bodies never seems to go out of fashion.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The new ideal seems impossibleTue 19 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.51 EDTShareThe first mention of five-a-day, as a fruit and vegetable diet ideal was in California in the late 80s, but didn’t reach the chattering crudité classes until the mid-90s. I once wrote a food diary for a magazine, in which it turned out I’d had one vegetable across the space of a week, when someone in a cafe slipped some spinach under my fried egg. Eating five a day was harder than it looked, particularly if you didn’t like tomatoes and hated fruit. There was a bit of debate around whether potatoes counted (they don’t), whether bananas and avocados were false friends (nobody ever got to the bottom of that) and how much lettuce counted as a portion, given that it is basically air. Later, there was a little consternation at how much influence had been wielded by the fruit and vegetable industry. But the late, much-missedMichael Mosleymadethe adjudication in 2013that the advice was pretty solid, and that was considered a good enough reason to follow the rule (at least for people who had the budget and headroom to follow rules).So, of course, with all its controversies having been leached out of it by the passage of time, all its strictures being not that strict, five-a-day was bound to be torched by rebels sooner or later, and in 2018 – again, it’s taken a while to percolate –the rule became to eat 30 different plants a week. The immediate problem is naming 30 different plants, never mind eating them. I tried it alphabetically and timed out at “carrot”. Seeds are also considered a plant, and herbs and spices count, but only to the value of a quarter of a point, so now you have a maths challenge, on top of everything else.The lesson here is: don’t surrender. The minute we’re all eating 30 different plants, the new normal will be 60. You’ll soon be foraging for nettles.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just chaosSidney BlumenthalThe recent summit meeting in Alaska between Trump and Putin was nothing short of a theater of the absurdTue 19 Aug 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 12.01 EDTShareAll the elaborate efforts of the European allies to prevent Donald Trump from prostrating himself beforeVladimir Putincame to naught at their summit meeting in Alaska. Flattering, coddling and petting the big baby appeared to have been in vain. Before the 15 August summit, the Europeans persuaded Trump to impose new sanctions if Putin would not agree to a ceasefire, which would serve as a prerequisite for any negotiations. But Trump willfully tossed policy like a stuffed animal out of the window of “the Beast,” the presidential car as he eagerly invited Putin to join him for a triumphant chariot ride.The Europeans scrambled once again, trying to get the addled Trump back on the page he was on before the summit. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sped to Washington to confer with Trump to try to pick up the pieces. At their last encounter, Trump jibed: “You don’t have any cards.” But Trump had just handed over his cards to Putin. Zelenskyy was not about to play the appeasement card. The European leaders gathered in an extraordinary posse to accompany Zelenskyy in an attempt to restore a unified western position. Unlike the last Zelenskyy meeting with Trump, he was not hectored. With the Ukrainian leader urrounded by a protective phalanx, Trump made agreeable sounding but vague gestures about a future summit with both Zelenskyy and Putin. Trump seemed favorable, if indefinite and imprecise, about western forces stationed inUkraineto maintain its sovereignty. But the notion of a ceasefire, pressed again by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, had evaporated. While the European recovery effort took place at the White House, Russian bombs rained down. Trump dreams of receiving the Nobel peace prize. Before the summit, he called the Norwegian finance minister to lobby him.I used to run the Foreign Office. This is my advice for today’s extraordinary White House meeting | Simon McDonaldRead moreInAlaska, Trump melted again in the presence of Putin while the whole world was watching. The self-abasing embarrassment of his previous meeting in Helsinki in 2018 did not serve as a cautionary precedent. Now, he invited the sanctioned war criminal to US soil. He ordered uniformed US soldiers to roll out the red carpet, “the beautiful red carpet” as the Russian foreign ministry called it. He applauded when Putin stood next to him. He patted Putin’s hand when he clasped it with an affectionate gesture. Then the door of “the Beast” opened for Putin.Trump’s personal negotiator for the summit, Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate operator whose knowledge of Russian culture to prepare him for his delicate role may had been a bowl of borscht at the Russian Tea Room on 57th Street, was easy prey for Putin. Bild, the German newspaper,reportedon 9 August that Witkoff had committed an “explosive blunder”. According to Bild, Putin “did not deviate from his maximum demand to completely control the five Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimea before the weapons remain silent … And even worse: Trump’s special envoy Witkoff is said to have completely misunderstood some of the Russians’ positions and misinterpreted them as an accommodation by Putin. He had misunderstood a “peaceful withdrawal” of the Ukrainians from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia demanded by Russia as an offer of “peaceful withdrawal” of the Russians from these regions”.“Witkoff doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” a Ukrainian government official told Bild. An assessment that, according to Bild information, is also shared by German government representatives.Bild further reported: “There was a telephone conference on Thursday evening between representatives of the US government – including the special envoy Witkoff and Foreign Minister Marco Rubio and Vice PresidentJD Vance– and the European partners. As BILD learned, the American side was perceived as chaotic and ununited. This was primarily due to Witkoff, whose remarks about his conversation with Putin on Wednesday in the Kremlin were perceived as confusing. He himself seemed overwhelmed and incompetent to the Europeans when he spoke about the territorial issues in Ukraine.”The German newspaper also reported friction between Rubio and Vance, with the vice-president seeking to shut the European allies out of the process and Witkoff taking his side against the secretary of state. “Apparently, there was also disagreement about the further course of action between Witkoff and Rubio, as the foreign minister emphasized that the Europeans should be involved in the further process, while Vance and Witkoff only wanted to informEuropeof the results of the further Trump steps.”In Trump’s new world order, Putin would be his partner ... while Trump waged a trade war imposing harsh tariffs on every other nationBild’s report on Putin’s position turned out to be completely accurate and its description of the Trump administration’s unsettled position prophetic of the fiasco that would unfold.Little noticed in the US media accounts, Trump had presented Putin with enormous economic advantages,according to the Telegraph. He offered access to valuable Alaskan natural resources, opportunities to tap into the US portion of the Bering Strait, which would boost Russia’s interests in the Arctic region. Trump promised to lift sanctions on Russia’s aircraft industry, which would permit Russian airlines (and by extension the Russian air force) to return to US suppliers for parts and maintenance. Trump would give Putin approval for access to rare earth minerals in Ukrainian territories currently under Russian occupation.In Trump’s new world order, Putin would be his partner, especially on the frontier of the Arctic, while Trump waged a trade war imposing harsh tariffs on every other nation. Ukraine stood as an obstacle to the gold rush.According to the Telegraph, Witkoff suggested to the Russians: “Israel’s occupation of the West Bank could be used as a model for ending the war.Russiawould have military and economic control of occupied [parts of] Ukraine under its own governing body, similar to Israel’s de facto rule of Palestinian territory.”Then, after Trump laid on lavish treatment for the Russian dictator at the US military base, marking his indifference to international condemnation, came the joint appearance, which exceeded the Helsinki disaster. An elated Putin and dejected Trump appeared on stage together.The announced joint press conference was a theater of the absurd. Its brevity contributed to the farce. There was no agreement, no plan for an agreement, and no press conference. Trump deferred to Putin to speak first, to set the tone and terms after which he would come on as the second banana to slip on the peel.The Guardian view on the Alaska summit: there must be no more gifts to Vladimir Putin | EditorialRead moreA clearly delighted Putinreiteratedhis belief that Ukraine was a security threat to Russia, and that “we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict,” which was his language for the elimination of an independent and democratic Ukraine. He blamed Biden for the war he had launched. He affirmed Trump’s presumptuous boast that there would have been no war had he been president. “Today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that.”A clearly glum Trump stepped to his podium. “So there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he said. He had pledged during the 2024 campaign that he could and would end the war on “day one”. It had taken him 210 days to reach the “No Deal”.Trump wistfully talked about doing business with Russia, his will-o’-the-wisp ambition since he attempted for decades to build a Trump Tower in Moscow even through the 2016 election. He threw Putin a bouquet. “I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir.” He blamed their inability to monetize their relationship to the inquiries that extensively documented Putin’s covert efforts in the 2016 election to help Trump. “We were interfered with by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax,” Trump complained. He would not let it go, drifting incoherently into his grievances. “He knew it was a hoax, and I knew it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that would like to have dealt with, but we’ll have a good chance when this is over.”Then, Trump praised the Russian officials accompanying Putin. Chief among them was the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who had arrived wearing a sweatshirt embossed with the Cyrillic letters “CCCP”, standing for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signaling Putin’s ultimate objective to restore the empire of the Soviet Union. The message was more than nostalgia; it was a mission statement. And Trump called Putin “the Boss”, not a reference to Bruce Springsteen. “Next time in Moscow,” said Putin.The press conference was over. There were no questions. There were no answers. Trump fled from the stage.Before the summit, Trump threatened new sanctions if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire, but now he forgot he had ever said that. He spoke loudly and carried a tiny stick. On Air Force One, on the return to Washington, he gave an exclusive interview to his lapdog, Sean Hannity of Fox News, along on the ride for this purpose. Trump reverted to his tacit support for Putin’s position. He put the burden on Zelenskyy to accede to Putin’s demands, which were unchanged.Putin won in Anchorage. Now Zelenskyy and Europe are in an even more perilous position | Rajan MenonRead moreThen, Trump spiraled down a wormhole, obviously anxious about his growing unpopularity and the prospect of the Democrats winning the congressional midterm elections, which has prompted him to prod the TexasRepublicansto gerrymander districts and California Democrats aroused to counter it in their state. “Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said you can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting,” said Trump. “Look at California with that horrible governor they have. One of the worst governors in history. He is incompetent, he doesn’t know what he is doing.”Is this a subject that Putin actually spoke about in their discussion? Has he had experience with mail-in voting or even know what it is? Was it brought up by Trump during their car ride? Or was Trump simply making it up for his gullible Fox News audience? Whatever the reality, Trump’s fear about losing control of domestic politics was at the top of his mind as he flew away from his charade in Anchorage.The shambolic scene left in Alaska represented the wreckage of Trump’s attempt at diplomacy. Setting the stage himself, Trump babbled, whined and weakly sided with Putin. Trump’s foreign policy team was exposed as incompetent, confounded and feckless. This was no best and the brightest, no rise of the Vulcans, but the circus of the Koalemosians, after Koalemos, the Greek god of stupidity.Apologists for Trump, in advance of this exemplary event, had suggested that there was such a conceit as a Trump doctrine. A former Trump official from his first term, A Wess Mitchell, has called it “The Return of Great Power Diplomacy” in the May/June issue of Foreign Affairs. He described “a new kind of diplomacy” that is “diplomacy in its classical form” and “an instrument of strategy”. He cited an ancient Spartan king, Archidamus II, the Roman Emperor Domitian, Cardinal Richelieu, and in his mélange did not neglect to throw in Metternich and Bismarck. (Kissinger, in his grave, must be weeping over the parading of Metternich’s mannequin as a forerunner of Trump. Mitchell, in any case, dismisses Kissinger as a fake realist and an “idealist”, which would have been a revelation to Kissinger.) Left out of Mitchell’s pantheon of great diplomatic influences through the ages is the influencer Laura Loomer, the loony far-right troll who has an open door to Trump, feeding him lists of national security officials he must purge.In Putin’s shadow, Trump was bared as having no larger or smaller concept or strategy of Great Power politics. It would be unfair to accuse Trump of having an idea beyond his self-aggrandizement. If anything, he aspires to be like Putin, whom he called a “genius” after his invasion of Ukraine. Putin has created and controls a vast kleptocracy. In 2017, Bill Browder, an American businessperson who had invested in Russia and has been targeted for assassination by Putin for exposing his corruption,testifiedbefore the Senate judiciary committee that Putin was “the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world”. Nobody, however, knows Putin’s true personal wealth.Trump, the Putin manqué, is trying to turn the United States into a kleptocratic system. According to the calculations of David D Kirkpatrick inthe New Yorker, in just six months of his second term his alleged personal profiteering, “would disappoint the haters who saw Trump as a Putin-level kleptocrat. Yet some three and a half billion dollars in Presidential profits – even though my accounting is necessarily approximate – is a dizzying sum.”Meanwhile, three days before the Trump-Putin summit, the Trump family crypto business, World Liberty Financial,raised $1.5bnto buy the Trump family token. The CEO of World Liberty Financial, Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, along with Eric Trump of WLF, will join the board of the investing company. That is the Trump doctrine.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Risible, but hey, better to be stiff as a board than labelled wokeTue 19 Aug 2025 06.04 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.54 EDTShareIt’s a world in flames. Too much antisocial behaviour, too many street gangs,too few crimes being solved– but fear not, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has a plan to fight back. Go to the Notting Hill carnival this weekend, he’s told his officers. Keep the peace, lay down the law – andI’d better not catch you dancing.He’s right to be concerned. Dancing policemen are a menace. They undermine tradition and the public’s trust. TheLaughing Policemanwas bad enough, but dancing ones? You wonder how they ever got through the vetting and the training. From now on, perhaps it will be a specific part of the vetting and the training. “Regan, you almost made it through, but when we played that bit of Rihanna in the final module, you shimmied a bit and there was a definite head bob. I’m sorry, this job isn’t for you.”There are many problems in the running of and the policing of the Notting Hill carnival. The numbers are too big, the west London space too small. We know there’s crime:two murderslast year and melees in which more than 60 officers were injured. No one underestimates the challenge. Last week, Tory members of the London assembly called for city hallto take over the running of the event, and mooted once again the idea that it could move to a park, Hyde Park perhaps, and become ticketed.View image in fullscreenA policeman joining in at carnival in 1978.Photograph: Frank Barratt/Getty ImagesNo one close to the event and its tradition wants that. But everyone knows that, security-wise, things have to change.Will motionless, ear-plugged officers do that? I’m not sure that’s the eureka moment. I can’t quite equate the difficulty of keeping roads unblocked and hyped-up young men from maiming themselves and others with the dereliction of rogue officers momentarily shaking a leg toMighty Sparrow,Sean PaulorShaggy. How does that work in fact? Is that the officer who says: “There is a punch up over there and I know I should intervene, but I do like this banging tune, and I’m having a nice dance, so I’ll wait until it’s finished?”Police officers warned against dancing with revellers at Notting Hill carnivalRead moreI don’t think any officer would do that, and I doubt the commissioner really thinks so either. The statement from Scotland Yard says: “Almost 7,000 officers will be deployed to this year’s event. They are there to keep revellers safe, not to join in the revelling. We want officers to positively engage with the carnivalgoers while staying vigilant at all times and remaining able to respond and intervene swiftly as necessary. They can’t do this if they are dancing. The standards of behaviour expected as part of the policing operation will be communicated clearly before the event, just as they have been in recent years.”On its face, this last bit appears to reveal that those who havegot jiggy wit itat carnival in recent years have been dancing disobediently, perhaps with intent, perhaps with malice aforethought. As for those who have actually danced in actual contact with the revellers, well, bring backKeir Starmer’s all-night courts.There is, of course, a simpler explanation for this new diktat, rather than any genuine nexus between carnival crime and the beat officer who likes the beats. It’s not really that too many officers over-engage: it’s that occasionally one makes a human connection, and someone takes a photo of that, and it ends up on the TV and in the papers – because little else happens on a bank holiday – and the rightwing press goes full tonto about woke coppers who talk to folk they should be tasering. Before you know it, someone is saying that the commissioner himself is a woke disciple who secretly loves Afrobeats and privately takes the knee on Congolese religious holidays, and that we really need new leadership, of the kind that Nigel Farage would seek out were he to reach No 10.View image in fullscreenCarnival in 2005, when police presence was increased after the 7 July bombings.Photograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesAnd all of that grouching is bad for the top team at Scotland Yard, who’ll be forgiven by the right if they never catch another criminal, so long as they don’t go woke. So the best thing for them, short of stopping the music itself, is to stop the thin blue line dancing, even for a smiley snapshot. And so they have.It’s all quite funny, and it’s all quite sad. Because those pictures of communal revelry between the public and law enforcement were sometimes a bit cringe and often a bit stagey, but they spoke to a desire of some officers to present as a police service rather than a police force – and showed an enthusiasm from carnivalgoers to embrace that. And for those who weren’t there, those moments – like the time in 2017 when a PC Daniel Graham threw his shapesand went viral– conveyed a world that doesn’t always exist, but one that most of us would like to see.We’ll have the old pictures as an archive, but pity the officers deployed to carnival this year: concerned about the crush, concerned about the crime (with optimists at the Mail already predicting“three days of carnage”) and now concerned that a surveillance camera might catch them twerking in the line of duty.

Will they succeed?Moira DoneganThe Republican party has already shown that its commitment to democratic elections is paper thinTue 19 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 10.42 EDTShareIf one mark of an autocratic regime is the meaningfulness of elections, you can make an argument that the United States has been backsliding away from a properly democratic form of government for a long time. In 2013’s Shelby county decision, the US supreme court gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act, clearing the way for states to impose a slew of restrictions on the franchise that were previously banned as part of an effort to prevent the re-establishment of Jim Crow; voting quickly became more burdensome and onerous in many Republican-controlled states.Three years before, in Citizens United, the same court declared that corporate money counted as political speech, thereby opening the floodgates on money in politics in ways that allowed the rich to distort public discourses ahead of elections. Donald Trump memorably tried tointerfere withthe 2020 census so that it would count as few of those who were disinclined to support him as possible, hoping to create a skewed vision of America in the data that the government uses to apportion public resources and congressional representation alike. The result is a clear picture of the Republican party’s approach to elections: that so long as they create a positive outcome for their candidates, they need not be strictly speaking fair, free or meaningful representations of the people’s will.Ahead of the 2026 midterms, Republicans are pursuing this agenda with renewed zeal. At Trump’s direction, Republicans in Texas are looking to redraw their state’s congressional maps to be more favorable to the Republican party, allowing the party to gain more seats in the House of Representatives not by persuading voters, but by choosing who their voters will be. The US supreme court, meanwhile, has chosen to continue its own efforts to rewrite election law in the Republicans favor, taking up a long-languishing case out of Louisiana challenging the remainder of the Voting Rights Act and accelerating argument so that a decision can be released in time for Republican-leaning states to redraw their maps ahead of the November 2026 contests.In Texas, the effort to ensure that the voters’ actual preferences will have no bearing on the outcome of the House races has unfolded in dramatic fashion. In early August, Trump told Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, to redraw his state’s congressional district maps – an unusual move in the middle of the decade – to ensure that Republicans picked up as many as five additional seats in Congress. “We” – the Republicans – “are entitled to five more seats”, thepresident said. Trump cited his own victory in Texas in the 2024 election as evidence that the state’s congressional seats belonged to his party – furthering his claim, often amorphous but repeatedly asserted, that his victory in 2024 amounts to a total and permanent grant of authority over all American policy and political jurisdictions.The supreme court is now moving to strike down section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the law’s last remaining edificeThe Texas governor quickly called the state legislature into a special session to vote on a proposed new set of districts for 2016. In a bit of political theater meant to draw attention to the move, the state legislature’s Democrats then left Texas in protest in order to deny the body a quorum to move on the vote, seeking sanctuary in Democratic-controlled Illinois. The standoffcame to an endwhen the Democrats gave in and agreed to return to the state on Friday, following the announcement by the California governor, Gavin Newsom, that he would encourage legislators in his own state to redraw maps in Democrats’ favor. The new Texas maps are likely to be passed by Labor Day, allowing the state to secure the outcomes in their 2026 congressional contests more than a year before a single vote is cast.Such moves are likely to become more common in the near future. The supreme court, not satisfied with having declared large portions of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional in 2013, is now moving to strike down section 2, the law’s last remaining edifice. The law allows states to draw so-called “majority minority” districts, so that Black voters can express political power in areas where they are concentrated instead of having their voting preferences diluted by spreading their votes out across majority-white districts.The justices are now poised to strike down this last remaining vestige of the monumental 20th-century law that was meant to remedially constitute Black voting power amid a long history of political repression, and finally make the 15th amendment meaningful in practice. Without this law, Republican-controlled states are likely to redraw their maps in order to eliminate “majority-minority” districts, thereby making it all but impossible for Black voters to elect their preferred candidates in many states, particularly across the former Confederacy.There was no need for the justices to take this case. The issue in question – a redistricting in Louisiana that created a second majority-minority congressional district in a state with six congressional districts that is more than 30% Black – had already been declared constitutional by an appellate court, in deference to the supreme court’s longstanding precedent. But John Roberts – depressingly, now the court’s moderate – has had a career-long vendetta against the Voting Rights Act, and will not resist an opportunity to finally strike it down in full. That the court expedited argument so as to be able to issue an opinion in June 2026 – just in time for states to redistrict before the midterms. It is yet another signal that the justices in the court’s majority consider themselves to be Republican party operatives – and the Republican party, as a whole, is becoming less and less interested in running in competitive elections.It is yet to be seen whether these efforts will succeed in swinging the midterm elections decisively in Republicans’ favor. Maybe the redistricting in Texas and the retaliation planned by California will not prompt a nationwide tit-for-tat of gerrymandering across the states; maybe the supreme court will show uncharacteristic restraint, and not overturn a decades-old precedent in order to further erode Black Americans’ voting rights.But the odds are slim, and at any rate, the Republican party has already shown that its commitment to democratic elections – that is, the kind that they might lose – is paper thin. TheTrump administration, meanwhile, is reviving their first-term effort to rewrite the rules of the census. In 2030, they hope, many Americans in Democratic-leaning districts simply won’t count at all.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But for how long?Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.33 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.49 EDTShareThe verdict on Donald Trump’smeeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaderson Monday depends entirely upon the metric used. The great fear was that this might prove a disaster along the lines of the US president’s dressing down of the Ukrainian leader in February – a scenario so plausible that Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and other key European leaders dropped everything to dash to the White House themselves in support.Following his red carpet welcome for Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Mr Trump reportedly backed the ideathat Ukraine should hand over the Donbasto achieve a peace deal. Even if one were naive enough to think that the Kremlin would see that as an end to conflict, rather than a staging post for a later offensive, it would not be a “land swap” but a land grab that Ukraine – for good reason – could not stomach. Kyiv would be handing over territory that Moscow has spent years attempting but failing to seize.On the basis of those meetings’ precedents, there was cause for some relief after the Washington talks: it could have been much worse. Yet judged by the standards of conventional diplomacy, let alone Ukraine’s needs, it was alarming. Last month, Mr Trump threatened tough sanctions against Russia. En route to Alaska, he warned that there would be “very severe consequences” if there wasn’t a ceasefire that day. Yet on Monday, with Ukrainian civiliansunder intense Russian attack, he said there was no need to stop the fighting while a deal is agreed.Never mind the administration’sweak grasp of detail, lack of competence and general inconsistency. Never mind the failure to apply itself to the kind of committed, diligent diplomacy required for peace. The record shows that Ukraine and its European allies repeatedlyexert every effort– from a new suit to arms purchases – to draw Mr Trump towards their position. Yet his compass needle always seems to swing back towards Mr Putin. Mr Trump should be standing with a democracy, alongside traditional allies, against a war criminal. But at best, he wants to be a mediator.The Kremlin has yet to confirm that the Russian leader will meet Mr Zelenskyy, as Mr Trump said he would. Mr Trump has said that the US will “help out” Europe withsecurity guaranteesand “coordinate” any such effort. But there is still no sign that this administration will provide the kind of backing that might make allies willing to put boots on the ground, or to persist with them if tested by Russia. Arguably the most important takeaway from Monday was the ability of European leaders of very different political persuasions – including Italy’s Giorgia Meloni – to coordinate effectively. That’s good news, but there’s a difference between fending off the worst case scenario and being able to establish a concrete plan for the future.Despite Russian advances in recent weeks – spurred by the prospect of talks – this war is costing Moscow dearly too. Mr Putin could yet conclude that it is not in his interests to continue. But even if Mr Trump can be held to his latest position, it remains far short of what is necessary.Ukraineurgently needs action to secure the future of thousands of children kidnapped by Russia, the promise of justice in the future, and above all, a ceasefire, before more lives are lost.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the globalising tendencies, and rising costs, of the Netflix age have made it increasinglyhardfor public service broadcasters to produce original programming with a distinctively British feel and focus. ITV’s Mr Bates vs the Post Officemadea £1m loss, and Mark Rylance took apay cutto ensure that the second series of the BBC’s Wolf Hall actually got made.Three cheers, then, for Channel 5’s bold move tobring backPlay for Today, more than 40 years after it left our screens in 1984. The channel has announced it will revive the brand from early next year, with an emphasis on the social realism that was an important feature of the original series. Some established stars such as Alan Davies and Sue Johnston are on board. But the plays are also intended to offer a springboard for young writers and actors from lower-income backgrounds – a welcome emphasis in an industry that is increasinglyinaccessibleto working-class talent.They will be aspiring to replicate one of the most successful experiments in the history of British television. In an era when producers, directors and writers enjoyed considerable freedom and trust, Play for Today offered some of the country’s finest creative spirits a prime-time Thursday-night slot. The extensive list of famous alumni includes Dennis Potter, Helen Mirren, Stephen Frears, Ken Loach, Alison Steadman andTrevor Griffiths.Hopefully, the revived version will offer greater room for female talent to flourish. Reflecting its time, the production process of Play for Today was very much a man’s world. But 14 years’ worth of plays, some of them adapted from the stage, allowed names to be made and often gritty themes to be addressed.David Edgar’s acclaimedDestiny, which examined the rise of the British far right in the late 1970s, was one of a number of sobering takes on the state of the nation. Abigail’s Party, Mike Leigh’s tragicomic portrait of suburban social anxiety, stilldelightstheatre audiences today.The days when the executives in charge of only three television channels decided what people watched belong to a different age. Next year’s reboot will face daunting competition for the public’s attention. But at a time when British politics feels particularly fissile, and opinions reverberate around social media echo chambers, a televisual space in which difficult subjects can be creatively addressed would be a national asset.A few years ago, Channel 5 scored a big hit when it faithfullyremadeAll Creatures Great and Small, the cosy adaptation of James Herriot’s vet novels originally broadcast from 1978. In tone and content, the new Play for Today will strike a rather different note from that pastoral reprise. But this is another revival that deserves to succeed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromPhilip HoyTue 19 Aug 2025 13.11 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareAccording to Peter Hain, “the approach to Palestine Action is contrary to every form of peaceful protest in British history, whether that’s the Chartists and suffragettes or anti-apartheid and anti-fascist protesters” (Peter Hain says UK government ‘digging itself into hole’ over Palestine Action, 13 August). Mr Hain, I’m afraid, needs to return to his history books.Describing those radical and sometimes violent movements as “peaceful protest” domesticates them and ignores the role that street fighting and property damage (for example) have played in successful protest in the past. From attempted armed uprisings, through bombings of cricket pavilions and churches, to Cable Street and elsewhere, those examples he gives of “peaceful protest” saw activists exercise violent resistance.Furthermore, the repression of Palestine Action and those protesting against its repression is very much not contrary to approaches to past protest movements. Excessive action through police and courts, and violent repression from the British state, have been common. From transportation (and sometimes execution) of early reformers, through the force-feeding of imprisoned suffrage activists, to the beating to death of Blair Peach by police officers, the state has often responded to serious challenges to its authority in ways that defy reason, and used the criminal justice system to do so.Mr Hain is repeating a longstanding liberal story that seeks to domesticate radicalism. It’s the story of a reasonable people interacting with reasonable governments to ensure slow and steady progress. Unfortunately, it is a story that runs contrary to historical (and present) reality.Mark NixonBlackford, Perth and KinrossAs a 57-year-old participant in the 9 August Palestine Action protest, I find the tone of slightly surprised celebration of older participants to be rather patronising. There’s nothing exceptional about older people’s participation in political refusal, and I’m not up for the kind of argument that things mustreally be badif old white women are coming out to protest in force.Older people – black, brown and white – have been central to civil disobedience as long as there has been protest. So while of course there will have been many people at the 9 August protest who were facing arrest for the first time, there were also many seasoned activists who were there in solidarity, in leadership and in persistent refusal to accept state curtailment of rights.These solidarity politics, which were beautifully in evidence among those waiting for arrest with their placards, come from feminist, queer and anti-racist histories of organising, solidarity and ethics that older people inaugurated.Today’s protests are possible because of the refusal of people to keep quiet about poverty and inequality, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia over many years. They are possible because of the risks that organisers have taken that have challenged police brutality and the hierarchies of social justice that prevent a full life – including freedom of expression – for all. People over 50 will continue to show up as long as there is public space to occupy.Clare HemmingsLondonWhat would happen if people wishing to demonstrate against the outlawing of Palestine Action carried banners emblazoned with the words “inept escalation” – a description of the government’s legislation that happens to be an anagram of the banned organisation’s name (Protester arrested over ‘Plasticine Action’ T-shirt: ‘How ridiculous is this?’, 18 August)?Philip HoyChurch Enstone, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters byChristopher BowserandAlan FairsTue 19 Aug 2025 13.11 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe chancellor is missing an open goal by looking at inheritance tax while searching for the elusive billions needed to fix Britain (Treasury targeting inheritance tax reforms to help plug UK deficit, 12 August). The tax needs significant reform to make it fit for the 21st century, but it isn’t the magic bullet the government is after.At the budget, Rachel Reeves could generate tens of billions of pounds by making tax changes that are overwhelmingly popular with the public and would be paid only by those with the broadest shoulders.Three-quartersof us want a wealth tax on net fortunes over £10m (backed byworld-leading economists). Equalising capital gains tax with income tax isfavouredby the majority too.The problem is that currently there’s a Britain for the haves, and a Britain for the have-nots. If you get an income from extreme wealth (often inherited or accumulated through “passive assets” such as property or investment), you get preferential treatment over people who work as a cleaner or a nurse, or in a warehouse or classroom.Just look at when Rishi Sunak released his tax return. He is from one of the UK’s350 richestfamilies, yet paid thesame effective tax rateas an average teacher, despite having income more than 50 times higher.That doesn’t sound fair to me, and it won’t sound fair to millions of people across the country who are struggling to get by and fed up with politics working for the rich and powerful over everyone else.Caitlin BoswellHead of advocacy and policy, Tax Justice UKLabour clearly has the interests of the 1% at heart above all others.Inheritance taxis hated by most; it appears to be a tax on ambition. Work all your life and, when you die, the government comes along and helps itself. In contrast, it is easy for the 1% to avoid it, using trusts, hiding assets offshore and there are even insurance policies that pay out if your estate is hit by IHT.Yes we need a wealth tax, but an even easier choice is simply to equalise capital gains and dividend tax rates with income tax and national insurance, and remove the additional capital gains and dividend tax allowances, so everyone gets a single £12,570 personal allowance.Christopher BowserHolmer Green, BuckinghamshireAmazingly, there are people who think somebody earning £20,000 a year should pay tax, while people who inherit £200,000 shouldn’t.Alan FairsBewdley, WorcestershireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

After lengthy consultation, the gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill waspassed by the Scottish parliamentwith a significant majority, the Conservatives being the only party voting against. If it had been enacted, Scotland would have aligned with the majority of European countries on this issue. However, the UK governmentused section 35 of the Scotland Act to stop it. So the dogma and divisiveness came from the UK, not Sturgeon or the Scottish government, and Scotland and the UK remain conservative outliers in Europe with regard to trans rights.John WarburtonEdinburghIt was the fact thatNicola Sturgeonwas a personable working-class woman with strong values that made the contrast between her and Boris Johnson so stark. Is it her support for independence that led to cold treatment in the British media? The headline on Martin Kettle’s article suggests so. But this raises the question of whether being pro-union is really less nationalistic than being pro-independence. In any case, many Scots remember Nicola fondly, something that can’t be said for many of this island’s recent political leaders.Duncan MacraeInvernessHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Championship promotion races and playoffs, the ill winds of struggling in the Premier League have nothing on the fever-dream pressures of trying to turn around an ailing Glaswegian giant.Martin may be the true believer in his processes but in an environment where snap decisions are often sustained, he will not have long to set them in place. “I think the precursor to change is pain,” he said after an agonising night for Rangers fans. “I knew coming here that there was going to be some pain early on.”‘Trust is lost’: Isak accuses Newcastle of broken promises in transfer dramaRead moreThe likelihood of Rangers playingChampions Leaguefootball rather than Europa League this season is only an outside chance following a first-half performance of rank ineptitude. The tone and probably the two‑leg tie were set by a horrible opening 20 minutes in which three soft goals were conceded.Until improvement in the second half offered crumbs of redemption, Martin’s chances of bending one of football’s haughtiest, venerable institutions to his blue-sky thinking looked ever more bleak.Christos Tzolis, reportedly high on Crystal Palace’s list should Eberechi Eze depart, was Brugge’s danger man, the veteran Hans Vanaken was the roving playmaker. They did not need long to hit their straps, aided by the negligence of their opponents.Ibrox had initially backed its men. Europa League qualification banked, Rangers began their task positively. But only briefly. In the third minute came one of those moments scarring Martin’s reputation. Within seconds of their striker Danilo shooting, Rangers were a goal down. The rebound reached Tzolis, the onward ball caught Nasser Djiga dozing with goalkeeper Jack Butland stranded. Romeo Vermant’s finish was exquisite, if granted the freedom of Govan. “That changes the whole feeling of the game,” Martin said. “Then we make so many decisions out of anxiety.”To compound disaster, Rangers’ malfunctioning zonal marking allowed Jorne Spileers to stroke home Vermant’s corner four minutes later. By the 20th minute, more disaster, Brandon Mechele celebrating his 500th Brugge appearance by seizing on a loose ball, drilling home unchallenged. Such grim, ugly exposure sent fans barrelling for the exits.Whatever Martin is attempting, such moments surely decimate his chances of long-term survival.

Jayden Meghoma, debuting on loan from Brentford – the captain, James Tavernier, having been benched – supplied Danilo for a close-range finish. Finally positivity reinjected by the attacking football Martin evangelises. “We need to give the supporters more moments like we did in the second half, really making them feel what’s going to come,” Martin said, still confident in brighter, better days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It looked marginal. “Lucky we had VAR,” the veteran former Liverpool goalkeeper said. That stopped the roof being raised; there would be no comeback.At least Rangers were improved from that initial farce. Mignolet was the busier goalkeeper as the first leg concluded. Rangers had hardly redeemed themselves yet Martin took heavy positives ahead of the second leg.“Tonight, the level of resilience the team showed, we will grow a lot from that,” he said. “I really believe that. We have the privilege and the beauty of being in that position of hunting and chasing.”Even Martin the eternally bullish optimist would recognise that better – much better – must follow if Ibrox is to host the Champions League group stage with him in the dugout.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueRangersClub BruggeEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In an incendiary Instagram message he claimed their relationship “could not continue”.Isak has been endeavouring to force a move to Liverpool all summer but, so far, at least Newcastle have proved resistant,rejecting one £110m bidas they struggle to find replacements.Prolific Salah and Caldentey rewarded with PFA player of the year awardsRead moreThe striker was due to have attended the Professional Footballers’ Association players’ player of the year awards in Manchester on Tuesday having been nominated for the top prize but he sent his apologies via his explosive social media post.Shortly after Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah won the main award for a third time, Isak’s words sent shockwaves through the corridors of power at St James’ Park. “When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can’t continue,” he posted after expressing pride at being voted on to the PFA Premier League team of the 2024-25 season.Isak then thanked his teammates and “everyone at Newcastle” for supporting him along the way before increasing the pressure on the club’s Saudi Arabian owners to sanction his longed-for sale to Anfield.“I’m not at the ceremony tonight,” he posted. “With everything going on, it didn’t feel right to be there.“I’ve kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn’t reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors.“The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading.“When promises are broken and trust is lost the relationship can’t continue. That’s where things are for me right now – and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.”Isak was understood to be furious when what he believed to be a promised pay rise was postponed last summer. At the time he had four years remaining on his contract worth £140,000 a week. His camp claim that last spring he made it clear to Newcastle’s manager and the club that he wanted to leave this summer, but Howe and the board interpret things very differently.This summer Isak skipped the club’s pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea citing a thigh injury, undetectable on scans. He then spent a week training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, an excursion Howe learned about only through the media.More recently Isak has been training alone at Newcastle after other players have departed and he was excluded from a club social barbecue after refusing Howe’s overtures to reintegrate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The board were preparing to fine the striker, who is understood to have rejected offers of a much-enhanced contract extension, the maximum permissible two weeks’ wages after he missed the club’s opening game of the season last Saturday, a goalless draw at Aston Villa.Later on Tuesday evening, Newcastlereleased a statement: “We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer.“We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views. As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take into consideration the best interests ofNewcastle United, the team and our supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a sale this summer have not transpired.“We do not foresee those conditions being met.“This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive to retain our family feel. Alex remains part of our family and will be welcomed back when he is ready to rejoin his teammates.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedLiverpoolTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

It would have been a shock had the Egypt forward not triumphed on Tuesday night at the ceremony in Manchester, given he scored 29 Premier League goals and created a further 18 asLiverpoolwon the title last season, the 33-year-old enjoying one of his very best campaigns of an already gilded career.Salah said: “I look at myself now, a guy coming from Egypt and making it to the top level, making history today, it’s something that makes me so proud.”Caldentey also shone in her first season as an Arsenal player, with the Spain forward helping the club to end an 18-year wait for European glory by defeating her former team Barcelonain the Champions League finalin Lisbon.Along the way, Caldentey scored 19 times in all competitions, including seven Champions League goals. She becomes the third Arsenal player to receive the PFA women’s award, following in the footsteps of Kim Little in 2013 and Vivianne Miedema in 2019.Caldentey spent July this year in Switzerland, starring for Spain at Euro 2025. She scored the opening goal inthe final against Englandin Basel before ending with a runners-up medal after the Lionesses prevailed on penalties.“Everyone at the club has made it so easy for me and they helped me from the start and it just feels like home and I’m happy to be here,” Caldentey said.“If you ask me my position I don’t know what to answer, but I just enjoy it on the pitch and I just want to help my teammates. They’ve made everything so easy for me so it has been an incredible pleasure.”Caldentey’s new Arsenal teammate Olivia Smith is the women’s young player of the year, with the equivalent men’s award going to Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers. Smith, a 21-year-old Canada forward, became the most expensive signing in women’s football historywhen she arrived in north Londonfrom Liverpool for £1m last month. Smith scored seven goals in 20 appearances last season and collected a series of player-of-the-year awards on Merseyside.Rogers turned 23 last month and is already a senior England international after scoring 14 goals in 54 appearances in all competitions for Villa last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The last time England hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup [in 2010], the girls played at the Stoop around the corner to a crowd of 13,000.“I started playing women’s rugby 30 years ago and the prospect of girls running out of the tunnel, playing to the three tiers of Allianz packed to the rafters, is something perhaps I never hoped or thought I would see and it’s certainly what girls’ dreams are made of.”More than 40,000 tickets have been sold for England’s game against USA but Sally Horrox, the World Rugby chief of women’s rugby, was confident that it would be close to a 50,000 sellout by kick-off. “The sport has grown significantly over the last three years,” she said. “But it’s hugely important now that we make the very most of this opportunity right in front of us over the next six weeks.”Sarah Massey, managing director of the tournament, said that more than 80% of tickets had been sold and that this would rise. She was confident those who had bought tickets would show up and be entranced by the spectacle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This, after all, is supposed to be a non-tribal environment aside from the weekend every two years when Europe face USA and people on either side of the ropes take leave of their senses.Golf’s next pursuit of the holy grail belongs to Tommy Fleetwood. Defeat from positions of strength at the Travelers and St Jude championships threw up an unwanted statistic. In 163PGA Tourstarts, Fleetwood is yet to emerge victorious. As striking as that raw number – Fleetwood’s talent is such that one assumes he should have claimed a batch of trophies in the US – is the fact people are willing him to end his drought. Fleetwood is relatable, likable, popular. He also has no objection to the discussion presently whirling around him.PGA Tour ends decade-long absence from Trump-owned courses with Doral return in 2026Read more“I’m not going to feed you lies and say: ‘Oh, in Memphis I thought I did everything great, or Travelers I didn’t do anything wrong,’” Fleetwood said. “Of course I got things wrong down the stretch and it didn’t happen for me.“You learn from those experiences. I would rather you be questioning me about not finishing tournaments off than not questioning me at all about anything. So I’ve obviously shown a lot of really good stuff and put myself in great positions.“I just want to put myself there again. I want to give myself another chance. I’ll finish it off at some point. I’ll get it right and I’ll get it right more than once. But being there is actually the hard part, in a way.“I don’t feel like I have to rattle off all the good stuff. I just need to be aware of it, know that I’m doing the right things and know that there’s still things that I can get better. I use the disappointments as motivation and I use the good stuff as confidence boosting.”At East Lake this week, another PGA Tour season will conclude. Scottie Scheffler will look to press his dominance of the game by lifting the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup.Just as fate eventually smiled on McIlroy, a two-hour drive away in April, could it finally be Tommy’s time? His reliability and close shave history is emphasised by six runner-up finishes on the PGA Tour, the same number of thirds, 30 top fives and 44 top 10s. He is the 10th-ranked player in the world. “Best case scenario coming down the stretch at East Lake with a chance to win,” Fleetwood said.“Whether I get it right or not, whether it happens or not, whether someone plays better or not, I’ll talk about that at the time. But I would love to get there and give myself that chance again.”View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood reacts to his putt on the 15th green during the final round of the Travelers.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesThe 34-year-old has not been burned by falling short. “It’s funny really, you walk off the course on Sunday last week and I was happier with a fourth place finish than I was with a third in Memphis,” Fleetwood said.“It’s a strange game that way. I am very happy with the consistency of my golf and the level I’ve been playing at.Golfis a crazy game. You never know what you’re going to turn up with week in and week out but this year has been a very good year.”Fleetwood knows how to get over the line. He has done it eight times elsewhere in the world. He has been successful when involved in tight scraps. The nature of recent events, as opposed to core results, is what has brought Fleetwood’s situation into sharp focus. He missed out on a playoff in Memphis by a shot, having led by two with three holes to play.At the Travelers,Keegan Bradley usurped Fleetwoodafter the Southport man three-putted the 72nd hole. Fleetwood was clearly dejected during post-tournament media duties at both but there was no raw moment, no smashed club, no fist through a window. Yes, the smile had vanished but not for long.“I get disappointed and I get angry,” Fleetwood said. “I’ve thrown the odd club in the water when I’m out there and maybe feel a bit better for a while. But I’m not that great at being angry. It just doesn’t suit me. I just kind of let it go. I work really hard on letting things go, moving on. Not that much great comes from those moments of anger.“But like I say, like anybody, I get disappointed, I get frustrated, I get angry. I doubt myself. Of course I do. It’s all part of being a professional athlete and part of trying to chase your dreams and accomplish great things against unbelievable golfers.”Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I want to be champion jockey, I need to be champion jockey and hopefully I’ll be able to do it.”From any other teenage rider bar the 19-year-old Loughnane, such a resolute statement of intent could prompt at least a niggle of concern that, with such a tight focus on the ultimate destination, he might not appreciate the journey. Loughnane, though, has been a little different from the earliest days of his riding career.Racing strike leads to battle lines being drawn in dispute over tax reforms | Greg WoodRead moreHe was being talked about as a future champion well before he started to discuss the idea himself. He has also, quite clearly, been enjoying every moment of the ride and every fresh career milestone that has appeared in his rearview mirror at a remarkably early stage of his career.Horses have always just run for Loughnane, as they did for Ryan Moore, Frankie Dettori and, way back in the 1950s, for a teenaged Lester Piggott who, like Loughnane, grew up in a racing yard and started out riding for his father.“There’s pictures of me a couple of days after I was born, perched up on a horse,” Loughnane says. “I grew up around racehorses and it’s been my dream job since I was a baby, as soon as I could imagine.“I’ve had a good couple of years and I’ve been lucky since I started. I’ve got a very good agent behind me now in Tony Hind, and a good boss in George Boughey to go with it.”Dettori was the champion apprentice at 18 but Loughnane was a year younger when he picked up the prize in 2023 and, while Dettori needed the best part of two full seasons to ride out his claim, Loughnane reached the necessary 95 winners less than a year after his debut success in November 2022.View image in fullscreenBilly Loughnane returns to the paddock at Newbury after winning on Rhythm N Hooves.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianIt was an 11-month period when the naturally gifted Loughnane was, for practical and punting purposes, a senior jockey with a claim. His first winner – Swiss Rowe for his father, Mark – was a 28-1 chance but it did not take the market long to catch up. Within weeks, he was the punters’ favourite apprentice, riding – and winning – on well-backed runners on almost a daily basis.His first Group-race win arrived in April 2024 and a first success at Royal Ascot – on only his ninth ride at Flat racing’s showpiece meeting – came two months later, as Loughnane coolly steered Rashabar, an unconsidered 80-1 shot in the betting, to victory in the Group Two Coventry Stakes. It was the jockey’s sole ride on Brian Meehan’s colt and it remains the only success of Rashabar’s 10-race career. A longed-for first success at Group One level, meanwhile, arrived this month, when he got the call from Charlie Appleby to ride Rebel’s Romance, the hot favourite, in the Grosser Preis von Berlin.Amid all the quickfire success and the inevitable attention that followed, Loughnane’s awareness and composure in the saddle have been matched by a strikingly clear-eyed sense of how far he still has to travel. How has he managed to stay so grounded? “Everyone asks me the question,” he says, “and it’s a difficult one for me to answer.“I wake up, ride out in the mornings, try and ride out in as many places as possible to get around and get the rides later in the day. Then I go to the gym, go to the races, focus on my rides, ride my horses and go home, that’s my whole life.”View image in fullscreenBilly Loughnane crosses the line on Rhythm N Hooves to win the D&H Excellence In Nutrition Handicap at Newbury.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesIn 2025, Loughnane has not simply been busy, but the busiest rider of all in the British weighing room, with 771 rides. Rossa Ryan, with 712 rides, is the only other jockey to pass 700. Every ride, meanwhile, involves much more than a minute or two on the track.“A lot goes in beforehand with the form book,” he says, “looking at my horse’s previous form and its run style, making a plan on what to do with the trainer before the race. I’m very lucky that I’ve got a good team around me and a driver to drive me to the races, so I can do my form in the car on the way, when I’m not sleeping.”Only Oisin Murphy, with 131 winners since 1 January, has ridden more than Loughnane’s 124 this year, and though Loughnane trails the reigning champion by 28 in the official race, which runs from May to mid-October, a recent burst of winners has taken him into a clear second, going into the Ebor meeting at York this week.“There are no days off, I’m riding seven days a week,” he says, “but I’m happy to be busy and I’d be complaining if I was sat at home with no rides. My outlook’s the same and it will always be the same – trying to win the championship every year to come.”Danon Decile can deliver York delightOnly six go to post for the Group One International Stakes at York on Wednesday but the race still promises to be one of the highlights of the summer season, with horses from four different countries ensuring that it lives up to its name.Delacroix and Ombudsman, first and second respectively in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown last month, head the betting, with Ombudsman narrowly favoured at 15-8 and Delacroix back to around 2-1 after a concerning – and unexplained – drift to 6-1 over the weekend. The pair are closely matched on their Sandown form but nowhere near as far clear of their field on ratings as the market suggests.See The Fire, whose sire (Sea The Stars) and dam (Arabian Queen) both won this race, is an intriguing alternative at the track and trip where she took the Middleton Stakes by a dozen lengths in May, and it is easy to overlook her run behind Whirl at Goodwood last time after she handed several lengths to the winner at the start.A stronger challenge, though, may emerge from the Japanese-trained contenderDanon Decile(3.35). Keita Tosaki’s four-year‑old won last year’s Japanese Derby, and showed he can take his best form overseas when coming home a length and a half in front of Calandagan, the King George winner at Ascot last month, in March’s Sheema Classic at Meydan.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowYork1.50 Spring Is Sprung 2.25 Goodwood Galaxy (nb) 3.00 Carmers 3.35 Danon Decile 4.10 Dancing In Paris (nap) 4.45 Jumbeau 5.20 Temple Of AthenaCarlisle2.05 Gwen John 2.40 Promise Time 3.15 Rosso Levanto 3.50 Count Palatine 4.25 Crystal Dagger 4.55 TootsieWorcester4.50 Rocks Up Late 5.25 My Gift To You 5.55 Mikhailovich 6.30 Tamarind Bay 7.00 Just A Heartbeat 7.30 Rogue Mission 8.00 Orange DiamondKempton5.15 Houdini Miss 5.50 Tierra Del Toro 6.20 Chapter 6.50 Royal Bodyguard 7.20 Zoffandia 7.50 Finalise 8.20 Valsharah 8.50 Silca BayWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.York 1.50:Spring Is Sprungis in the form of his life and has already landed a £100,000 bonus for three wins in the Sunday Series.

As the doors hissed open, the girls tumbled out one by one, hair tied back, boots slung over shoulders, already wide awake and buzzing with energy.It was the start of another dawn practice session for theBangladeshwomen’s national football team, but spirits were high. With internationals on the horizon and competition growing stronger, the girls had no time to spare. At the front of the squad was Afeida Khandaker, the fierce and quietly confident captain who recently led Bangladesh to qualify for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup for the first time. “I want our girls to be recognised for their brilliance and our recent victory did exactly that,” the 18-year-old defender says proudly. “But we are only just getting started. We want to show the world what Bangladesh is truly capable of.”View image in fullscreenThe Bangladesh women’s national football team shares a lighthearted moment on the bus after a morning practice session in August 2025.Photograph: Farzana Hossen/The GuardianThe team topped Group C in the 2026 qualifiers, defeating Bahrain 7-0, Myanmar 2-1 and Turkmenistan 7-0 to finish with nine points from three matches. They now join teams such as Japan, China and South Korea in Australia next year, and a top finish there could seal qualification for the Women’s World Cup and even the Olympic Games, marking a major milestone in their football journey.The group have also achieved theirbiggest ever leapin the Fifa world rankings, rising 24 places to 104th, the highest gain among all nations in the latest cycle. “This achievement isn’t just ours – it belongs to every girl in Bangladesh who dares to dream,” says Khandaker. “It’s proof of what faith, hard work, and unity can achieve. But we’re not stopping here. The next few months of preparation will be tough but we are up for the challenge.”Back in their hotel rooms, the team are more relaxed; lounging around in PJs, making TikTok videos and packing for a flight the following morning. Many of them are still adjusting to life as national footballers. Having come from mostly disadvantaged backgrounds, they’re learning to navigate a new world away from home structured around training, strict routines, and nutrition charts. Despite having access to room service at five-star hotels, the girls have been using kettles to boil potatoes and scissors to cut up onions to makebhorta, a traditional Bangladeshi dish. “We’re still getting used to international cuisine,” says Khandaker sheepishly. “And sometimes after a big game, we just want some comfort food. A little something from back home.”Khandaker had a modest upbringing in Satkhira, south-west Bangladesh, where her father, an avid footballer, once played at district level. He aspired to play internationally but, like many Bangladeshi men, had no choice but to abandon his dreams and migrate to the middle east to support his family. When he returned he had saved enough to start a small business and set up an amateur football academy for local kids; Khandaker and her elder sister Afra were his first students. “My passion for football comes from my father,” says the captain. “He wanted to prove that girls could play football just as well as boys – if not better – and pushed us harder than anyone else.”View image in fullscreenAfeida Khandaker, the 18-year-old captain of Bangladesh, credits her father’s enthusiasm for girls’ football for her love of the game.Photograph: Farzana Hossen/The GuardianAs children, when the siblings were too tired to train or run laps, their father would chase them around a field with mud in his hands, recalls Khandaker, laughing. “At home he was ourabbu,but on the field he was our coach and he never gave us a day off!” Their hard work paid off. Aged 11, Khandaker was selected for the Bangladesh Football Federation’s national training camp while Afra pivoted to boxing and recently competed in the semi-finals of Bangladesh’s national boxing championship. “We’re really lucky to have supportive parents and hope our success inspires other girls to pursue sport without self-doubt,” says Khandaker. “We’ve worked really hard to get to where we are but without a proper support system none of it would have been possible.”Khandaker and her teammates are determined to excel internationally, and the British head coach, Peter Butler, believes they are well on their way. “It’s been a tough few months of development, intense training and building resilience,” says the former West Ham midfielder. “But the girls have shown remarkable progress and I’m dead proud. This is a young group playing fearlessly against teams ranked significantly higher than them – they’re improving with every game and becoming a force to be reckoned with.” Butler has been training the team since March 2024 and it’s not just his discipline and work ethic that have rubbed off – some of the girls have started pronouncing English words with a Yorkshire accent.A few months after Butler arrived in Dhaka, astudent uprisingthat sparked mass protests throughout the country quickly turned violent with hundreds killed at the hands of security forces. The uprising led to the establishment of aninterim governmentunder the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has focused on stabilising the country. But, in the wake of the political shift, activists say there isstill a lot of workto be done.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Bangladesh Football Federation quickly stepped in, issuing strong statements and putting security measures in place. “It’s sad that there are people who still think girls shouldn’t be playing football,” says Khandaker. “Bangladeshi women are leading in all aspects of the public sphere – the pitch should be no exception.”The threats have not deterred Khandaker and her teammates who continue proving the naysayers wrong and remain hopeful for the future. “I remember watching the World Cup on TV with my family in 2022 and wishing I could be there,” recalls Khandaker, who was invited to tour Qatar earlier this year. “It felt impossible at the time but as I stood there silently in that vast stadium, I wondered what other dreams of mine were within reach”.

Bayern had an offer for the Frenchman – a loan with an option to buy – rejected over the weekend and have so far shown little inclination of wanting to pay enough to buy him. Chelsea’s preference is a permanent sale rather than a loan for Nkunku as he is not part of their long-term plans.Transfer roundup: Leeds close on £18m deal for Milan striker Noah OkaforRead moreInter are also interested in Nkunku, whose contract runs until 2029, but a return to Leipzig two years after leaving them forChelseafor £52m is a possibility. The 27-year-old forward is open to a reunion with his former club, although other options are on the table. A deal with Leipzig is not close but there is confidence that they will be able to come to an agreement with Chelsea on a fee for the France international, who has struggled for form and fitness during his time in west London.The clubs have already held talks over Chelsea adding Simons to their attacking ranks. Chelsea are yet to lodge a bid for the Netherlands international, who wants to move to Stamford Bridge, and hope to move out fringe players before making further additions. Aston Villa are interested in Nicolas Jackson but would need a significant drop in his £80m asking price if they are to pursue a deal for the striker. Jackson wants a new challenge after seeing Chelsea sign Liam Delap and João Pedro.Chelsea have also strengthened on the flanks, signing Estêvão Willian and Jamie Gittens, but they want more depth on the left. They are pushing to sign Garnacho, who is viewed as competition for Gittens, but want United to drop their asking price of £50m for the Argentina winger. Garnacho, who has reportedly turned down a switch to Bayern, has fallen from favour at United and Chelsea are unlikely to want to pay over £40m.Other players expected to leave Chelsea are Tyrique George, Axel Disasi, Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka and Renato Veiga; the latter of whom is a target for Villarreal. Fulham are interested in Raheem Sterling.Meanwhile, West Ham have had a bid rejected for Chelsea’s Andrey Santos. The Hammers are interested in the Brazilian but have been knocked back and have now made an improved offer for the Southampton midfielder Mateus Fernandes.Explore more on these topicsChelseaRB LeipzigBayern MunichTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas had given a “very positive response, and it truly was almost identical to what the Israeli side had previously agreed to”, the spokesperson said.Egypt said on Monday that it and Qatar had sent the new proposal to Israel and “the ball is now in its court”.Reports emerged on Tuesday that Egyptian security officials were putting strong pressure on Hamas to agree to a compromise that would bridge the gap for Israel’s demands for Gaza’s demilitarisation in any future peace deal by placing Hamas’s weapons in Egyptian custody for an undisclosed period.With Hamas’s agreement, the focus will now be on Israel, which is under mounting international pressure to accept a ceasefire amid international horror overwidespread conditions of starvationthat have spread through the Palestinian territory after Israel earlier this year imposed a complete blockade on aid entering Gaza.While Israel is now letting some supplies into the Gaza Strip, it is not enough to avert widespread starvation, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday. Its spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan told a press briefing in Geneva: “In the past few weeks Israeli authorities have only allowed aid to enter in quantities that remain far below what would be required to avert widespread starvation.”He said the risk of starvation in Gaza was a “direct result of the Israeli government’s policy of blocking humanitarian aid”. Israel’s military agency that coordinates aid, Cogat, has said Israel invests “considerable efforts” in aid distribution to Gaza, a claim rejected by many in the international community.While any prospect of a ceasefire is rejected by Netanyahu’s far-right allies who have again suggested they could collapse his fragile governing coalition, the scale of mass protests in favour of a deal that would secure the return of Israeli hostages is creating its own dynamic, with more demonstrations being called for this weekend.On Tuesday, Israeli media analysts suggested that a vacillating Netanyahu, whose position has lurched abruptly between supporting a partial deal for a ceasefire and rejecting it, would be compelled to choose a course of action, not least if the White House backs the ceasefire terms.“Just two weeks ago he changed his tune and went from insisting on a partial deal to vehemently demanding a comprehensive deal,” wrote Amos Harel in Haaretz of Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza. “As usual, everything is fluid and flexible: Netanyahu will change his arguments and explanations, and may even covertly encourage internal opposition, as long as he can afford to avoid signing a deal.“If circumstances become impossible for him, due either to a demand from Trump or persistent and severe public outcry, the deal will be signed despite the risks it poses for him.”1:33Israel protests erupt nationwide to demand end of Gaza war – videoFacing a full resumption of his trial oncorruption chargesin the autumn, the most significant of those risks is that Netanyahu’s government falls and he is compelled to call new elections.Writing in the centre-right Yedioth Ahronoth, Ben-Dror Yemini was equally scathing about Netanyahu’s leadership and the consequences of rejection of the new proposal. “What now? If Israel says no, it will walk into the trap that Hamas prepared. Because if the talk – and it’s only talk – about conquering Gaza City has already begun to produce increasing calls for sanctions [against Israel], then a military incursion into Gaza will only precipitate an even stronger avalanche,” he wrote.“We have to bear in mind that things can always get worse. And if an Israeli incursion into Gaza City, along with all of the horrific images of destruction, devastation and fatalities, is going to precipitate this avalanche, then going into Gaza City after Hamas said yes to the Witkoff plan – and after Israel refused – will only worsen the avalanche. Once again, Hamas’s strategy will be proven as far more intelligent than Israel’s.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The company – which has an exposure of $2.4bn (£1.8bn) to Thames Water’s bonds – was “well protected in terms of the legal structure” from losing money, he told investors ona callon 8 August.“The joke I make internally, and I’ll put it out here over some criticism, is that even in Puerto Rico’s case, they paid the water bill,” he said. “So I’m assuming the UK government will do the same.”Puerto Rico, a US territory, went through thebiggest municipal default in modern history, beginning in 2014. However, its water company debtswere not hit, preserving returns for investors.The comments underline the scale of Thames Water’s crisis, as well as the expectation of some its senior creditors that they will not lose their money. Thames Water has been under the effective control of its senior creditors, which hold the bulk of its £17.7bn debt pile since shareholders walked away from the company last year.The creditors have proposed a £5.3bn injection of equity and debt to take formal control of Thames Water and try to turn it around. However, the creditors insist that no recovery is possible withoutleniency on pollution fines from Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales.That proposal is deeply controversial and has led to a standoff, with the environment secretary, Steve Reed, insisting that Thames Water mustcontinue to meet the same environmental standardsas rivals. The government has faced calls for it to place Thames Water into special administration, effectively a temporary nationalisation that would probably impose significant losses on creditors.However, Assured Guaranty has said that it is confident it will not lose money, and that Thames Water will stay out of government control. Frederico said that he was “very comfortable” that the creditor plan would be approved.Assured Guaranty’s exposure to UK water companies has risen to more than $16bn inJune, up from $10.6bn inMarch 2022, according to quarterly filings. Its biggest exposure was $2.8bn on Southern Water, another British water company that hasfaced financial difficulties.The insurer has said that it feels “pretty good” about its exposure to Britain’s privatised water companies. Its chief financial officer, Benjamin Rosenblum, said in February: “The UK government has stated that they really don’t plan to nationalise the water utilities and frankly, they don’t really seem to have the room in their budget to do so, and they would like to see additional investment. So I think the macroeconomic background for the UK water sector looks pretty good.”Dieter Helm, an Oxford University professor who has advised previous Labour and Conservative governments on energy and water policy, said this week that the creditor offer was “a plan designed to protect their debt” and that it did not appear to address Thames Water’s long-term problems.Helm said that “Thames is, in principle, a very viable asset” because of rising bills that guarantee revenues but added that creditors are not likely to back debt write-offs that would impose losses on themselves. Several of the creditors bought the debt at a discount from the original lenders, meaning they could still make large profits even with a large cut in the amount Thames owes.A Thames Water spokesperson said: “A special administration regime doesn’t fix Thames Water’s problems. It will delay the delivery of improvement for our customers and the environment. It will be disruptive, add risk and uncertainty, increase costs, hinder our operational turnaround, destabilise our stakeholders and colleagues, and will not fix the balance sheet.“A market-led recapitalisation is the quickest and most effective route to financial stability, sustainable investment and better outcomes for customers and the environment.”Assured Guaranty and the Thames Water senior creditor group were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterUtilitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

This meant ensuring all affected owners are “provided with viable alternatives”, whether through courtesy cars, financial compensation or at-home repairs.In the letter, first reported by the PA news agency, the minister said the existing arrangements were “not meeting expectations”. She had received reports from MPs and their constituents that detailed distressing experiences and inadequate support with alternative transport arrangements.The consumer group Which? recently described Stellantis’s handling of the recall as “chaotic”. It said it had heard from “many distressed drivers” – including a woman caring for her terminally ill husband who needed to get to hospital appointments – who were incurring significant expenses for hire cars, taxis or insurance fees.While Stellantis had promised to minimise the burden on consumers, the “execution of this recall has exposed significant gaps in customer support and transparency”, Alexander said.Cars equipped with Takata airbags are being recalled because chemicals in the inflators may deteriorate over time, which could cause the bag to rupture.No incidents have been reported in the UK, but Stellantis issued the “stop drive” order across Europe after a woman in France was killed when her airbag exploded. Driving one of the cars can invalidate your insurance, and it is illegal for a private seller to sell a car with a “stop drive” recall without disclosing it first.Stellantis insisted thatCitroënwas “fully engaged” in maximising the daily number of cars that can have their airbags replaced, adding that its Peugeot network is now authorised to also carry out the work.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These options include replacement airbags at a dealership or at home, a courtesy car, support for other mobility options and recovery.

The Coos Forest Protective Association, a non-profit that provides wildland fire protection for several counties in Oregon, had received a call about the fire on Saturday.Harper said there’s still a spot about 280 ft up the tree that’s “still hot and it’s still showing some smoke”.“That’s the area of focus right now to see if we can get that that spot cooled down because of the thick bark,” she said.Wildfire smoke far more dangerous to health than thought, say scientistsRead moreThe blaze was burning from the top of the tree down into its trunk on Monday, according to anupdate from the non-profit, and helicopter crews managed to douse flames in the canopy. On Tuesday, crews remained on “observation mode” to see if the helicopter work was successful or not.“They are holding off on any more helicopter drops today, just to see what the fire does,” Harper said. “There are helicopters available to respond if they do start to see more fire developing.”Fire officials will not send climbing crews into the Doerner fir, according to the non-profit’s update on Facebook, amid safety concerns.“Fallout from the treetop makes it unsafe for crews to engage directly under the tree, so firefighters are working to identify additional ways to reach and extinguish the fire,” reads the statement from Monday.Firefighters have set up a containment line and sprinklers to prevent the flames from spreading near the ground.The cause of the fire remains under investigation, and investigators with the Bureau of Land Management are on scene.“Visitors should be aware that the area will be closed to public use at this time due to active fire and firefighting efforts,” the Coos Forest Protective Association said.Harper said the tree’s height makes it the first target for lightning strikes or anything falling from the sky. She said the tree also has a lot of dried moss and bark built up over the summer amid the heat and lack of rain.“That material is all flammable,” Harper said. “It’s an older tree, it has a lot of pitch that’s coming out of it, that sticky, sugary substance that has the potential to be pretty flammable.”Explore more on these topicsOregonWildfiresWest CoastTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

And it is not the only hallmark of autumn that appears to have come early: trees are dropping their leaves, apples are ripe and acorns are hitting the ground.But with temperatures still high, experts say this is not simply a case of an early fall. Instead, they say, nature is under stress.England has just had itsfourth heatwaveof the summer, with temperatures reaching up to 33.4C, and five areas of the country arein drought.“A lot of what we’re seeing has been caused by a very hot and very dry spring and summer, it’s been one of the driest periods on record,” said Kathryn Brown, the director of climate change and evidence at the Wildlife Trusts. “So it feels like autumn has come early, but it’s due to the natural environment reacting to that very extreme spring and summer, which is not average conditions that our species are adapted to in terms of seasonal cycles.”Brown said some birch and poplar trees had already turned brown and were losing their leaves, while in her own garden acorns were already falling from oak trees. “Trees will set seed [earlier] as a reaction to stress, because they’re trying to employ an insurance strategy,” she said.There have also been warnings about treessuddenly dropping branches. While the cause of this phenomenon is not clear, it often occurs after aprolonged period of dry weather.According to the Met Office’sState of the UK Climate report, climate changes are causing shifts in many biological events in the UK. Prof Tim Sparks, a co-author of the report, noted that plants and insects were becoming active earlier in the year.Sparks said earlier fruit ripening was a result of higher temperatures, with shrivelled blackberries arising because of a lack of water. “Leaf drop is also a water issue; it’s not autumn in the sense it’s not the end of the growing season if we get more rain,” he said.While trees are dropping their leaves because of drought, Sparks said a warmer climate would generally be expected to result in trees holding on to their leaves for longer. Together with earlier fruit ripening, he said, that would result in a longer autumn.While shifts in the timing of natural events can be discombobulating for humans, the ramifications could be serious for wildlife. As Brown points out, birds such as blackbirds tend to predominantly eat insects in the spring and summer and feed these to their chicks when they are breeding.“But in the autumn, they switch to seeds and berries and fruits like blackberries. And if they’ve already come and gone, there’s going to be a food gap in the autumn,” she said.Brown said this had serious implications for animals trying to get ready for winter, when food is scarce.“It’s very hard to predict what the exact impacts are going to be for different species, but it is very worrying, because the seasonal cycle is completely out of whack at the moment and our wildlife is not adapted to that, so it’s definitely much more chaotic for them,” she said.Farmers are also coming to terms with unpredictable weather. While the National Farmers’ Union said farmers and growers around the country were facing a varied picture in terms of crop yields this year, Rachel Hallos, its vice-president, said the increasing extreme weather was affecting farmers’ ability to produce food.“Although parts of the country have seen some rainfall, and farmers are no strangers to unpredictable weather, the extremes this year have been unprecedented,” she said. “Last year’s harvest was marked by heavy rain; this year, it’s the lack of it. These fluctuations of drought and flood are becoming more pronounced and more regular.”Hallos said food security must be a national priority and she called for the government to support farmers and growers to build resilience, stressing that investment was needed in climate adaptation and resilient crop varieties as well as water infrastructure.Hallos’s concerns are supported by data from the Met Office, which has revealed winters are getting wetter and temperature extremes have increased, becoming more frequent and more intense. This June was thewarmest ever recordedin England and the second warmest for the UK since records began in 1884.Brown said a key concern was that the current conditions were occurring with global warming at about 1.5C above preindustrial levels, yet higher levels of warming were expected.“That’s what really worries me is seeing the impacts now at this relatively low level of warming where things are already getting really stressed, and thinking about what’s this going to be like in five years or 10 years, or even next year,” she said. “It’s quite hard to predict, but it doesn’t look very hopeful.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherPlantsFarmingClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

They have pumped out more than twice the amount of PM2.5 that wildfires have generated on average by this point in the year over the last two decades.“Previously, people assumed the same toxicity for wildfire particles and all particles,” said Prof Cathryn Tonne, an environmental epidemiologist at the Barcelona Institute for GlobalHealth(ISGlobal) and co-author of the study.“Our paper shows evidence that – although it happens less often – the health impact for the same amount of particles is stronger for wildfire particles,” she added.Dirty air is one of the biggest threats to human health, and research suggests wildfires are a significant contributor to the vast death toll. In December, astudyattributed 1.53 million deaths around the world each year to short-term and long-term exposure to air pollution from wildfires.The ISGlobal researchers, who looked only at the smoke’s short-term effects, for which the evidence base is stronger, combined daily mortality records from 32 European countries with estimates of PM2.5 pollution from 2004 to 2022.Using models that account for an expected lag in deaths, they found exposure to wildfire smoke increased the risk of death in the following week.For every extra microgram of PM2.5 fouling 1 cubic metre of air, they found that all-cause mortality rose by 0.7%, respiratory mortality went up by 1% and cardiovascular mortality rose by 0.9%.“The results are concerning, considering that wildfires and other extreme events are increasing exponentially with climate change,” said Prof Antonio Gasparrini, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study.Devastating blazes compounded by relentless heat have killed several people across southern Europe and the Balkans in recent weeks. But deaths from the toxic fumes released by the fires are likely to go unnoticed.“Smoke can affect populations far away from the fires,” said Tonne. “So many more people will be exposed to smoke than the immediate physical threat of the flames.”The researchers said the study was limited by the lack of variability in the data on exposure to fire-related particulate matter, which made it harder to estimate how people’s health responded based on age and sex. They were also unable to “completely disentangle” the health burden of fire-related PM2.5 from ozone, another pollutant released by wildfires, though they said estimates were largely consistent when they adjusted the main model for ozone from all sources.Toxic pollution from wildfires creeps into the homes of more than 1 billion people a year, astudyfound in May. It concluded that air purifiers were an effective but expensive solution to indoor air pollution, which can be nearly three times higher on wildfire days than normal days, even when all windows and doors are closed.The risk of fire weather has risen as greenhouse gas emissions have heated the planet and dried out vegetation in some regions. The Iberian peninsula has been hit particularly hard this year, with Spain and Portugal accounting for the bulk of Europe’s burned area.Associate professor Victor Resco de Dios, a forestry engineer at the University of Lleida, said the fire belt would move north in the coming years and decades.“What we are witnessing now will sooner or later occur also in central and northern Europe, where we have also seen an aggravation of the fire problem,” he said. “This is not a Mediterranean problem, but a European one.”Explore more on these topicsWildfiresAir pollutionClimate crisisEuropeExtreme weatherHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

He was arrested on arrival at Gatwick.In May, he was handed a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence at Lewes crown court after being found guilty of one count of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual assault.His victim, who has maintained her anonymity and is referred to as Kelly, has been denied a payout through the criminal injuries compensation scheme because the incident happened on a plane that was not registered in Britain.The law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Kelly, has written to the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, urging her to close what it believes is a gap in the law.Kelly, who is in her 20s and from London, said: “I do not understand why I, and other victims like me, have been excluded from the CIC scheme.“I was attacked on a flight en route to the UK, I am a UK citizen, and this crime was investigated and prosecuted by British authorities.“I should be entitled to compensation, and being excluded from the scheme is unfair and illogical. I am still suffering with the effects of the attack and want to move forward with my life.”The Civil Aviation Act was updated in 1996 to ensure criminal acts on foreign planes bound for the UK can be prosecuted in UK criminal courts.Claire Powell, a solicitor at Leigh Day, said: “Our client suffered an horrific sexual attack on a UK-bound flight. She was refused compensation under the criminal injuries compensation scheme simply because it was a foreign flight and the rules have not been amended in line with the updates to the Civil Aviation Act.“It is a gap that needs closing urgently and we trust the justice secretary will agree, particularly in light of this government’s commitment to addressing violence against women and girls.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with this victim, and we remain resolute in our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade. The rules that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority follows, and the values of payments for injuries, are set by parliament.“Other routes are available for victims to receive support.”Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultUK criminal justiceAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

It requires steady hands, long-term commitment and a depth of understanding. What it has been given instead is instability, poor judgment, and revolving-door appointments.“At a time when Leicestershire needs stability, vision, and experienced leadership more than ever, residents are being served a plate of chaos. Reform promised change, what they’re delivering is a shambles.”A Reform UK source said: “Joseph deserves thanks for his role in helping to establish the Reform group at Leicestershire county council and we wish him well as he moves into a new role where he will continue to support the group’s efforts at County Hall.”Reform won 25 out of the 55 seats on the council and formed a minority administration after the local elections in May, seizing control from the Tories.Boam was not the youngest Reform councillor with a senior county council position. In Warwickshire county council, 19-year-old George Finch is leader.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

As many as 2 million people attend the second-biggest street festival in the world every year, held on the August bank holiday weekend.In his letter sent to the NGOs and charities, Rowley acknowledged that previous use of the technology at the carnival in 2016 and 2017 did not build public confidence. The Met’s former facial recognition system, which has since been improved, incorrectly identified 102 people as potential suspects and led to no arrests.“Since then, we’ve made considerable progress. The current version of the algorithm is significantly improved, has undergone independent testing and validation, and now performs to a much higher standard,” Rowley said.He said the technology would target the “small minority” who commit serious crimes including violence and sexual offences.In 2024 there were 349 arrests made at the event, including for homicide, rape, possession of weapons, and other violence-related and sexual offences, Rowley said.“Together, these offences represent a threat to public safety and all those who seek to enjoy carnival safely. Our use of LFR is part of a much broader strategy to locate, disrupt, and deter the minority who pose such risks.”Civil liberty groups have called on the Met to drop the use of LFR cameras after a high court challenge was launched last month by the anti-knife campaigner Shaun Thompson. Thompson, a Black British man, was wrongly identified by LFR as a criminal, held by police, and then faced demands from officers for his fingerprints.Rowley’s letter did not address Thompson’s challenge but dismissed claims that the police were operating without a legal framework. “The Equality Act 2010 places a legal obligation on public authorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination,” he wrote, adding that the European convention on human rights, and data protection laws, also covered LFR technology.Responding to Rowley’s letter, Rebecca Vincent, the interim director of the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: “With no legislation governing live facial recognition, no governmental framework as promised by the home secretary, and a crucial judicial review pending, why the rush to accelerate use of this Orwellian technology? We’re meant to operate on the basis of ‘policing by consent’, yet no one has consented to this, and certainly not the attendees of this cultural celebration.“We all want criminals off the streets, but turning carnival into a mass police lineup is not the way to do it.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Trump had weighed in to accuse Britain of behaving like China, telling the prime minister, Keir Starmer: “You can’t do this”.Neither theHome Officenor Apple are commenting on the alleged agreement, which Gabbard said meant the UK was no longer demanding that Apple “provide a ‘backdoor’ that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties”.The transatlantic row began when theHome Office issued a “technical capability notice” to Appleunder the Investigatory Powers Act, which requires companies to assist law enforcement in providing evidence. Apple responded by launching a legal challenge, which the Home Office demanded be kept secret but judges ordered be made public.The US vice-president, JD Vance, also complained saying: “I don’t want American citizens to be spied on.” He said it was “crazy” that “we’re creating a backdoor in our own technology networks that our enemies are now using”.Civil liberties groups cautioned that the backdoor would put politicians, campaigners and minority groups at particular risk of being targeted.In February,Apple responded by withdrawingthe option for its new British customers to enable advance data protection options, saying it was “deeply disappointed” and would never build a backdoor into any of its products. That meant, uniquely, many UK customers were unable to benefit from end-to-end encryption of services, including the iCloud Drive, photos, notes or reminders, making them more vulnerable to data breaches.Gabbard said: “Over the past few months, I’ve been working closely with our partners in the UK, alongside President Trump and Vice-President Vance, to ensure Americans’ private data remains private and our constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected.”It is not clear whether the technical capability notice requiring the data access would be withdrawn altogether or altered. It could in theory be limited to allowing access to the data only of UK citizens, although experts cautioned that could be technologically unrealistic. It also raises the danger that other foreign governments could still find a way to use the backdoor.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We have long had joint security and intelligence arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats, such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in enabling those threats.”It added: “Those arrangements have long contained safeguards to protect privacy and sovereignty: for example the data access agreement includes critical safeguards to prevent the UK and US from targeting the data of each other’s citizens. We will continue to build on those arrangements and we will also continue to maintain a strong security framework to ensure that we can continue to pursue terrorists and serious criminals operating in the UK. We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe.”The UK-US data access agreement allows UK agencies to submit requests for content of communications directly to communications service providers, including social media platforms and messaging services, in the US, but this must be for the purpose of investigating, preventing, detecting, and prosecuting serious crime, officials said.Apple was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAppleComputingEncryptionHome OfficeTrump administrationUS politicsPrivacynewsShareReuse this content"

They were then deported to Ecuador. The Intercept cited phone-tracking evidence that had been shared with the publication and was later seen by the Guardian.The evidence corroborates the account of a source with knowledge of hotel operations in Alexandria, who told the Guardian that they believed the venue had been used to detain immigrant families and unaccompanied children since it was renovated in late 2023. The source observed Ice contractors known to assist in the transfer of unaccompanied minors operating at the Sheraton as recently as June of this year.The source added that other hotels in the area have also been used to hold immigrant families.It is not clear whether Marriott has a formal contract with Ice or what the company knows about Ice’s use of the Sheraton in Alexandria. Inone case that emerged last year, Marriott sued a New York-based franchise after the hotel entered a partnership with the city for it to be used as an immigrant shelter, saying it had done so without Marriott’s consent.Marriott did not respond to several requests for comment.“It would be highly unfortunate if major hotel chains are facilitating the Trump administration’s cruel policy of deporting families,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.In 2019, duringDonald Trump’s first term, Marriottrejected the ideathat any of its hotels or properties – which include Sheraton and Courtyard hotels – would be used by Ice to detain immigrants. It made the statement at a time when theTrump administrationwas calling for a mass roundup of undocumented immigrants. Citing anonymous sources, ABC News reported at the time that administration officials had internally discussed the possibility that they might need hotel rooms because of limited capacity at Ice detention centers.“Our hotels are not configured to be detention facilities, but to be open to guests and community members as well. While we have no particular insights into whether the US government is considering the use of hotels to aid in the situation at the border, Marriott has made the decision to decline any requests to use our hotels as detention facilities,” a company spokesperson said in July 2019, according to ABC News.The company’s position won it plaudits at the time, such aspublic recognitionby the American Historical Association, an association of professional historians, which announced in a public statement that it appreciated Marriott’s “principled stand” and noted the importance of immigrants to the hotel and related industries.It is well-documented that Ice does use hotels to house immigrant families who are being deported from the US or being transferred to other detention centers.In a case that attractednational attention in April, Ice detained two families in Louisiana with three of their US citizen children and held them incommunicado and under guard at a hotel for days on end, despite multiple attempts by family members and lawyers to contact them.The families, along with their US citizen children, were deported in the early hours of 25 April and, according to legal filings, had been held at a location in Alexandria.Filings in that case reviewed by the Guardian includea short, handwritten submission by one of the mothers writtenon paper that closely matches images of branded Sheraton notepadsposted online. The Guardian could not independently confirm whether the families had been detained at the Sheraton in Alexandria.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pair were then reportedly flown toLouisianaand “locked up” in the Sheraton hotel, where they stayed for four days without access to their phones or the internet.“We couldn’t call or go on the web to ask for help,” Roger told the Intercept. “Without our phones, we didn’t know any names or phone numbers.”Ice did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s questions about the agency’s use of the Sheraton, including whether it has a contract with the hotel or uses it on an ad hoc basis.The hospitality industry is especially vulnerable to Ice raids and the Trump administration’s deportation program, given thehigh percentage of workers in the industry who are undocumented.While the Department of Homeland Security issued guidance earlier this year that Ice agents were not to conduct raids at hotels, restaurants and farms, that guidance was later reversed, according toa June report in the Washington Post. About 34% of housekeepers, 24% of cooks and 20% of waitstaff employed by the US hotel industry is undocumented, according to the 2023 census.Additional reporting by Maanvi SinghDo you have a tip on this story?

While Somalia has improved vaccination rates in recent years, the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) blames the uptick in cases on persisting immunisation gaps.Abdulrazaq Yusuf Ahmed, the director of Demartino public hospital in the capital, Mogadishu, said: “The number of recorded cases of children sick with diphtheria has increased across the regions in the whole country. We have received about 49 patients in the whole of 2024 but this year, 2025, we have received 497 diphtheria cases during the last four months alone.”Deaths had risen from 13 to 42, according to a report by Ahmed’s hospital this month. The report described the resurgence of diphtheria as “one of the most urgent and dangerous threats to public health”.Earlier this month, the health ministry said it had recorded 1,616 cases and 87 deaths from the disease so far this year.MSF’s Somalia medical coordinator, Frida Athanassiadis, said: “We are seeing a rapid increase in diphtheria among children under 15 in central Somalia,” adding that they accounted for roughly 97% of cases. “Low vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy and poor living conditions are driving the spread.”Athanassiadis said that in some medical centres the basic resources were “insufficient to cope with rising caseloads”.MSF said while teams initially had a small emergency stock of the antitoxin, it had now been exhausted, with the health ministry and the World Health Organization helping to distribute the “limited available stock based on needs”.In July, Save the Children warned that since April cases of measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera and severe respiratory infections in Somalia had doubled from roughly 22,600 to more than 46,000. About 60% of the cases were children under five, it said.“The sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases is linked to the recent aid cuts, which have impacted the health system’s capacity to deliver essential services, including routine immunisation, and to treat and run catch-up campaigns to increase the immunity necessary to halt the outbreak,” the NGOsaid.In Mogadishu, one resident, Abdiwahid Ali, said: “Many children in my neighbourhood are sick, some of them hospitalised.”Anab Hassan, a grocer, said people were concerned about the outbreak. “A friend of mine lost a five-year-old daughter who was diagnosed with diphtheria, and several others told me their children are sick and coughing,” she said. “We hear about children getting sick every day.”Explore more on these topicsSomaliaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Las Vegas outlet8NewsNow reportedthat Alexandrovich chatted with an officer posing as a teenager online before being arrested.“The sexual contact included bringing a condom and taking the decoy to ‘Cirque du Soleil’,” which stages elaborate shows along theLas VegasStrip, said police documents seen by 8NewsNow.Details of the arrest came as the state department denied the US government played any role in releasing the Israeli official – after Alexanderovich was able to return toIsraelonce he had bonded out of jail in connection with the felony charge.A swarm of commentary online, propelled in part by Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, speculated that Alexanderovich had been shielded by the government at a time when theTrump administrationhas been struggling to contain criticism over unfulfilled promises to release all files related to the prosecution of the late, disgraced financier and convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein.“The Department of State is aware that Tom Artiom Alexandrovich, an Israeli citizen, was arrested in Las Vegas and given a court date for charges related to soliciting sex electronically from a minor,” the state departmentwrote on X.“He did not claim diplomatic immunity and was released by a state judge pending a court date. Any claims that the US government intervened are false.”That statement came after Greene, who has recently broken with the White House over Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, questioned Alexandrovich’s case on Monday,claimingthat the government had “release[d] a child sex predator from Israel who works directly under the prime minister of Israel”,Benjamin Netanyahu.Abramovich was arrested as he arrived at an agreed-upon location for the meet-up, 8NewsNow reported. He told police he believed he was chatting with an 18-year-old.“Alexandrovich stated he felt the girl ‘pushed’ him to talk about bringing a condom, yet could not remember how many times the girl ‘pushed’ him,” police documents seen by 8NewsNow said.“Alexandrovich stated he was embarrassed for being arrested.”Court records reviewed by Reuters show a $10,000 bond was posted in Alexandrovich’s case at the Henderson detention center, south-east of Las Vegas, on 7 August. The records indicate he is due back in court on 27 August.A post on Israel’s government website from November describes Alexandrovich as the “head of the Technological Defense Division at the INCD [Israel National Cyber Directorate]”. A screenshot on Alexanderovich’s LinkedIn page, first reportedby Mediaite, describes him as the same. A post on Alexandrovich’s page alluded to his having been in Las Vegas earlier in August for the Black Hat Briefings, a yearly meeting of cybersecurity professionals.“Two things you can’t escape at Black Hat 2025: the relentless buzz of generative [artificial intelligence] and the sound of Hebrew … in every corridor,” Alexandrovich wrote in part in an accompanying post. Invoking an abbreviation for large language models and referring to one of Israel’s largest cities, the post continued: “The key takeaway? The future of cybersecurity is being written in code, and it seems a significant part of it is being authored in #TelAviv and powered by LLMs. An exciting time to be in the field!”That LinkedIn page under Alexandrovich’s name has since beendeleted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Israeli news site Ynetreportedthat Alexandrovich was on leave from the Cyber Directorate by “mutual decision”.Alexanderovich was among eight men in an operation led by Nevada’s internet crime against children taskforce.All of the suspects believed they were meeting minors when undercover officers instead confronted and arrested them, police said.The arrested men were all brought to jail after being detained, said the statement from the Las Vegas metropolitan police department, which participated in the operation alongside local, state and federal law enforcement officials.Among the other suspects was Las Vegas Redemption church pastor Neal Harrison Creecy, 46, 8NewsNowreported. Creecy reportedly believed he would meet a 14-year-old boy when he was arrested, and he resigned after posting a $10,000 bond for his release from jail.Under Nevadalaw, luring a child with a computer for a sex act can carry between one to 10 years in prison.Ramon Antonio Vargasand Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsLas VegasNevadaUS crimeIsraelMarjorie Taylor GreeneTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The opposition conservative People’s party (PP) has accused Sánchez of touting the pact as a means to deflect criticism of what it claims has been his poor handling of the crisis.“State pacts don’t put out the flames, nor do they restore what’s been lost,” a PP spokesperson said on Monday. “People were expecting a lot more than a smokescreen designed to save his reputation after he’d gone missing for a week.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which, given the function of a poster, doesn’t bode well for the marketing of my new standup hour. The festival has almost 4,000 shows, all jostling for attention, so bringing promotional material to the city this month can feel like chucking wads of cash into the sea.This year, my show is calledMy Apologies to the Chef, so I’ve gone with a photo in which I’m doing a kooky grin as my head is served on a silver platter under a cloche. Hilarious stuff, yes, but I feel apprehensive about the theme – largely because my show includes no mention of chefs or catering. Registration for the fringe typically happens around March, when a show might have included a large section about restaurants, for example, which has since been removed. It’s how you end up with an aesthetic that is far more culinary than is ideal.View image in fullscreenUnder the cloche … Alfie Packham’s poster for My Apologies to the Chef.Photograph: Rebecca Need-MenearThe other issue is that grin. Goofy faces on standup comedy posters are passe, I’m told. It’s all about moody lighting and nonchalant poses these days. One of the poster designers behind this cool trend isJonny Woolley.“I have always had a pet peeve for comedians doing funny faces on their posters,” he says. “It’s always been such a turn-off for me.”Oh, no.“When I started making posters nearly a decade ago, no comedy posters looked cool,” says Woolley. “And I was really influenced by album art and movie posters. I hate when comedy posters are just goofy. There are so many posters of comedians sitting on the toilet. I’m interested in trying to make art for the posters that feels like it could be a more longstanding representation of that show.”Woolley, who is also a co-founder of the clown ensembleStamptown, is interested in lending a “legitimacy” to the art of comedy through his designs. In parliament this month, a select committee of MPs called upon the government torecognise live comedy as an art form. As comedy is becoming more businesslike, apparently so is its marketing.One of Woolley’s clients this year is the musical comedianJordan Gray, who Jonny tells me is “very hands on” in the design of her posters. Gray wanted her photo (shot byDylan Woodley) to match her on stage persona – an image of unbridled rock star ego.“I like having a stupid title and a picture that makes you think that I’m very, very serious about this,” Gray says. “That lack of self-awareness is quite funny.”View image in fullscreen‘I was influenced by album art and movie posters’ … some of Jonny Woolley’s designs for Edinburgh shows this year.Composite: Jonny WoolleyMichael Julings, another prolific fringe poster designer, says simplicity is key to standing out at the fringe. So many posters are cluttered with stars, quotes, QR codes and subtitles. While you might think these accolades would sell tickets, it really creates a kind of “patchwork effect” when the posters are presented together, he says.Every year, the effort to stand out results in small, random coincidences. This year, stand-ups Alex Kitson, Daniel McKeon and Aaron Wood all use Post-it notes as a visual motif in their publicity photos. Two years ago, Julings recalls, six different acts’ posters included dogs for some reason.“The busier it is, the more it fades,” says Julings. “A good example of this is the most ubiquitous design of last summer, which is the green Charli xcxBrat album cover. I remember seeing all the Mercury nominees in a grid, with all this beautiful artwork that’s been made independent of each other. But the only one that stands out is the block of green.”It’s hard to equate selling 50 tickets to a fringe show with a multimillion-pound marketing campaign, but the Brat influence can be seen on the streets of Edinburgh this year. An obvious example is Ivo Graham’sdirect parody, which says “Ivo” in the same typography with an orange background. Meanwhile, Vittorio Angelone has used text-only billboards to coax passersby with the slogan: “Vittorio Angelone has always denied any involvement in the Edinburgh fringe.”View image in fullscreen‘The busier it is, the more it fades’ … posters by Michael Julings for Edinburgh this year.Composite: Michael JulingsFashionable music marketing appears to be a growing influence on the fringe and the comedy industry in general. This is reflected in the rise of comedy nights such as Adam Flood’s Late NightComedyRave; Ivo Graham’s DJ sets featuring comedian guests; and Jack Shep’s London comedy night, Wanting to Be Cool, Having to Be Funny. (I am devastated to report that I have not performed at any of these.)But unlike musicians, comedians don’t seem to mind hiring the same designers and photographers as each other. “Which is good for me,” says Julings. “Unfortunately, I think it’s because of the financial margins and the money that’s being spent at the fringe and the gamble that’s being made.” Performers spend hundreds or thousands of pounds hiring photographers, designers and booking advertising space with Out of Hand, the festival’s main outdoor advertising provider. “Everybody’s looking at each other saying, I don’t want to be the one to do something wrong.”I can relate to this. I ask Jonny what he thinks of my poster this year, which was photographed byRebecca Need-Menearand designed by my sister,Robyn Packham, who gave me a 15% discount.“I think it came out great!” he says.Phew. Maybe I am cool after all.Alfie Packham: My Apologies to the Chef is atUnderbelly, Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)PostersDesignEdinburgh festivalTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He buzzed the door and said: “Is Paul there?” There was a new person working in our office at the time, and she said: “No, no one’s in at the minute. Who’s calling?” He said: “It’sTerence Stamp.” And then she was like: “Well, he’s not here, shall I leave a message?” She didn’t invite him up or anything. She left him standing there. And he didn’t give a shit about that, to be honest.Me, Terence and Gemma Arterton, who played the music teacher in Song for Marion, went to lunch at a vegan cafe in Shoreditch. His character, Arthur, was someone who loved his wife (played by Vanessa Redgrave), and would do anything for her, but always moaned, was always cantankerous, and found it very difficult to show any form of love to his son.He was someone who I based on my grandad, and bits of my dad. When his wife dies, it’s Gemma’s character who brings him out of his shell a bit, and encourages him to sing.We were talking about this character and he looked at me like I was talking in French. I stopped and said: “Well, you can always just wing it.” He went, “Yeah, let’s wing it.”Working with him, I learned that veteran actors do like to be talked to, in terms of being directed. I also learned, without him telling me, that he had insecurities as well. When I met him, the first thing he said was: “I’m only going to do one take. That’s it.” But then when you got to know him, he was like, “Oh, don’t be silly.” He had his bravado.But he was a very underrated, very understated actor. When he sang Lullabye by Billy Joel in the film, he broke everyone. It was obviously very good, but it was so sad.View image in fullscreen‘When he sang, it broke everyone’ … Terence Stamp in Song for Marion.Photograph: Steel Mill Pictures/AllstarAs a kid, I loved him as the baddie in the amazing Superman and Superman II. He’s good at frustration. He punches his hands in rage at one point. When we were shooting Song for Marion, I remember him coming over to give me a massage, because I’d said my back was sore. I’ve never been in more pain in my life. He was not the most tender of men.Terence was super, super fit. During filming, I went to the apartment where he was staying. He had this set of rotating press-up handles. They’re on the ground, and you put your hands on them, and as you go, you can turn them. He said: “Go on, do one.” I was like, “Fucking hell, I don’t know if I can.” He did loads, and I did one. I was in the peak of health, about 39 years old. He was 74 when he did Song for Marion.He was so healthy. He didn’t drink. He didn’t do any bad stuff at all. He was supposed to eat a chocolate bar in the film, and we had to swap it for a carob date bar, otherwise he wouldn’t touch it.We always used to go to a place on Berwick Street for tea – a herbal tea, because I thought he’d really like that. He had this blue carrier bag with him. In it, he had his script and a load of raw beetroot and carrots. He said: “I’m going to make a wicked salad: beetroot, carrot, that’s it. A bit of vinegar – gorgeous.” That’s what I remember.When we made Song for Marion, he was obviously still known. He had just done The Adjustment Bureau, and he had done Steven Soderbergh’s The Limey, which wasn’t a massive hit, but it was a really respected film. I didn’t expect him to like this kind of script, because it was more commercial in terms of the story itself. But we talked about the fact that it reminded him very much of the relationship he had with his father. The troubles he had with his dad were not dissimilar to his relationship with Christopher Eccleston in the film. There was a jealousy of the mum’s attention.We were the closing night film at the Toronto film festival. Terence was there, and behind him was his younger brother, Chris, who had managed the Who. Chris was crying his eyes out, and Terence was very comforting towards him, because they recognised their old man.He did like to talk about himself. I’ll give him that. He would always go on about how big guys in gyms would beg him to say: “Kneel before Zod.” He told me, obviously, about going off to India, about how he was absolutely broke and he had to borrow coins to call his agent to find out about Superman. He’d tell stories about him and Jim Morrison. The thing is, he did have an amazingly interesting life.He was low-key, but when he put a suit on, he looked good. He is possibly the best looking man I’ve worked with. My old drama teacher came to our screening at the London film festival, and the first thing he said to her was that she had wonderful shoes. She’s still dining out on that.He was the most charming grump I’ve ever met. He was great to work with, but he was such a moaner. Then he would smile, and you’d think, he knew what he was doing.Explore more on these topicsTerence StampfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dressed in a red raincoat with short dark hair and a wry smile, Elle’s character is very much reminiscent of Jordana Bevan in Richard Ayoade’s 2010 film Submarine, as is the dry sardonic humour peppered into the script. Leonard and Elle’s exchanges are awkward yet sweet, teetering on the edge of a true connection. That is, until Elle doesn’t show up to work one day and reports of a missing person trickle through the town. The hotel staff are rattled by Elle’s disappearance and when news breaks that her body has been found, this chilling bereavement subtly upends their lives.Misper (an abbreviated term used by the police to refer to a missing person) is stylistically compelling in its atmosphere building. There is an unsettling sense of staleness that runs throughout the film, characterised by the beige, stained walls of the old-timey, mostly vacant hotel, and Leonard’s expression, which is permanently set in a sunken, shell-shocked gaze. “I feel like I’m in a horror film,” he says, as he attempts to schedule an appointment with a therapist over the phone.This empty hotel is a prime site for horror and although Misper dabbles in the genre with some nightmarish flashes of Elle haunting Leonard after her death, it doesn’t go all the way. Nor does it follow the pathway of a crime drama, refusing to offer up the salacious details of Elle’s death in the true crime manner (though there a brief yet frightening visit by a “fan” of the dead girl). The nature of Elle’s murder and the profile of her killer are pushed into the periphery. What is at the forefront is the bafflement, melancholy and looming sense of dread that the hotel staff are faced with as they attempt to grapple with a return to normality.In the film’s final moments, a crew is shooting a crime drama series based on the events of Elle’s death and disappearance, six months after it happened. The bleak misery remains but drifts into the eeriness of the uncanny.Misper screened at the Edinburgh film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsDrama filmsHorror filmsEdinburgh film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

She’s played by an in-house Netflix star, he’s played by a non-American actor known for his role in a hit TV show. The film is based on a novel and is premiering on a streaming platform this month. While this might not be dramatically similar enough to become a Dante’s Peak/Volcano situation, it’s hard not to watch Amazon’s The Map That Leads to You, out this week, and frequently think about Netflix’s loosely similarMy Oxford Year, released at the start of August.My Oxford Year review – so-so Netflix romance trades on anglophiliaRead moreWhat immediately separates the two, and often separates Netflix and Amazon movies in general, is the aesthetic. My Oxford Year is every bit a TV movie while The Map That Leads to You is as glossy and sweeping as one deserving of a big screen release. That’s both the Jeff Bezos budget bump but also the benefit of having a director like Lasse Hallström at the helm. The Oscar-nominated Swedish film-maker was once Hollywood’s master of the middlebrow movie, behind Sunday afternoon specials like Chocolat and The Cider House Rules. But it’s his later Nicholas Sparks adaptations Dear John and Safe Haven that made him the ideal choice here, smoothly guiding an adaptation of JP Monninger’s sappy 2017 novel The Map That Leads to You (the book is even adorned by a Sparks quote).Trusty hands help in making the film feel grander especially when the emotion of the story, adapted by Dante’s Peak’s Les Bohem andDon’t Make Me Go’sVera Herbert, can’t quite get us there.We meet Heather (Madelyn Cline) and her two friends as they near the final stretch of their Eurotrip, perfectly bullet pointed to the final detail. Heather is a type A over-thinker, whose Notes app schedule for her post-graduation and pre-first job in the city hurrah did not include having a meet-cute with Jack (Riverdale’s KJ Apa), a handsome New Zealander and fellow Ernest Hemingway fan. He’s everything she isn’t – impulsive and unplanned – and she finds herself changing her plan, and herself, as the pair start to fall in love.Apa is a likable enough actor but he struggles to sell a lot of Jack’s manic pixie dream boy shtick, blandly insisting on the power of living in the moment and saying things like: “I really believe that your thoughts help create your future,” with a straight face. The film’s reheated messaging about the importance of following heart over head is ultimately a sneaky way to push the female lead off her course and on to his, as she relinquishes control to let him lead the way. Their jaunt around Europe, now on his terms, is a simple, seductive watch less for their burgeoning relationship, although they have decently sparky chemistry, and more for the crisply captured scenery, a lush and transporting late summer trip for us stuck at home, from Spain to Portugal to Italy and so on. Hallström knows exactly how to make his films look and feel delectable and at a time of ongoing streamer tinniness, it’s a pleasure to be led by someone who truly knows where he’s going.It’s just a shame that we’re being led somewhere so familiar. Not just because My Oxford Year recently took us there too (the “reveal” is almost identical) but because so many romantic dramas have taken us there before. Both films try to avoid the standard cliches that come with the territory but neither manages anything truly new or, more importantly, poignant enough to bring the tears that should be cascading by the finale. Cline, as she recently showed in theI Know What You Did Last Summer sequel, is an incredibly engaging young star but one hopes her career leads her somewhere more unconventional next.The Map That Leads to You is available onAmazon Prime Videoon 20 AugustExplore more on these topicsRomance filmsAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the bitter cold of a winter’s night on theYorkshireDales, two men dig a hole in the frozen earth to bury a body. The pair are illegal migrants; so too is the dead man. His funeral comes at the end of a long night of the soul in this confident debut from Jack King, handsomely shot in black and white. It’s set in the world of dodgy carwashes, exploited workers dressed in hoodies and joggers, hands chilled to the bone. But the message is not overtly political, not straightforwardly social realist.It begins strongly, tense and edgy, in aBradfordcarwash. Tudor Cucu-Dumitrescu is brilliant as Cristi, a young Romanian man who manages the place, answering only to the nasty-looking boss Zully. The dead man (Mo’min Swaitat) has taken his own life after being accused of stealing a Rolex by a customer; Cristi doesn’t want to get the police involved so he tells the new Kurdish guy, Yusef (Erdal Yildiz), to help dispose of the body. This is all sharply observed – though a couple of details niggled me, like who leaves a super-valuable watch in their car while getting it hand-washed?‘Not the tea-cosy Yorkshire’: the film about carwash workers showing the dark side of the DalesRead moreWith the body in the back of a white van as Cristi and Yusef drive out into the Dales, The Ceremony becomes a kind of road movie. In the stark monochrome photography, the landscape is menacing and hostile. The camera often lingers on the men’s faces, like portrait photography. Cristi wants to dump the body, but Yusef insists on a burial, so they wait until nightfall. At this point, as the film becomes more ruminative, it does start to sag; there’s one dream sequence too many and far too much screen time given to a ram, as magnificent as he is. It’s a slightly unsatisfactory conclusion to an impressive film.The Ceremony is in UK cinemas from 22 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBradfordYorkshirereviewsShareReuse this content"

Not from a cursory glance at her bibliography, perhaps: in that time Hall has published six other novels and three volumes of extraordinary short stories. But in every other way, and the moment you begin reading.There’s the subject, for starters. Ever since the first paragraph of her first novel,Haweswater, in which an early 20th-century man drives his horse and cart through the waters of a Cumbrian valley recently drowned by a dam, Hall has been concerned with landscape, with weather, with nature in all its forms, with the ways in which we affect each other. InThe Carhullan Army, climate change has already happened. Cumbria is semi-tropical, temperate England a folk memory; a dystopian vision that feels, this baked summer, uncomfortably close to reality.The Wolf Border, published in 2015, was, among many other things, about the ethics and unpredictabilities of rewilding an apex predator, while Hall’s last novel,Burntcoat, written in the first lockdown, was set in and after a pandemic. Her story Later, His Ghost is set in a perpetual windstorm of total climate breakdown; in One in Four, a virologist writes to his wife, apologising for getting things wrong. In this new novel, weather and climate are not just potent settings but the main event. The central character in Helm is the Helm, Britain’s only named wind.This wind, which is local to Cumbria, occurs when air sweeping down Cross Fell, above the Eden valley, creates both acrest and a low bar of cloud. “Tricky to explain/visualise”, admits Helm. “For now, imagine a skater launching off a quarter pipe two thousand feet high, then somersaulting. Again. And again and again.” As the book begins, Helm witnesses its own arrival. An ice age, sun flares, ash cloud; and, relatively insignificant in the context of such deep time, the evolution of humanity. Because there are many people in the novel, too, which is structured by braiding their stories with Helm’s, but also with lists: the forces of Helm, for instance, which range from “0. Zero Helm (complete calm). Mean wind speed < 1mph. Weathervanes and trees unmoving, grass still, water as mirror, smoke rising vertically from roundhouses/cottages/plague pyres” to “12. Hurricane Helm (Hand of God). Wind speed 73-83mph, phenomenal damage and widescale loss of life, Eden reconfigured biblically, Carlisle-Settle train lifted off the tracks, history made, FIN.”Other lists include names for Helm and the damage Helm can wreak; or the trinkets Helm collects, often after that damage (Howdah pistol, iron skullcap, Apple iPhone 11 64GB, Tornado F3 series, eject pin). The pictures humans make, trying to understand, locate, corral Helm. Helm finds people amusing, and watches as they succeed each other; Hall’s ambition may be bounded by one valley, but it reaches through thousands of years. Her subjects range from a neolithic tribe to a medieval exorcist; from an isolated 18th-century wife to a quixotic Victorian meteorologist; from a wind-touched, lonely mid-20th-century child to a present-day academic counting plastic particles in the air. From stone tools to the Industrial Revolution to the advent of AI, each era has its own existential encounters with Helm: as deity or devil, as a psychological or a scientific mystery. Both sides are made complacent by Helm’s longevity, size and power, by human smallness and briefness, neither realising, until perhaps too late, that these little beings threaten Helm’s own existence.We move from a neolithic world interpreted through animal behaviour to the bathos of the 21st centuryA project of this scope, which requires a range of research and imagination that could have produced several historical novels, not to mention an entire other volume of meteorological expertise, holds so much in suspension around its whirling, windy core that it could easily blow apart. But, despite the occasional threat or lull, Helm doesn’t. Partly, I would argue, this is because of Hall’s development as a consummate short story writer. Her novels are never less than hugely accomplished, but the narrative demands of the longer form, especially in more conventional earlier work, can sometimes dissipate the blaze of which she is capable. Hall is freed by the constraints of the short story – like the female sculptor in her last novel, Burntcoat, she burns away everything extraneous – and her work only gains in concentrated, suggestive power. Each strand of Helm has this concentration; the characters and voices could stand alone, but they flow together into something deep and rich, held together by the Eden valley, and its Helm.And by the writing. Hall’s work on place, and especially this corner of England, has always been virtuosic, a tough and supple poetry anchored in decades of attention to Cumbrian land and plants and skies. In her first novels it sometimes threatened to submerge everything else, but in Helm is so embedded on the page that it’s easy to take for granted, until you pause and back up to really look at the “dirty, clay-slipped sky”, or a gaggle of Victorian children, born into the shantytown that grows up around the railway, collecting on a hillside to eat magic mushrooms and stare at the “silly jinking stars”.Every era in Helm has its own seeing; the same land, the same wind filtered through time-specific fears and hopes and work, time-specific knowings, from a neolithic world interpreted through animal behaviour to the bathos of 21st-century cycling waterproofs, pub menus, emails. Hall has a thrilling command of vocabulary, with the concurrent deployment of etymologies and the hinterlands they bring; words often work not as single notes, but as chords, big ideas slipping in on the wakes of concrete specificities. So NaNay, a neolithic girl, watches as the wind approaches: “In the centre it was blue-grey, like bull-hide, with the dull pearl-shine of scales at its edges. It was faceless and its body was its only government.” The “spectral gap” is a technical term of modern mathematics and quantum mechanics as well as meteorology. But what heft and metaphorical possibility such a gap has, when a retired policeman in a glider is required to fly into it.Above all it is the wind itself that holds this vastly ambitious, serious – but also often playful and ironic – book together. Some might find Helm’s voice initially a little arch, a little unplaced relative to the human voices, but it grows on you. Antic, needy, angry, curious, millennia-old Helm, who gives and takes, fascinates and awes, is feared and loved, and loves in return; who absorbs violences, propitiations, yearnings, and who is now beginning to feel “a bit wrong”. There has been so much change, over so many millennia, but this is different. “It’s complicated. Hard to put Helm’s fingers on it.” It isn’t that Helm is old, more that “Whatever is wrong … feels insidious, sneaky, infectious. The surprise disease on the routine tests. Some kind of weird intimate growth you find accidentally and go, Jesus, how long has that been there? A toxic waft when you’re asleep.

In the mid-20th century Helm searches for a young girl, his friend, who has been locked in an asylum, and, trying to look beyond the valley, “rises, higher, until being is difficult”. At the 21st-century meteorological observation post, 2,000ft up, Helm whips and churns and “calls to awful prayer”. A prayer for itself, perhaps, because whatever Hall’s intentions – an urgent rallying, a tribute, a warning – this novel reads like nothing so much as an elegy.Helm by Sarah Hall is published by Faber (£20).

And what happens when interest tips into obsession?Sukhdev SandhuTue 19 Aug 2025 04.01 EDTShareJames Delbourgo, a professor of history at Rutgers University, New Jersey, says that his latest work is less a book about collecting than it is about the “cultural idea” of collecting. Does this need illuminating? Hasn’t collecting long been seen as one of the more refined arts? A way for the educated and wealthy to show off their learning, taste, urbanity? Collectors escape the shackles of the present, throw lifelines to a disappearing past, replenish the future. Sure, says Delbourgo. But he is also interested in telling the story of how – through the ages and across continents, in the popular and sometimes political imagination – collectors have been seen as introverts and perverts, as thieves and predators, as enemies of the humanity and humanism they espouse.The major religions have always been suspicious about collecting, which they associate not with piety so much as idolatry. Why, their leaders thundered, would true believers worship objects rather than God? Artefacts – whether early coins featuring the image of Muhammad or golden and gemstone-encrusted statues of the Buddha – were inherently flawed for, as theologian John Calvin declared, “the finite cannot contain the infinite”. Yet images had the power to reach parts of illiterate societies that words alone never could. Churches invested in relics not only to attract donations and pilgrim-tourists, but to succour and solace parishioners in times of war or pestilence.Within living memory, idolatry was one of the accusations levelled at collectors during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. They were targeted as decadents, bourgeois, in thrall to a discredited past. Their homes were raided, their antiquities destroyed. Such scorn for history would have appalled the Chinese thinkers and poets who, in the 17th century, developed the concept ofpi, whose shifting meanings include hobby, craving, eccentricity, fetishism. But if it was an illness, it was one to be celebrated. A true gentleman, wrote Yuan Hongdao, “worries only about having no obsessions”. Collectors, it was believed, were brave, deep, devotional.Collecting is often assumed to be the preserve of men or man-boys. Notable exceptions include Egyptian pharaoh Hatshepsut and, in the 19th and 20th century, Isabella Stewart Gardner and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Women collectors, in the very act of acquiring things, are sometimes said to be betraying their gentle, nurturing, “female” essence. Women collectors, in the very act of acquiring things, are sometimes said to be betraying their gentle, nurturing, “female” essence. In the 17th century, Queen Christina of Sweden sought to make Stockholm the “Athens of the north”, asked Descartes to set up a scientific academy in the city and was open to alchemy and mysticism. None of this counted for much – she wore, they all sniggered, men’s clothes. She even refused to marry. Whether it’s Catherine the Great or Marie Antoinette, women’s appetite for objects has been portrayed as unbecoming, carnal, obscene.Delbourgo is at his liveliest when writing about collecting and empire. Those who sailed out into what they believed to be brave new worlds earned plaudits for advancing the frontiers of scientific knowledge. Long before the advent of postcolonial studies, they were also seen as looters and frackers. By removing the Parthenon marbles, lamented Byron, Lord Elgin had riven “what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared”. For the explorer and biologist Alfred Wallace, “The wealth and knowledge and culture of the few do not constitute civilization”.Every chapter of A Noble Madnessis its own cabinet of curiosities. Collecting has itself been collected – by novelists such as Oscar Wilde, John Fowles, Orhan Pamuk; film-makers Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock in Psycho; Sigmund Freud who thought collectors were displaced shaggers. Hokum? Delbourgo prefers such myths and storytelling to modern neuroscientists whose clinical explanations remind him of a lament by Charles Darwin: years of “grinding general laws out of large collections of facts”, wrote the naturalist, had led to “the atrophy of that part of his brain on which the higher tastes depend”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The PlayStation 5 had Astro’s Playroom, the Steam Deck had Aperture Desk Job, and for theNintendo Switch 2there’s Drag x Drive. Here, you play competitive wheelchair basketball with the Joy-Con 2’s new mouse mode (which lets you control a game by pushing it along a desk like a computer mouse) – rolling, jumping and shooting in hectic three v three bouts. A solid exhibition of a controller upgrade, to be sure, but Drag x Drive struggles to harness the high-octane nature of the real-world sport, instead delivering a shallow impersonation.As a basketball game, Drag x Drive demands that you spend the majority of your time shooting hoops and racing around the court, each Joy-Con controlling a single wheel on your avatar’s chair. Additionally, you can press the triggers to lift your wheels and jump, or raise each Joy-Con and flick to shoot your shot or pass the ball to a teammate.View image in fullscreenSpouts of joy … Drag x Drive.Photograph: NintendoAs cool as it sounds in theory, this doggedly practical approach isn’t as intuitive as you might expect, and, ironically, not very accessible either. It’s tough to find a comfortable position as you press and roll your palms, so it takes grit to truly master the control scheme. Still, if you can muscle through, there are rare spouts of joy to be found in hitting top speed, bashing into your opponents and taking possession of the ball.Some additional variety comes via the player styles menu, which allows you to jump between different presets based on your preferred approach. Alongside the balanced forward style, which splits your rebounding, strength and quickness skills evenly, the guard style sacrifices the other stats for a speed boost, and the centre position makes you slower but tougher. The ability to switch between styles helps smooth out the rocky onboarding process and allows you to freshen up the gameplay between online multiplayer matches, which are the key focus of the game.At a glance, Drag x Drive is reminiscent of vehicular football simulatorRocket League, with two teams battling it out to score points by pulling off trick shots and smashing into one another. However, where Rocket League excels with its litany of bouncy stadiums and explosive graphics, Drag x Drive attacks the genre with more restraint, trading atmospheric arenas for cold, metallic courts. There is some reprieve in the character customisation menu, where you can alter the colour of your wheels and chair, as well as choose cute headgear such as cat ears or old-timey driving goggles. But it’s a far cry from the warmth and esoteric vibrance that Nintendo is known for.Despite a lack of personality and wrist-cramping controls, there’s an adrenaline rush when players chase you that’s easy to get swept up in, especially when your momentum is dependent on your real-world stamina. There’s also a real sense of pride when you finally land a distance shot, or craft a witty assist. As your confidence grows, you’ll start to see the benefit of the half-pipes that flank the in-game court, allowing you to pull off wicked tricks and earn extra points. Suddenly, simple shots make way for flamboyant slam dunks, and you feel more like a pro.Nintendo Switch 2 review – more than good enoughRead moreBetween bouts of b-ball, there’s also a small pool of repetitive skill-honing side activities to engage with, including a skipping rope minigame, a shooting competition and an obstacle course. Excelling at these challenges and performing well in matches allows you to earn trophies, which unlock more cosmetics to jazz up your avatar’s aesthetic.Despite some efforts in meta-progression, it’s difficult to look past Drag x Drive’s most significant hurdle – that it’s uncomfortable to play for extended periods. The mouse controls are ingenious in theory, and when applied in small bouts, it feels like a novel prototype. But, in the context of such overtly active gameplay, the concept starts to fall apart. What remains is a surprisingly inaccessible sports game that lacks modal variety and a long-term hook. If you were hoping for a spiritual successor to the Nintendo Switch’s Rock ’Em Sock ’Em brawlerArms, you will be disappointed.Drag x Drive is available now, £16.99Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo Switch 2Sports gamesNintendo SwitchNintendoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Zainab Johnson’s maiden fringe set – although she’s already a big noise in the US – gives an account of how she came to own a firearm. It’s not an explicitly political show – if a show about gun ownership by a black,Muslim, Americanfemale is allowed to be anything but. But Toxically Optimistic does invite engagement with some searching questions about guns, their use, and the safety they supposedly ensure – even if, so poised is Johnson’s delivery, you barely notice it doing so.Hers is that particularly American style of standup that can feel too polished for UK tastes: smiling, slick and a little bit frictionless. If a British comedian tells a dating story, you can bet they’ll be the butt of the joke; when Johnson does, it’s to lord it over the short guy who wants but can’t have her. Small wonder she is, by her own account, an eternal optimist – even if that quality is now to be tested when a friend tells her, apropos of her buying her own house, that she should acquire a gun without delay.Liam Withnail: Big Strong Boy review – look back in laughter at misfit youthRead moreIs that so? Johnson resists, and keeps resisting, even when her friend drags her to a shooting range, even when she imagines the home invasion scenario that might make a gun worthwhile. She asks herself questions about fear, with reference to an odd anecdote about a homeless man and a “bucket of shit”, and about safety, which has arguably been secured, but at what cost?Delivered with authority by the Harlem comic, the tone is smooth and philosophical, with the safety catch coming off only occasionally – see the excellent joke explaining why she takes notes when out on a first date. The show’s final quarter pivots to a different subject entirely – and a less compelling one, too, notwithstanding that Johnson justifies it persuasively with a take-that reveal at the end. If you didn’t know she was armed and dangerous before, that fine flourish of an ending proves it.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalUS gun controlreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a neat parallel to the housing market, where properties are also getting smaller and more expensive. But Alin’s chief metaphor is the “lost art” of the house party – indicative of her generation’s financial crisis and a wider crack in social cohesion. There’s no space to throw a decent party or the would-be hosts can’t risk trashing their precarious, overpriced rentals or family homes.The argument is put across with brio and evident authenticity on a homely stage decorated with balloons, heart-shaped cushions and a cocktail shaker. Greatly at ease with the audience, Alin plays Skip (smart name for a show about constant upheaval), born and raised in ever-gentrifying east London where she lives with her mum. Skip hearts Hackney, it even says so on her T-shirt, but how have we reached the point where dying in the place you’re from may be an unreachable dream?Bitterness is shot through a predominantly buoyant show with some sparkling sequences: Skip fantasising about “white-pillared Georgians” and other desirable addresses; hitting up RightMove as if it’s PornHub; finding that the TV series Skins has sold her a lie, and likening house parties to oceans while nightclubs are swimming pools.View image in fullscreenAnalytical … House Party.Photograph: Ella MuirEasy gags about gentrification are rife at the Edinburgh fringe but instead Alin gives us an inside perspective and a longer view of familiar issues, anticipating the hollowing-out when gentrifiers move on. The show also occasionally veers into straight standup: “What do they call French windows in France?” But amid the bubbling humour, the threat of homelessness for Skip and her mum is a constant concern.Blaze FM review – high-energy history of pirate radio stationRead moreAlin repeatedly strikes the pose of an analyst, whether explaining why Miley Cyrus’s We Can’t Stop should be on every playlist or the function of house parties for the Windrush generation. It’s two years since Skip left drama school and she gives a lucid account of how her chosen profession is similarly weighted against her, also dominated by those benefiting from inherited wealth.A subplot about a friend who sleeps rough needs deepening, as do a couple of supporting characters. But Alin’s plotting displays a skilful sleight of hand and she has charisma to burn in a show packed with home truths about dispossession.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalTheatreFestivalsGentrificationreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s space too for quite-a-sticky-period comedy, a notch down on the scale of bad stuff that happens, but no less significant in the lives of those lucky enough to keep actual trauma at bay.That’s Liam Withnail’s mode in Big Strong Boy, which, from a vantage point of modest career success in his mid-30s, revisits a mild crisis weathered half a lifetime ago. In his unassuming hands, it takes the shape of a lovely story about misfit adolescence, family love, the guilt we carry – and redemption.Now resident in Edinburgh, Withnail transports us back to his youth in Dagenham, the support of whose tourist board he is unlikely be currying. In a town where, at least back then, homophobic abuse would follow on the slightest deviation from sartorial norm, young Liam does not fit in. He tries and fails to have a love affair with his “indie sleaze” soulmate. With his brother, he steals his dad’s Guinness, aged only seven, triggering a precocious alcohol habit. It spirals, he gets depressed, Dagenham starts feeling less dead end, more death sentence.The Ego review – tricksy stories from film sets and award ceremoniesRead moreNotwithstanding the volume of booze consumed, Withnail knows this is dramatic small beer. But it means a lot to him, to his mum, with her addiction to ALL CAPS text messages, and to his “leprechaun” dad. In an artfully structured show, directed by Jet Vevers, Withnail reconsiders this period in response to the question “Are you happy?”, which catches him cold. Was he then? Is he now? One of the story’s key players resurfaces in the present day, helping absolve our host’s guilt and make peace with the unwise teenager he once was.A churl may argue that the show’s charge by this point is more sentimental than comic. For my money, Withnail gets the balance right. Fine jokes about Grenade protein bars, generational reactions to comedy, and his parents’ indulgent child-rearing style keep the heart light in this tale of a teenager in panic, and his adult self letting him off the hook.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 August.

The performance has begun before the audience are given wristbands and enter the room. The stage is like a nightclub, a table filled with water cups to one side and a floor spotlight in the corner. Beneath an array of suspended tube lights, forming a kind of ramshackle roof, are three people lost in music: Oli Mathiesen, Lucy Lynch and Sharvon Mortimer. We are hearing Nocturbulous Behaviour by Detroit techno giant Suburban Knight. It is relentless, as are the dancers.For the next hour, you are seated spectators at a rave. The opening minutes seem impenetrable, as if the trio are surrounded by a force field, but your passivity melts away as the music shudders through us all and they respond to our whoops. Those screams disappear into a soundscape that includes sirens, punishing drums, insistent beats and otherworldly bleeps. The accompaniment is loud, heavy, an assault. But the dancers are incredibly light on their feet – butterflies who float while the music stings like a bee. They add a touch of humour, too, akin to Matteo Haitzmann’s similarly unremitting trio performanceMake It Count.At times, it is as if the fug and scrum of a club has cleared, leaving just three isolated dancers – or as if they have ascended to a podium. They often use familiar techno or street dance moves but the choreography grows increasingly sophisticated as the trio snake from one routine to the next, barely pausing for water breaks. Side steps suggest the swaggering attack of warriors or boxers and that drilled momentum abates for body ripples, elasticated legs, disco arms and blissed out reverie – even a few gestures towards line dancing. When exercise equipment is brought on, it morphs into a Hiit workout. All three don rave gloves like lightning mimes.View image in fullscreenLost in the music … The Butterfly Who Flew Into the Rave.Photograph: Lucy ParakhinaThe heat rises in the room. The dancers, clad in athleisure and cargo pants, shed bits of clothing. Their focus is absolute, switching between responding to the music and almost controlling it, only to occasionally recoil under strobes (part of Shanell Bielawa’s lighting design) from its shattering power. Frequently in triangular formation, their bond is as mesmerising as their compulsion to keep going, even if there’s no space for a deeper narrative or emotional nuance in the piece’s audacity.Choreographed by the trio (from a concept by Mathiesen and featuring Celia Hext as an occasional alternate performer), the show is billed as endurance art because it condenses a three-day rave into 60 minutes. It’s a testament to their stamina – but there is pure pleasure here, too. The lasting impression is of transcendence and when those red cups start glowing like votive candles, it almost attains a spiritual quality.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreDanceEdinburgh festivalClub cultureDance musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

I feel really grateful to be moving through the world. I think I’m OK, but it’s like a daily struggle, obviously.”Baena, who directed Plaza in the comedies Life After Beth and The Little Hours, killed himself at the age of 47 at his Los Angeles home. At the time, a joint statement from Plaza and his familycalledit “an unimaginable tragedy”.In her interview with Poehler, Plaza used the Apple sci-fi horrorThe Gorgeas a “really dumb analogy” to describe the aftermath.“It’s like an alien movie with Miles Teller,” she said. “In the movie, there’s a cliff on one side and a cliff on the other side and there’s a gorge in between and it’s filled with all these monster people that are trying to get them. I swear when I watched it, I was like, ‘That what this feels like, what my grief is like – or what grief could be like.’ At all times there’s like a giant ocean of awfulness that’s likeright there, and I can see it. And sometimes, I just want to dive into it and be in it. And then sometimes, I just look at it. And then sometimes, I’m just trying to get away from it. But it’s always there. It’s just always there. And the monster people are trying to get me like Miles Teller.”The pair met in 2011 and married in 2021.In anobituaryfor the Guardian, Ryan Gilbey praised Baena’s “enjoyably twisted” movies. Baena also co-wrote I Heart Huckabees with David O Russell, and his final film was the dark comedy Spin Me Round, starring Plaza and Alison Brie.Plaza’s film roles also include Ingrid Goes West and Emily the Criminal, and she can next be seen in Ethan Coen’s comedy Honey Don’t.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

In a statement on 7 August, it said that Boyne had been longlisted “on merit” and that it was “inevitable” that “even within our community, we can at times hold radically different positions on substantive issues”.The statement in protest against Boyne’s longlisting, drafted in response to Polari’s 7 August statement, said that the author had “publicly and unequivocally associated himself with trans exclusionary sentiments”, citing anIrish Independentarticle in which Boyne expressed support for JK Rowling and described himself as a “fellow Terf”. Its hundreds of signatories included Alice Oseman, the author of Heartstopper, along with the writers Nikesh Shukla, Julia Armfield, Naoise Dolan and Seán Hewitt.Author Nicola Dinan, who won the Polari first book prize last year for her novel Bellies, resigned from this year’s jury for the debut prize. Guardian journalist Jason Okundaye asked for his book Revolutionary Acts to be removed from this year’s first book prize longlist, while Andrew McMillan withdrew his book Pity from the longlist for the overall Polari book prize for non-debuts, for which Boyne was also longlisted.Writingin the Guardianlast week, Okundaye said that the prize had “always been for the entire LGBTQ+ community”, and so “it is a contradiction to include someone who is trans-exclusionary”.In aresponseto the controversy, Boyne said that it seemed “absurd and wrong” that debut writers who were withdrawing were losing an opportunity, and said that if they returned, he would ask judges not to consider his novella, Earth, for the shortlist.Writing in the Telegraphon Tuesday, he called Polari’s decision to cancel the prize an “interesting example of self-cancellation”, and said that nobody from the prize had contacted him. “Had they done so, perhaps a happier resolution might have been found”.Explore more on these topicsBooksJohn BoyneSexualityTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, he said the prospect for actors from underprivileged backgrounds now looked “quite scary”.“Having those school plays where the drama was happening in my school – then there was a youth theatre that was funded through the education department of the council, and then I got a grant to go to drama school,” said Sheen, who was speaking at an event opening theEdinburghTV festival. “So just to get to the point of going to drama school, all of those things sort of had to be in place. All of those things have gone, essentially.“It does worry me that for young people who might want to get into this – if you are relying on the bank of mum and dad – it’s really tough to even just go and live in London, or move to wherever. That’s why it’s so important we get stuff out of London and around the country.”His comments come amid wider concern in the TV world about narrowing access. Acrisis in the industryhas left many established freelance workers out of a job as production has slowed down and the industry adapts to fast-changing consumption habits.It has led to fears that those without resources behind them will be the first forced out of an industry that already faces allegations of havingtoo many privately educated executives.Sheen said there were schemes to support actors from all backgrounds, but he feared they came too late in life to help some talented children. He advocated for a system more like football scouting, spotting talent at a younger age.“It needs to be like football,” he said. “You need to get them when they’re six, seven years old – start supporting people much younger and help them, because a lot of people are just never going to get to the point where they get picked up in these sorts of programmes and projects.”Sheen said he was trying to address the issue with his new Welsh National Theatre, whose first production,Our Town, by the US playwright Thornton Wilder, has been put through a “Welsh lens” by the Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies.Sheen said that he was now able to spend time helping his home community in Port Talbot thanks to his success as an actor. However, he revealed he did not have immediate success in Hollywood, initially finding himself spending “most of my time sitting in diners, reading Stephen King novels and doing very little”.He said it was only when he played Tony Blair in the Channel 4 drama The Deal in 2003, which led to him playing the former prime minister again in The Queen three years later, that his Hollywood career took off.“I’ve gone from sitting in diners reading Stephen King novels on my own completely, to then having a very different life and opening up all kinds of opportunities back here as well as over there – and suddenly having a bit of choice and all those kinds of things.”Explore more on these topicsMichael SheenActingEdinburghScotlandWalesInequalityPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

I love the excitement, but feel manipulatedPamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 19 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 04.45 EDTShareMy husband and I never have sex at home, only at our friends’ places or in hotel rooms. We’ve lived together, improbably, for four years now. When we hooked up six years ago I never expected anything serious, just a one-night stand with a hot flight attendant.After 15 casual sexual encounters we had a screaming row about my sleeping with someone else, and after the 16th, we decided to be in an exclusive relationship. After 40 meet-ups, he brought home an exotic strain of gonorrhoea; when we had got over the shock, and finished a course of antibiotics, we started planning the wedding.It took us a while to find the right place to live together and we stayed with friends for the first three months. We had an incredible amount of sex during that time, of which he was nearly always the instigator– using words such as “she’s out for milk – let’s gooooo”.We kept this up for the first few months in our ownhome, butgraduallywe ended up just cuddling in our shared bed, and, after a few rejected attempts on my part to spicethings up a bit, I settled for just that.He admitted once (when I tried to have sex with him on the kitchen floor) that my furniture was too “me”, it intruded on his mind – he preferred anonymous spaces. And, truly, when we’re not home, suddenly it’s all fireworks again: in a friend’s guest room during a dinner party, in countless hotels, and a few times in very public situations that I still feelanxious about.I do love the excitement – but I’m feeling increasingly manipulated. My husband is the “bottom”, and he’s always ready when he decides we’re doing it.I feelas if he’s treating me like his dirty secret, and that makes me worry about what he’s getting up to in all those foreign hotels he’s staying in. We make increasing use of the blindfold and other BDSM materials, and on a recent hotel visit he suggested inviting up one of the waiters he’d been flirting with to “share” him.I don’t know if I can cope with the emotional whiplash for much longer. How can I get the balance backin our life?Maintaining heightened eroticism in a marriage is not always possible, but you two have achieved this, albeit fleetingly. This has happened largely because the contrasting nature of your lifestyles has helped you to reconnect with the passionate, diverse and somewhat forbidden nature of some of your most exciting early encounters, and has also supported the maintenance of your sexual individuality. Both of these aspects are known to enhance a couple’s erotic connection. On the one hand, they are blessings; on the other hand you have entered a phase of life where you crave true intimacy, while your husband still thrives on spontaneous, creative sex.Your contrasting sexual styles are both valid and legitimate, but, in the context of your long term relationship, some negotiation needs to occur between you to ensure that the needs of both of you are met. Listen to each other’s point of view and share your own feelings. Some couples agree to try a 50/50 split. In your case, that split could be between “at home” sex and sex elsewhere.But I suspect the thing that is bothering you the most is that, in common with many people who “top” exclusively, you are experiencing burnout. To make matters worse, he is passively controlling.

As with most men over 50, it was time for my annual digital rectal exam, or DRE: those riveting moments when the doctor takes a “look” at the prostate gland, which is just below the bladder and in front of the rectum.Its position makes the examination difficult. The physician inserts a well-lubricated finger into the patient’s rectum to feel for abnormalities such as lumps, nodules or areas of hardness. As uncomfortable as the procedure can be, in my experience, it rarely lasts for more than 10 seconds.As always, she said everything looked fine. In my rush to pull my boxers up and change the subject, I didn’t bother to ask any more questions. At the time, I was clueless that as men age, the prostate becomes increasingly susceptible to cancer.In the rare event the disease tops the news cycle, it’s because of high-profile diagnoses, such as for former US presidentJoe Biden in May, Nelson Mandela,Robert De Niroand the Chicago Cubs hall of famer Ryne Sandberg, whodied in late July. Even so, important details of the illness often go unreported. I – like many others – typically dismissed the topic with a yawn, being of the uninformed but persistent impression that it’s “the best cancer to have”. All I knew was that prostate cancer tends to move slowly and can be successfully treated when detected early.Now I am a prostate cancer survivor, whose prostatectomy in 2020 almost came too late. I didn’t know that in the US, prostate cancer is the second leading cause ofcancer death in men. One in eight will be diagnosed with it. One in 44 will die from it.Being uninformed about those details and testing options could have killed me.“Prostate cancer has been called the Silent Epidemic,” said Dr Samuel L Washington, a urologic surgeon who specializes in oncology at the University of California in San Francisco. Even with an active lifestyle, healthy nutritional regimen and digital screenings, cancer can sneak in undetected.What is a colonoscopy and should I get one?Read more“Many men with prostate cancer won’t experience any outward signs or symptoms until the disease is advanced, which is why testing is so critical,” said Dr Clifford Gluck, a urologist and Founder of Dr Gluck’s Wellness Center in Massachusetts. “If not caught early, it can break free of the prostate and run unchecked through the body, with a particular penchant for bone.” Once prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the five-year relative survival rateis only 37%.“In 2023, only about 38% of men between 50 and 64 were screened for the disease,” said Washington. “Sadly, a lack of screening remains one of many factors leading to increased rates of men presenting with more advanced disease over the last decade. The more advanced the cancer, the harder it is to treat.”Before my 62nd year, I routinely postponed my annual physical, assuming I was bulletproof. I was athletic and ate a plant-based diet. My life was free of processed foods, recreational drugs, tobacco, asbestos and weapons-grade plutonium. I experienced no symptoms indicative of prostate cancer, such as erectile dysfunction or urinary issues that reportedly led tothe former president’s diagnosis.Then, after a couple of cross-country moves with my family, I no longer had a primary physician. Dismissing my claims of invincibility, my wife handed me a list of internists. I booked a physical, and my new doctor ordered my first-ever PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate. Normal and cancerous prostate cells produce it, but cancerous onestend to produce more. That said, an elevated PSA level is not always indicative of cancer.Generally, anormal, or non-elevatedscore for men over 60 is under four; for men under 59, under two-and-a-half; and for younger men, under one. But “PSA levels differ for each person,” said Dr Ash Tewari, professor and chairperson of the department of urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “While scores below four are preferred, it is most important to understand whether a PSA level is changing from year to year.” Variables such as family history, overall health, nutrition and race can have an effect. “At the very least, I urge patients to have the conversation with their doctor,” he said.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Mine was a harrowing 17. My doctor called, speaking with a breathless urgency that made me feel I might not live to the end of the conversation. “It’s almost certain,” he said, “that you have prostate cancer.”The PSA test is a common, though imperfect, screening test for prostate cancer recommended by many urologists and primary care physicians for men starting at age 50. It is also one of the only ways to catch prostate cancer early. I asked my two previous primary care physicians why they had never ordered one, and they argued that the test sets off too many false alarms and causes undue stress; elevated PSA levels can be symptomatic ofissues other than cancer, such as an infection. Also, I had never asked for one. (They must have confused my BA in English with a medical degree.)After hearing I had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, one conceded: “In hindsight, a PSA test would have been a good idea.”When do you know when it’s time to stop cancer treatment? She knew – her final act of controlRead moreTheir reluctance is not unusual. Many doctors in the US shy away from prescribing the test because of the uncertainty of what an elevated score means, how patients react to that uncertainty and risks associated with subsequent exploratory procedures like biopsies.A PSA test can correctly indicate that prostate cancer is present, as it did for me. But it can also result in a false positive, suggesting cancer is present when it isn’t (6 to 7% perscreening round); a false negative, or not picking up that cancer is present (according to the UK’sNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 15% of people with a normal PSA test result may have prostate cancer); or catch slow-growing cancers that might never have caused issues.The latter is called overdiagnosis, and treatment can expose “a person unnecessarily to potential complications”, according to theNational Cancer Institute: these include urine leakage, increased urination, loose stools or rectal bleeding, and loss of erections or decreased erections. Current estimates suggest that20%–40% of screen-detected prostate cancersmay never have caused harm, with risk varying by age, PSA levels, and Gleason Score.“There are risks to the test,” said Dr Nancy L Keating, MD, MPH, professor of healthcare policy & medicine at Harvard Medical School. The PSA test has a C rating from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). For context, an A rating means the USPSTFstrongly recommends the test. A C means doctors may offer it, “but that patients should make an individual decision about screening after discussing potential benefits and harms with their doctor”, said Keating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A 2024 multicenter cohort studyreported that about 5% of menregretted undergoing the procedure, often due to pain, bleeding, or unexpected psychological distress.In qualitative studies, men who believed they had been overdiagnosed and unnecessarily treated reported lasting regret, uncertainty, and emotional distress – even years after treatment.Five free, easy ways to fight chronic inflammationRead moreMen more susceptible to prostate cancer, and therefore more likely to benefit from a PSA test, include African American men, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and those with genetic mutations such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, according to theAmerican Cancer Society.Gluck noted that the PSA test has a low USPSTF grade “primarily due to concerns about side-effects from surgery or radiation treatments”. But advances in technology, treatment and surgical techniques – such as high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), a non-invasive treatment that uses targeted sound waves to destroy prostate cancer while preserving urinary and sexual function – make screening a “far more favorable proposition” now, he said.My PSA score definitely spiked my anxiety, despite knowing I might only have an infection. The only way to determine what it meant was an MRI and a prostate biopsy. I dreaded the biopsy, which was to a digital exam what a root canal is to flossing. My urologist explained that there were some risks, such asinfectionand false negatives, but for me, confirming whether I had cancer far outweighed them.Nothing about these processes counted as pleasant. For the MRI, I was ensconced in the machine for about 40 minutes. A week after that, the doctor inserted an ultrasonic probe into my rectum to guide him as he extracted 12 small samples of my prostate. The biopsy redefined my concept of vulnerability, but although it seemed like hours, it took less than 20 minutes – and anticipating the pain was worse than the actual pain. After a few days of mild tenderness, I was back to normal.For all of the worry and discomfort, if the biopsy revealed no trace of cancer, I would have uncorked the champagne. Unfortunately, my results showed ahigh Gleason score– which measures how different cancer cells look under a microscope compared with normal cells – consistent with aggressive prostate cancer. But I was relieved to hear that the disease hadn’t spread beyond the prostate membrane. Had I waited another two or three months, according to my post-operation pathology report, it probably would have.Doctors dismissed my pain. I eventually discovered I had a rare tumorRead moreSix weeks after the biopsy, I underwent a radical robotic nerve-sparing prostatectomy, a roughly five-hour operation to remove the prostate using minimally invasive tools. Finding data onsuccess rateswas frustrating given the myriad factors that can affect the outcome, which include Gleason scores, age, health, obesity, comorbidities and whether or not the cancer has metastasized beyond the prostate. I banked on my fitness and the skill of my surgeon as deciding factors to undergo the operation. My greatest fears were long-term incontinence or erectile dysfunction, but I was fortunate not to suffer either.As lucky as I was, earlier testing and detection would have afforded me more treatment options. “The benefits of early detection can’t be overstated, which is why I advise men between 50 and 70 years of age to have a PSA discussion annually,” said Tewari. “PSA screening combined with imaging is an important approach to effectively screen for prostate cancer.”It took moving across the country, my wife’s diligence and a doctor who routinely prescribed PSA tests for my cancer to be diagnosed. It was a complicated road, and experts’ divergence on the effectiveness of screening show just how difficult it can be for a layperson to make these kinds of medical decisions. It’s not ideal to rely on a testing option that at best results inan estimated10 out of 1,000 peopleavoiding death from prostate cancer, with treatment options that can result in incontinence and sexual dysfunction.But taking the test when I did had a dramatic impact. It saved my life. At the very least, I wish I’d had an earlier opportunity for a detailed discussion with my doctor. Given what I know now, I would have preferred screening and early detection, because for me, there is no such thing as the best type of cancer.Ed Manning is a 67-year-old technology executive, jazz pianist and freelance writer who is writing a memoir about surviving prostate cancerExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyCancerMenProstate cancerHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many of them first took root in Europe in Extremadura, where I’m from. In La Vera, peppers were smoked and ground into what becamepimentón de la Veraand is now part of our food culture. These fritters, which are simple, quick and full of flavour, bring together all these ingredients with long journeys behind them and a solid place in the modern Spanish kitchen.Sweetcorn, chorizo and piquillo pepper frittersPrep10 minCook30 minMakesAbout 12125g cured chorizo, skinned and finely diced75g jarred piquillo peppers, drained and finely chopped2 corn cobs, kernels shaved off with a big sharp knife125g plain flour1 tsp baking powderSea salt and black pepper2 largeeggs, beaten160ml whole milkOlive oil, for fryingPut the chorizo, peppers and corn in a large bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and toss to coat. Season generously, then add the eggs and milk, and mix again to combine.Heat a good layer of oil in a large nonstick frying pan, then, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, drop in spoonfuls of the fritter mixture and fry for a minute or two on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the rest of the fritters.Serve the fritters warm, either just as they are or with some creme fraiche or a little tomato salsa for dipping.Explore more on these topicsFoodSnacksSausagesSpanish food and drinkVegetablesSummer food and drinkEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

From stuffing vegetables with slow-cooked lentils to switching out meat for brussels sprouts in a comforting winter pie, these recipes are both full of fibre and extremely tasty.Cosy cooking: six fragrant, flavourful braises and stewsRead moreMeera Sodha’s beetroot risotto with curry leaf butter(Pictured above)Sodha remembers barely coming up for air between mouthfuls when she first ate this risotto. She describes it as “wildly pink”, savoury and rich, yet zingy and sweet. Coconut milk and marsala are stirred into the arborio rice to create a creamy base. Sodha recommends making the effort to find fresh curry leaves for their “citrus and smoky notes”, which she uses in the spiced lime beetroot topping.Anna Shepherd’s spring vegetable and cannellini bean cheesy mustard gratinView image in fullscreenSpring vegetable and cannellini bean cheesy mustard gratin.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian.

The food writer promises happy diners when it hits the table. Spinach, leeks and a variety of beans are cooked down with garlic to make a soft and tender filling. This is combined with a tart cheesy mustard sauce that gets nice and melty after 25 minutes in the oven.Ravinder Bhogal’s oven-baked hasselback eggplant curry with peanut crustView image in fullscreenOven-baked hasselback eggplant curry.Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian.

Drizzled in coconut oil, the eggplants are then smothered in the paste then baked in the oven. Shrimp paste, lemongrass, lime leaves and tamarind concentrate are then blended together to make the jammy paste. You can sub the shrimp paste with miso to make it vegetarian. To take the edge off the tangy and salty taste, it’s finished with a toasted coconut peanut crust. Serve with roti, parathas or rice.Justine Schofield’s meatless meatloafView image in fullscreenJustine Schofield’s lentil and bean loaf.Photograph: Rob Palmer/PlumThis nutritionally dense meatloaf – with lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans – can be made with ingredients you probably already have in the pantry. Whiz onion, celery and carrots with walnuts and day-old sourdough to make the crumb. Then beans, lentils and quinoa are combined in a food processor to create the mixture, which is then transferred to a baking tin to cook nice and slow in the oven.

Sykes stuffs squash with lentils cooked with winter veggies (carrots, leeks, celery) plus garlic and herbs to make a fragrant savoury stuffing. There are two ways to stuff the squash, but as long as the stuffing makes it inside it’s good to go. Finish it with a mixture of creme fraiche, cheese and breadcrumbs for a soft golden top.Pasta, faster: Alice Zaslavsky’s quick and easy pantry puttanesca recipeRead moreAlice Zaslavsky’s winter pie with brussels sprouts, leeks and cheesy potatoView image in fullscreenAlice Zaslavsky’s veggie twist on a shepherd’s pie.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianIn Zaslavsky’s twist on a classic shepherd’s pie, she replaces the meat with velvety leeks and fat brussels sprouts, with plenty of quark (a slightly acidic cottage cheese) and butter. Tarragon gives the filling a zesty “lick of liquorice”. The pie is then topped with cheesy, mustardy mashed potato. It requires a kilogram of potatoes, so Zaslavsky recommends planning ahead and making a double batch if you’re already making a meal with mash.

Why are they the essential alcopop at this year’s picnics, parties and festivals?Emma RussellTue 19 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhen Merrilee Kick invented BuzzBallz in 2009, she was a 47-year-old teacher from Texas who needed to make some money fast. “I was about to get a divorce and was terrified of becoming homeless,” she says. “I was a high-school teacher not making enough money to survive, much less put two sons through college.” She had the opportunity to do an MBA through a teacher-enrichment programme, and came up with the idea for BuzzBallz one hot afternoon while marking homework. “I chose booze because it thrives in good times, and thrives even more in bad times,” she says.Kick decided to make a cocktail that came in a plastic container rather than glass that could break, and was inspired by the shape of a snow globe she had brought back from Sweden. Finding the funds to manufacture her product proved challenging. She was turned down for business loans by every bank in Dallas, until one accepted the cows from her mum’s ranch and her old car as collateral.Since then, BuzzBallz has grown to become the US’s biggest-selling single-serve premixed cocktail, and the fastest-growing ready-to-drink brand in terms of sales volume in the UK. In 2022, the company was bought by Sazerac in an estimated $500m deal, which made Kick the89th-richest self-made womanin the US. In January 2025, Kick and her family stepped back from running the company – now valued at more than $1bn.BuzzBallz arrived in the UK in 2022, and in the past year sales have boomed. In one day in London, I spoke to students, lawyers and a group of festivalgoers, all swigging the vividly coloured drinks. You may have seen the packaging – bright, round, gaudy – on shelves in corner shops and supermarkets, clutched at house parties or spilling out of the bins in your local park.View image in fullscreenCarlo-Gino, Felicity Dunstan and Emil James drinking BuzzBallz in Peckham Rye park, London.Photograph: Emma Russell/The Guardian“The buzz has been largely driven by organic discovery, primarily in independent retailers and via word of mouth on social media,” says Jake Wenz, the CEO of Sazerac. “It has been incredible to watch BuzzBallz become a cult favourite among consumers in the UK, specifically gen Z.” And it’s not just BuzzBallz that are booming in popularity with this age group.A survey showedthat in March 2025, 76% of UK gen Z consumers had drunk alcohol in the last six months, up from 66% in 2023.Strawberry ‘Rita, Tequila ‘Rita and Chili Mango are Britain’s favourite flavours, according to Wenz. My nearest off-licence started selling them four months ago, and the shopkeeper tells me that young people can’t get enough of them. “It’s surreal,” says Kick. “What started as a wild idea has become a global party-starter.”“People my age are either buying a home and getting married,” says Freya McCann, 29, who works in sales in Edinburgh, “or they’re saying: ‘Let’s get some BuzzBallz and have a good time.’” McCann recently tried her first BuzzBallz, a Strawberry ‘Rita, at a friend’s party and now loves them. She thinks they’ve become popular in the UK because “you can get them at a corner shop, or before you get on the train”. They’re convenient, she says, “but they’re also quite silly”. For McCann, there’s something nostalgic about the drink, reminding her of school discos. “They used to sell these little drinks and you’d feel so hyper.” With about five teaspoons of sugar in each BuzzBallz, not far off the maximum daily recommendation for a woman, it’s no wonder.Like everything that was all the rage in the 90s and early 00s – from low-rise jeans to thin eyebrows – premixed drinks and alcopops are making a return. After a 10-year hiatus, Reef, the vodka, orange and passion fruit drink, was relaunched in 2024. Bacardi Breezer, also discontinued a decade ago, made a return this summer. In June, Smirnoff Ice launched a new advertising campaign across 20 countries. Nik Jhangiani, the interim chief executive of the drinks company Diageo, which makes Smirnoff Ice, told the Telegraph this month that it now has a “huge opportunity” to win over gen Z.In the mid-90s, when alcopops first came on the market, critics said they were being deliberately marketed to teenagers who were below the legal drinking age. “The thing that really bothered people about alcopops was that they are so palatable,” says Andrew Misell, a director at Alcohol Change UK. “We know from looking at statements from some of the drink companies that they were aware that if you want to sell more alcohol, you need to appeal to people who don’t like traditionally bitter or sharp drinks,” such as wine or beer. In 1996, the government slapped a 40% tax on alcopops and some supermarkets pulled them from their shelves. TV adverts for WKD and Smirnoff Ice were banned for encouraging under-18s to drink. By 2013, the ready-to-drink sector, which at its peak in 2005 was worth £1bn,had shrunk by half.Misell doesn’t think there’s anything especially wrong with alcopops or premixed cocktails making a return: “They don’t have any sort of extra-dangerous ingredients in them; they don’t tend to be particularly strong alcoholically.” But, he says, they are “easy to drink a lot of and they may appeal to younger drinkers who have a sweet palate”.Nick Lonergan, a 29-year-old Australian who moved to London two years ago and works in customer relations for a fashion brand, had his first taste of BuzzBallz at a house party four months ago. “I had a sip and then I ran down to the store and bought about five of them,” he says. He likes the fact that they are easy to fit in a bag, which makes them “the perfect drink for a party”.View image in fullscreen‘They’re everywhere’ … BuzzBallz.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFlorence Langford, a 30-year-old Italian-Scottish marketing executive living in Manchester, thinks they’re perfect before a night out or at a festival. “They’re not chic,” she says. “But they arethatdrink of the summer.” The appeal for her is the packaging, which is fun, trashy and toxic-looking. “I probably just go for the most obnoxious colour over the taste, if I’m honest,” she says.There are two types of consumers for these kinds of drinks, says Matthew Bulcroft, the marketing director of Global Brands, which owns Hooch and Reef: “The nostalgia-chasers – the over-30s who either remember it from their parents drinking it or actually consuming it themselves.” They make up about 65% of Hooch’s market. The rest are finding the drink for the first time: “Either because the 90s and 00s are cool again, or just because they want an easy drink that is nice and refreshing and won’t get them too drunk,” says Bulcroft.Since 2022, the consumption of alcohol-free drinks has risen, withMintel revealingthat 41% of UK adults have drunk low- or no-alcohol beer, wine, cider, spirits or cocktails in the past three months. The manufacturers of drinks such as Hooch and Reef have responded by creating drinks that are lower in alcohol: once about 6% ABV, they are now 3.4%. Misell says that while there is a cohort of under-25s who don’t drink at all, that “doesn’t mean that the rest of the under-25s are problem-free when it comes to alcohol”.That could explain the popularity of BuzzBallz with gen Z. “They’re generally having one or two as a precursor to a night out, or it’s an indulgent treat for the train,” says Bulcroft. Gen Z and millennials rate the cost of living as their top concern, with 52% of both generations reporting that they live from one payday to the next. According to a2025 survey by Deloitte, many young people will be looking for more cost-effective ways of socialising. Since the beginning of 2020, more than2,000 pubs have closed inEngland and Wales, in part due to rising costs and declining consumer spending.BuzzBallz cost from £2.99 in Aldi, which started stocking them this May, to £4.99. At 13.5% ABV, they are certainly not low alcohol.Felicity Dunstan, who is finishing off a Choc Tease with her friends Carlo-Gino, 27, and Emil James, 23, in a London park, says she first saw BuzzBallz on TikTok, where there are more than 50,000 videos of people taste-testing them. In a viral video to her 991,000 followers, the influencerHeather Bowlingdrinks a Chili Mango before a night out in Manchester, a voiceover of Samantha Jones from Sex and the City in the background. There’s a #buzzballchallenge to see how people react to drinking them.View image in fullscreenDiscarded BuzzBallz in London.Photograph: Simon Leigh“People litter them a lot, so you see them around,” says James. “It’s actually really good advertising. They’re everywhere.” Carlo-Gino chimes in: “But put them in the bin, guys.” BuzzBallz say they are packaged in 100% recyclable PET plastics.Are BuzzBallz actually any good? With the help of a few friends, I give them a go. We buy all six of the flavours stocked at my local shop. The Espresso Martini is watery and tastes like a strong black filter coffee, but it’s not bad. If I needed a pick-me-up on the way to a club, I’d probably give it another go.The Choc Tease is creamy and has a subtle hint of vodka – it tastes a bit like Baileys. The Pornstar Martini, made with vodka and passion fruit juice, tastes weirdly synthetic, as does the Strawberry ‘Rita with tequila and vodka. The Chili Mango, also with a tequila and vodka base, is my favourite. It’s very sugary but has a little kick from the jalapeños.All my friends were keen on the containers, until it came to finishing the last sip. The spherical shape means you have to tilt your head right back to drain it.Langford says she has noticed the alcopop revival – she’s seen Hooch around and is looking forward to trying WKD’s Irn-Bru flavour. She thinks BuzzBallz are fun but is just as happy to buy premixed Moth cocktails or a canned Cîroc Vodka Spritz. But the drinks are new and exciting for Lonergan, who didn’t grow up drinking alcopops in Sydney. “There’s no nostalgia attached. It’s like I’m living in the here and now. In the BuzzBallz era.”Explore more on these topicsCocktailsSpiritsAlcoholFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Think barbecue, braise or wrapAnna BerrillTue 19 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareMy garden has produced an abundance of lettuce(mainly butter lettuce)this year but there’s a limit to how much salad I can eat. What else can I use them for?Julian, by email“Start thinking of lettuce, and especially butter lettuce, as bread or a taco shell,” says Jesse Jenkins, author ofCooking with Vegetables, and happily this is a “highly adaptable” strategy, too. Sure, you could pile in grilled spicy pork belly and herbs, but this dinner fix also works well “with everything a big green salad does: a piece of nicely grilled protein, some sauce, a few pickled crunchy things, all wrapped in a big, beautiful green leaf”. But why stop there? “I also like to use butter lettuce to wrap cheese toasties,” Jenkins says. “It catches all the fatty goodness and acts as a barrier between the crunchy bread and the roof of your mouth.”Lettuce is also a great carrier of flavour, so braising is another potential ploy. “Start with a base of onion and garlic,” suggests Yohei Furuhashi, head chef atThe Laveryin London, then separately brown some chicken thighs and add them to the onions with a little thyme, a splash of wine and some chicken stock. Then tear in some lettuce and simmer for 10-15 minutes to “let all the flavours come together”.Julian might also give his abundant greens a quick stir-fry “with olive oil and garlic, then mix with cooked lentils, herbs and chilli and serve with salmon”, Furuhashi says. Alternatively, get a thrill from the grill, says Alice Power, head chef atThe Black Swan at Oldsteadnear York. “Halve or quarter lettuces, and get them on the barbecue. Pair with stone fruit and grilled halloumi or chicken, and that will feel very different from a standard salad.” Dressing-wise, the aim is to balance the smokiness, which can done in myriad ways: “Go sweet and fruity, or creamy and herby, or something quite spicy,” Power says.Otherwise, it’s a truth universally acknowledged that few problems can’t be remedied by soup, and tackling an excess of lettuce is no different. “Take any Asian-style broth with chilli, coriander and chicken, then add the lettuce and it will soak up all that juice,” Furuhashi says. Power, meanwhile, would chill out by blending said lettuce into gazpacho or a chilled green and herby soup. Asimakis Chaniotis, ofMyrtosin London, on the other hand, takes inspiration from a fricassee of lettuce with lamb, which is usually eaten in Greece at Easter. “As it’s summer, I’ve been making a version with fish,” he says, and at the moment that means pink bream. He starts by sweating onions and garlic, then adds lettuce and herbs (parsley, mint, dill, basil, chervil) and cooks for just a minute or two. Cook some fish, and serve with anavgolemonosauce (AKA whisked egg yolks, lemon juice and cornflour), which Chaniotis fancies up by turning it into a foam.All that said, sometimes the simplest solution comes from a change in mindset, Power says: “Start thinking of lettuce as a lighter-style leaf, such as spinach,” and stir it through sauces and pasta at the last minute. “Or shred lettuce and add to a courgette and herb risotto,” she says. “That would be nice at this time of year.” And who am I to disagree?Got a culinary dilemma?

But another more concerning trend has emerged that has seen celebrities, elite athletes and influencers who don’t live with diabetes sporting the wearable device, which offers near real-time measurements of an individual’s blood sugar.A video Gwyneth Paltrow posted on Instagram in Maystarts with theactor turned wellness influencerstretching with a CGM conspicuously on her arm before she proceeds to make grain-free almond and coconut pancakes with a strawberry compote. Many in the comments questioned her use of a CGM, with some saying she risked stoking a “dangerous trend” given many diabetes sufferersstruggle to get access to them.It’s winter and respiratory illnesses are everywhere. Will going out underdressed in cold weather make me sick? | AntiviralRead moreOther influencers have directlypromoted CGMs to people who don’t live with diabetes, claiming it can help people manage their metabolism, and thereby improveenergy, mood and sleep. Dr Fiona Willer, the president of Dietitians Australia, worries about the proliferation of the devices and questions whether some people may have “fallen down a wellness rabbit hole”.What is glucose?Glucose, the sugar in our blood, is “there to help fuel all of our cells – our muscle cells, brain cells, all of them – and so we do need sugar in our blood. It’s a bit like the petrol in a car,” Willer says.“Any form of carbohydrate that we eat, whether that’s lollies or wholegrain bread, is turned into glucose, which makes its way into our bloodstream.” The body can also recycle glucose from the stored energy of food we’ve already eaten, Willer says.Those with diabetes need to monitor their glucose levels because their bodies havetrouble making or using insulin– the hormone created by the pancreas that helps move glucose from our bloodstream into the body’s cells to make energy.The blood glucose of people who don’t have regulation issues still fluctuates across the day, going up and down depending on what we eat, physical activity level, as well as things such as whether we’re ill or going through puberty, Willer says. “For people who don’t have diabetes, that fluctuation will occur within a tighter range, while for people who do have diabetes, their blood glucose levels stray outside of what we would call the reference range.”What do CGMs do?People with diabetes previously had to use a finger prick test to measure their blood glucose levels. The CGM is a relatively new device thatuses a sensor to measure glucose via the fluid between cells every few minutesand then sends the reading to a receiver or smartphone app. For people with diabetes, the reading can then help them manage their glucose levels by influencing how they eat or using some glucose-modifying drugs such as insulin.Clinical endocrinologist Prof Jenny Gunton says CGMs can “hugely improve the quality of life” for people living with type 1 diabetes, as well as pregnant women who have gestational diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes on insulin.What about people who don’t have diabetes?Gunton, who heads the Centre forDiabetes, Obesity and Endocrinology Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, says outside of these groups, wearing a CGM can be useful to understand blood glucose levels after various foods and exercise, but warns that “like any device that gives lots of information, CGMs can sometimes increase anxiety and stress”.They are also expensive. For people who aren’t eligible for a government subsidy, it can cost more than $100 for a sensor that lasts just 14 days.Should people without diabetes use them?A study led by the University of the Sunshine Coast in 2022 found CGMsprovide little benefit for healthy athletes without diabetes. Separately, researchers whoanalysed the available evidenceof the utility of CMGs among people not living with diabetes in 2024 said that due to the lack of evidence, “we urge for the commercial claims suggesting the utility of the device in [this population] to be labelled as misleading”.What is hair and scalp oiling, and will it make my locks long like Rapunzel? | AntiviralRead moreWiller welcomes people trying to understand how their body works, but says any idea of a “magic number” for glucose levels for someone who doesn’t have insulin resistance or diabetes is “completely imaginary”. She also says it could lead people to becoming unnecessarily restrictive with their diet and trying to control their body in a way that is not necessarily healthy.“It’s a bit like calorie counting, in that it’s one metric that can give people the impression that it kind of wraps everything up together, that it is an indicator for everything. But just like calorie counting, it is actually hugely reductionistic, and it means that we lose so much context about why we eat, when we eat, the sorts of things we eat, and how food functions in our social and cultural experiences as well.”Willer recommends for people who are interested in living a healthier lifestyle and want an individual approach to speak to a health expert rather than buy a product online.“Even if they have purchased a CGM, a dietitian or another health professional will help understand, to help them interpret what’s going on with their numbers against their actual behaviours.”Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Following the Exe estuary towards Dawlish, where the railway runs along the beach, flocks of waders are gathering on the sandbanks, backed by boats and glinting water.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’m heading for the Dart valley and the English Riviera, AKA Torbay, to explore by foot and ferry, river boat, bus and steam railway. The area promises wine, walking, seafood and an eclectic history from prehistoric cave-dwellers to Agatha Christie. It’s easy to assume a Devon holiday must involve driving, but it can be even better without. On previous trips, I’ve stayed inExeter and toured by train, or based myself inTorquayto walk the coast path and take the boat to Brixham. This time, I’m testing the limits of what can comfortably be done without a car by staying in an old farmhouse in the countryside, half a mile from the nearest bus stop.A map of south DevonBus 125runs every couple of hours from Paignton, and the road from Four Cross Lanes bus stop toSandridge Bartonwinery is laced with stitchwort and pink campion, growing under hedges wreathed in honeysuckle. Robins are singing in the apple trees and skylarks over the fields. Hard to believe I was in rainy Essex this morning and am now in a sunny Devon vineyard, ready for the midday tour. A whiff of wood smoke from the fire in the tasting cabin mixes with soft bubbles from the Sharpham sparkling wine, made on site and tasting of oak and tart apple crumble. The last taster, a young, fruity red, comes withSharpham cheesesand localchilli jam.The route to Stoke Gabriel is almost impossibly idyllic: a path I might never have found if I’d come by carAfterwards, I stroll for a mile down to Stoke Gabriel for provisions. The route is almost impossibly idyllic: a narrow track under banks of ferns and wildflowers. The only sounds are birdsong and a waterfall near the old mill. It’s a path I might never have found if I’d come by car. Along the stony beach of the big Millpool, I reach theRiver Shackand sit right by the water with bowls of sesame-seaweed salad and honeyed anchovies. Dozens of green and orange crabs are marching sideways over the dam nearby, caught and released by children fishing there with sacks of bacon. A heron is fishing too, far out in the pool.View image in fullscreenThe River Shack in Stoke GabrielBack at Sandridge Barton, thenew restauranthas closed for the day, and there are only sheep in the orchard and swallows spiralling overhead. My brother joins me from Somerset on the last bus and we have a whole floor each in the pale pink, wisteria-deckedLower Well Farmhousenext to the winery. It would comfortably sleep eight in three doubles and a twin, all en suite, and downstairs there’s a slate-floored farmhouse kitchen, beamed, log-fire-warmed sitting room and a walled courtyard strung with lights (from £278 a night, three nights minimum).Agatha Christie’s house atGreenwayis roughly three miles south, beside the River Dart, so we decide to walk there the next morning. After a mile or so along a lane, paths lead down to the quay at Galmpton Creek and we pick up the well-signedGreenway trail, along a stony beach, through woods and over hills, to the gate. There are lockers to store bags and free hot drinks for visitors who reach Greenway without a car. We have simnel scones with pots of tea before wandering through the gardens. Woodpeckers yaffle above banks of primroses and strawberry flowers, lipstick-bright camellias and cascading rhododendrons. We sit in Christie’s old sitting room, where 1930s songs are playing, and stroll into woods, past mossy fountains, river views and hillsides white with wild garlic. This year, the National Trust has introduced a new half-price admission for non-members after 2.30pm (full price £17 adults, £8.50 under-18s).View image in fullscreenAgatha Christie’s home, Greenway.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/AlamyThe Dartmouth Steam Railway and River Boat Company runs different routes across the River Dart and sells combi andRound Robin tickets. From the little quay below Greenway, we catch theboat to Dartmouth(£12) along the wide, tree-lined river to explore palm-studded gardens and half-timbered houses. A quickferry trip(£2.50) to Kingswear brings us to one end of thesteam railway(£23.50) and, from the glass-walled observation carriage (£3 extra), the views are unbeatable.The train passes wooded riverside cliffs and crosses viaducts, then climbs through oaks and neon-yellow broom flowers to reach the sandy beaches of Torbay. We end the day eating River Teign mussels on a sunny, pub-style terrace atThe Boathousein Paignton, with the foaming sea just feet away. The only problem is, once we’ve finished, the last bus has left and our options are a four-mile sunset walk or a £12taxi. We take the taxi.At Agatha Christie’s house we have simnel scones with pots of tea before wandering through the gardensHeading to the bus stop in Stoke Gabriel the next morning, paths lead us up from the water, through a blossoming community orchard and the village churchyard, where a 1,000-year-old yew tree rests its sagging branches on wooden posts.

Red-leggedturnstonesare scampering under oyster-crusted pillars, and a new statue of Christie with her favourite dog, Peter, was unveiled in April. She was born in Torquay in 1890 and several novels feature local settings. She would have been more familiar with yesterday’s boat and steam train trips than today’sRib ride(£37). A breezy, hour-long coastal tour takes in caves, coves and rocky arches, cormorants and harbourside seals, before flying us back across the bay with the salt spray spattering our laughing faces.View image in fullscreenThe Dartmouth Steam Railway.Photograph: Phoebe TaplinTorquay is peppered with Christie-related landmarks, including Beacon Cove, where she nearly drowned; the Grand Hotel, where she honeymooned; and Kents Cavern, which inspired her mystery novel The Man in the Brown Suit.The tour ofKents Cavernleads through a wooden door into dripping tunnels and dens of ancient cave bears, past stalactites, calcite bands and pickaxe marks. The guide lights moss-and-beeswax-filled scallop shells and holds up neolithic skulls like a cheery, enthusiastic Hamlet (£16.95 adults, £14.25 under-16s, if booked in advance).Torquay Museum, in an elegant gothic building five minutes by bus from Kents Cavern, displays the fossilised jawbone of a 41,000-year-old human, one of Britain’s earliest Homo sapiens. You can also find stuffed birds and farmhouse kitchens, delicate Egyptian sarcophagi and pictures crafted in Torquay marble. In the UK’s only gallery dedicated to Christie, there’s also one of her fur coats and the walking stick David Suchet used to play Poirot (£10 adults, £5 under-18s for an annual pass).There’s time before our train for a meal atNo Seven, a seafood bistro with a sea-view wine bar upstairs. From the Tickled Pink Torquay gin, flavoured with raspberry and rose petals fromTorre Abbeygarden, through the gurnard with basil and tomato, the tempura plaice and skate wing, to the coffee with local fudge, it’s pretty much perfect.Accommodation was provided bySandridge Bartonand travel byGWR(advance tickets from LondonPaddingtonto Torquay or Paigntonfrom around £50 each way, or from Taunton from£6each way), with additional helpfromEnglish RivieraExplore more on these topicsDevon holidaysCar-free coastPublic transport tripsWalking holidaysEngland holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t a major problem – no punctured tyre or busted door handle – simply that my maps app wouldn’t connect to my phone’s music player any more. An “update” during the night had stolen the function away, robbing me of the ability to change my music and track where I was on the map at the same time.It’s things like this that make automatic updates the mundane bane of my existence. The promise of forced software patches is that they improve the software and apps we use every day – make them more convenient, maintain our security and so on. But what actually happens most of the time is that updates change perfectly fine tech – now it sucks.Was I finally used to how my inbox works, secure in the knowledge that buttons weren’t going to move randomly around? Too bad – it’s entirely different now! How about that handy feature I used all the time, like YouTube’s community-contributed subtitles or my running app’s ability to check my historical statistics? Sorry, it’s been completely deleted or placed behind a paywall. The practice invokes paranoia, too: I’ve found myself deep in Reddit threads full of people convinced the latest operating system update halved their phone’s battery life. Did it? Who can say?My petty gripe: why do fitness instructors lie about rep counts? Who hurt them?Read moreIt’s one reason I eye “smart” appliances with wifi access with deep suspicion; I’m not scared of Hollywood hackers or a sentient robot uprising, but I dread the broken updates, vanished features or forced additions I don’t want. I fear some anonymous developer on the other side of the planet can push a button and overnight make the apps and software I use worse. It’s bad enough half the programs on my PC are riddled with the latest GenAI tech-fad rubbish; wait until the fridge makers decide I need it too.Would we tolerate anything else that got worse over time, not as a result of normal wear and tear but because the manufacturer suddenly decided it should? A hammer that had the nail-puller mysteriously removed unless you paid for some stupid new subscription? A faucet whose creator decided actually they don’t want hot water and so neither should you? Absolutely not.I’ve learned to live without my maps and audio controller connectivity. But it still rankles – a constant reminder that maybe living a more disconnected life, far from the tendrils of the faceless corporations’ incessant updates, wouldn’t be all that bad.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyPetty gripescommentShareReuse this content"

But there is a solution if they look too wild for your living roomGynelle LeonTue 19 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 19.05 EDTShareWhat’s the problem?My philodendron has long, white, string-like growths coming out of the stems. Is my plant OK and can I cut them off?DiagnosisThese curious structures are known as aerial roots, and are completely natural. Philodendrons originate from tropical rainforests, where they climb trees. These aerial roots help it anchor itself, absorb moisture and draw nutrients directly from the humid air. Indoors, however, they can give the plant a slightly wild appearance.PrescriptionThere’s no need for any concern or immediate action. Aerial roots are a sign of a healthy plant. If you find them visually unappealing, gently guide the roots on to a support, such as a moss pole or bamboo stake, to encourage your plant to climb. This helps it develop larger leaves and gives it an attractive shape. If you prefer to trim, use clean, sharp scissors to avoid damage or introducing infections.PreventionThere’s no need to prevent aerial root growth, but providing your plant with adequate support will keep it looking neat and encourage lush foliage.Got a plant dilemma?

It is known for its architecture that resembles alávvu(a Sámi hut).View image in fullscreenThe church is to be rolled to its new home at a pace of half-a-kilometre an hourPhotograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersOn Wednesday, a church service and coffee event will be held in an attempt to break a world record for church coffee. There will also be musical entertainment, including a concert with the singer Carola.The church is expected to reopen at its new location at the end of next year, but the city’s entire relocation is not expected to be completed until 2035.The church is one of 23 cultural buildings being relocated in what LKAB has described as “a unique event in world history”. The mine’s operator gave residents the option to either financially compensate those affected by the town’s relocation or rebuild homes or buildings.LKAB mineThe expansion has attracted criticism, including from the Sámi community, who fear that fragmentation of the land will make reindeer herding more difficult and threaten the town’s Indigenous culture and way of life.Karin K Niia, a reindeer owner and board member of Gabna Sameby, a Sámi village that has its year-round lands in Kiruna municipality, said the moving of the church was a “big show” to distract from the destruction of the town and the culture of its Indigenous people.The church was just “one small part of Kiruna” that had been chosen to be preserved, she said, accusing the company of “land-grabbing” the grazing territory needed to support Sámi culture.“It feels rather difficult to see the move of the church when I’m well aware of the consequences that mining activities have on everything around it: biodiversity, the air, pollution of water, reindeer and wildlife in general,” she said.“They have planned it all in order to get people’s attention, media attention on this state-owned company and their action to preserve the church as a symbol for the cultural heritage of Kiruna.”Stefan Hämäläinen, senior vice president of urban development at LKAB, said: “The move of Kiruna church is necessary for it to continue to exist at all. LKAB has moved a vast amount of buildings in the ongoing urban transformation that began planning over 20 years ago. We are obliged to compensate for what is affected by the mine. In the same way, we seek constructive solutions when mining operations affect reindeer herding, as it is an important part of Sami society and culture.”View image in fullscreenPeople watching the move.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesIt has previously declined to specify the cost of the move, but on Tuesday the chief executive, Jan Moström, said it had cost more than half a billion kronor. He insisted it was worth the money.“If the mine is to remain, we have to move Kiruna city centre. Kiruna city centre without the church, I can’t see it – so there are no alternatives,” he said during SVT’s live broadcast.The altarpiece of the church, a pastel landscape by the late Prince Eugen of Sweden, and the more than 2,000-pipe organ have been carefully wrapped for the journey, and the ground around the church’s former location dug out so that beams could be placed underneath.“The church is sitting on a beam system, then two rows of trailers were brought in,” the LKAB project manager, Stefan Holmblad Johansson, said. These were slid underneath the beams.The bell tower, which is a separate structure, will be moved next week.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeHeritageArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

While Somalia has improved vaccination rates in recent years, the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) blames the uptick in cases on persisting immunisation gaps.Abdulrazaq Yusuf Ahmed, the director of Demartino public hospital in the capital, Mogadishu, said: “The number of recorded cases of children sick with diphtheria has increased across the regions in the whole country. We have received about 49 patients in the whole of 2024 but this year, 2025, we have received 497 diphtheria cases during the last four months alone.”Deaths had risen from 13 to 42, according to a report by Ahmed’s hospital this month. The report described the resurgence of diphtheria as “one of the most urgent and dangerous threats to public health”.Earlier this month, the health ministry said it had recorded 1,616 cases and 87 deaths from the disease so far this year.MSF’s Somalia medical coordinator, Frida Athanassiadis, said: “We are seeing a rapid increase in diphtheria among children under 15 in central Somalia,” adding that they accounted for roughly 97% of cases. “Low vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy and poor living conditions are driving the spread.”Athanassiadis said that in some medical centres the basic resources were “insufficient to cope with rising caseloads”.MSF said while teams initially had a small emergency stock of the antitoxin, it had now been exhausted, with the health ministry and the World Health Organization helping to distribute the “limited available stock based on needs”.In July, Save the Children warned that since April cases of measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera and severe respiratory infections in Somalia had doubled from roughly 22,600 to more than 46,000. About 60% of the cases were children under five, it said.“The sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases is linked to the recent aid cuts, which have impacted the health system’s capacity to deliver essential services, including routine immunisation, and to treat and run catch-up campaigns to increase the immunity necessary to halt the outbreak,” the NGOsaid.In Mogadishu, one resident, Abdiwahid Ali, said: “Many children in my neighbourhood are sick, some of them hospitalised.”Anab Hassan, a grocer, said people were concerned about the outbreak. “A friend of mine lost a five-year-old daughter who was diagnosed with diphtheria, and several others told me their children are sick and coughing,” she said. “We hear about children getting sick every day.”Explore more on these topicsSomaliaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Police also accused her of smuggling dozens of ecstasy pills.The Peruvian woman told the police she was hired to transport the drugs toIndonesiaby a man she met on the dark web in April in return for $20,000, said Radiant.The woman has been charged under Indonesia’s harsh narcotics law and could face the death penalty if found guilty.Last month, aBalicourt sentenced a 46-year-old Argentine to seven years in prison after she was found guilty of smuggling 244 grams of cocaine wrapped with a condom that she hid inside her genitals.Indonesia has some of the world’s toughest drug laws.There are dozens of traffickers on death row in the country, including a 69-year old British womanconvicted of smuggling cocaine.Indonesia last carried out executions in 2016, killing one Indonesian and three Nigerian drug convicts by firing squad.Explore more on these topicsBaliIndonesiaDrugsPeruQatarAmericasAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The UN needs all national plans – known asnationally determined contributions (NDCs)– by that date to compile a “synthesis report”, which will show how far off track the world is on the crucial goal of limiting global heating to1.5C above preindustrial levels.André Corrêa do Lago, the veteran Brazilian diplomat who will preside overCop30, wrote to governments on Tuesday to urge them to submit ambitious NDCs, and warned that if they were not strong enough then further action would be needed at Cop30.He wrote: “Far from representing mere climate targets for 2035, our NDCs represent the vision of our shared future. They are vehicles of cooperation, enabling us to realise this vision together. If the image shown by NDCs turns out disappointing, it is our collective responsibility to convert it into a picture that will ensure a livable planet, protect all economies, and improve living standards and life opportunities for all peoples, for all generations.”Brazil has markedly stepped up its diplomatic efforts in the past week, as theprospects for Cop30 look increasingly difficult. Brazil’s president, Lula da Silva, held a one hour call with China’s Xi Jinping last week in which the climate was a key priority.Do Lago said: “We are quite convinced that China will publish an ambitious NDC in time for the synthesis report. We are very confident that China is taking this exercise very seriously.”The “presidency consultation” meeting called for 25 September is a new departure, as such meetings normally only take place during the final stages of Cops. It will be followed by another on 15 October, both aimed at preventing the gridlock that has afflicted recent UN climate meetings, at which negotiations have been unable to start on time because of disagreements over what should be on the agenda.But the Cop30 presidency has been beset by problems amid a worsening geopolitical situation, reinforced byDonald Trump’s red-carpet treatment of Vladimir Putin last weekin Alaska.Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement, and Putin’s war in Ukraine has proved a bonanza for fossil fuel interests.Brazil has also suffered obstacles of its own making, includingthe siting of the summit in Belém, a small city at the mouth of the Amazon River. Developing countries and civil society groups have grownincreasingly anxious at the lack of hotels and other accommodation, and thehigh prices charged, and there are questions over whether Belém’s airport has the capacity and security needed for the scores of world leaders who have been invited.Belém only has about 18,000 hotel rooms in normal times, while about 50,000 people are expected to attend Cop30. While Brazil’s government has commissioned two large cruise ships to moor at Belém for about 6,000 attenders, and set up a platform for Belém residents to rent out rooms and apartments, the cheapest rooms are about $400 a night for the fortnight of talks, with many hotel rooms priced at well over $1,000 a night. These are daunting sums for many of the most vulnerable countries, who can only afford to send a handful of delegates in contrast to the scores of officials sent by some of the biggest emitters. Civil society groups and media organisations have also warned they are being shut out of the event.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

While NDCs are crucial to global climate action, they were not originally set to be the focus of the Cop30 agenda, as Brazil maintained they would be settled before the summit and therefore not subject to negotiation.However, many countries made it clear that discussing the NDCs and their impacts would be central to fulfilling the Paris agreement. Do Lago said there would be opportunities for parties to discuss all key issues: “Some of the issues that the public in general expect more discussion on at Cop were not included in the agenda. So what we want to do is make sure we are dealing with these issues, that are considered important by stakeholders. There is a huge debate about trust in these negotiations, and I firmly believe that transparency is essential.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He now replaces Damien Kurek, who volunteered to resign his seat in order to give Poilievre a chance return to parliament.Without a seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre has been unable to fully serve his role as opposition leader. Instead of sparring with the prime minister, Mark Carney, during question period, Poilievre has been relegated to holding media scrums on the outskirts of parliament, diminishing his national visibility.Monday’s victory, with relatively high turnout for a byelection, is likely to re-energize supporters. But Poilievre won one of the country’s most Conservative-friendly seats by a narrower margin than Kurek did in April. Diminished support for the federal leader could influence members when they vote to review his tenure as the top Tory in January.The race, which had a national feel for a rural, sparsely populated riding, was also the target of the Longest Ballot Committee, a group calling for electoral reform. The movement coaxed 203 candidates to add their names to the roster, forcing ElectionsCanadato use write-in ballots for the first time during a federal election and to hire more staff to count ballots on election night.“Make your vote count so that I can go to Ottawa and fight for you. Fight for your right to buy any truck or car you want. To keep your firearms, fight for farmers, oil and gas workers, and a stronger military. Fight for an immigration system that is under control and puts Canadians first,” Poilievre said in a video posted to social media on Monday, which included directions on how to correctly spell his surname. “But before I can do any of that, I need you to get out and vote today.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We have a tentative agreement we will bring forward to you,” the Canadian Union of Public Employees’ (Cupe) Air Canada branch said in a statement.“We are required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,” the statement said.Air Canada said in a statement that it would “gradually restart its operations” after reaching an agreement with Cupe through a mediator, William Kaplan.It said the first flights were scheduled for Tuesday evening but warned that full service may not return for seven to 10 days.“Restarting a major carrier like Air Canada is a complex undertaking. Full restoration may require a week or more,” Air Canada president Michael Rousseau said.Neither the union nor the airline immediately provided details of the proposed agreement.But Cupe said the deal achieves “transformational change for our industry after a historic fight”.“Unpaid work is over,” it added, a reference to a key demand throughout the talks that flight attendants also be compensated for time not spent in the air.“When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back – and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on,” Cupe further said.Air Canada said it would not comment on the terms of the deal “until the ratification process is complete”.It was not immediately clear when Cupe would schedule a vote.More travel disruptionAir Canada – the national carrier which flies directly to 180 cities domestically and abroad – has said the strike forced cancellations impacting 500,000 people.Over the weekend, federal labor minister Patty Hajdu invoked a legal provision to halt the strike and force both sides into binding arbitration.Following that intervention, the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB), a regulatory tribunal, ordered the flight attendants back to work in two separate orders – on Sunday and Monday.But the union said it would not comply with the orders, forcing Air Canada to walk back service resumption plans.Air Canada told customers on Tuesday to expect continued disruption “as aircraft and crew are out of position”.It urged passengers to only travel to the airport if their flight was shown as operating.“The suspension of our service is extremely difficult for our customers. We deeply regret and apologize for the impact on them of this labour disruption,” Rousseau said.Prime minister Mark Carney told reporters Monday it was “disappointing” that eight months of negotiations between the carrier and union had not produced an agreement.He said it was “important” that flight attendants were “compensated equitably”, but voiced unease that hundreds of thousands of people were facing travel uncertainty.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAir transportAmericasUnionsnewsShareReuse this content"

That was my only motivation.”The court martial was before a panel of three senior military officials and a judge, and was expected to run for at least two days.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandEspionageAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Australians have a choice about how to bank productivity gainsPatrick ComminsBusiness groups call it a ‘populist, anti-productivity thought bubble’, but a four-day week holds obvious appealGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastTue 19 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTShareOne of the ideas that has captured many peoples’ attention amid the flurry of proposals ahead of the economic roundtable is the Australian Council of Trade Unions’ vision of a four-day working week.The peak union body argued that working less could actually be productivity enhancing, although the studies behind those claims aren’t too rigorous.While many Australians would certainly welcome a three-day weekend, Jim Chalmers has made it clear that working towards a national four-day working week is not on the government’s agenda, while reaffirming Labor’s commitment to flexible work.Qantas’ hefty fine shows the tide is turning and workers are pushing back against bad corporate behaviour | John QuigginRead moreEmployer groups have been scathing, and it’s not likely to be a big discussion point on day two of the three-day roundtable.Clearly not on board with the treasurer’s “open hearts and open minds” approach to this week’s talkfest, the Australian Industry Group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, called the four-day working week idea “another populist, anti-productivity thought bubble”.A smaller share of full-time workers are doing long hours (more than 50 hours a week) from about 25% of FT workers in 2000 to about 15% in 2025.Willox calculated that at the current dismal rate of productivity growth it would take 26 years to get to the point where we could drop a day’s work without going backwards economically.But as the ACTU secretary,Sally McManus, explained to the Conversation’s Michelle Grattan:the labour movement doesn’t expect a revolution in the working week to happen overnight.“To be clear, we weren’t asking for a change to the workplace laws for the government to do something,” McManus said.“We were raising this in the context of a discussion both around productivity and around AI as an important part of the distribution of the benefits of productivity growth or, for that matter, productivity growth out of less jobs, out of AI.”The longer arc of Australian history has been towards shorter working weeks and longer holidays. But that progress stopped a few decades back, settling on the current set-up of a 38-hour full-time job, two-day weekend and four weeks’ paid leave.But there has been progress in other ways (assuming “progress” is working less – many believe hard work is an end in and of itself).More women than ever are in jobs - graph showing about 65% of women in the workforce in 2025 compared to under 52% in 2000For example, since the turn of the century, the share of full-time employed Australians who say they work longer than 50 hours weekly has gone from 25% to 15%.Meanwhile, part-time work has flourished, fed in particular by a surge in women entering the jobs market. (Which means households overall are probably working harder.)Since the turn of the century, the female employment to working-age population ratio has climbed from 50% to over 60%, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.(The equivalent workforce participation rate for men is just under 68% and hasn’t moved much over 25 years.)Of course, the working from home phenomenon that emerged with Covid has been a revolution for many, particularly working families. Thankfully, employers are on board and hybrid work looks set to stay.But to many Australians juggling work and other commitments, time still feels like the greatest luxury.A three-day working week or higher pay: what a more productive economy could buy AustraliansRead moreIn which case, why shouldn’t the reward for lifting productivity growth be fewer working hours for the same pay?Somefascinating researchearlier this year by Rusha Das, an economist at the Productivity Commission, showed we would have a three-day working week today if we had collectively decided in 1980 to spend all the productivity gains of the following decades on leisure time instead of higher incomes.Das calculated that Australians used only a quarter of the productivity “dividend” from the past 40-plus years to work less, while we banked the remaining three-quarters as higher income.“We have largely traded it for higher incomes, and more and better stuff,” she said.One of the great things about a more efficient and dynamic economy is that it can give us more choices about what we want to do – how much more we want to buy, how much more we want to work and how much more we want to devote to family, hobbies or helping others.This may be getting ahead of ourselves – we have to raise our economic speed limit before we decide how much faster we want to drive.But we’d be mad to limit our thinking to the notion higher productivity is all about generating more income.The ACTU’s four-day work week proposal is a good reminder of that.Explore more on these topicsIndustrial relationsAustralian economyAustralian trade unionsLabor partyBusinessanalysisShareReuse this content"

The documents contained AI-generated case citations for cases that did not exist.It is one of more than 20 cases so far in Australia in which AI use has resulted in fake citations or other errors in court submissions, with warnings from judges across the country to be wary of using the technology in the legal profession.In a federal court judgment published this week, the anonymised lawyer was referred to the Legal Practice Board of Western Australia for consideration and ordered to pay the federal government’s costs of $8,371.30 after submissions to an immigration case were found by the representative for the immigration minister to include four case citations that did not exist.Judge criticises lawyers acting for boy accused of murder for filing misleading AI-created documentsRead moreJustice Arran Gerrard said the incident “demonstrates the inherent dangers associated with practitioners solely relying on the use of artificial intelligence in the preparation of court documents and the way in which that interacts with a practitioner’s duty to the court”.The lawyer told the court in an affidavit that he had relied on Anthropic’s Claude AI “as a research tool to identify potentially relevant authorities and to improve my legal arguments and position”, and then used Microsoft Copilot to validate the submissions.The lawyer said he had “developed an overconfidence in relying on AI tools and failed to adequately verify the generated results”.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“I had an incorrect assumption that content generated by AI tools would be inherently reliable, which led me to neglect independently verifying all citations through established legal databases,” the lawyer said in the affidavit.The lawyer unreservedly apologised to the court and the minister’s solicitors for the errors.Gerrard said the court “does not adopt a luddite approach” to the use of generative AI, and understood why the complexity of migration law might make using an AI tool attractive. But he warned there was now a “concerning number” of cases where AI had led to citation of fictitious cases.Gerrard said it risked “a good case to be undermined by rank incompetence” and the prevalence of such cases “significantly wastes the time and resources of opposing parties and the court”. He said it also risked damage to the legal profession.Gerrard said the lawyer did “not fully comprehend what was required of him” and it was not sufficient to merely check that the cases cited were not fake, but to review those cases thoroughly.“Legal principles are not simply slogans which can be affixed to submissions without context or analysis.”There have beenat least 20 casesof AI hallucinations reported in Australian courts since generative AI tools exploded in popularity in 2023.Last week a Victorian supreme court judgecriticised lawyers acting for a boyaccused of murder for filing misleading information with the courts after failing to check documents created using AI.The documents included references to nonexistent case citations and inaccurate quotes from a parliamentary speech.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He overlooks one key pointRead moreThere have also been similar cases involving lawyers inNew South WalesandVictoriain the past year, who were referred to their state’s regulatory bodies.The spate of cases is not just limited to qualified lawyers. In aNSW supreme court decisionthis month a self-represented litigant in a trusts case admitted to the chief justice, Andrew Bell, to have used AI to prepare her speech for the appeal hearing.Bell said in his judgment that he was not criticising the person, who he said was doing her best to represent herself. But he said problems with using AI in preparing submissions were exacerbated when the technology was used by unrepresented litigants “who are not subject to the professional and ethical responsibilities of legal practitioners”.He said the use of generative AI tools “may introduce added costs and complexity” to proceedings and “add to the burden of other parties and the court in responding to it”.“Notwithstanding the fact that generative AI may contribute to improved access to justice, which is itself an obviously laudable goal, the present case illustrates the need for judicial vigilance in its use, especially but not only, by unrepresented litigants.”The Law Council of Australia’s president, Juliana Warner, said sophisticated AI tools offered unique opportunities to support the legal profession in administrative tasks, but reliance on AI tools did not diminish the professional judgment a legal practitioner was expected to bring to a client’s matter.“Where these tools are utilised by lawyers, this must be done with extreme care,” she said. “Lawyers must always keep front of mind their professional and ethical obligations to the court and to their clients.”Warner said courts were regarding cases where AI had generated fake citations as a “serious concern” but added that given the widespread use of generative AI, a broadly framed prohibition on its use in legal proceedings would be “neither practical nor proportionate, and risks hindering innovation and access to justice”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The CEWH team is working diligently to find a resolution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It can’t be Nato,” he said, ruling out Ukraine’s admission to the transatlantic bloc. “They’re willing to put people on the ground. We’re willing to help them with things, especially, probably, if you could talk about by air.”The White House spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said Putin andVolodymyr Zelenskyyhad both expressed “a willingness to sit down with each other”. She added: “I understand accommodations for that meeting are under way.”Bloomberg reported that Hungary has expressed interest in hosting such a meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had proposed Geneva, with the Swiss foreign minister promising “immunity” to Putin despite an indictment by the international criminal court.Russia has said it views the deployment of troops from Nato countries to Ukraine as a red line in negotiations. Trump dismissed that concern on Tuesday and said he was still optimistic about the potential to reach a deal with Putin.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy, who met Trump and European leaders at the White House on Monday, is said to have declined an invitation to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow.Photograph: ShutterstockNato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, had described Trump’s pledge on Monday to provide security guarantees to ensure Russia would abide by a peace deal as a significant breakthrough, as Zelenskyy and European leadersconvened at the White Housefor an extraordinary summit.In a press conference during the summit, Trump declined to say whether US troops could be deployed to Ukraine in what could provide a “tripwire” to prevent Russia from resuming the conflict in the future.European leaders held fresh talks on Tuesday after their White House meeting with Zelenskyy amid uncertainty over Putin’s readiness to meet the Ukrainian president.Sources close to the talks told Agence France-Presse that Putin had proposed meeting with Zelenskyy in Moscow, hostile territory for a Ukrainian president who has reportedly survived a number of Kremlin assassination plots. Zelenskyy was said to have declined the invitation.It is unclear if or when the two leaders will meet. Putin is scheduled to attend a Shanghai Cooperation Organization security bloc meeting in Tianjin, China, at the end of August, complicating plans to hold a bilateral summit in the coming two weeks.The European “coalition of the willing” first met virtually, co-chaired by Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, before joining a video conference hosted by the European Council president, António Costa.Europe’s flurry of diplomacy is aimed at pushing Trump to take a tougher line with Putin, days after their friendly summit in Alaska.Recent Russian advancesTrump, along with several European leaders in Washington on Monday, said Putin had agreed to face-to-face talks with Zelenskyy in the coming weeks in an attempt to end the three-and-a-half-year war in Ukraine. Moscow, however, has yet to confirm that any such meeting – which would be the first between the two leaders since the invasion – is in the works.Four key takeaways from Trump’s White House summit on UkraineRead moreThe Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov has said only that Putin and Trump discussed the idea of “raising the level of representatives” in Ukraine talks. In remarks late on Monday, Ushakov did not clarify what that would entail and made no mention of a possible trilateral meeting with Trump and Zelenskyy.On Tuesday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told state TV that any meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents would have to be prepared “very thoroughly”.In his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Trump conceded it was possible that Putin did not want to make a deal. “We’re going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks … It’s possible that he doesn’t want to make a deal,” the US president said, adding that Putin would face a “rough situation” if that were the case.At the heart of Tuesday’s talks among European allies was the question of what security guarantees could be offered to Ukraine. On Monday, Zelenskyy described security guarantees as “a key issue, a starting point towards ending the war” and he appreciated Trump’s indication that the US was ready to be part of that guarantee.Zelenskyy said those guarantees would be “formalised in some way in the next week or 10 days”, which could prove to be a long time when it comes to diplomacy involving Trump’s White House.In a social media post late on Monday, Trump said the White House talks included plans for European countries to provide security assurances to Ukraine with the US acting as “coordinator”.Britain and several European allies have floated the idea of a “reassurance force” that could be sent to Ukraine under a future peace deal to deter renewed Russian aggression. Their plans would need firm US backing and Trump has been resistant to deploying US troops as guarantors of any settlement.Moscow issued a statement on Monday evening rejecting any prospect of Nato personnel being deployed in Ukraine. “We reaffirm our categorical opposition to any scenarios involving the stationing of a Nato contingent in Ukraine,” Russia’s foreign ministry said.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron takes part in a video meeting of the ‘coalition of the willing’ from Fort de Brégançon in Bormes-les-Mimosas, southern France.Photograph: Christophe Simon/EPAOther proposals for security guarantees include western allies offering Ukraine article 5-style protection, similar to Nato’s collective defence pledge that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all.In a statement after Monday’s White House meeting, Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that while Ukraine would not be joining Nato, western allies would commit to “a collective security clause that would allow Ukraine to benefit from the support of all its partners, including the United States, ready to take action if it is attacked again”.Zelenskyy has made clear that Ukraine would reject any deal limiting the size of its armed forces, insisting that “a strong Ukrainian army” must be part of the country’s security guarantees. These proposals run counter to the conditions Putin has previously outlined as acceptable for ending the war.While western leaders adopted an upbeat, congratulatory tone toward Trump at the White House, the gulf between Russia’s demands and Ukraine’s willingness to concede remains vast. There remains widespread confusion over what exactly Trump proposed and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the Alaska summit. Some fear Trump may have overstated the outcome and misjudged Moscow’s willingness to compromise.Monday’s White House meeting shed little light on Putin’s territorial terms. The Russian leader has demanded Ukraine’s withdrawal from Donetsk and Luhansk, but Zelenskyy has set a firm red line against ceding land beyond the present occupation or legitimising Moscow’s control.Some observers say that for all the diplomatic manoeuvring, there has been little real movement towards ending the war. “Nothing had happened in Anchorage on Aug. 15th. Nothing happened yesterday in Washington DC,” Gérard Araud, the former French ambassador to the US, wrote on X. “Putin, Zelenskyy and the European leaders were all relieved: they had avoided Trump taking unwelcome decisions. It was the triumph of empty vagueness and meaningless commitments.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is known for its architecture that resembles alávvu(a Sámi hut).View image in fullscreenThe church is to be rolled to its new home at a pace of half-a-kilometre an hourPhotograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersOn Wednesday, a church service and coffee event will be held in an attempt to break a world record for church coffee. There will also be musical entertainment, including a concert with the singer Carola.The church is expected to reopen at its new location at the end of next year, but the city’s entire relocation is not expected to be completed until 2035.The church is one of 23 cultural buildings being relocated in what LKAB has described as “a unique event in world history”. The mine’s operator gave residents the option to either financially compensate those affected by the town’s relocation or rebuild homes or buildings.LKAB mineThe expansion has attracted criticism, including from the Sámi community, who fear that fragmentation of the land will make reindeer herding more difficult and threaten the town’s Indigenous culture and way of life.Karin K Niia, a reindeer owner and board member of Gabna Sameby, a Sámi village that has its year-round lands in Kiruna municipality, said the moving of the church was a “big show” to distract from the destruction of the town and the culture of its Indigenous people.The church was just “one small part of Kiruna” that had been chosen to be preserved, she said, accusing the company of “land-grabbing” the grazing territory needed to support Sámi culture.“It feels rather difficult to see the move of the church when I’m well aware of the consequences that mining activities have on everything around it: biodiversity, the air, pollution of water, reindeer and wildlife in general,” she said.“They have planned it all in order to get people’s attention, media attention on this state-owned company and their action to preserve the church as a symbol for the cultural heritage of Kiruna.”Stefan Hämäläinen, senior vice president of urban development at LKAB, said: “The move of Kiruna church is necessary for it to continue to exist at all. LKAB has moved a vast amount of buildings in the ongoing urban transformation that began planning over 20 years ago. We are obliged to compensate for what is affected by the mine. In the same way, we seek constructive solutions when mining operations affect reindeer herding, as it is an important part of Sami society and culture.”View image in fullscreenPeople watching the move.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesIt has previously declined to specify the cost of the move, but on Tuesday the chief executive, Jan Moström, said it had cost more than half a billion kronor. He insisted it was worth the money.“If the mine is to remain, we have to move Kiruna city centre. Kiruna city centre without the church, I can’t see it – so there are no alternatives,” he said during SVT’s live broadcast.The altarpiece of the church, a pastel landscape by the late Prince Eugen of Sweden, and the more than 2,000-pipe organ have been carefully wrapped for the journey, and the ground around the church’s former location dug out so that beams could be placed underneath.“The church is sitting on a beam system, then two rows of trailers were brought in,” the LKAB project manager, Stefan Holmblad Johansson, said. These were slid underneath the beams.The bell tower, which is a separate structure, will be moved next week.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeHeritageArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

Putin insists Zelensky is not a legitimate leader and has said that any meeting with him would only take place to sign a final peace deal.Yet European leaders continue to push both ideas, which some observers view as a tactic to make Putin appear the one unwilling to budge.“Most of their [European] optimistic statements aren’t true beliefs, but meant to influence Trump. Europeans hype up expectations to create a reality in which Putin disappoints,” Janis Kluge, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, wrote on X.“Europeans (hopefully) know that Putin will never agree to Nato troops in Ukraine. They know that Putin doesn’t want to meet Zelenskyy. But they pretend all that is a realistic possibility to make Putin look as bad as he really is, to undermine Putin’s own narratives,” Kluge added.Putin, who has himself shown little desire to compromise on his maximalist demands, has also tried to frame the other side as the obstacle to peace.In remarks after his Alaska summit with Trump, the Russian president warned that Kyiv and European capitals should not “throw a wrench in the works” by pursuing back-room dealings that could derail the “agreements” he reached with Trump.There remains widespread confusion over what exactly Trump proposed and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the Alaska summit.Trump’s team has presented Putin’s core concession as agreeing to US and European security guarantees for Ukraine – though even that remains murky.Moscow is reported to have floated a different idea: that China, Russia’s ally, act as one of the guarantors of Ukraine’s security, reviving a proposal first tabled by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022.For now, Europe’s tactic seems to have paid off: Trump has temporarily refrained from attacking Zelenskyy or demanding that Ukraine hand over territory on the spot.Putin, meanwhile, is being forced to now tread carefully in response to Trump’s push for a Zelenskyy meeting. The Kremlin is expected to intensify pressure on Kyiv to accept Russian terms, framing it as groundwork for talks.“That way Moscow can deflect claims Putin won’t meet Zelenskyy, while signalling that any talks depend on Kyiv’s willingness to concede,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.But Europe’s far-reaching promises, designed in part to draw a reaction from Putin, may prove unrealistic once Ukraine needs clarity about what support it can truly expect.“Security guarantees come in lots of shapes and sizes. But let’s be clear: there’s not going to be a US or European commitment to go to war with Russia if it reinvades Ukraine,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, a nonprofit global policy thinktank.“This conversation is becoming divorced from reality,” Charap added.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinRussiaUkraineDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Hamas had given a “very positive response, and it truly was almost identical to what the Israeli side had previously agreed to”, the spokesperson said.Egypt said on Monday that it and Qatar had sent the new proposal to Israel and “the ball is now in its court”.Reports emerged on Tuesday that Egyptian security officials were putting strong pressure on Hamas to agree to a compromise that would bridge the gap for Israel’s demands for Gaza’s demilitarisation in any future peace deal by placing Hamas’s weapons in Egyptian custody for an undisclosed period.With Hamas’s agreement, the focus will now be on Israel, which is under mounting international pressure to accept a ceasefire amid international horror overwidespread conditions of starvationthat have spread through the Palestinian territory after Israel earlier this year imposed a complete blockade on aid entering Gaza.While Israel is now letting some supplies into the Gaza Strip, it is not enough to avert widespread starvation, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday. Its spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan told a press briefing in Geneva: “In the past few weeks Israeli authorities have only allowed aid to enter in quantities that remain far below what would be required to avert widespread starvation.”He said the risk of starvation in Gaza was a “direct result of the Israeli government’s policy of blocking humanitarian aid”. Israel’s military agency that coordinates aid, Cogat, has said Israel invests “considerable efforts” in aid distribution to Gaza, a claim rejected by many in the international community.While any prospect of a ceasefire is rejected by Netanyahu’s far-right allies who have again suggested they could collapse his fragile governing coalition, the scale of mass protests in favour of a deal that would secure the return of Israeli hostages is creating its own dynamic, with more demonstrations being called for this weekend.On Tuesday, Israeli media analysts suggested that a vacillating Netanyahu, whose position has lurched abruptly between supporting a partial deal for a ceasefire and rejecting it, would be compelled to choose a course of action, not least if the White House backs the ceasefire terms.“Just two weeks ago he changed his tune and went from insisting on a partial deal to vehemently demanding a comprehensive deal,” wrote Amos Harel in Haaretz of Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza. “As usual, everything is fluid and flexible: Netanyahu will change his arguments and explanations, and may even covertly encourage internal opposition, as long as he can afford to avoid signing a deal.“If circumstances become impossible for him, due either to a demand from Trump or persistent and severe public outcry, the deal will be signed despite the risks it poses for him.”1:33Israel protests erupt nationwide to demand end of Gaza war – videoFacing a full resumption of his trial oncorruption chargesin the autumn, the most significant of those risks is that Netanyahu’s government falls and he is compelled to call new elections.Writing in the centre-right Yedioth Ahronoth, Ben-Dror Yemini was equally scathing about Netanyahu’s leadership and the consequences of rejection of the new proposal. “What now? If Israel says no, it will walk into the trap that Hamas prepared. Because if the talk – and it’s only talk – about conquering Gaza City has already begun to produce increasing calls for sanctions [against Israel], then a military incursion into Gaza will only precipitate an even stronger avalanche,” he wrote.“We have to bear in mind that things can always get worse. And if an Israeli incursion into Gaza City, along with all of the horrific images of destruction, devastation and fatalities, is going to precipitate this avalanche, then going into Gaza City after Hamas said yes to the Witkoff plan – and after Israel refused – will only worsen the avalanche. Once again, Hamas’s strategy will be proven as far more intelligent than Israel’s.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Public have no idea of value of top universities, study findsBelief that snack chain’s revenues exceed those of Oxford one of many underestimations of importance of HE sectorRichard AdamsEducation editorTue 19 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTShareManchester United and Greggs’ famous sausage rolls are no match for the financial firepower of Britain’s leading universities, despite many members of the public thinking otherwise, according to research.The study by King’s College London’s policy institute revealed that many people have a string of misperceptions about the higher education sector, ranging from its size to the lucrative career boost it gives to graduates.KCL’ssurvey of 2,000 peoplefound that many picked Greggs and Manchester United as bigger earners than the likes of the University of Oxford, when the balance sheets show that Oxford takes in over £1bn more than Greggs – despite selling approximately 140m fewer sausage rolls – each year.Students in England now graduate with average debt of £53,000, data showsRead moreAsked to rank a list of organisations by annual revenue, Manchester United and Manchester City football clubs were the most popular choices, followed byGreggsand the owners of the Daily Mail, while only 6% correctly identified Oxford as the highest earner on the list.Asked to rank the UK’s exports by sector, a third of those surveyed named aircraft manufacturing and telecoms as the highest earners, despite higher education earning billions more from overseas sources.Prof Bobby Duffy, the director of KCL’s policy institute, said: “These surveys of misperceptions are not meant to be general knowledge quizzes – we don’t expect the public to have a detailed understanding of the university sector, they have many more directly important things to focus on.“Instead what they do is send signals about how we really feel about an issue, which will be based on what we hear from the media, social media, politicians and our general conversations with friends and family.”The misperceptions extended into areas such as graduates’ attitudes and pay, with more than a quarter of those surveyed convinced that graduates earn the same or even less than those without a degree, when the evidence shows additional lifetime earnings for graduates running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.Duffy said the results showed that the public is being influenced by “negative rhetoric” about university education and its costs, even if most parents remained positive about their children going into higher education.“The standout finding for me is the huge overestimation of the sense of regret about going to university among graduates: only 8% of graduates say they wouldn’t go if they could choose again, but the average public guess is 40%,” Duffy said.“This will be driven by vivid, individual stories of graduate regret and the generally negative background noise about the declining value of a degree.”Duffy said the survey also showed that many “hugely overestimate the proportion of overseas students who claim asylum once they are here, because of the vivid stories of boat crossings that dominate headlines.”One in six surveyed guessed that most international students “remained in the UK to seek asylum or for other humanitarian reasons” after graduation, when in reality just 0.5% did so.The results “illustrate the challenge of shifting these misperceptions and getting this more positive message across. It’s extremely difficult to first get public attention, and then cut through the noise of individual negative stories that are much more likely to stick in our minds,” Duffy said.However many graduates also struggle to grasp the intricacies of the UK’s student loan system. Half of graduates aged 35 and under falsely believed that those who fall behind on their repayments can have their belongings repossessed by the Student Loans Company, compared with just 27% of the general public.UK higher education factsUniversity of Oxford’s annual revenue in 2022-23 was more than £2.9bn, far above Greggs bakery chain’s revenue of £1.8bn.University of Manchester had annual revenues close to the combined incomes of Manchester City and Manchester United football clubs: £1.35bn compared with £718m and £649m respectively.UK higher education employed 550,000 people in 2022-23, more than the Tesco (330,000) and Sainsbury’s (148,000) supermarket chains added together.Higher education generated £24bn in export earnings for the UK in 2022-23, far above aircraft manufacturing with £12bn, legal services with £9.5bn and telecoms with £8.8bn.Of the public 68% have a positive attitude towards universities, while 13% have a negative view. Among respondents, 67% agree that “UK universities are amongst the best in the world” while only 8% disagree.Source: King’s College London policy instituteExplore more on these topicsHigher educationStudentsUniversitiesGreggsUniversity of OxfordKing's College LondonUniversity fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.”The researchers concluded that although it was not yet possible to definitively say vaping leads children to smoke, precautionary policies to restrict sales and marketing of vapes to young people were needed.Dr Ronny Cheung, of the Royal College of Paediatrics, said the study “adds to the mounting evidence that youth vaping is a serious threat to health and wellbeing, with strong links to smoking and other harmful behaviours”.Cheung urged the government not to further delay implementing the tobacco and vapes bill, which will limit the flavours, packaging and marketing of vapes.The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described the rise in children vaping around the world as alarming. Figures compiledby Action on Smoking and Healththis year showed that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain had tried vaping, amounting to an estimated 1.1 million children, triple the levels in 2020.For the new study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control, researchers examined 56 reviews, most of which suggested that young people who vape are about three times as likely to start smoking as those who do not vape.Asthma was the most common respiratory health condition, with consistent associations of between 20% and 36% increased risk of being diagnosed with the condition, and a 44% risk of worsening symptoms.The researchers acknowledged that the umbrella reviews were of variable quality and that it was difficult to prove a causal relationship since the evidence was mostly observational. They urged further research to better understand whether vapes are genuinely acting as a gateway to smoking.Last month,researchersat the University of Michigan established that a third of UK teenagers who vape will go on to start smoking tobacco, meaning they are as likely to smoke as their peers in the 1970s were.Hazel Cheeseman, the chief executive of Action onSmokingand Health, said: “The rise in teen vaping in recent years is very concerning and needs urgent action from government. Vapes are effective quit aids for adults who smoke and while they are less harmful than smoking, they are not risk free and should not be used by children.”Dr Stephen Burgess, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said the research showed “that vaping users are more likely to engage in certain behaviours, but whether vaping is truly a cause of these behaviours is beyond the scope of the data”.He added: “The associations demonstrated are both extensive in scope and strong in magnitude – it is clear that vaping users are at higher risk of many diseases than non-users. A causal explanation to the findings is both plausible and consistent with the evidence provided but such a finding can only be made conclusively by a randomised trial.Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London, noted that many of the studies on which the researchers drew for the study were “rated critically low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making any conclusions”.She said there could be other reasons for the consistency of the relationship between vaping and cigarette smoking – for example, a young person having a sensation-seeking or impulsive personality. Other research looking at population-level trends in vaping and smoking had found that as youth vaping increased in a population, smoking reduced, she said.John Dunne, UK Vaping Industry Association director general, said: “We have seen a lot of research from the scientific community about vaping which does not stand up to scrutiny and this latest study seems to fit the bill.“We need to stop demonising vaping because until the relative risks of cigarettes and vaping are understood by smokers then 220 people will needlessly die in the UK of smoking-related illnesses every day.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Our health advice is clear, while vapes are less harmful than smoking and can be an effective quit aid for smokers, children and non-smokers should never vape.“The worrying rise in youth vaping requires attention – that’s why we commissioned this research, the largest comprehensive review of the health impacts of youth vaping to date.“We are taking decisive action through the landmark tobacco and vapes bill and single-use vape ban, which will put an end to the cycle of addiction and stop the next generation getting hooked on nicotine.”Explore more on these topicsVapingSmokingYoung peopleChildren's healthHealthTobacco industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers may be forced to rip up that plan and move at a rapid pace because of the ruling’s implications.Tory MPs complain party attack ad on asylum hotels ‘makes us look silly’Read moreIf councils take to the high court to complain about the use of a hotel for housing asylum seekers – and many will be under immense political pressure from the public to do so – it could force officials to find alternative housing for thousands of people.View image in fullscreenAnti-migrant protests have been growing outside hotels housing asylum seekers.Photograph: Jaimi Joy/ReutersLegal sources believe that there will be similar grounds to launch applications for interim injunctions from a number of councils. This case has centred on an alleged breach of planning laws by owners of the Bell hotel, who it was claimed did not get permission to switch use from a hotel to hostel-style accommodation.Other hotel owners are thought to be in similar positions to Somani Hotels Limited, which originally housed families in the Bell, but faced a legal challenge after the asylum seekers were switched to single men.Ominously for the government, the Reform UK deputy leader, Richard Tice, said his party would look at pursuing similar cases regarding hotels within the 10 council areas it controls, which include both North and West Northamptonshire councils, Doncaster, and Kent and Staffordshire county councils.And the high court rulings can require a rapid response. Epping’s application for an interim was launched on 12 August. By 4pm on 12 September, all asylum seekers will have to be removed from the Bell hotel.There may yet be a lifeline for the government. They could convince the court of appeal to overturn the decision. The fact that the Home Office was not allowed to intervene in a case that was directly related to the home secretary’s duties to house asylum seekers could well be seized upon by government lawyers.Targeted by the right, Britain’s asylum hotels are places of fear and disorder. Bad political decisions made it so | Daniel TrillingRead moreIf they fail to overturn the decision, they will face the same dilemma as successive Tory home secretaries going back to Priti Patel, who promised and failed to find alternatives to hotels to house asylum seekers.The number of asylum hotels soared to 400 under successive Tory home secretaries because of a shortage of housing, a growing backlog in asylum applications, and a failure to establish large accommodation sites in buildings such as disused military barracks.Since coming to power, Labour has increased the speed at which applications are processed, and used more “dispersal accommodation” such as flats and housing in the community.Questions will no doubt be asked inside the department as to why it took the Home Office until Monday to try to intervene in the case. If it had done so last week, when the case came to court, it would have stood a better chance of preventing the injunction.The political implications of the ruling will continue to unsettle Cooper and No 10. The government has been caught flat-footed on an immigration-related issue, as it struggles withsoaring numbers of small boats crossing the Channel.Anti-asylum seeker protesters will see this as a victory in response totheir demonstrations across the country this summer. Reform UK and its leader, Nigel Farage, currently leading in most polls, will be buoyed by the prospect of further embarrassment for the government.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumYvette CooperLabourEssexanalysisShareReuse this content"

Previously, the CDC advised vaccination for everyone six months and older with the latest available dose.The CDC currently advises that Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six months through 17 years should be determined through “shared clinical decision-making”.The AAP recommends vaccination for anyone under 18 who is at higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19, resides in a long-term care or congregate living facility, has not previously been vaccinated or shares a household with someone at elevated risk.“The academy has been making pediatric immunization recommendations since the 1930s. That has not changed,” Dr Susan Kressly, president of the AAP, toldABC News.“But what has changed is that this year, we’re doing it in the environment of misinformation, which makes it more important than ever that we provide clear and confident guidance, because the majority of American families really depend on us for this guidance.”The AAP says infants and toddlers between six and 23 months face the greatest risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 and vaccination offers protection against serious illness.Even as medical groups continue to disagree with federal agencies, insurers oftenbase coverageon guidelines from the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP). If ACIP declines to endorse a vaccine, families may have to pay out of pocket, and the shot may not be provided through the federally funded Vaccines for Children program.The US Department ofHealth& Human Services (HHS) communications director, Andrew Nixon, responded to the AAP’s updated recommendations with the following statement:“The American people deserve confidence that medical recommendations are based solely on science and public health. We call on the AAP to strengthen conflict-of-interest safeguards and keep its publications free from financial influence, ensuring every recommendation reflects only the best interests of America’s children. Instead, the AAP is undermining national immunization policymaking with baseless political attacks.”The statement continues: “Secretary Kennedy has stood firm in his commitment to science, transparency, and restoring public trust. By bypassing the CDC’s advisory process and freelancing its own recommendations, while smearing those who demand accountability, the AAP is putting commercial interests ahead of public health and politics above America’s children.”Kennedy also responded, posting onsocial mediaon Tuesday a screenshot from the AAP’s website that listedcorporate donorsto the Friends of Children Fund, an AAP program that directs donations to pediatric health projects. Kennedy accused the group of failing to sufficiently disclose conflicts of interest.“AAP is angry that CDC has eliminated corporate influence in decisions over vaccine recommendations and returned CDC to gold-standard science and evidence-based medicine laser-focused on children’s health,” Kennedy wrote.He went on to accuse the AAP’s vaccine recommendation list of being “corporate-friendly” and added: “AAP should follow the lead of HHS and disclose conflicts of interest, including its corporate entanglements and those of its journal–Pediatrics–so that Americans may ask whether the AAP’s recommendations reflect public health interest, or are, perhaps, just a pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial ambitions of AAP’s Big Pharma benefactors.”Kennedy’s restructured vaccine panel has maintained support for annual flu shots butvoted to limitthem to single-dose formulations without the preservative thimerosal.The AAP, however, maintains that the preservativeposes no riskand says physicians should administer any approved flu vaccine suitable for the patient.Explore more on these topicsUS newsChildren's healthCoronavirusHealthVaccines and immunisationInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this content"

What is in it for the American taxpayer? And the answerDonald Trumphas is we should get an equity stake for our money,” he told the CNBC financial news network. “So we’ll deliver the money which was already committed under the Biden administration, we’ll get equity in return for it.”Shares inIntelrallied 7.5% in New York.The conversion of the funding would not confer governing rights typical of a company’s largest shareholder to the federal government, according to Lutnick. “It’s not governance, we’re just converting what was a grant under Biden into equity. Non-voting,” he said.Lutnick did say the goal of the equity stake would be much the same as that of the Chips Act, bluntly stating: “We need to make our own chips here. We cannot rely on Taiwan.”A large portion of the world’s semiconductors originate from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), based in the city of Hsinchu. TSMC has also received Chips Act funding to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the US, with construction beginning in Arizona.The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also said on Tuesday that a potential stake would not oblige US businesses to purchase Intel chips.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s no talk of trying to force companies to buy from Intel.”The prospect of large US investment in Intel has reinvigorated investor interest in the company, whose stock value has declined by half over the past five years.Shares jumped last weekafter initial reports of discussions with the US government, and theJapanese conglomerate Softbankannounced late on Monday that it would take a $2bn stake in the company.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We have a tentative agreement we will bring forward to you,” the Canadian Union of Public Employees’ (Cupe) Air Canada branch said in a statement.“We are required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,” the statement said.Air Canada said in a statement that it would “gradually restart its operations” after reaching an agreement with Cupe through a mediator, William Kaplan.It said the first flights were scheduled for Tuesday evening but warned that full service may not return for seven to 10 days.“Restarting a major carrier like Air Canada is a complex undertaking. Full restoration may require a week or more,” Air Canada president Michael Rousseau said.Neither the union nor the airline immediately provided details of the proposed agreement.But Cupe said the deal achieves “transformational change for our industry after a historic fight”.“Unpaid work is over,” it added, a reference to a key demand throughout the talks that flight attendants also be compensated for time not spent in the air.“When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back – and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on,” Cupe further said.Air Canada said it would not comment on the terms of the deal “until the ratification process is complete”.It was not immediately clear when Cupe would schedule a vote.More travel disruptionAir Canada – the national carrier which flies directly to 180 cities domestically and abroad – has said the strike forced cancellations impacting 500,000 people.Over the weekend, federal labor minister Patty Hajdu invoked a legal provision to halt the strike and force both sides into binding arbitration.Following that intervention, the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB), a regulatory tribunal, ordered the flight attendants back to work in two separate orders – on Sunday and Monday.But the union said it would not comply with the orders, forcing Air Canada to walk back service resumption plans.Air Canada told customers on Tuesday to expect continued disruption “as aircraft and crew are out of position”.It urged passengers to only travel to the airport if their flight was shown as operating.“The suspension of our service is extremely difficult for our customers. We deeply regret and apologize for the impact on them of this labour disruption,” Rousseau said.Prime minister Mark Carney told reporters Monday it was “disappointing” that eight months of negotiations between the carrier and union had not produced an agreement.He said it was “important” that flight attendants were “compensated equitably”, but voiced unease that hundreds of thousands of people were facing travel uncertainty.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAir transportAmericasUnionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shein still makes most of its clothing in China.It has consulted lawyers about setting up a parent company in mainland China, according to a Bloomberg report, indicating that the company is now most likely to list inHong Kong.Melanie Tng, a private capital analyst for the venture capital research firm PitchBook, said: “For companies likeSheinthat are operating at the intersection of consumer, cross-border and digital commerce, Hong Kong is arguably the only viable major offshore listing venue left.“Mainland exchanges remain largely inaccessible to these sectors, while US and UKIPOshave grown increasingly difficult due to CSRC approval hurdles and geopolitical friction.”The latest effort to secure a listing comes as prospects for growth at the company have been dampened by new restrictions on the import of low-value goods to the US. The restrictions are poised to be tightened again next week after Shein and Temu, another online marketplace founded in China, were seen to have benefited from them at the cost of local retailers.In May the USrevoked its de minimis exceptionfor Chinese-made goods, under which parcels with a value of less than $800 (£600) shipped to individuals were exempt from import tax.

Despite ample smiles and enjoyment on the court, they were outclassed in a battle of British No 1s by a sharp Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper, the top seeds, who reached the quarter-finals of the revamped mixed‑doubles competition with a 4-2, 4-2 win.With one win under their belt and their confidence growing, Pegula and Draper then rolled through their quarter-final against Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev, easing into the semi-finals with an emphatic 4-1, 4-1 victory. They will face Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison on Wednesday afternoon for a place in the final, which takes place on Wednesday night.US Open mixed doubles: Draper/Pegula v Alcaraz/Raducanu and more – liveRead moreIn a draw filled with surreal scratch partnerships, the first bracket was particularly striking. Draper and Raducanu have known each other since their childhood days when they were rising up the national rankings in Great Britain while dreaming of becoming professional players. When in February the US Open announced its “reimagined” mixed‑doubles competition, the two British players pairing up seemed like a logical option. Instead, they found themselves facing each other inside the biggest tennis stadium in the world.Raducanu had played just three doubles tournaments in her entire career before this week and the match started with a reminder of her inexperience as she sprayed a backhand drive volley far wide. That first point set the tone for a difficult day as she was continually vulnerable at the net. Draper and Alcaraz have not spent much more time on the doubles court, either, but it was Draper who tackled the contest with total aggression. He played two great matches, constantly looking to close down the net and punching holes in his opponents with his heavy topspin forehand. He also showed his old friend Raducanu no mercy at all, successfully targeting her throughout their match.Perhaps the most significant result on Tuesday was Draper’s mere presence on the court. He has not competed since his second‑round defeat at Wimbledon last month after opting to withdraw from both the Canadian Open and the Cincinnati Open because of a left forearm injury.After his blistering start to the season, the past few months have been tough with injury and two difficult defeats at the French Open and Wimbledon. One year after his breakthrough semi-final run in New York, he looks fit and ready again.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz celebrate after winning a point.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the partnership between Raducanu and Alcaraz has dominated the headlines since it was announced, the pairing of Draper and Pegula is a result of numerous withdrawals but they have now formed a formidable team. Pegula is one of the most accomplished players across both singles and doubles, the current singles No 4 and a former doubles No 1. Pegula’s solid baseline play and intelligence on the court provided Draper with the platform to continually attack the net, and they have put themselves in position to compete for the title.On Monday night, after hertriumph against Jasmine Paoliniat the Cincinnati Open, Iga Swiatek did not finish her media duties until around 10pm. She and Alcaraz, the men’s champion, travelled from Cincinnati together on a private jet and arrived in New York at 12.50am. Just over 13 hours after finishing her work in Ohio, she was on Grandstand training with her new doubles partner, Casper Ruud. No matter, she put together two brilliant performances to deliver her second and third wins in less than 24 hours.Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the defending champions and the only doubles specialist team in the draw, marched through the rounds in pursuit of another title – and justice for the doubles specialists who have been squeezed out of the competition in order to accommodate the singles stars.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Amid the storm, the Vikings stood firm. And rightly so. After all, Minnesota is no stranger to innovators who challenge convention. This is the home of Prince, a man who wore high heels, embraced gender ambiguity, and redefined masculinity.In an official statement, the Vikings reminded everyone that male cheerleaders – whose numberinclude former US presidents– are nothing new, not only at the amateur and collegiate levels but also in the NFL itself. As of the 2025 season, at least 11 NFL teams include male cheerleaders on their official squads, the first being the Los Angeles Rams back in 2018, when Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies made history on the sidelines and laterperformed at the Super Bowl in 2019. The Minnesota Vikings also reminded people that Shiek and Conn earned their spots through the same competitive process as their peers, much like we football players compete and earn our spots on the roster.I was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 2015, and I’ve been in those locker rooms where the pressure to perform as an athlete, teammate and man can feel overwhelming. The one thing that wasn’t on my mind or any other player’s mind was the cheerleaders.Not because they weren’t talented. Not because they didn’t belong. But because during the game, while they performed on the sidelines or at half-time, we were in huddles, making adjustments on the sidelines, giving our all on the field, or processing and schemes in the locker rooms for the next half. Everyone out there has a job to do, and the cheerleaders are no exception. They’re not there for the players. They’re there for the fans. Which means they should reflectallthe fans.View image in fullscreenLA Rams cheerleaders Napoleon Jinnies, right, and Quinton Peron perform during Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in February 2019.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesThe people expressing outrage over male cheerleaders on the Vikings aren’t talking about work ethic, talent or dedication. Their complaints are even more baseless than the Monday Morning Quarterbacks – a term created to address those who criticize players with the benefit of hindsight.This isn’t about performance at all. It’s about presence. It’s about the mere existence and visibility of men on NFL cheer squads who don’t conform to the rigid, outdated ideas of masculinity that so many use sport, and football in particular, to defend.The New York gunman blamed CTE. I’ve seen that pain and I know silence is deadly | RK RussellRead moreWhat this backlash really reveals is not fear of change, but fear of visibility. The outrage over male cheerleaders isn’t about sports. It’s about control: over masculinity, over image, and over who gets to be seen and celebrated in public spaces or on the global stage of the NFL. It’s the same impulse that drivesanti-LBGTQ+ legislation, the same fear that fuelsbook bans,bathroom bills, andattacks on drag performers. This moment isn’t isolated; it’s part of a broader cultural backlash to liberation.And just as Christian nationalism has long been weaponized to marginalize queer people, so too has sport. Sport is used to draw lines around what’s “American” and “man enough”. But those lines were never drawn for protection; they were drawn for power.The truth is, football isn’t as rugged as society would like us to believe. The power of sport is in its intimacy; its emotional extremity. In the way players and fans alike grieve, cry, pray, dance, and embrace under the lights and flags, and banners. The locker room is one of the few places in American culture where men are allowed to be vulnerable, broken, weep, and to hug in celebration, speak with peers across all cultures and generations, and build themselves up again. When you peel back the helmets and hits, you’ll see what’s always been there: joy, vulnerability, brotherhood, and the undeniable truth that masculinity isn’t fixed, it’s fluid. And that’s not changing.Shiek, Conn, and every male cheerleader across the league aren’t just cheering for a team. They’re cheering for possibility, for the next generation of boys who want to move their bodies with pride, for the kids who don’t see themselves in shoulder pads but still belong in the stadium. Sport isn’t sacred because it resists change. It’s sacred because it brings people together, and the more inclusive that togetherness becomes, the more powerful the game will be.Explore more on these topicsNFLMinnesota VikingsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

That year, the WGC-Cadillac Championshipwas pulled from the resortand relocated to Mexico City after Cadillac ended its sponsorship.At the time, then-commissioner Tim Finchemstressed that the decisionwas “fundamentally a sponsorship issue” and not political, despite Trump’s incendiary remarks on immigration and his insistence the Tour was punishing him for his first US presidential run. “We value dollars for our players,” Finchem said in 2016. “We were not able to secure sponsorship for Doral. From a golf standpoint, we have no issues with Donald Trump. From a political standpoint, we are neutral.”Trump, who had spent $250m redeveloping the Doral property, publicly lashed out at the Tour and quipped that he hoped officials had “kidnapping insurance” for the event’s new Mexican host city. For the next decade, the Blue Monster fell off the PGA calendar and instead became a regular site for the upstart LIVGolfseries, serving as a centerpiece in the Saudi-backed league’s schedule.Now the course returns at a moment of transition for thePGA Tour. The Miami Championship expands the roster of Signature Events to nine and sits at the heart of a crowded spring. Beginning with the Masters in April, players will face four Signature Events and two majors in a seven-week stretch, with only the Zurich Classic in New Orleans breaking the run.Next season's PGA TOUR schedule is here!2026, we're ready for you 💪pic.twitter.com/yRT2iRavba— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR)August 19, 2025“We’re excited to showcase the game’s greatest players competing at golf’s most iconic venues,” said Brian Rolapp, the Tour’s new chief executive. “Inspired by our players and fans, we’re accelerating the Tour’s evolution and ushering in a new era of innovation on and off the course.”The Miami Championship is expected to secure a title sponsor before its debut. Its addition shifts the Mexico Open into the FedExCup Fall and removes the Barracuda Championship in California, which had been played opposite the British Open.Doral has been synonymous with PGA Tour golf since 1962, when it launched as the Doral Open. It became a World Golf Championship site in 2007 but struggled to sustain sponsorship after Trump’s 2012 purchase of the property. The 2016 split was, in Finchem’s words, pragmatic rather than political, though it coincided with Trump’s polarizing rise.Explore more on these topicsPGA TourDonald TrumpLIV Golf SeriesGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Partly, that is thanks to baby Clara’s arrival a couple of months ago, which has dominated most of the summer. The rest of it has been dictated by a job relocation to Hawaii where he has been given a three-year posting as a personnel officer in the US air force. The air hockey table at his Oahu home is the only professional-style playing surface in the whole multi-island state.Shorn of suitable playing partners, Cummings has geared up for his tilt at a sixth successive world crown in an unconventional manner. Irregular solo practises – increasingly infrequent since Clara’s birth – have been the air hockey equivalent of a tennis player hitting balls against a wall. He has also attempted to keep track of opponents on the mainland through video streams of their matches, but his main physical activity of late involves surfing Hawaii’s famous waves.Brazilian table tennis star denied entry to US due to having competed in CubaRead moreAged just 26, Cummings is already almost universally considered the air hockey GOAT (Greatest Of All Time). Two other players, Danny Hynes and Jesse Douty, are tied with his 12 world titles, but that pair are generally bracketed alongside a couple of others on the second rung of air hockey’s all-time pyramid. But the general consensus is that Cummings, alone, stands at the top.It was he who, at 16, became the youngest ever world champion in the sport – and Cummings is absolutely adamant that air hockey is a sport. And it is he who has relinquished just one of the 13 world championships held over the past decade. Ask the man himself and he is in no doubt over his GOAT status: “Oh hell yeah, bro, I got to be. I’ve even got a little goat sticker on my mallet.”Most people Cummings encounters are surprised to hear that air hockey even possesses a competitive life outside arcades and home basements. Played on a low-friction table, with opposing players attempting to hit the puck into goals using handheld mallets, the elite side of the sport has, in fact, been around for almost 50 years, beginning soon after air hockey’s invention.Texas, North Carolina, Illinois and Idaho are America’s four major competitive hubs, while the recent boom in barcades – drinking establishments featuring retro entertainment offerings – has provided a resurgence in pockets across the country. Aside from a Venezuelan contingent, and a smattering of Russians and Spaniards, air hockey tends to be an all-American affair.Cummings’ route in began when his family relocated to Texas in 2009 and happened to move across the road from the world No 4 player. Invited over for a game by the man’s son – who was the top-ranked Under-12 player – Cummings received a pasting and vowed not to let it happen again: “I instantly knew I had to beat the kid. He was so cocky.”Within six months, the Cummings family found a small table of their own at a garage sale; half a year later, they had upgraded it to a professional-standard table. While Colin emerged as the star, air hockey quickly became something for the whole family to play. His younger brother Connor is ranked world No 3, while their father, Mike, is No 15. As he has done for close to a decade, Colin tops the pile.In the smallest of niche sporting ponds, the biochemistry graduate is a superstar. But unlike his world-beating peers – think Roger Federer, Lionel Messi or Oleksandr Usyk – he receives next to no external recognition.“It’s definitely a challenge,” he says, of his vastly contrasting lives on and off the air hockey table. “I have to be versatile.“I have my air force persona where I have to embody a leadership character. Then there’s the air hockey champion persona where I walk into a room and people all want to meet me when I have no idea who they are. Then there’s normal life.“I remember when I won my first world title in 2015, I went back to my day job where I was a salad boy/janitor, just mopping the floor in a hair net. I’d gone from being world champion to mopping floors.”In the fledgling days of his relationship with his now-wife Meg, Cummings sent her a video link of an interview he did with CNN. “She was like: ‘You’re the world champion? What the heck?’ But she’s very supportive.”So much so that husband and wife even joined forces to claim world doubles silver in 2022, although Cummings suggests that was a one-off: “If I’ve not been playing at all in Hawaii, then she’s definitely not been playing.”The furthest any possible discontent stretches is Meg forlornly enquiring whether they might vacation farther afield than Texas, where the world championships usually take place. That return to familiar soil does at least mean they can forego expensive hotel bills and stay with family for free during competition.In a sport that offers about $2,000 prize money for winning the world title, Cummings suggests he has “at least broken even, if not made money” over the course of his career. When not based in Hawaii, he had also previously earned modest sums through sponsorship from small companies.The ultimate ambition is to “break out of this niche bubble and turn into something that’s multinational and well cemented”. The closest comparison, he says, would be to emulate the growth of table football or foosball – which has produced men and women’s world champions from 10 different countries over the past two decades – and, eventually, table tennis.Until then, Cummings must content himself with the adulation of a select few and the ignorance of the masses. When he returns from this week’s world championships, he intends to hold an exhibition tournament at home in Hawaii for his air force colleagues, who all believe they can beat him. “So I’ll toast them all,” he says. Wayne Gretzky never had to deal with such disrespect.Explore more on these topicsSportHockeyOlympics 2012: table tennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the grandiosity of thecircus-tent-like structure attracted widespread attention, something else did, too: as part of this project, United are planning to secure land not by paying for it themselves – but by having the UK government do it for them.In order to clear the site that the club wants to use, a rail freight hub will need to be moved to out near St Helens, between Manchester and Liverpool. The cost of moving the hub is estimated to be between £200m and 300m ($270-405m), but that may be an optimistic appraisal; in the past, the project budget wasestimated at closer to £1bn($1.35bn).Politicians supporting United’s plan, like Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, have stressed that no public money will be used to build the stadium. But that appears to be a bit of verbal trickery: United’s new stadium cannot be built as planned without moving the freight rail hub; if the government pays to move the hub, they save United from having to do so themselves. (Manchester United declined to respond to a request for comment.)Manchester United’s ‘Wembley of the North’ stadium plan hits the buffersRead moreThe plan’s proponents back it by promising it wouldconfer grand economic benefitsto Greater Manchester – 92,000 new jobs! 17,000 new homes! 1.8 million additional tourists! – and would be worth over £7bn annually to the UK economy. Sebastian Coe, the chair of the Old Trafford Regeneration Taskforce and a key organizer behind the 2012 London Olympics,has said“I don’t think I’m overstating when I say this actually has the potential to be, not only a bigger project than London 2012 but, in terms of European scope and scale, probably the biggest thing that’s ever really been undertaken.”If United do secure hundreds of millions of pounds of public money as an ancillary part of the stadium project, the club, knowingly or otherwise, would be continuing a long and ignoble tradition that has become commonplace in America. In the UK, it’s relatively rare for big sports teams to benefit from public money. In the US, however, it’s such a common practice that the record for the largest public subsidy given to a team has been repeatedly shattered in recent years. The Las Vegas Raidersreceived $750m (£555m)in 2016. The Buffalo Billsgot $850m (£629m)in 2022. The Washington Commanders are now in the process of landingover $1bn(£740m).And all that has happened despite a consensus among American academics that massive injections of public money towards major stadium projects have not led to the widespread economic benefits they promised. “That’s the story they tell to get the public money, but it’s the big lie” of the stadium funding debate, says Pat Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project, “We [in the US] export a lot of problematic things. And I really hope that we don’t exportthatbig lie.”Adds Geoffrey Propheter, a professor at the University of Colorado-Denver: “In the US, my colleagues and I have the benefit of [decades] worth of examples. We have gotten to see how government intervention in sports facilities has evolved into this monster.” According to Propheter, out of the approximately 125 major league sports facilities across five major men’s leagues – MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLS – only about 10% do not or have not received public money in some form.Sunderland to object over council’s housing plans at Stadium of LightRead moreIn the UK, West Ham and Manchester City play in stadiums built with public money, but in both cases the facilities were built for one-off sporting events (the 2012 Olympics and the 2002 Commonwealth Games, respectively) and then repurposed. According to research by the University of Michigan professor Stefan Szymanski, smaller clubs lower down the pyramid – such as Swansea City and Colchester United – have received some public money, but that spending was seen more as an investment into a community asset like a library or a school rather than as an economic generator.“In the US it is almost taken as a given now that any new facility will receive taxpayer funding,” says Garofalo. “It’s the ones that don’t that stand out as oddballs.”The story that Manchester United are telling now is the same one that American sports owners have told, again and again, despite a voluminous andstill-growing body of proofthat the story isn’t real.“I stress to my friends in the UK – all the evidence here shows that it’s not true,” Garofalo says. “You are setting this money on fire. And you are doing this to support a massive private business thatprintsmoney.”View image in fullscreenHadlock Field, home to the Portland Sea Dogs, got renovated recent as the team received a $2m tax break.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesIn 2024, the Portland Sea Dogs – a minor league baseball team in Maine – received a $2m tax break. While the sums of money and the size of the teams being discussed vary widely, there is a parallel between the Sea Dogs and Manchester United: both effectively disguised their solicitations for public money. Just as United aren’t asking for hundreds of millions of pounds to go into their stadium construction budget, the Sea Dogs didn’t ask for $2m to be put in their bank account. But by not having to pay $2m in taxes, that’s effectively what the Sea Dogs got.Maura Pillsbury of the Maine Center For Economic Policy was part of a network of locals and legislators who pushed back on the Sea Dogs’ tax break, ultimately unsuccessfully. When imagining what she would share with folks in Manchester as they contemplated United’s plan, she says, “Everybody here loves the Sea Dogs and I’m sure everybody there loves Manchester United” (City fans aside, of course) “so it’s hard to say no to. But I would encourage them to think about what they’re sacrificing. Other people are going to have to pay for that.

Meanwhile, the Sea Dogsrecently unveiled the results of the renovationpaid for in part by their tax break. “That was another dagger,” Pillsbury says. “Giving the Sea Dogs $2m – that was a policy choice. Where could have this money gone instead? That’s childcare subsidies, that’s healthcare, that’s food on kids’ plates. The emotional, feelgood nature of these proposals belie the actual reality – there’s a cost and a consequence to making these decisions.”View image in fullscreenThe NFL’s Raiders moved from Oakland to Las Vegas in 2020 after getting $750m of public money to build Allegiant Stadium.Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesPropheter says that to “get to where we are now” – where American pro teams have received billions in public money payouts – “it took about 50 years of these stadium messes. I wonder if across the pond, folks are like: ‘Hey, we can get to where America is because we can learn from the NFL, MLB – we can get to ballooning subsidies even faster.’”One thing standing in the way of this dangerous precedent blossoming in the UK may be the agency of the fans. As United seeks to benefit from public money, will fans – imagining where else their tax pounds could go – push back?The $62m question: does a high school really need a professional-style stadium?Read moreAmerican fans “live in a world of fear,” says the University of Michigan’s Stefan Syzmanski, “because of what terrible thing might happen to them” – namely, their team being taken away.When a team owner in the US asks for public money, there is the implicit or explicit threat of the owner moving the team if the municipality doesn’t cough up the dough. “As a matter of rote reflex,” Garofalo says, “they threaten to move the team. They have all the leverage to demand these subsidies” lest they have to rip up the team and move away – as, for example, happened when the NFL’s Chargersleft San Diego for Los Angeles. “The fans treat the team as a community asset and the owners treat it as a private business.”But while American sports fans seem to respect team owners’ legal right to manipulate them by threatening to leave, in the UK, Szymanski says, the thinking is different. Relocating your team is “a borderline criminal activity.” And in general, fans don’t think the owners of their teams should get to do whatever they want.“Manchester United fans do not actually believe” that its proprietors, the Glazer family and Jim Ratcliffe, “own Manchester United,” Szymanski says. “That might be the legal position but the reality” is that they, the club’s supporters, are “the true owners” and that the Glazers and Ratcliffe are “temporary stewards – and pretty shitty ones, at that.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedBusiness of soccerPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Championship promotion races and playoffs, the ill winds of struggling in the Premier League have nothing on the fever-dream pressures of trying to turn around an ailing Glaswegian giant.Martin may be the true believer in his processes but in an environment where snap decisions are often sustained, he will not have long to set them in place. “I think the precursor to change is pain,” he said after an agonising night for Rangers fans. “I knew coming here that there was going to be some pain early on.”‘Trust is lost’: Isak accuses Newcastle of broken promises in transfer dramaRead moreThe likelihood of Rangers playingChampions Leaguefootball rather than Europa League this season is only an outside chance following a first-half performance of rank ineptitude. The tone and probably the two‑leg tie were set by a horrible opening 20 minutes in which three soft goals were conceded.Until improvement in the second half offered crumbs of redemption, Martin’s chances of bending one of football’s haughtiest, venerable institutions to his blue-sky thinking looked ever more bleak.Christos Tzolis, reportedly high on Crystal Palace’s list should Eberechi Eze depart, was Brugge’s danger man, the veteran Hans Vanaken was the roving playmaker. They did not need long to hit their straps, aided by the negligence of their opponents.Ibrox had initially backed its men. Europa League qualification banked, Rangers began their task positively. But only briefly. In the third minute came one of those moments scarring Martin’s reputation. Within seconds of their striker Danilo shooting, Rangers were a goal down. The rebound reached Tzolis, the onward ball caught Nasser Djiga dozing with goalkeeper Jack Butland stranded. Romeo Vermant’s finish was exquisite, if granted the freedom of Govan. “That changes the whole feeling of the game,” Martin said. “Then we make so many decisions out of anxiety.”To compound disaster, Rangers’ malfunctioning zonal marking allowed Jorne Spileers to stroke home Vermant’s corner four minutes later. By the 20th minute, more disaster, Brandon Mechele celebrating his 500th Brugge appearance by seizing on a loose ball, drilling home unchallenged. Such grim, ugly exposure sent fans barrelling for the exits.Whatever Martin is attempting, such moments surely decimate his chances of long-term survival. Never in 61 years of European football had a Rangers team fallen so far behind so quickly.View image in fullscreenRussell Martin holds his head in anguish during a painful defeat.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PANicky Hayen, the Brugge coach, was at nearby Haverfordwest while Martin managed Championship Swansea in the 2021-22 season. In 2025, the gulf between their teams during the first 45 minutes was aching. The fans’ half-time reaction was rancorous and Rangers players at least returned with higher energy.Their grain of hope soon arrived. Jayden Meghoma, debuting on loan from Brentford – the captain, James Tavernier, having been benched – supplied Danilo for a close-range finish. Finally positivity reinjected by the attacking football Martin evangelises. “We need to give the supporters more moments like we did in the second half, really making them feel what’s going to come,” Martin said, still confident in brighter, better days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It looked marginal. “Lucky we had VAR,” the veteran former Liverpool goalkeeper said. That stopped the roof being raised; there would be no comeback.At least Rangers were improved from that initial farce. Mignolet was the busier goalkeeper as the first leg concluded. Rangers had hardly redeemed themselves yet Martin took heavy positives ahead of the second leg.“Tonight, the level of resilience the team showed, we will grow a lot from that,” he said. “I really believe that. We have the privilege and the beauty of being in that position of hunting and chasing.”Even Martin the eternally bullish optimist would recognise that better – much better – must follow if Ibrox is to host the Champions League group stage with him in the dugout.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueRangersClub BruggeEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

USA Swimming’s failure runs deeper than medals | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreThe reason for Gardner’s removal wasn’t disclosed. But court records obtained exclusively by the Associated Press show the coach was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow’s and secretly recording others undressing in a gym bathroom at his prior job in Mississippi.Last week, more than three years after being suspended from coaching, the FBI arrested Gardner, 38, on a federal child sexual abuse images charge. But his disciplinary case has still not been resolved by SafeSport, which handles sex-abuse cases in Olympic sports.In cases like Gardner’s, the public can be in the dark for years while SafeSport investigates and sanctions coaches. SafeSport requires that allegations be reported to police to ensure abusers don’t run unchecked outside of sports, but critics say the system is a slow, murky process.“From an outward operational view, it seems that if SafeSport is involved in any way, the situation turns glow-in-the-dark toxic,” said attorney Steve Silvey, a longtime SafeSport critic who has represented people in cases involving the center.While acknowledging there can be delays as its investigations unfold, SafeSport defended its temporary suspensions in a statement as “a unique and valuable intervention” when there are concerns of a risk to others.Nevertheless, in 2024, Gardner was able to land a job helping care for surgical patients at an Iowa hospital – two years after the abuse allegations against him were reported to SafeSport and the police.And it was not until late May that West Des Moines police executed a search warrant at his home, eventually leading to the recovery of a trove of photos and videos on his computer and cellphone of nude young girls, court records show.Authorities in Iowa sealed the court documents after the AP asked about the investigation earlier this month, before details of the federal charge were made public Friday. Gardner, Qiao and Gardner’s former employer in Mississippi did not respond to AP requests for comment.Chow’s Gymnastics is best known as the academy where US gymnasts Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas trained before becoming gold medalists at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.Qiao opened the gym in 1998 after starring on the Chinese national team and moving to the United States to coach at the University of Iowa. The gym became a draw for top youth gymnasts, with some families moving to Iowa to train there.Gardner moved to Iowa in September 2018, jumping at the opportunity to coach under Qiao.“This is the job that I’ve always wanted. Chow is really someone I have looked up to since I’ve been coaching,” Gardner told the ABC affiliate WOI-TV in 2019. “And you can tell when you step foot in the gym, just even from coaching the girls, the culture that he’s built. It’s amazing. It’s beautiful.”A year later, Gardner was promoted to director of Chow’s Winter Classic, an annual meet that draws more than 1,000 gymnasts to Iowa. He also coached a junior Olympics team during his four-year tenure at Chow’s.Several of his students earned college gymnastics scholarships, but Gardner said he had bigger goals.“You want to leave a thumbprint on their life, so when they go off hopefully to school, to bigger and better things, that they remember Chow’s as family,” he said in a 2020 interview with WOI-TV.Gardner is accused of abusing his position at Chow’s and his former job at Jump’In Gymnastics in Mississippi to prey on girls under his tutelage, according to a nine-page FBI affidavit released Friday that summarizes the allegations against him.A girl reported to SafeSport in March 2022 that Gardner used “inappropriate spotting techniques” in which he would put his hands between her legs and touch her vagina, the affidavit said.It said she alleged Gardner would ask girls if they were sexually active and call them “idiots, sluts, and whores.” She said this behavior began after his hiring in 2018 and continued until she left the gym in 2020 and provided the names of six other potential victims.SafeSport suspended Gardner in July 2022 – four months after the girl’s report – a provisional step it can take in severe cases with “sufficient evidentiary support” as investigations proceed.A month after that, the center received a report from another girl alleging additional “sexual contact and physical abuse,” including that Gardner similarly fondled her during workouts, the FBI affidavit said. The girl said that he once dragged her across the carpet so hard that it burned her buttocks, the affidavit said.SafeSport shared the reports with West Des Moines police, in line with its policy requiring adults who interact with youth athletes to disclose potential criminal cases to law enforcement.While SafeSport’s suspension took Gardner out of gymnastics, the criminal investigation quickly hit a roadblock.Police records show a detective told SafeSport to urge the alleged victims to file criminal complaints, but only one of their mothers contacted police in 2022. That woman said her daughter did not want to pursue criminal charges, and police suspended the investigation.Victims of abuse are often reluctant to cooperate with police, said Ken Lang, a retired detective and associate professor of criminal justice at Milligan University.“In this case you have the prestige of this facility,” he said. “Do they want to associate their name with that, in that way, when their aspirations were to succeed in gymnastics?”Police suspended the investigation, even as Gardner was on probation for his second-offense of driving while intoxicated.The case stayed dormant until April 2024 when another former Chow’s student came forward to the West Des Moines Police Department to report abuse allegations, according to a now-sealed affidavit signed by police detective Jeff Lyon. The AP is not identifying the student in line with its policy of not naming victims of alleged sexual abuse.The now 18-year-old told police she began taking lessons from Gardner when she was 11 or 12 in 2019, initially seeing him as a “father figure” who tried to help her get through her parents’ divorce. He told her she could tell him “anything,” the affidavit said.When she moved in 2021, she told police, he gave her a hug and said she could text and follow him on Instagram and other social media sites, where he went by the nickname “Coach Seanie,” because gym policy barring such contact no longer applied.According to a summary of her statement provided in Lyon’s affidavit, she said Gardner fondled her during exercises, repeatedly touching her vagina; rubbed her back and butt and discussed his sex life; and made her do inappropriate stretches that exposed her privates.She told police she suspected he used his cellphone to film her in that position.Reached by the AP, the teen’s mother declined comment. The mother told police she was interested in a monetary settlement with Chow’s because the gym “had been made aware of the complaints and they did nothing to stop them,” according to Lyon’s affidavit. The gym didn’t return AP messages seeking comment.It took 16 months after the teen’s 2024 report for the FBI to arrest Gardner, who made an initial court appearance in Des Moines on Friday on a charge of producing visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, which can carry up to 30 years in prison. A public defender assigned to represent him didn’t return AP messages seeking comment.It’s unclear why the case took so long to investigate and also when the FBI, which had to pay $138m to Nassar’s victims for botching that investigation, got involved in the case.Among evidence seized by investigators in late May were a cellphone, laptop and a desktop computer along with handwritten notes between Gardner and his former pupils, according to the sealed court documents.They found images of girls, approximately 6 to 14 years in age, who were nude, using the toilet or changing into leotards, those documents show. Those images appear to have come from a hidden camera in a restroom.They also uncovered 50 video files and 400 photos, including some that appeared to be child sexual abuse images, according to the FBI affidavit. One video allegedly shows Gardner entering the bathroom and turning off the camera.Investigators also found images of an adult woman secretly filmed entering and exiting a bathtub, and identified her as Gardner’s ex-girlfriend. That woman as well as the gym’s owner, Candi Workman, told investigators the images appeared to come from Jump’In Gymnastics’ facility in Purvis, Mississippi, which has since been closed.SafeSport has long touted that it can deliver sanctions in cases where criminal charges are not pursued as key to its mission. However, Gardner’s ability to land a job in health care illustrates the limits of that power: It can ban people from sports but that sanction is not guaranteed to reach the general public.While not commenting about Gardner’s case directly, it said in a statement provided to AP that a number of issues factor into why cases can take so long to close, including the 8,000 reports it receives a year with only around 30 full-time investigators. It has revamped some procedures, it said, in an attempt to become more efficient.“While the Center is able and often does cooperate in law enforcement investigations,” it said, “law enforcement is not required to share information, updates, or even confirm an investigation is ongoing.”USA Gymnastics President Li Li Leung called the center’s task “really tough, difficult to navigate.”“I would like to see more consistency with their outcomes and sanctions,” Leung said. “I would like to see more standardization on things. I would like to see more communication, more transparency from their side.”As the investigation proceeded, Gardner said on his Facebook page he had landed a new job in May 2024 as a surgical technologist at MercyOne West Des Moines Medical Center. It’s a role that calls for positioning patients on the operating room table, and assisting with procedures and post-surgery care.Asked about Gardner’s employment, hospital spokesman Todd Mizener told the AP: “The only information I can provide is that he is no longer” at the hospital.Meanwhile, the case lingers, leaving lives in limbo more than three years after the SafeSport Center and police first learned of it.“SafeSport is now part of a larger problem rather than a solution, if it was ever a solution,” said attorney Silvey. “The most fundamental professional task such as coordination with local or federal law enforcement gets botched on a daily basis, hundreds of times a year now.”Explore more on these topicsGymnasticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

That is how many Tests Brazil’s women’s rugby union team have played, only six more than England played in 2024 alone. The Yaras have recorded five wins but one of those was history-making: a first victory against Colombia last June that secured qualification for the Rugby World Cup. They will be the first South American country at the women’s tournament and the firstBrazilteam, male or female, to compete in rugby’s global showpiece. “It is incredible,” says their captain, Eshyllen Coimbra.The remarkable story began in 2008 with their first international match. Brazil lost 10-0 to the Netherlands in what would be their sole fixture before an 11-year hiatus, mainly due to a lack of regional opponents. Brazil’s union focused on women’s sevens and rugby league before the 15s team were revived in 2019. One of the main reasons for doing so was the potential for World Cup qualification.Women’s Rugby World Cup: the definitive guide to the poolsRead moreFor the 2021 tournament (staged in 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) Brazil were beaten by Colombia in a qualifier, the victors going on to lose to Scotland in a playoff. However, for the expanded 2025 tournament, South America was granted a guaranteed qualification spot. That place was decided in a winner-takes-all encounter between Brazil and Colombia.Brazil came away with a convincing 34-13 victory in which Coimbra was one of the try-scorers. The captain was emotional when the full-time whistle blew, but World Cup qualification was not the first thing on her mind.“It was a very unbelievable thing to win the game against Colombia because we had about six or seven losses before that game, it was the first time we won,” says Coimbra, who has a full-time player contract with Brazil and is also studying journalism. “I wasn’t thinking about the Rugby World Cup, it was the first win, and I couldn’t believe it.“I started to think about the World Cup the next day and I just thought: ‘I cannot believe I am in the tournament.’ I’m so glad we made it and it is incredible to achieve it.”The playoff was only the second win in the team’s history, the first coming against Portugal in December 2023. Emiliano Caffera took charge just after the Portugal victory and the head coach, who is also in charge of the men’s team, focused on developing the players’ skills for the 15-a-side game, with many of the players transitioning from sevens.He says: “All of the skills of sevens start the preparation for 15s. I had to work on the weaknesses which were the scrum, maul, defence and kicking game. We really focused there. The scrum-half, the No 10s, didn’t have the knowledge of 15s, so we had to start from scratch … that was the key to start making that history that we didn’t have.”Many of the squad also bring rugby league knowledge. One of the most experienced players is Edna Santini, who is poised to become the first player to appear at a Rugby World Cup, Rugby World Cup Sevens, Sevens World Series, Olympic Games and a Rugby League World Cup.The 33-year-old says: “It is a very important personal milestone. Having the opportunity to play each tournament is really meaningful to me. To conquer everything with Brazil rugby, it’s so important.”View image in fullscreenEdna Santini has already appeared in a Rugby League World Cup and an Olympic Games.Photograph: fotojumpSantini and the rest of squad are keen to make it clear they are not at the 2025 tournament just to make up the numbers. They want to make an impact, while acknowledging the difficulty of their pool.Pool D contains South Africa, Italy and France, three opponents they have never played, all of whom will be favourites. Positive results may be difficult to come by so what will success look like? The message is clear throughout the squad.“It is an opportunity to show the Brazilian way to play rugby,” Coimbra says. “We want to do our best, without looking at results. We want to surprise people and make people see what Brazil rugby is about. Each game there are expectations to play the best rugby we can but the main goal is to show Brazilian rugby for the first time.”Santini says: “Brazil being in the World Cup is new, we have high expectations in terms of doing our best, playing the hardest we can. We want to show we trained really hard to represent the Brazil rugby union in the best way we could.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the Springboks have far more experience, Italy and France are another step ahead.Caffera believes his side are capable of causing an upset. The 46-year-old, who played for Uruguay at the men’s 2003 Rugby World Cup, says: “For me it is the game that, if we do all good things and we have an amazing day, maybe we can do it. I don’t think it’ll happen against Italy or France. But with the weaknesses of South Africa and our strengths, maybe that can be the day.”View image in fullscreenThe Brazil squad face a tough challenge but are determined to show their abilities.Photograph: João Neto/FotojumpRegardless of results, the coach believes the tournament will hugely benefit his squad. He says the experience of playing Tier 1 nations will be significant but to continue to progress they need more games. The creation of a South American tournament would be the answer for Caffera but he understands the challenges – nations such as Argentina and Chile do not have established women’s teams.The coach adds: “It’s [about] playing with big countries and playing in big tournaments. At the moment we don’t have that and we don’t have that on the continent, it’s going to be hard for us growing in the future without a 15s tournament. We really need a South American tournament to grow this team and grow the young players too. If we want to be a good team in the future we need to grow the young players and for me tournaments and games like that are key.“WXV [World Rugby’s annual global women’s 15s competition] started some things but it is only one tournament for us. We don’t have Six Nations, we don’t have a strong club league, we don’t have Super Rugby Americas for women, we need to send players to other clubs and countries. That is going to be the start because here we don’t have anything. It is going to be really hard for World Rugby to give us more games. Players have to go to other countries like England, Italy, Spain, USA, New Zealand. We have good players, they need to play more.”Brazil will break new ground at this World Cup; the next challenge is ensuring it is not their last.This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Its global success, despite only 89 seconds of action and a farcical ending, set the tone for the sport’s development in the modern era.Promoted simply as “He’s Back”, the contest was Tyson’s return after a three-year imprisonment for rape, but the former undisputed heavyweight champion’s popularity seemed to have increased. Among those ringside at a sold-out MGM Grand sat Madonna, Nicolas Cage, Jerry Seinfeld, Denzel Washington, Jim Carrey, Pamela Anderson, Eddie Murphy and an alarmingly human-coloured Donald Trump. All in attendance to see something akin to a ritual sacrifice.My punishment for calling the Hundred the worst thing in cricket? A day at the Hundred | Barney RonayRead more“Tyson brought out a crowd unlike anything I’ve ever known,” says the sportscaster Jim Gray, who covered the fight for Showtime. “Mike would even say: it goes from billionaires to the pimps and the drug dealers, to the chairman of the board and the highest celebrity. Mike was very proud he attracted everybody – and everybody did come out that night. We haven’t seen anything like it since.”McNeeley, the chosen fall guy to help Iron Mike shake off his ring rust, certainly enlivened the buildup. “I am going to wrap Mike Tyson in a cocoon of horror,” he said, during a barrage of pre-fight bluster that included poetry, bold predictions and lame gags. But it was his brooding opponent who was expected to provide the punchline.“McNeeley was being billed as an up-and-coming fighter with a 36-1 record, most of his wins by knockout,” says Steve Albert, the commentator who called the fight in the US. “But when you looked at his list of opponents, you just shook your head.”Even considering the 29-year-old Tyson’s long layoff, the gulf in class pointed to dangerous matchmaking.“You’re not going to put Tyson in there with a top-notch contender in his first fight back, but this wasn’t a Rocky movie – it was a sanctioned fight,” says Albert. “It had the feel of an exhibition match, which was a disservice to the fans in the arena, the TV viewers and the media, including us, the ringside announcers.“Tyson-McNeeley was not only a way to reintroduce Tyson: it was about money and TV ratings. And it was also about seeing Tyson knock somebody – anybody – out.”View image in fullscreenNearly 30 years after his fight with Peter McNeeley, Mike Tyson was back in the ring at the age of 58 to fight YouTuber Jake Paul.Photograph: Kevin Jairaj/USA Today SportsFans did not even get to see that. After an in-ring stare down, the underdog kept to his pre-fight promise and rushed at Tyson, swinging bar-room haymakers. He soon found himself on the canvas, but instantly got up and started jogging around the ring. “He went down, but then he jumped right up like a jack-in-a-box,” Tyson later recalled. “This guy was skipping around the ring and charging back at me. I couldn’t believe this shit.”After a few clumsy exchanges, McNeeley was felled, this time more seriously. “It was a double left hook, followed by a vicious right uppercut,” says Albert. “It was vintage Tyson. McNeeley was badly hurt, but he got up … and then came the chaos and confusion.”The abrupt ending involved McNeeley’s cornermen piling into the ring, despite their charge being gamely ready to go on, causing a disqualification. The messy finish provoked howls of derision from the crowd. The Nevada commission withheld the purse of the defeated fighter’s manager,Vinnie Vecchione, pending an investigation.“It was the easiest $25m Tyson ever made,” says Albert. “McNeeley’s corner probably did their guy a favour. But after the fight there was speculation that somebody in his camp had made a million-dollar bet that the fight wouldn’t last 90 seconds – the official time was 89 seconds of the first round. It just became another bizarre tale in boxing folklore.”The event’s promoter, Don King, somehow kept a straight face when claiming: “This night has been something we can all be proud of.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tyson is an A-lister, but he has the appeal of everyman; trials and tribulations, redemption … back then, it was him coming out of jail. But everybody loves to see a hurricane. They didn’t know what to expect.”View image in fullscreenFloyd Mayweather Jr beating MMA fighter Conor McGregor generated a huge payday but was another mismatched contest.Photograph: Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty ImagesMcNeeley cashed in on his notoriety with adverts for AOL and Pizza Hut, in which he was knocked out by a slice of stuffed crust. Tyson’s comeback continued as a money-making machine but – despite winning two versions of the world title – he never recovered the aura of invincibility shattered byhis 1990 defeat by Buster Douglasand his career ended with a series of limp losses.If the victory against McNeeley was ultimately unsuccessful in launching a second great act in Tyson’s career, it proved something more instructive: that people will pay to see a spectacle above a competitive contest. It paved the way forFloyd Mayweather Jr v Conor McGregor, Tyson v Paul, YouTube boxers and the modern trend of social media influencers profiting by throwing themselves into the arena. For Tyson, it showed that despite the defeats, the crimes, the personal turmoil, his grip on the public remained as strong as when he burst on to the scene in the 1980s.“I love Tyson, I’ve loved him for ever, because he’s the most honest athlete I’ve ever dealt with,” says Gray. “He knows he has his flaws. He’ll take his medicine when he’s wrong, he doesn’t try to blame others, and he’s trying to be better tomorrow than he was yesterday.”In the yesteryear of 1995, Tyson tested his drawing power in boxing’s greatest nonevent and he discovered that while he may be fallible as a fighter, his ongoing mystique remained bulletproof.Steve Albert’s bookA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Broadcast Boothis out now; Jim Gray hosts the podcast Let’s Go! and wroteTalking to GOATs.Explore more on these topicsMike TysonBoxingUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She becomes the third Arsenal player to receive the PFA women’s award, following in the footsteps of Kim Little in 2013 and Vivianne Miedema in 2019.Caldentey spent July this year in Switzerland, starring for Spain at Euro 2025. She scored the opening goal inthe final against Englandin Basel before ending with a runners-up medal after the Lionesses prevailed on penalties.“Everyone at the club has made it so easy for me and they helped me from the start and it just feels like home and I’m happy to be here,” Caldentey said.“If you ask me my position I don’t know what to answer, but I just enjoy it on the pitch and I just want to help my teammates. They’ve made everything so easy for me so it has been an incredible pleasure.”Caldentey’s new Arsenal teammate Olivia Smith is the women’s young player of the year, with the equivalent men’s award going to Aston Villa’s Morgan Rogers. Smith, a 21-year-old Canada forward, became the most expensive signing in women’s football historywhen she arrived in north Londonfrom Liverpool for £1m last month. Smith scored seven goals in 20 appearances last season and collected a series of player-of-the-year awards on Merseyside.Rogers turned 23 last month and is already a senior England international after scoring 14 goals in 54 appearances in all competitions for Villa last season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an incendiary Instagram message he claimed their relationship “could not continue”.Isak has been endeavouring to force a move to Liverpool all summer but, so far, at least Newcastle have proved resistant,rejecting one £110m bidas they struggle to find replacements.Prolific Salah and Caldentey rewarded with PFA player of the year awardsRead moreThe striker was due to have attended the Professional Footballers’ Association players’ player of the year awards in Manchester on Tuesday having been nominated for the top prize but he sent his apologies via his explosive social media post.Shortly after Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah won the main award for a third time, Isak’s words sent shockwaves through the corridors of power at St James’ Park. “When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can’t continue,” he posted after expressing pride at being voted on to the PFA Premier League team of the 2024-25 season.Isak then thanked his teammates and “everyone at Newcastle” for supporting him along the way before increasing the pressure on the club’s Saudi Arabian owners to sanction his longed-for sale to Anfield.“I’m not at the ceremony tonight,” he posted. “With everything going on, it didn’t feel right to be there.“I’ve kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn’t reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors.“The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading.“When promises are broken and trust is lost the relationship can’t continue. That’s where things are for me right now – and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.”Isak was understood to be furious when what he believed to be a promised pay rise was postponed last summer. At the time he had four years remaining on his contract worth £140,000 a week. His camp claim that last spring he made it clear to Newcastle’s manager and the club that he wanted to leave this summer, but Howe and the board interpret things very differently.This summer Isak skipped the club’s pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea citing a thigh injury, undetectable on scans. He then spent a week training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, an excursion Howe learned about only through the media.More recently Isak has been training alone at Newcastle after other players have departed and he was excluded from a club social barbecue after refusing Howe’s overtures to reintegrate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As explained to Alex and his representatives, we must always take into consideration the best interests ofNewcastle United, the team and our supporters in all decisions and we have been clear that the conditions of a sale this summer have not transpired.“We do not foresee those conditions being met.“This is a proud football club with proud traditions and we strive to retain our family feel.

Minutes earlier, Osasuna had their chance to snatch what would have been an undeserved equaliser but Ante Budimir headed over from inside the six-yard box.“It was important for us to start with a win at home, we knew it was going to be difficult,” Mbappé said. “Osasuna had a clear plan to wait for us and they had Budimir. We are happy with the victory and we are going for more.”WithBarcelona beating Mallorca 3-0in their opening game on Saturday, three points were already a must for Alonso, and he did it without the injured Jude Bellingham, Ferland Mendy, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick, as well as the suspended Antonio Rüdiger.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaKylian MbappéReal MadridOsasunaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Bayern had an offer for the Frenchman – a loan with an option to buy – rejected over the weekend and have so far shown little inclination of wanting to pay enough to buy him. Chelsea’s preference is a permanent sale rather than a loan for Nkunku as he is not part of their long-term plans.Transfer roundup: Leeds close on £18m deal for Milan striker Noah OkaforRead moreInter are also interested in Nkunku, whose contract runs until 2029, but a return to Leipzig two years after leaving them forChelseafor £52m is a possibility. The 27-year-old forward is open to a reunion with his former club, although other options are on the table. A deal with Leipzig is not close but there is confidence that they will be able to come to an agreement with Chelsea on a fee for the France international, who has struggled for form and fitness during his time in west London.The clubs have already held talks over Chelsea adding Simons to their attacking ranks. Chelsea are yet to lodge a bid for the Netherlands international, who wants to move to Stamford Bridge, and hope to move out fringe players before making further additions. Aston Villa are interested in Nicolas Jackson but would need a significant drop in his £80m asking price if they are to pursue a deal for the striker. Jackson wants a new challenge after seeing Chelsea sign Liam Delap and João Pedro.Chelsea have also strengthened on the flanks, signing Estêvão Willian and Jamie Gittens, but they want more depth on the left. They are pushing to sign Garnacho, who is viewed as competition for Gittens, but want United to drop their asking price of £50m for the Argentina winger. Garnacho, who has reportedly turned down a switch to Bayern, has fallen from favour at United and Chelsea are unlikely to want to pay over £40m.Other players expected to leave Chelsea are Tyrique George, Axel Disasi, Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka and Renato Veiga; the latter of whom is a target for Villarreal. Fulham are interested in Raheem Sterling.Meanwhile, West Ham have had a bid rejected for Chelsea’s Andrey Santos. The Hammers are interested in the Brazilian but have been knocked back and have now made an improved offer for the Southampton midfielder Mateus Fernandes.Explore more on these topicsChelseaRB LeipzigBayern MunichTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningTue 19 Aug 2025 11.34 EDTFirst published on Tue 19 Aug 2025 11.05 EDTShareTARK ARTS?We can only speculate about what David Moyes would have said in his post-match press conference if it had been his team who had been awarded a penalty in identical circumstances to those leading to Leeds United scoring their winner againstEvertonlast night, but there really isn’t much point. Like pretty much every football manager, Everton’s tends to be pretty consistent in his view that debatable decisions that go in favour of his players are correct and to be commended, while those which go against them are not and should be criticised. Twas ever thus, so it was no surprise that when James Tarkowski was penalised for deliberately leaning to his left to stop a ball that would otherwise have not struck his arm at a febrile Elland Road, Moyes decided his player and team had been extremely hard done by, even if did seem fairly relaxed and wasn’t in full-on Begbie radge-funk mode.‘Refs have had a poor weekend’: Moyes hits out after Leeds’ penalty winnerRead moreMoyes was far from alone in this view, even if those espoused by former players – the people that some geniuses would have infiltrate Stockley Park’s bunker of squinting windows becausethey’ve played the game– were wildly divergent. BBC pundit Chris Sutton declared the decision “scandalous”, while his Sky Sports counterparts Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher agreed referee Chris Kavanagh had got it right. “I’m obviously going to say it’s not a penalty and I believe it’s not a penalty,”growled Moyes after the game. “I’ve been to see the referee. [Kavanagh] sort of took nothing to do with it, he thought it was to do with VAR, the decision they’ve made. I don’t know what else I can say.” He went on to say plenty as he criticised the standard of refereeing across the board over the weekend just gone, even though it seemed largely fine to Football Daily apart from one or two minor ricks from officialdom.While the misguided reaction of various members of the punditocracy to the entirely correct decision to disallow Eberechi Eze’sfree-kick for Crystal Palace against Chelseaon Sunday demonstrated that no end of former footballers live in blissful ignorance of the laws of the game they are now tasked with discussing for a living, handball is an entirely different kettle of sea bream. Since the introduction of VAR, constant tinkering has rendered the law so diluted, murky and subjective that the fabled “consistency” players, managers and fans everywhere demand has become impossible to achieve.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the handball law has become so opaque and open to interpretation, one suspects a good lawyer could argue convincingly that each and every one of Moyes, his opposite number Daniel Farke, Sutton, Carragher, Neville and all the internet crazies who debated long into the night were spot-on in their assessments of how it was applied against Tarkowski and Everton. A mess that shows no sign of being tidied up anytime soon, handball will continue to be a talking point with each passing match. Such was the paucity of quality at Elland Road, it was in fact theonlytalking point from that particular game.QUOTE OF THE DAY“This achievement isn’t just ours – it belongs to every girl in Bangladesh who dares to dream.

Villa’s xG – for what it is worth – was only 0.13. Enter Evann Guessand? Guessand had a watching brief at Villa Park as his new teammates struggled to penetrate the opposition but presumably Emery is tempted to introduce his £30m signing from Nice, a powerful forward with a penchant for eliminating defenders and tearing down the flanks, in search of victory at Brentford this weekend.For Guessand there are new surrounds, and these remain early days, but the 24-year-old is coming in hot, fresh from a breakout season at Nice where he scored 13 goals in 40 matches (33 of which were starts) and was voted their joint-player of the season after helping the team to fourth in Ligue 1, their highest finish since 2016-17. Guessand’s final goal for Nice came in a 6-0 home win against Brest. The visitors’ goalkeeper that day? Marco Bizot, the 34-year-old Dutchman who is Villa’s only other arrival this summer.‘Don’t lose those stupid points’: Youri Tielemans on Aston Villa lessons, Emery and aiming highRead moreGuessand predominantly featured on the right wing for Nice but also operated off the left, as a No 9 and behind the striker. “He is capable of pulling something out of the bag to make the difference,” says Lilian Nalis, the Nice assistant manager. “If he gets in front of you, it’s difficult for defenders to get him back.”Last season was his first as a regular starter for Nice, for whom he starred domestically and in the Europa League after loans to Lausanne and Nantes. For Nalis, Guessand’s equaliser at Nantes, where he seized the ball in the box, took the briefest of glances at goal and sent a fizzing left-foot shot into the top corner, stands out. “He’s at his best on the wings because there he can take on people, dribble and accelerate beyond defenders with his speed,” says Nalis, the former Leicester and Plymouth defender who spent six years in England. “Evann, with his goals and assists, had a big part in taking us towards the top.”View image in fullscreenEvann Guessand celebrates after scoring for Nice against Auxerre in March 2025.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersGuessand was born in Ajaccio, the capital of Corsica, where his father, Hervé, also a striker, played, and joined Nice aged 12 after being spotted at ASPTT Marseille, a multi-sport youth club. From that point Guessand always felt a fondness for Nice, where he was a boarder at the College du Parc Imperial secondary school, mixing with youngsters aged between 11 and 20, 200km from his family home in Marseille. Nice’s then academy director, Alain Wathelet, wanted to gauge Guessand’s talent so asked him to join an Under-14s session, in which he impressed with his dribbling skills and eye for goal. “Within five minutes, we approved him,” says Nice’s pre-academy coach, Pascal Bistarelli, for whom an Under-15s title-deciding match sticks in the memory. “It was 2-2 at half-time and I asked him to increase his level. It finished 6-2, Evann scored a hat-trick.”Guessand’s education in Nice fuelled his drive to succeed. He was a ballboy and flag bearer at Nice matches and soon grasped the lyrics of Nissa la Bella, Menica Rondelly’s hymn synonymous with the city. “Evann always showed great attachment to Nice, even when he went on loan to Lausanne and Nantes,” says Bistarelli. “He was always determined to play in the Nice first team.” Guessand, who was given his debut against Fréjus Saint-Raphaël in the Coupe de France by Patrick Vieira in 2020, playing as a left winger, has stayed in touch with Bistarelli; the pair exchanged messages when he signed for Villa and Guessand gave him his shirt for Bistarelli’s birthday.Guessand represented France at youth level but made his Ivory Coast debut last year. He grew up idolising Didier Drogba and the pair had dinner in Abidjan a few years ago and have remained in contact. But while Guessand has drawn comparisons to Drogba, unlike the former Chelsea player he is not a conventional No 9. “If you talk about the power he’s got, I would say yes, they are similar, but they’re not the same kind of player,” says Nalis. “Drogba enjoyed the battle of playing when he had his back to goal, a defender on his back. Evann doesn’t like that so much – he prefers almost hugging the touchline so he can see all the information he needs before making his move.”Villa tracked Guessand, who rejected a move to the Saudi Pro League side Neom earlier this summer, for 12 months before his arrival. They moved to sign him, amid strong interest from Crystal Palace, before the£39m sale of Jacob Ramseyto Newcastle and Leon Bailey’s expected exit to Roma to prevent the possibility of being quoted an inflated price for a player who had three years remaining on his Nice contract.View image in fullscreenEvann Guessand surges forward during Aston Villa’s Trofeo de La Ceramica match against Villarreal.Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesVilla acknowledge Guessand’s game requires some refinement but they see shades of Morgan Rogers in a player who is also adept at retaining the ball under pressure. Emery admires his versatility, citing his ability to play across the frontline, including as a No 10. “We are watching him, giving him a lot of information about how we want to build the team,” says Villa’s manager. “He is watching our analysis, our matches. I am using him as a striker and winger [in training]. Finding how to best put him into our structure is my job. He is going to help us a lot, hopefully.”Now Guessand, voted the second-best African player in Ligue 1 last season, behind Paris Saint-Germain’s Achraf Hakimi, plans to build on his promise in the Premier League. “England is a step up,” says Nalis. “You get no time to rest; English football will kick your ass if you think you’re going to take your time or if you think you’re going to ait until you’re capable of playing at your high level. You need to perform.“English football is probably more physical than French but I’ve seen him have some good games against tough guys. I’m looking forward to him showing his skills in England.”Explore more on these topicsAston VillafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Morecambe had come within days of being expelled from league competition and Johal said he hoped to play a part in ensuring such a situation “never happens again”.“I’m extremely proud to be the manager of Morecambe Football Club and I can’t wait to meet the fans and show them what an exciting team we can build that represents them and the town on the pitch,” Johal said.“The short-term plan this year is to make sure that we retain our place in the National League by playing exciting energetic football and working hard. We want to make sure that the situation that happened in Morecambe over the last couple of years never happens again because no club, no town, no people deserve that.”Johal has never held a first-team managerial role before but has built an impressive CV since beginning as a teenage coach in Leicester City’s schools programme. After rising to take full-time charge of the Foxes’ under-18 side, he followed Kolo Touré to Wigan as his assistant, then to Como where he worked alongside Cesc Fàbregas during the Spaniard’s season in charge of the club’s Primavera side. Last year Johal was the manager of Notts County’s B team while also becoming one of the youngest coaches to complete their Uefa Pro Licence.“All in all I have had a number of good experiences,” Johal said. “I’ve been working hard for the past five or six years to be around the right environments so that when I get the opportunity to be a manager I’m successful from the start.“[Being a manager] has been my dream since the age of 14, 15. It’s been my target. Now I have a new target to make Morecambe successful as a club. I want to make sure that this year we don’t just survive, we thrive, and that there are moments in games where we dominate. I want to make sure the fans have a team that thrives in games.”Johal has long been the preferred managerial candidate for Panjab Warriors with the BBC reporting the group had agreed to appoint him before a takeover deal had been completed and with Derek Adams still in place as manager. Adams was relieved of his responsibilities on Monday.Morecambe had beensuspended from competition in the National Leaguewhile the takeover was incomplete. That suspension is now lifted, but the club are believed to have insufficient players on their books to compete and it is likely their scheduled match against Altrincham this Saturday will be postponed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Milan, the player who began his career with Basel before moving to Red Bull Salzburg scored a modest seven goals in 39 league appearances. Those statistics do not reflect the versatility of a forward who can operate in assorted positions, including anywhere across the frontline. He has frequently been deployed as a winger for Switzerland, scoring twice in 24 senior international appearances.Encouragingly for Farke, Okafor proved Milan’s top scorer in pre‑season, with two of his goals coming against Liverpool in a friendly in Hong Kong. The Leeds manager has been keen to sign an extra striker after telling the club’s former No 9 Patrick Bamford that he is surplus to requirements.Wolveshave signed the Cameroon defender Jackson Tchatchoua from Hellas Verona in a deal worth about £10m. The Belgium-born right wing‑back has spent the past two seasons in Serie A after starting his career at Charleroi.Tchatchoua is in effect a replacement for the former club captain Nélson Semedo, who rejected a new contract at Wolves in favour of a move toFenerbahce.View image in fullscreenJackson Tchatchoua was the fastest player in Serie A last season, with a top speed of 36.3km per hour.Photograph: @Wolves/XTchatchoua, who produced the top speed in Serie A last season at 36.3km/h, has signed a five‑year deal.Vítor Pereira, the Wolves manager, is hopeful of making at least two more signings this window, with a forward and a midfielder high on the list of priorities. “[I am] waiting for the help of the club to sign new players,” Pereira said after the home defeat against Manchester City on Saturday.Wolves are wary of Jørgen Strand Larsen being high on Newcastle’s shortlist but consider the striker not for sale. The Norway forward is among Newcastle’s targets amid the protracted Alexander Isak saga after moves for Benjamin Sesko, among others, failed to materialise.Strand Larsen joined Wolves on a permanent basis in July, after the club triggered a £23m deal to buy a player who scored 14 league goals last season while on loan from La Liga side Celta Vigo.Newcastle have so far failed in their attempts to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford, with the London club holding out for what they deem a fair price for the forward, while Eddie Howe’s side have been linked with a move for the out-of-favour Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson.It is thought that only a bid significantly above market value would give Wolves a decision to make on Strand Larsen, who is under contract until 2029.Wolves are open to offloading Hwang Hee-chan this summer, with Crystal Palace pursuing a loan deal for the South Korea forward. Matt Hobbs, the former Wolves sporting director who was influential in bringing Hwang to Molineux from RB Leipzig in 2022, is thought to be close to filling a similar role at Palace, after Dougie Freedman departed for the Saudi side Al-Diriyah.Hwang, who scored only two league goals last season, has dropped down the pecking order under Pereira and was the subject of an inquiry from Birmingham earlier in this window.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The midfielder is surplus to requirements at the London Stadium and freeing up his wages, which are understood to be around £115,000 a week, will increase Graham Potter’s budget for new signings.West Ham value Álvarez at £20m but the finances of the deal have made it hard to find clubs willing to buy the Mexico international. Fenerbahce have emerged as a temporary solution and talks with the Turkish club are progressing. Álvarez has not made a decision on his future, however, and also has loan interest from Porto and Borussia Dortmund.Álvarez has fallen from favour under Potter, who is desperate for additions in midfield after seeing his side crash to a3-0 defeat at Sunderlandin their opening game. West Ham had a £30m bid rejected for Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes last week and were beaten by Newcastle to the signing of Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa.View image in fullscreenEdson Álvarez has fallen out of favour at West Ham under Graham Potter.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesOther options are being explored but the chances of anyone joining before Potter’s side host Chelsea on Friday are receding. Álvarez or Guido Rodríguez need to leave before West Ham move for certain targets, but West Ham are desperately short of energy and creativity in midfield.One of the midfielders signed to fill the void left by Declan Rice’s £105m sale to Arsenal two years ago, Álvarez has flattered to deceive since joining from Ajax for £35m. His lack of pace has been exposed at times and he was sent off twice last season. He was on the bench against Sunderland, with Potter preferring James Ward-Prowse and Rodríguez in midfield.Rodríguez, who joined on a free transfer from Real Betis last summer, is also available. The Argentinian has interest from Spain and Turkey but his high wages have put off prospective buyers. Andy Irving, the 25-year-old Scottish midfielder, is also up for sale.Potter and West Ham’s recruitment chief, Kyle Macaulay, are not working with a big budget this summer. They have signed four players sinceselling Mohammed Kudus to Tottenhamfor £54.5m.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowWolverhampton WanderersWest Ham UnitedFenerbahcenewsShareReuse this content"

The last time England hosted the Women’s Rugby World Cup [in 2010], the girls played at the Stoop around the corner to a crowd of 13,000.“I started playing women’s rugby 30 years ago and the prospect of girls running out of the tunnel, playing to the three tiers of Allianz packed to the rafters, is something perhaps I never hoped or thought I would see and it’s certainly what girls’ dreams are made of.”More than 40,000 tickets have been sold for England’s game against USA but Sally Horrox, the World Rugby chief of women’s rugby, was confident that it would be close to a 50,000 sellout by kick-off. “The sport has grown significantly over the last three years,” she said. “But it’s hugely important now that we make the very most of this opportunity right in front of us over the next six weeks.”Sarah Massey, managing director of the tournament, said that more than 80% of tickets had been sold and that this would rise. She was confident those who had bought tickets would show up and be entranced by the spectacle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This, after all, is supposed to be a non-tribal environment aside from the weekend every two years when Europe face USA and people on either side of the ropes take leave of their senses.Golf’s next pursuit of the holy grail belongs to Tommy Fleetwood. Defeat from positions of strength at the Travelers and St Jude championships threw up an unwanted statistic. In 163PGA Tourstarts, Fleetwood is yet to emerge victorious. As striking as that raw number – Fleetwood’s talent is such that one assumes he should have claimed a batch of trophies in the US – is the fact people are willing him to end his drought. Fleetwood is relatable, likable, popular. He also has no objection to the discussion presently whirling around him.PGA Tour ends decade-long absence from Trump-owned courses with Doral return in 2026Read more“I’m not going to feed you lies and say: ‘Oh, in Memphis I thought I did everything great, or Travelers I didn’t do anything wrong,’” Fleetwood said. “Of course I got things wrong down the stretch and it didn’t happen for me.“You learn from those experiences. I would rather you be questioning me about not finishing tournaments off than not questioning me at all about anything. So I’ve obviously shown a lot of really good stuff and put myself in great positions.“I just want to put myself there again. I want to give myself another chance. I’ll finish it off at some point. I’ll get it right and I’ll get it right more than once. But being there is actually the hard part, in a way.“I don’t feel like I have to rattle off all the good stuff. I just need to be aware of it, know that I’m doing the right things and know that there’s still things that I can get better. I use the disappointments as motivation and I use the good stuff as confidence boosting.”At East Lake this week, another PGA Tour season will conclude. Scottie Scheffler will look to press his dominance of the game by lifting the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup.Just as fate eventually smiled on McIlroy, a two-hour drive away in April, could it finally be Tommy’s time? His reliability and close shave history is emphasised by six runner-up finishes on the PGA Tour, the same number of thirds, 30 top fives and 44 top 10s. He is the 10th-ranked player in the world. “Best case scenario coming down the stretch at East Lake with a chance to win,” Fleetwood said.“Whether I get it right or not, whether it happens or not, whether someone plays better or not, I’ll talk about that at the time. But I would love to get there and give myself that chance again.”View image in fullscreenTommy Fleetwood reacts to his putt on the 15th green during the final round of the Travelers.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesThe 34-year-old has not been burned by falling short. “It’s funny really, you walk off the course on Sunday last week and I was happier with a fourth place finish than I was with a third in Memphis,” Fleetwood said.“It’s a strange game that way. I am very happy with the consistency of my golf and the level I’ve been playing at.Golfis a crazy game. You never know what you’re going to turn up with week in and week out but this year has been a very good year.”Fleetwood knows how to get over the line. He has done it eight times elsewhere in the world. He has been successful when involved in tight scraps. The nature of recent events, as opposed to core results, is what has brought Fleetwood’s situation into sharp focus. He missed out on a playoff in Memphis by a shot, having led by two with three holes to play.At the Travelers,Keegan Bradley usurped Fleetwoodafter the Southport man three-putted the 72nd hole. Fleetwood was clearly dejected during post-tournament media duties at both but there was no raw moment, no smashed club, no fist through a window. Yes, the smile had vanished but not for long.“I get disappointed and I get angry,” Fleetwood said. “I’ve thrown the odd club in the water when I’m out there and maybe feel a bit better for a while. But I’m not that great at being angry. It just doesn’t suit me. I just kind of let it go. I work really hard on letting things go, moving on. Not that much great comes from those moments of anger.“But like I say, like anybody, I get disappointed, I get frustrated, I get angry. I doubt myself. Of course I do. It’s all part of being a professional athlete and part of trying to chase your dreams and accomplish great things against unbelievable golfers.”Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump had weighed in to accuse Britain of behaving like China, telling the prime minister, Keir Starmer: “You can’t do this”.Neither theHome Officenor Apple are commenting on the alleged agreement, which Gabbard said meant the UK was no longer demanding that Apple “provide a ‘backdoor’ that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties”.The transatlantic row began when theHome Office issued a “technical capability notice” to Appleunder the Investigatory Powers Act, which requires companies to assist law enforcement in providing evidence. Apple responded by launching a legal challenge, which the Home Office demanded be kept secret but judges ordered be made public.The US vice-president, JD Vance, also complained saying: “I don’t want American citizens to be spied on.” He said it was “crazy” that “we’re creating a backdoor in our own technology networks that our enemies are now using”.Civil liberties groups cautioned that the backdoor would put politicians, campaigners and minority groups at particular risk of being targeted.In February,Apple responded by withdrawingthe option for its new British customers to enable advance data protection options, saying it was “deeply disappointed” and would never build a backdoor into any of its products. That meant, uniquely, many UK customers were unable to benefit from end-to-end encryption of services, including the iCloud Drive, photos, notes or reminders, making them more vulnerable to data breaches.Gabbard said: “Over the past few months, I’ve been working closely with our partners in the UK, alongside President Trump and Vice-President Vance, to ensure Americans’ private data remains private and our constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected.”It is not clear whether the technical capability notice requiring the data access would be withdrawn altogether or altered. It could in theory be limited to allowing access to the data only of UK citizens, although experts cautioned that could be technologically unrealistic. It also raises the danger that other foreign governments could still find a way to use the backdoor.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We have long had joint security and intelligence arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats, such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in enabling those threats.”It added: “Those arrangements have long contained safeguards to protect privacy and sovereignty: for example the data access agreement includes critical safeguards to prevent the UK and US from targeting the data of each other’s citizens. We will continue to build on those arrangements and we will also continue to maintain a strong security framework to ensure that we can continue to pursue terrorists and serious criminals operating in the UK. We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe.”The UK-US data access agreement allows UK agencies to submit requests for content of communications directly to communications service providers, including social media platforms and messaging services, in the US, but this must be for the purpose of investigating, preventing, detecting, and prosecuting serious crime, officials said.Apple was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAppleComputingEncryptionHome OfficeTrump administrationUS politicsPrivacynewsShareReuse this content"

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, currently enjoying Shirley Jackson’s eerie final novel We Have Always Lived in the Castle.An age of enterprise surveillanceSurveillance is industrializing and privatizing. In the United States, it’s big business, and it’s growing.My colleagues Johana Bhuiyan and Jose Olivares report on the companies aiding Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, which are running a victory lap after their latest quarterly financial reports:Palantir, the tech firm, and Geo Group and CoreCivic, the private prison and surveillance companies, said this week that they brought in more money than Wall Street expected them to, thanks to the administration’s crackdown on immigrants.“Well, as usual, I’ve been cautioned to be a little modest about our bombastic numbers,” said Alex Karp, the Palantir chief executive, in an investor call earlier this week. Then he crowed about the company’s “extraordinary numbers” and his “enormous pride” in its success.Private prison company executives, during their respective calls, could barely contain their excitement, flagging to investors opportunities for “unprecedented growth” in the realm of immigration detention.Read the full story:Companies aiding Trump’s immigration crackdown see ‘extraordinary’ revenuesMeanwhile, Microsoft’s cloud computing product is enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone lines, per an investigation published in the Guardian.Armed with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity, the IDF’s Unit 8200 began building a powerful new mass surveillance tool: a sweeping and intrusive system that collects and stores recordings of millions of mobile phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.The cloud-based system – which first became operational in 2022 – enables Unit 8200 to store a giant trove of calls daily for extended periods of time.Read the full story:‘A million calls an hour’: Israel relying on Microsoft cloud for expansive surveillance of PalestiniansMicrosoft has not been publicly enthusiastic about the surveillance initiative and haslaunched an internal inquiryfollowing the story.Listen:How Israel used Microsoft technology to spy on Palestinians – podcastTurmoil in techRussia restricts WhatsApp and Telegram, alleging apps used for fraud and terrorismCrypto mogul Do Kwon pleads guilty to fraud for $40bn market collapseElon Musk threatens Apple with lawsuit over OpenAI, sparking Sam Altman feudCan’t pay, won’t pay: impoverished streaming services are driving viewers back to piracy‘Shut it down and start again’: staff disquiet as Alan Turing Institute faces identity crisisMeta faces a backlash over child safety yet againView image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg at Siggraph 2024 in Denver, Colorado, on 29 July 2024.Photograph: David Zalubowski/APMeta finds itself under the harsh lens of an investigation by the US Congress, once again over issues of child safety. Senator Josh Hawley opened an investigation into the company late last week. Reuters had surfaced an internal document from the company detailing a policy of allowing AI chatbots to engage in “romantic or sensual” conversations with children. The company has since nixed the guidelines.Everything about the backlash feels familiar.The same reporter that published the initial Reuters story, Jeff Horwitz, broke the Facebook Files story in the Wall Street Journal, which unearthed documents showing that Meta understood that using its social networks could lead teens, particularly girls, into depression. The senator who opened the most recent inquiry, Hawley, likewise grilled Zuckerberg about child safety issues in early 2024.Since so many elements of the controversy are so familiar, will it inspire outrage or apathy? Plausible lines of logic could lead to both. Will this uproar bring stringent regulation down on Zuckerberg’s head? Or will the US populace and lawmakers shrug and say they’ve seen this before?Read the full story:Meta faces backlash over AI policy that lets bots have ‘sensual’ conversations with childrenRobots v humans, physically and emotionallyView image in fullscreenUnitree Robotics humanoid robots compete in a kickboxing match at the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games, in Beijing, China, on  Friday.Photograph: Tingshu Wang/ReutersHumans are facing off against robots IRL and online.

With the new entries, British lexicographers nodded to the influence of the internet on the way we speak and write.“Internet culture is changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the dictionary,” said the dictionary’s lexical programme manager, Colin McIntosh.Among the words were “tradwife”, short for “traditional wife”, and “delulu”, an elongated abbreviation of “delusional”. Both are more notable for their connotations – the former of social conservatism expressed through marital behavior and the latter of the knowing, winking choice to follow a misinformed path – than their denotations.Read the full story:‘Skibidi’, ‘delulu’ and ‘tradwife’ among words added to Cambridge DictionaryOne other, in my mind more interesting, word was entered into the dictionary: skibidi, of “skibidi toilet” fame, referring to a series of animated shorts in which menacing human heads emerge from toilets and do battle with TV-headed men in suits. The toilets begin to sing a part of the songDom Dom Yes Yes, which includes the line “Shtibididob dob dob dob dob yes yes” if the viewer is watching with sound. To English speakers, the first word has been transliterated to “skibidi”.The Cambridge Dictionary defines skibidi as “a word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke’, an example of its use is: ‘What the skibidi are you doing?’”When I was a child, my parents would look on in confusion as my siblings and I watched SpongeBob SquarePants on Saturdays. The show was incomprehensible to them in all ways – premise, plots, visuals, voices. Think of the animated toilets as a gen Alpha successor, delightful to children in bizarreness, doubly so because of the baffled looks on the faces of their parents.“Tradwife” and “delulu” have fixed meanings that refer to real human actions and emotions. “Skibidi”, on the other hand, with its use as an emphatic, humorous filler word with “no real meaning”, per Cambridge refers to nothing so much as the hurtling feeling of scrolling through too many videos in one sitting. When we are so overwhelmed with moving images, conflicting perspectives, and advertising, what words are useful? Perhaps only skibidi.Jean Baudrillard coined the concept of the “simulacra” – words or images without an origin in reality and which refer to no real thing – when writing about the media of his day, especially television. “Skibidi” is a likewise hyperreal word, referring only to the strange and continual refraction of meaning that a particular word has undergone online.“The territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory,” he wrote in 1981.The word does not precede the TikTok, nor survive it. Henceforth, it is the video that precedes the definition.The wider TechScapeMan develops rare condition after ChatGPT query over stopping eating saltIs AI going to steal your job?

Intel is valued at more than $100bn.TheUS government is reportedly also considering taking a stake in Intel. It could be as high as 10%, according to Bloomberg. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Lip-Bu Tan, an industry veteran who took the top job at Intel four months ago, has been tasked with a huge turnaround project at the business. The company has suffered from slow sales and continued losses as it has struggled to maintain its technological edge in recent years.On Tuesday, Tan said Intel was “very pleased to deepen our relationship with SoftBank, a company that’s at the forefront of so many areas of emerging technology and innovation and shares our commitment to advancing US technology and manufacturing leadership”. He had “worked closely together [with Son] for decades”, he added.Donald Trumpinitially called for Tan’s resignation, accusing him of having ties to the Chinese Communist party. However, after meeting Tan in Washington last week, the president praised the Intel boss, saying he had “an amazing story”.If the US government takes a 10% stake in the business, it could surpass the asset manager Vanguard as the chip makers’s single biggest shareholder. It would mark the Trump’s administration latest attempt to intervene in an area of the private sector that it considers nationally strategic.Trump has threatened previously to impose tariffs of up to 100% on imported semiconductors and chips, which could favour Intel as a US-based semiconductor business.Earlier this month, the US government announced a deal that would result in chip makers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices paying 15% of their revenue from Chinese AI chip sales to the US government. In July, the defence department also announced it would take a $400m preferred stake in the US rare-earth producer MP Materials.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The PlayStation 5 had Astro’s Playroom, the Steam Deck had Aperture Desk Job, and for theNintendo Switch 2there’s Drag x Drive. Here, you play competitive wheelchair basketball with the Joy-Con 2’s new mouse mode (which lets you control a game by pushing it along a desk like a computer mouse) – rolling, jumping and shooting in hectic three v three bouts. A solid exhibition of a controller upgrade, to be sure, but Drag x Drive struggles to harness the high-octane nature of the real-world sport, instead delivering a shallow impersonation.As a basketball game, Drag x Drive demands that you spend the majority of your time shooting hoops and racing around the court, each Joy-Con controlling a single wheel on your avatar’s chair. Additionally, you can press the triggers to lift your wheels and jump, or raise each Joy-Con and flick to shoot your shot or pass the ball to a teammate.View image in fullscreenSpouts of joy … Drag x Drive.Photograph: NintendoAs cool as it sounds in theory, this doggedly practical approach isn’t as intuitive as you might expect, and, ironically, not very accessible either. It’s tough to find a comfortable position as you press and roll your palms, so it takes grit to truly master the control scheme. Still, if you can muscle through, there are rare spouts of joy to be found in hitting top speed, bashing into your opponents and taking possession of the ball.Some additional variety comes via the player styles menu, which allows you to jump between different presets based on your preferred approach. Alongside the balanced forward style, which splits your rebounding, strength and quickness skills evenly, the guard style sacrifices the other stats for a speed boost, and the centre position makes you slower but tougher. The ability to switch between styles helps smooth out the rocky onboarding process and allows you to freshen up the gameplay between online multiplayer matches, which are the key focus of the game.At a glance, Drag x Drive is reminiscent of vehicular football simulatorRocket League, with two teams battling it out to score points by pulling off trick shots and smashing into one another. However, where Rocket League excels with its litany of bouncy stadiums and explosive graphics, Drag x Drive attacks the genre with more restraint, trading atmospheric arenas for cold, metallic courts. There is some reprieve in the character customisation menu, where you can alter the colour of your wheels and chair, as well as choose cute headgear such as cat ears or old-timey driving goggles. But it’s a far cry from the warmth and esoteric vibrance that Nintendo is known for.Despite a lack of personality and wrist-cramping controls, there’s an adrenaline rush when players chase you that’s easy to get swept up in, especially when your momentum is dependent on your real-world stamina. There’s also a real sense of pride when you finally land a distance shot, or craft a witty assist. As your confidence grows, you’ll start to see the benefit of the half-pipes that flank the in-game court, allowing you to pull off wicked tricks and earn extra points. Suddenly, simple shots make way for flamboyant slam dunks, and you feel more like a pro.Nintendo Switch 2 review – more than good enoughRead moreBetween bouts of b-ball, there’s also a small pool of repetitive skill-honing side activities to engage with, including a skipping rope minigame, a shooting competition and an obstacle course. Excelling at these challenges and performing well in matches allows you to earn trophies, which unlock more cosmetics to jazz up your avatar’s aesthetic.Despite some efforts in meta-progression, it’s difficult to look past Drag x Drive’s most significant hurdle – that it’s uncomfortable to play for extended periods. The mouse controls are ingenious in theory, and when applied in small bouts, it feels like a novel prototype. But, in the context of such overtly active gameplay, the concept starts to fall apart. What remains is a surprisingly inaccessible sports game that lacks modal variety and a long-term hook. If you were hoping for a spiritual successor to the Nintendo Switch’s Rock ’Em Sock ’Em brawlerArms, you will be disappointed.Drag x Drive is available now, £16.99Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo Switch 2Sports gamesNintendo SwitchNintendoreviewsShareReuse this content"

But for how long?Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.33 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.49 EDTShareThe verdict on Donald Trump’smeeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaderson Monday depends entirely upon the metric used. The great fear was that this might prove a disaster along the lines of the US president’s dressing down of the Ukrainian leader in February – a scenario so plausible that Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and other key European leaders dropped everything to dash to the White House themselves in support.Following his red carpet welcome for Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Mr Trump reportedly backed the ideathat Ukraine should hand over the Donbasto achieve a peace deal. Even if one were naive enough to think that the Kremlin would see that as an end to conflict, rather than a staging post for a later offensive, it would not be a “land swap” but a land grab that Ukraine – for good reason – could not stomach. Kyiv would be handing over territory that Moscow has spent years attempting but failing to seize.On the basis of those meetings’ precedents, there was cause for some relief after the Washington talks: it could have been much worse. Yet judged by the standards of conventional diplomacy, let alone Ukraine’s needs, it was alarming. Last month, Mr Trump threatened tough sanctions against Russia. En route to Alaska, he warned that there would be “very severe consequences” if there wasn’t a ceasefire that day. Yet on Monday, with Ukrainian civiliansunder intense Russian attack, he said there was no need to stop the fighting while a deal is agreed.Never mind the administration’sweak grasp of detail, lack of competence and general inconsistency. Never mind the failure to apply itself to the kind of committed, diligent diplomacy required for peace. The record shows that Ukraine and its European allies repeatedlyexert every effort– from a new suit to arms purchases – to draw Mr Trump towards their position. Yet his compass needle always seems to swing back towards Mr Putin. Mr Trump should be standing with a democracy, alongside traditional allies, against a war criminal. But at best, he wants to be a mediator.The Kremlin has yet to confirm that the Russian leader will meet Mr Zelenskyy, as Mr Trump said he would. Mr Trump has said that the US will “help out” Europe withsecurity guaranteesand “coordinate” any such effort. But there is still no sign that this administration will provide the kind of backing that might make allies willing to put boots on the ground, or to persist with them if tested by Russia. Arguably the most important takeaway from Monday was the ability of European leaders of very different political persuasions – including Italy’s Giorgia Meloni – to coordinate effectively. That’s good news, but there’s a difference between fending off the worst case scenario and being able to establish a concrete plan for the future.Despite Russian advances in recent weeks – spurred by the prospect of talks – this war is costing Moscow dearly too. Mr Putin could yet conclude that it is not in his interests to continue. But even if Mr Trump can be held to his latest position, it remains far short of what is necessary.Ukraineurgently needs action to secure the future of thousands of children kidnapped by Russia, the promise of justice in the future, and above all, a ceasefire, before more lives are lost.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But Trump willfully tossed policy like a stuffed animal out of the window of “the Beast,” the presidential car as he eagerly invited Putin to join him for a triumphant chariot ride.The Europeans scrambled once again, trying to get the addled Trump back on the page he was on before the summit. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sped to Washington to confer with Trump to try to pick up the pieces. At their last encounter, Trump jibed: “You don’t have any cards.” But Trump had just handed over his cards to Putin. Zelenskyy was not about to play the appeasement card. The European leaders gathered in an extraordinary posse to accompany Zelenskyy in an attempt to restore a unified western position. Unlike the last Zelenskyy meeting with Trump, he was not hectored. With the Ukrainian leader urrounded by a protective phalanx, Trump made agreeable sounding but vague gestures about a future summit with both Zelenskyy and Putin. Trump seemed favorable, if indefinite and imprecise, about western forces stationed inUkraineto maintain its sovereignty. But the notion of a ceasefire, pressed again by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, had evaporated. While the European recovery effort took place at the White House, Russian bombs rained down. Trump dreams of receiving the Nobel peace prize. Before the summit, he called the Norwegian finance minister to lobby him.I used to run the Foreign Office. This is my advice for today’s extraordinary White House meeting | Simon McDonaldRead moreInAlaska, Trump melted again in the presence of Putin while the whole world was watching. The self-abasing embarrassment of his previous meeting in Helsinki in 2018 did not serve as a cautionary precedent. Now, he invited the sanctioned war criminal to US soil. He ordered uniformed US soldiers to roll out the red carpet, “the beautiful red carpet” as the Russian foreign ministry called it. He applauded when Putin stood next to him. He patted Putin’s hand when he clasped it with an affectionate gesture. Then the door of “the Beast” opened for Putin.Trump’s personal negotiator for the summit, Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate operator whose knowledge of Russian culture to prepare him for his delicate role may had been a bowl of borscht at the Russian Tea Room on 57th Street, was easy prey for Putin. Bild, the German newspaper,reportedon 9 August that Witkoff had committed an “explosive blunder”. According to Bild, Putin “did not deviate from his maximum demand to completely control the five Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimea before the weapons remain silent … And even worse: Trump’s special envoy Witkoff is said to have completely misunderstood some of the Russians’ positions and misinterpreted them as an accommodation by Putin. He had misunderstood a “peaceful withdrawal” of the Ukrainians from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia demanded by Russia as an offer of “peaceful withdrawal” of the Russians from these regions”.“Witkoff doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” a Ukrainian government official told Bild. An assessment that, according to Bild information, is also shared by German government representatives.Bild further reported: “There was a telephone conference on Thursday evening between representatives of the US government – including the special envoy Witkoff and Foreign Minister Marco Rubio and Vice PresidentJD Vance– and the European partners. As BILD learned, the American side was perceived as chaotic and ununited. This was primarily due to Witkoff, whose remarks about his conversation with Putin on Wednesday in the Kremlin were perceived as confusing. He himself seemed overwhelmed and incompetent to the Europeans when he spoke about the territorial issues in Ukraine.”The German newspaper also reported friction between Rubio and Vance, with the vice-president seeking to shut the European allies out of the process and Witkoff taking his side against the secretary of state. “Apparently, there was also disagreement about the further course of action between Witkoff and Rubio, as the foreign minister emphasized that the Europeans should be involved in the further process, while Vance and Witkoff only wanted to informEuropeof the results of the further Trump steps.”In Trump’s new world order, Putin would be his partner ... while Trump waged a trade war imposing harsh tariffs on every other nationBild’s report on Putin’s position turned out to be completely accurate and its description of the Trump administration’s unsettled position prophetic of the fiasco that would unfold.Little noticed in the US media accounts, Trump had presented Putin with enormous economic advantages,according to the Telegraph. He offered access to valuable Alaskan natural resources, opportunities to tap into the US portion of the Bering Strait, which would boost Russia’s interests in the Arctic region. Trump promised to lift sanctions on Russia’s aircraft industry, which would permit Russian airlines (and by extension the Russian air force) to return to US suppliers for parts and maintenance. Trump would give Putin approval for access to rare earth minerals in Ukrainian territories currently under Russian occupation.In Trump’s new world order, Putin would be his partner, especially on the frontier of the Arctic, while Trump waged a trade war imposing harsh tariffs on every other nation. Ukraine stood as an obstacle to the gold rush.According to the Telegraph, Witkoff suggested to the Russians: “Israel’s occupation of the West Bank could be used as a model for ending the war.Russiawould have military and economic control of occupied [parts of] Ukraine under its own governing body, similar to Israel’s de facto rule of Palestinian territory.”Then, after Trump laid on lavish treatment for the Russian dictator at the US military base, marking his indifference to international condemnation, came the joint appearance, which exceeded the Helsinki disaster. An elated Putin and dejected Trump appeared on stage together.The announced joint press conference was a theater of the absurd. Its brevity contributed to the farce. There was no agreement, no plan for an agreement, and no press conference. Trump deferred to Putin to speak first, to set the tone and terms after which he would come on as the second banana to slip on the peel.The Guardian view on the Alaska summit: there must be no more gifts to Vladimir Putin | EditorialRead moreA clearly delighted Putinreiteratedhis belief that Ukraine was a security threat to Russia, and that “we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of that conflict,” which was his language for the elimination of an independent and democratic Ukraine. He blamed Biden for the war he had launched. He affirmed Trump’s presumptuous boast that there would have been no war had he been president. “Today, when President Trump is saying that if he was the president back then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be so. I can confirm that.”A clearly glum Trump stepped to his podium. “So there’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he said. He had pledged during the 2024 campaign that he could and would end the war on “day one”. It had taken him 210 days to reach the “No Deal”.Trump wistfully talked about doing business with Russia, his will-o’-the-wisp ambition since he attempted for decades to build a Trump Tower in Moscow even through the 2016 election. He threw Putin a bouquet. “I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin, with Vladimir.” He blamed their inability to monetize their relationship to the inquiries that extensively documented Putin’s covert efforts in the 2016 election to help Trump. “We were interfered with by the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax,” Trump complained. He would not let it go, drifting incoherently into his grievances. “He knew it was a hoax, and I knew it was a hoax, but what was done was very criminal, but it made it harder for us to deal as a country, in terms of the business, and all of the things that would like to have dealt with, but we’ll have a good chance when this is over.”Then, Trump praised the Russian officials accompanying Putin. Chief among them was the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who had arrived wearing a sweatshirt embossed with the Cyrillic letters “CCCP”, standing for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, signaling Putin’s ultimate objective to restore the empire of the Soviet Union. The message was more than nostalgia; it was a mission statement. And Trump called Putin “the Boss”, not a reference to Bruce Springsteen. “Next time in Moscow,” said Putin.The press conference was over. There were no questions. There were no answers. Trump fled from the stage.Before the summit, Trump threatened new sanctions if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire, but now he forgot he had ever said that. He spoke loudly and carried a tiny stick. On Air Force One, on the return to Washington, he gave an exclusive interview to his lapdog, Sean Hannity of Fox News, along on the ride for this purpose. Trump reverted to his tacit support for Putin’s position. He put the burden on Zelenskyy to accede to Putin’s demands, which were unchanged.Putin won in Anchorage. Now Zelenskyy and Europe are in an even more perilous position | Rajan MenonRead moreThen, Trump spiraled down a wormhole, obviously anxious about his growing unpopularity and the prospect of the Democrats winning the congressional midterm elections, which has prompted him to prod the TexasRepublicansto gerrymander districts and California Democrats aroused to counter it in their state. “Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said you can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting,” said Trump. “Look at California with that horrible governor they have. One of the worst governors in history. He is incompetent, he doesn’t know what he is doing.”Is this a subject that Putin actually spoke about in their discussion? Has he had experience with mail-in voting or even know what it is? Was it brought up by Trump during their car ride? Or was Trump simply making it up for his gullible Fox News audience? Whatever the reality, Trump’s fear about losing control of domestic politics was at the top of his mind as he flew away from his charade in Anchorage.The shambolic scene left in Alaska represented the wreckage of Trump’s attempt at diplomacy. Setting the stage himself, Trump babbled, whined and weakly sided with Putin. Trump’s foreign policy team was exposed as incompetent, confounded and feckless. This was no best and the brightest, no rise of the Vulcans, but the circus of the Koalemosians, after Koalemos, the Greek god of stupidity.Apologists for Trump, in advance of this exemplary event, had suggested that there was such a conceit as a Trump doctrine. A former Trump official from his first term, A Wess Mitchell, has called it “The Return of Great Power Diplomacy” in the May/June issue of Foreign Affairs. He described “a new kind of diplomacy” that is “diplomacy in its classical form” and “an instrument of strategy”. He cited an ancient Spartan king, Archidamus II, the Roman Emperor Domitian, Cardinal Richelieu, and in his mélange did not neglect to throw in Metternich and Bismarck. (Kissinger, in his grave, must be weeping over the parading of Metternich’s mannequin as a forerunner of Trump. Mitchell, in any case, dismisses Kissinger as a fake realist and an “idealist”, which would have been a revelation to Kissinger.) Left out of Mitchell’s pantheon of great diplomatic influences through the ages is the influencer Laura Loomer, the loony far-right troll who has an open door to Trump, feeding him lists of national security officials he must purge.In Putin’s shadow, Trump was bared as having no larger or smaller concept or strategy of Great Power politics. It would be unfair to accuse Trump of having an idea beyond his self-aggrandizement. If anything, he aspires to be like Putin, whom he called a “genius” after his invasion of Ukraine. Putin has created and controls a vast kleptocracy. In 2017, Bill Browder, an American businessperson who had invested in Russia and has been targeted for assassination by Putin for exposing his corruption,testifiedbefore the Senate judiciary committee that Putin was “the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world”. Nobody, however, knows Putin’s true personal wealth.Trump, the Putin manqué, is trying to turn the United States into a kleptocratic system. According to the calculations of David D Kirkpatrick inthe New Yorker, in just six months of his second term his alleged personal profiteering, “would disappoint the haters who saw Trump as a Putin-level kleptocrat. Yet some three and a half billion dollars in Presidential profits – even though my accounting is necessarily approximate – is a dizzying sum.”Meanwhile, three days before the Trump-Putin summit, the Trump family crypto business, World Liberty Financial,raised $1.5bnto buy the Trump family token. The CEO of World Liberty Financial, Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, along with Eric Trump of WLF, will join the board of the investing company. That is the Trump doctrine.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Will they succeed?Moira DoneganThe Republican party has already shown that its commitment to democratic elections is paper thinTue 19 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 10.42 EDTShareIf one mark of an autocratic regime is the meaningfulness of elections, you can make an argument that the United States has been backsliding away from a properly democratic form of government for a long time. In 2013’s Shelby county decision, the US supreme court gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act, clearing the way for states to impose a slew of restrictions on the franchise that were previously banned as part of an effort to prevent the re-establishment of Jim Crow; voting quickly became more burdensome and onerous in many Republican-controlled states.Three years before, in Citizens United, the same court declared that corporate money counted as political speech, thereby opening the floodgates on money in politics in ways that allowed the rich to distort public discourses ahead of elections. Donald Trump memorably tried tointerfere withthe 2020 census so that it would count as few of those who were disinclined to support him as possible, hoping to create a skewed vision of America in the data that the government uses to apportion public resources and congressional representation alike. The result is a clear picture of the Republican party’s approach to elections: that so long as they create a positive outcome for their candidates, they need not be strictly speaking fair, free or meaningful representations of the people’s will.Ahead of the 2026 midterms, Republicans are pursuing this agenda with renewed zeal. At Trump’s direction, Republicans in Texas are looking to redraw their state’s congressional maps to be more favorable to the Republican party, allowing the party to gain more seats in the House of Representatives not by persuading voters, but by choosing who their voters will be. The US supreme court, meanwhile, has chosen to continue its own efforts to rewrite election law in the Republicans favor, taking up a long-languishing case out of Louisiana challenging the remainder of the Voting Rights Act and accelerating argument so that a decision can be released in time for Republican-leaning states to redraw their maps ahead of the November 2026 contests.In Texas, the effort to ensure that the voters’ actual preferences will have no bearing on the outcome of the House races has unfolded in dramatic fashion. In early August, Trump told Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, to redraw his state’s congressional district maps – an unusual move in the middle of the decade – to ensure that Republicans picked up as many as five additional seats in Congress. “We” – the Republicans – “are entitled to five more seats”, thepresident said. Trump cited his own victory in Texas in the 2024 election as evidence that the state’s congressional seats belonged to his party – furthering his claim, often amorphous but repeatedly asserted, that his victory in 2024 amounts to a total and permanent grant of authority over all American policy and political jurisdictions.The supreme court is now moving to strike down section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the law’s last remaining edificeThe Texas governor quickly called the state legislature into a special session to vote on a proposed new set of districts for 2016. In a bit of political theater meant to draw attention to the move, the state legislature’s Democrats then left Texas in protest in order to deny the body a quorum to move on the vote, seeking sanctuary in Democratic-controlled Illinois. The standoffcame to an endwhen the Democrats gave in and agreed to return to the state on Friday, following the announcement by the California governor, Gavin Newsom, that he would encourage legislators in his own state to redraw maps in Democrats’ favor. The new Texas maps are likely to be passed by Labor Day, allowing the state to secure the outcomes in their 2026 congressional contests more than a year before a single vote is cast.Such moves are likely to become more common in the near future. The supreme court, not satisfied with having declared large portions of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional in 2013, is now moving to strike down section 2, the law’s last remaining edifice. The law allows states to draw so-called “majority minority” districts, so that Black voters can express political power in areas where they are concentrated instead of having their voting preferences diluted by spreading their votes out across majority-white districts.The justices are now poised to strike down this last remaining vestige of the monumental 20th-century law that was meant to remedially constitute Black voting power amid a long history of political repression, and finally make the 15th amendment meaningful in practice. Without this law, Republican-controlled states are likely to redraw their maps in order to eliminate “majority-minority” districts, thereby making it all but impossible for Black voters to elect their preferred candidates in many states, particularly across the former Confederacy.There was no need for the justices to take this case. The issue in question – a redistricting in Louisiana that created a second majority-minority congressional district in a state with six congressional districts that is more than 30% Black – had already been declared constitutional by an appellate court, in deference to the supreme court’s longstanding precedent. But John Roberts – depressingly, now the court’s moderate – has had a career-long vendetta against the Voting Rights Act, and will not resist an opportunity to finally strike it down in full. That the court expedited argument so as to be able to issue an opinion in June 2026 – just in time for states to redistrict before the midterms. It is yet another signal that the justices in the court’s majority consider themselves to be Republican party operatives – and the Republican party, as a whole, is becoming less and less interested in running in competitive elections.It is yet to be seen whether these efforts will succeed in swinging the midterm elections decisively in Republicans’ favor. Maybe the redistricting in Texas and the retaliation planned by California will not prompt a nationwide tit-for-tat of gerrymandering across the states; maybe the supreme court will show uncharacteristic restraint, and not overturn a decades-old precedent in order to further erode Black Americans’ voting rights.But the odds are slim, and at any rate, the Republican party has already shown that its commitment to democratic elections – that is, the kind that they might lose – is paper thin. TheTrump administration, meanwhile, is reviving their first-term effort to rewrite the rules of the census. In 2030, they hope, many Americans in Democratic-leaning districts simply won’t count at all.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

BF Skinner,the psychologist who first demonstrated this effectin 1947, described the birds adopting “a sort of superstition … as if there were a causal relation between its behaviour and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking”.It would be unkind to compare that bird-brained affliction to the behaviour of European leaders trying to make sense of Donald Trump’s erratic distribution of favours. Their diplomatic manoeuvres are more rational. And they get results. But there is also an element of superstition. Visiting politicians make lavish gestures, strike unusual poses, cultivate White House contacts, looking for the sequence of steps that will unlock a steady supply of American amity. The causal relation is not lacking, but it is unreliable.In February, Keir Starmer wooed Trump with an invitation to visit Britainas a guest of his majesty the king. The prime minister was rewarded with relative leniency under the White House’s punitive tariff regime. In March, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, impressed his US counterpart withtechnical prowess on the golf course. Between shots, he seeded the conversation with warnings not to trust Vladimir Putin. There followed a discernible dip in Trump’s patience with the Russian president.Trump warns Putin of ‘rough situation’ if he does not move towards peace in Ukraine but tells Zelenskyy to ‘show flexibility’ – liveRead moreAt a summit in June, Nato leaders presented hikes in their national defence budgets as tributes paid in honour of the US president’s superior statecraft. The alliance’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, performed a rhetorical kowtow,praising “daddy” Trump, thanking him for making Europe pay more for its own defence. Choreographed sycophancy seemed to work. Trump spoke of Nato with uncharacteristic warmth. His tone towards Russia turned chillier.It didn’t last. Putin countered withhis own campaign of flattery. Trump emerged from last week’s bilateral summit in Alaska with a roadmap to peace in Ukraine that followed twisted Kremlin directions – no imminent ceasefire and cessions of unconquered land to Russia.And so the ritual dance began anew. A flock of European pigeons raced to Washington, cooing and flapping in support of the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, hoping to generate a fresh portion of transatlantic solidarity.The result could have been a lot worse. There was no repeat of the notorious ritual humiliation that Trump inflicted on Zelenskyy for the cameras in February. In place of bullying there was bonhomie. On the substance of a peace settlement, there is talk of security guarantees forUkraineresembling but not replicating article 5 – the mutual assistance clause of Nato’s founding charter. What that really means, how it might be enforced, whether it will be underwritten by US military might and therefore how deterred Russia would be from any renewed landgrabs are all questions left hanging.The next stage is a proposed face-to-face meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, followed by atrilateral summit with Trump. The Russian president is reported to be open to the idea of direct talks with his Ukrainian enemy, but there is no enthusiasm for such an encounter in the Kremlin.View image in fullscreenEuropean leaders led by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, follow Donald Trump in the Cross Hall of the White House, Washington DC, 18 August.Photograph: ShutterstockTo justify full-scale invasion, Putin cast Zelenskyy as the despised boss of a drug-addled, neo-Nazi junta preventing Ukraine’s eager reintegration into the greater slavic motherland. When that fiction proved hard to sustain, the emphasis shifted to presenting the Ukrainian leader as a pawn in a long-running western campaign to diminish and humiliateRussia. That story was meant to end with Zelenskyy’s death or surrender. It will not be easy for Moscow propagandists to narrate a different denouement where the Ukrainian president talks terms with Putin as his unvanquished peer.Avoiding such a scenario had been one of the Russian president’s two big achievements in Alaska. First, by insisting on a bilateral meeting, Putin was able to bounce Trump into endorsing a template for peace that contains no hint of rebuke or reparation for flagrant territorial aggression.Second, by recreating the optics of cold war detente – a superpower summit to settle the fate of lesser nations – Putin signalled to his domestic audience that Soviet-style parity with the US was restored. To European democracies he hoped to prove that their efforts at isolating Russia as a thuggish pariah state would come to naught.The notion of Russia as America’s equal on any measure of power (except the size of nuclear arsenal) was a delusion even before the USSR unravelled, but one that Trump willingly indulges. It is a corollary of his obsession with making America great again, and doing so by authoritarian measures. It predisposes him to denigrate the accomplishments of 20th-century US democracy and project greatness on to regimes that showcase despotism under a personality cult.Putin is skilled at manipulating that attraction. While European leaders lobby Trump in the style of supplicants at the court of a king, Russia’s modern tsar cultivates him as something more like a protege – a recruit to the exclusive club of world historical figures who dictate the destiny of millions. They are the kind of men who redraw borders and parcel out land among themselves, not the kind that whines when the territorial allocation is unfair. It is a concept of geopolitics that despises international law and denigrates multilateral alliances as crafty games that minnow countries play to trap the big fish.That speaks to Trump’s narcissistic personality and aversion to any institutional constraint on his power. It means the Russian president is communicating with the White House on his own special channel, on a higher frequency.European counter-signals aren’t blocked. The evidence shows real success in shifting Trump away from a policy of unthinking pro-Kremlin alignment. But there is a perverse imbalance of influence. Just when the leaders of America’s oldest and most loyal allies think they have mastered the art of Trump-whispering, they find his ears have been thoroughly bent by Russian disinformation.In the short term, there isn’t an obvious alternative but to carry on with the current method, using force of numbers and repetition to persuade Trump that his route to greatness goes by way of durable Ukrainian independence with muscular security guarantees.It is certainly feasible that the Europeans’ diplomatic dance can nudge the president’s position in a more equitable direction on the road to a peace deal. But they will not effect any revision of his view of a world divided between mighty power players, to whom no rules apply, and vassal states.The challenge then is to develop European capacity as a coherent and autonomous power player – to evolve and coordinate the continent’s economic and military heft with confidence and on a scale to command respect in the only language the US president understands.The current approach isn’t exactly failing. But Trump-whispering is an unstable and inherently transient method at best. At worst it starts to look like a superstitious belief that performing the rituals of an old alliance will conjure it back into being. The right pigeon steps can win vital favours from the US president. The idea that he could ever be the true friend Europe wants him to be is for the birds.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionVladimir PutinTrump administrationUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyKeir StarmerNatocommentShareReuse this content"

But inclusivity on the sidelines reflects the game’s true power: bringing people togetherTue 19 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 20.37 EDTShareOf all the existential threats facing professional football –concussions that erode the mindsof players, scandals that rot institutions from within, dwindling youth interest in a sport built on collision and control – who could’ve predicted that what would truly rattle some fans was the sight of two men dancing on the sideline?RK RussellEarlier this month, the Minnesota Vikings unveiled their newly minted 35-member cheerleading squad with a bold promotional videocaptioned, “The next generation of cheer has arrived!” It wasn’t just the choreography that caught attention, but the fact that two male performers, Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn, were part of the group.Almost immediately, reactions erupted online, from heartfelt support to calls for a boycott, and even a homophobic slur wielded by a formerNFLplayer whose name deserves no mention in this or any other reputable publication. Amid the storm, the Vikings stood firm. And rightly so. After all, Minnesota is no stranger to innovators who challenge convention. This is the home of Prince, a man who wore high heels, embraced gender ambiguity, and redefined masculinity.In an official statement, the Vikings reminded everyone that male cheerleaders – whose numberinclude former US presidents– are nothing new, not only at the amateur and collegiate levels but also in the NFL itself. As of the 2025 season, at least 11 NFL teams include male cheerleaders on their official squads, the first being the Los Angeles Rams back in 2018, when Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies made history on the sidelines and laterperformed at the Super Bowl in 2019. The Minnesota Vikings also reminded people that Shiek and Conn earned their spots through the same competitive process as their peers, much like we football players compete and earn our spots on the roster.I was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 2015, and I’ve been in those locker rooms where the pressure to perform as an athlete, teammate and man can feel overwhelming. The one thing that wasn’t on my mind or any other player’s mind was the cheerleaders.Not because they weren’t talented. Not because they didn’t belong. But because during the game, while they performed on the sidelines or at half-time, we were in huddles, making adjustments on the sidelines, giving our all on the field, or processing and schemes in the locker rooms for the next half. Everyone out there has a job to do, and the cheerleaders are no exception. They’re not there for the players. They’re there for the fans. Which means they should reflectallthe fans.View image in fullscreenLA Rams cheerleaders Napoleon Jinnies, right, and Quinton Peron perform during Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in February 2019.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesThe people expressing outrage over male cheerleaders on the Vikings aren’t talking about work ethic, talent or dedication. Their complaints are even more baseless than the Monday Morning Quarterbacks – a term created to address those who criticize players with the benefit of hindsight.This isn’t about performance at all. It’s about presence. It’s about the mere existence and visibility of men on NFL cheer squads who don’t conform to the rigid, outdated ideas of masculinity that so many use sport, and football in particular, to defend.The New York gunman blamed CTE. I’ve seen that pain and I know silence is deadly | RK RussellRead moreWhat this backlash really reveals is not fear of change, but fear of visibility. The outrage over male cheerleaders isn’t about sports. It’s about control: over masculinity, over image, and over who gets to be seen and celebrated in public spaces or on the global stage of the NFL. It’s the same impulse that drivesanti-LBGTQ+ legislation, the same fear that fuelsbook bans,bathroom bills, andattacks on drag performers. This moment isn’t isolated; it’s part of a broader cultural backlash to liberation.And just as Christian nationalism has long been weaponized to marginalize queer people, so too has sport. Sport is used to draw lines around what’s “American” and “man enough”. But those lines were never drawn for protection; they were drawn for power.The truth is, football isn’t as rugged as society would like us to believe. The power of sport is in its intimacy; its emotional extremity. In the way players and fans alike grieve, cry, pray, dance, and embrace under the lights and flags, and banners. The locker room is one of the few places in American culture where men are allowed to be vulnerable, broken, weep, and to hug in celebration, speak with peers across all cultures and generations, and build themselves up again. When you peel back the helmets and hits, you’ll see what’s always been there: joy, vulnerability, brotherhood, and the undeniable truth that masculinity isn’t fixed, it’s fluid. And that’s not changing.Shiek, Conn, and every male cheerleader across the league aren’t just cheering for a team. They’re cheering for possibility, for the next generation of boys who want to move their bodies with pride, for the kids who don’t see themselves in shoulder pads but still belong in the stadium. Sport isn’t sacred because it resists change. It’s sacred because it brings people together, and the more inclusive that togetherness becomes, the more powerful the game will be.Explore more on these topicsNFLMinnesota VikingsUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s no secret that countries and corporations are far from living up to the goals set by international leaders at the landmark 2015 Paris agreement.Unless there is a significant course correction, the ramifications will be far-reaching and often destructive. The second coming of Donald Trump and growing global instability has made a top-down injection of urgency at the pace needed harder to imagine. Optimism is harder to come by.But that doesn’t mean nothing is happening.It’s worth pointing this out because a narrative has started to take hold that renewable energy and other clean solutions have made little to no headway in displacing fossil fuels, and therefore are pointless. Fuelled byTony Blairandthe former US government adviser Daniel Yergin, and embraced by the fossil fuel industry and its lapdogs in the commentariat, it is used to attack zero emissions targets as a fool’s dream. In Australia, it is part of the backdrop as the Albanese government is lobbied over whether to set an ambitious emissions reduction target for 2035.The reality, though, is more complicated. Here are some things worth considering if you hear climate action is pointless.Clean energy is coming for fossil fuelsOne line that has gained some traction this year is that the proportion of global energy supply from fossil fuels has barely moved over the past 35 years. The claim –bubbling away in the The Australian, on Sky News and on social media – goes that dirty fuels provided 85% of energy in 1990, and still provide 80% today.So much for progress, right?Albanese government substantially expands renewable energy scheme amid 2030 target concernsRead moreBut the Bloomberg NewEnergyFinance founder and self-declared conservative Michael Liebreich points out that this ignores an important factor.The percentages referred to by fossil fuel advocates refer to primary energy – that is, raw coal, crude oil, gas, wood, sun or wind. They do not refer to secondary energy – energy that has been converted into a usable form, such as electricity or refined petroleum.Given secondary energy is what humans use, it is the more relevant measure. And the process of processing raw fossil fuels into usable energy is, in many cases, not particular efficient. More energy is lostin generating at a remote coal-fired power plant and transmitting it to a homethan if solar, wind or hydro was used. Petrol cars require much more energy to travel a kilometre than an electric vehicle does.If we acknowledge this and consider secondary energy alone, the amount of energy provided by fossil fuels is not 80%, but 68%.This is obviously still too high. But it won’t stay at this level. Despite all the talk of new coal plants still being built, they are playing in the margins. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that solar and windwill meet more than 90% of the global increase in electricity demand this year. Global generation from solar and wind energy is expected to increase by about 25%, from 4,000 terawatt-hours to more than 5,000. Next year it is expected to jump another 20%, past 6,000TWh.The IEA projects that global renewable energy output – including solar, wind and hydro – will surpass coal output in either 2025 or 2026. For the first time in a century, the share of electricity coming from coal will have fallen to less than 33%.Solar and wind will together be nearly 20% – up from 4% a decade ago.A key question is if this growth in renewable energy will eventually reduce global fossil fuel use – as is necessary – or mostly just meet growing energy demand. Liebreichargues compellingly that fossil fuel use is set to fall. Using a simple model, he suggests it is likely to start falling in the 2040s and could be squeezed out of the system by about 2065.That is not near fast enough to deliver the trajectory scientists say is needed to limit global heating since pre-industrialisation to 1.5C. But it is a well argued rejection of claims that a global transition isn’t possible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s movingWith a population of 1.4 billion and having taken on a huge proportion of the world’s manufacturing, China is easily the world’s biggest direct national climate polluter, pumping out more than twice as much CO2as the second-placed US.Its story is mixed, as always. But the data show it is changing.An analysis for Carbon Briefby China experts Qi Qin and Lauri Myllyvirta found that coal’s share of the country’s power generation fell from 73% in 2016 to 51% in June this year. This happened as it continued to build new coal plants for a simple reason – it doesn’t run them at anything like capacity.A significant moment came earlier this year when China’s national emissions fell for the first time,dropping 1% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Beijing needs to do much more if it is to meet its commitment under the Paris deal. Its next five-year plan for economic development, due this year, will be crucial.Dirty car sales are downAccording to Our World in Data, global sales of internal combustion engine cars – which run solely on petrol or diesel – peaked in 2016 at 80.47m. Electric and plug-in hybrid car sales in that year were just 780,000.Last year, sales of dirty cars were 62.05m, a 23% fall. Electric and plug-in hybrid car sales had increased to 17.5m.Trying to keep cool in an increasingly hot world – picture essayRead morePut another way, nearly a decade ago only one in every 100 cars sold across the globe was electric. Now it is more than one in five. Elon Musk’s extraordinary self-own indamaging Tesla’s reputationmay dent the pace of growth but it won’t stop it. China has little time or need for Teslas and is home to more than 60% of global EV sales.Still a mountain to climbNone of this is to understate the scale of the problem. This columnhas reported beforeon the big step-up in global heating since June 2023. Averaged across the globe, every day in 2024 was at least 1.25C hotter than preindustrial levels, and three-quarters were 1.5C hotter.Extreme weather events are becoming more damaging. Feedback loops (melting permaforst and huge wildfires) are releasing large additional amounts of CO2, accelerating the problem. Governments havebarely started to acknowledgethe expected increase in economic, societal and environmental costs that will hit productivity – the current focus of the Australian political class – and so much else.It’s hard to overstate how much there is to be done. But don’t believe self-interested arguments that action is impossible, or will be for nothing.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisClear airAustralian politicsEnergyFossil fuelscommentShareReuse this content"

But another more concerning trend has emerged that has seen celebrities, elite athletes and influencers who don’t live with diabetes sporting the wearable device, which offers near real-time measurements of an individual’s blood sugar.A video Gwyneth Paltrow posted on Instagram in Maystarts with theactor turned wellness influencerstretching with a CGM conspicuously on her arm before she proceeds to make grain-free almond and coconut pancakes with a strawberry compote. Many in the comments questioned her use of a CGM, with some saying she risked stoking a “dangerous trend” given many diabetes sufferersstruggle to get access to them.It’s winter and respiratory illnesses are everywhere. Will going out underdressed in cold weather make me sick? | AntiviralRead moreOther influencers have directlypromoted CGMs to people who don’t live with diabetes, claiming it can help people manage their metabolism, and thereby improveenergy, mood and sleep. Dr Fiona Willer, the president of Dietitians Australia, worries about the proliferation of the devices and questions whether some people may have “fallen down a wellness rabbit hole”.What is glucose?Glucose, the sugar in our blood, is “there to help fuel all of our cells – our muscle cells, brain cells, all of them – and so we do need sugar in our blood. It’s a bit like the petrol in a car,” Willer says.“Any form of carbohydrate that we eat, whether that’s lollies or wholegrain bread, is turned into glucose, which makes its way into our bloodstream.” The body can also recycle glucose from the stored energy of food we’ve already eaten, Willer says.Those with diabetes need to monitor their glucose levels because their bodies havetrouble making or using insulin– the hormone created by the pancreas that helps move glucose from our bloodstream into the body’s cells to make energy.The blood glucose of people who don’t have regulation issues still fluctuates across the day, going up and down depending on what we eat, physical activity level, as well as things such as whether we’re ill or going through puberty, Willer says. “For people who don’t have diabetes, that fluctuation will occur within a tighter range, while for people who do have diabetes, their blood glucose levels stray outside of what we would call the reference range.”What do CGMs do?People with diabetes previously had to use a finger prick test to measure their blood glucose levels. The CGM is a relatively new device thatuses a sensor to measure glucose via the fluid between cells every few minutesand then sends the reading to a receiver or smartphone app. For people with diabetes, the reading can then help them manage their glucose levels by influencing how they eat or using some glucose-modifying drugs such as insulin.Clinical endocrinologist Prof Jenny Gunton says CGMs can “hugely improve the quality of life” for people living with type 1 diabetes, as well as pregnant women who have gestational diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes on insulin.What about people who don’t have diabetes?Gunton, who heads the Centre forDiabetes, Obesity and Endocrinology Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, says outside of these groups, wearing a CGM can be useful to understand blood glucose levels after various foods and exercise, but warns that “like any device that gives lots of information, CGMs can sometimes increase anxiety and stress”.They are also expensive. For people who aren’t eligible for a government subsidy, it can cost more than $100 for a sensor that lasts just 14 days.Should people without diabetes use them?A study led by the University of the Sunshine Coast in 2022 found CGMsprovide little benefit for healthy athletes without diabetes. Separately, researchers whoanalysed the available evidenceof the utility of CMGs among people not living with diabetes in 2024 said that due to the lack of evidence, “we urge for the commercial claims suggesting the utility of the device in [this population] to be labelled as misleading”.What is hair and scalp oiling, and will it make my locks long like Rapunzel? | AntiviralRead moreWiller welcomes people trying to understand how their body works, but says any idea of a “magic number” for glucose levels for someone who doesn’t have insulin resistance or diabetes is “completely imaginary”. She also says it could lead people to becoming unnecessarily restrictive with their diet and trying to control their body in a way that is not necessarily healthy.“It’s a bit like calorie counting, in that it’s one metric that can give people the impression that it kind of wraps everything up together, that it is an indicator for everything. But just like calorie counting, it is actually hugely reductionistic, and it means that we lose so much context about why we eat, when we eat, the sorts of things we eat, and how food functions in our social and cultural experiences as well.”Willer recommends for people who are interested in living a healthier lifestyle and want an individual approach to speak to a health expert rather than buy a product online.“Even if they have purchased a CGM, a dietitian or another health professional will help understand, to help them interpret what’s going on with their numbers against their actual behaviours.”Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Risible, but hey, better to be stiff as a board than labelled wokeTue 19 Aug 2025 06.04 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.54 EDTShareIt’s a world in flames. Too much antisocial behaviour, too many street gangs,too few crimes being solved– but fear not, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has a plan to fight back. Go to the Notting Hill carnival this weekend, he’s told his officers. Keep the peace, lay down the law – andI’d better not catch you dancing.He’s right to be concerned. Dancing policemen are a menace. They undermine tradition and the public’s trust. TheLaughing Policemanwas bad enough, but dancing ones? You wonder how they ever got through the vetting and the training. From now on, perhaps it will be a specific part of the vetting and the training. “Regan, you almost made it through, but when we played that bit of Rihanna in the final module, you shimmied a bit and there was a definite head bob. I’m sorry, this job isn’t for you.”There are many problems in the running of and the policing of the Notting Hill carnival. The numbers are too big, the west London space too small. We know there’s crime:two murderslast year and melees in which more than 60 officers were injured. No one underestimates the challenge. Last week, Tory members of the London assembly called for city hallto take over the running of the event, and mooted once again the idea that it could move to a park, Hyde Park perhaps, and become ticketed.View image in fullscreenA policeman joining in at carnival in 1978.Photograph: Frank Barratt/Getty ImagesNo one close to the event and its tradition wants that. But everyone knows that, security-wise, things have to change.Will motionless, ear-plugged officers do that? I’m not sure that’s the eureka moment. I can’t quite equate the difficulty of keeping roads unblocked and hyped-up young men from maiming themselves and others with the dereliction of rogue officers momentarily shaking a leg toMighty Sparrow,Sean PaulorShaggy. How does that work in fact? Is that the officer who says: “There is a punch up over there and I know I should intervene, but I do like this banging tune, and I’m having a nice dance, so I’ll wait until it’s finished?”Police officers warned against dancing with revellers at Notting Hill carnivalRead moreI don’t think any officer would do that, and I doubt the commissioner really thinks so either. The statement from Scotland Yard says: “Almost 7,000 officers will be deployed to this year’s event. They are there to keep revellers safe, not to join in the revelling. We want officers to positively engage with the carnivalgoers while staying vigilant at all times and remaining able to respond and intervene swiftly as necessary. They can’t do this if they are dancing. The standards of behaviour expected as part of the policing operation will be communicated clearly before the event, just as they have been in recent years.”On its face, this last bit appears to reveal that those who havegot jiggy wit itat carnival in recent years have been dancing disobediently, perhaps with intent, perhaps with malice aforethought. As for those who have actually danced in actual contact with the revellers, well, bring backKeir Starmer’s all-night courts.There is, of course, a simpler explanation for this new diktat, rather than any genuine nexus between carnival crime and the beat officer who likes the beats. It’s not really that too many officers over-engage: it’s that occasionally one makes a human connection, and someone takes a photo of that, and it ends up on the TV and in the papers – because little else happens on a bank holiday – and the rightwing press goes full tonto about woke coppers who talk to folk they should be tasering. Before you know it, someone is saying that the commissioner himself is a woke disciple who secretly loves Afrobeats and privately takes the knee on Congolese religious holidays, and that we really need new leadership, of the kind that Nigel Farage would seek out were he to reach No 10.View image in fullscreenCarnival in 2005, when police presence was increased after the 7 July bombings.Photograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesAnd all of that grouching is bad for the top team at Scotland Yard, who’ll be forgiven by the right if they never catch another criminal, so long as they don’t go woke. So the best thing for them, short of stopping the music itself, is to stop the thin blue line dancing, even for a smiley snapshot. And so they have.It’s all quite funny, and it’s all quite sad. Because those pictures of communal revelry between the public and law enforcement were sometimes a bit cringe and often a bit stagey, but they spoke to a desire of some officers to present as a police service rather than a police force – and showed an enthusiasm from carnivalgoers to embrace that. And for those who weren’t there, those moments – like the time in 2017 when a PC Daniel Graham threw his shapesand went viral– conveyed a world that doesn’t always exist, but one that most of us would like to see.We’ll have the old pictures as an archive, but pity the officers deployed to carnival this year: concerned about the crush, concerned about the crime (with optimists at the Mail already predicting“three days of carnage”) and now concerned that a surveillance camera might catch them twerking in the line of duty.

I have a way to fight backDawn ButlerCommunities feel powerless because the law gives betting firms the upper hand. But a simple change could transfer power to the peopleDawn Butler is MP for Brent EastTue 19 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.45 EDTShareWalking down their local high streets, people in Britain are increasingly unlikely to come across a local butcher, baker or grocery shop, and more likely to find betting shops, casinos, adult gaming centres (AGC) and so-called bingo venues, where traditional bingo is muscled out by money-sapping slot machines. These establishments are taking over our town centres at an alarming rate. From talking to my constituents in Brent, west London, and residents across the capital, I know that people have had enough.That’s why this summer I have launched a campaign for urgent reform of our gambling laws. Ministers must give local authorities and people greater power to tackle this issue and reclaim our high streets. Currently,billionaire-owned overseas corporationshave too much power, and local people have none. That needs to change. And it’s time to raise the gambling tax. As Gordon Brown, a former Labour chancellor and prime minister,recently pointed out, it is now an under-taxed industry. With a modest increase we could raise £3bn a year.It’s a national problem, but as an MP, I see it locally. The explosion in gambling premises is a huge problem in Brent,which has 81licensed enterprises. With so many already here, I routinely object to new applications, and those objections are routinely ignored. Why? Because of theGambling Act 2005which has a clause called “aim to permit” that essentially means local authorities have to allow them, or face court cases which cost money that the councils can’t afford.There is an answer to this. If we deleted the aim to permit clause, the views of local residents and MPs would carry more weight, and that would result in fewer gambling shops.Of that I’m sure. In Wembley, in the shadow of the world famous stadium, we have 11 gambling centres within 0.3 miles. One double-fronted soon-to-be-opened shop close by has already been graffitied with “stop opening gambling shops in deprived areas”.I’m persuaded by the figures. In 2021, when I surveyed my constituents, 75% called for betting shops to be limited and 65% called for more council licensing powers. But just as much, I am motivated by the accounts they give, of which this is one example. “Gambling destroyed my family and our relationship with my father. I know that he still has the same addiction,”one contributor said. “This addiction caused financial loss (to a huge degree) and mood swings from him. His promises, that he will stop … or that he has stopped, were always just empty.” The effects, the respondent said, are wide and lingering. “I don’t gamble at all due to what I saw it do to my father, and I always feel nauseous when I see any gambling stores on our high streets. I see the people hanging around them. It brings too much back.”View image in fullscreenA man watches Racing UK coverage of Newbury races at a betting shop.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianMore recently, when I asked constituents to design their ideal high street, not one of them included a gambling shop, or even bingo. The most moving and unexpected encounter was a meeting with a man I called Gambler A as he was leaving a betting shop. I expected him to design a high street with a betting shop, perhaps the one he had just left, but pointedly, he chose a gym, a library, a newsagent and a launderette. Where’s the betting shop, I asked him, and he was unequivocal.Gamblinghas ruined my life, he said. It is an addiction just like alcohol and drugs. He moved me to tears.Some national figurespoint to a decline in the number of betting shops, down from more than 9,000 in 2011 to just over 6,000 in 2023. But that’s cold comfort to areas that continue to feel targeted.That is why Brent council, in my constituency, has joined forces with 40 UK councils, mayors and other organisations, calling for urgent gambling reform. “We are standing up for our residents,” is how council leader, Muhammed Butt, explains it. “We know the damage that saturation gambling can do – to mental health, public safety and our local economy. It’s time councils were given the power to say enough is enough.”Truly this cannot go on. With approximately more than one person every daydying of a gambling-related suicide, it’s clear that, along with everything else, this is a public health crisis. But it is also an economic and moral emergency.According to Public Health England, problem gambling costs the UK economy £1.05-£1.77bn a year. Prof Henrietta Bowden-Jones, PHE’s national clinical adviser on gambling harms,is clearabout where that money comes from: “Slot machine venues, particularly those open 24/7 … channel funds from the pockets of the poorest into the pockets of the richest.” The sad fact is that the house always wins.In parliament, I have tabledan early day motionon high street gambling reform to highlight the issue with fellow MP’s who do not yet know it. I have also applied for a back-bench business debate in the Commons. We have gambling reform, the end of aim to permit, and enhanced taxation in our sights.There have been years of talk, but now it really is time for change: time for communities to benefit from high streets that do not – by design and for greedy reasons of profit – suck them into addiction. We know the problem and we have the beginnings of a solution. The real gamble is to stand by and do nothing.Dawn Butler is MP for Brent EastIn the UK, support for problem gambling can be found via the NHSNational Problem Gambling Clinicon 020 7381 7722, orGamCareon 0808 8020 133.

It’s hard to maintain a healthy relationship to food in a society obsessed with weight lossTue 19 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 03.12 EDTShareWhen I was a teenager suffering from anorexia, I thought it was a life sentence. I genuinely believed slogans like “every woman has an eating disorder” and couldn’t imagine a future where calories didn’t make me sweat. With this in mind, you must understand that I’m boasting when I write this next sentence: in November 2024, I was diagnosed with “very high” cholesterol.After years of restriction, I spent my 20s unable to understand why every meal shouldn’t be the maximum amount of delicious. This means that last year, I was regularly melting a packet of white chocolate buttons on my morning porridge before heading out for a white chocolate matcha with cream, followed by a cheese and egg sandwich in a brioche bun, a slice of cake, fried chicken and chips, to say nothing of the bread and butter before dinner and dessert. In short, I was smashing through my recommended daily allowance of saturated fat and loving every second of it. “Treats”, to my mind, are not something that have to be earned.I went up a couple of dress sizes and while it would be a lie to say I did so “happily”, I didn’t really care too much about it – certainly not enough to change my eating habits or move my legs.But what is mentally healthy isn’t always physically healthy – and perhaps I wasn’t as mentally healthy as I believed. My recovery had become almost as performative as my disorder. While I once thought I was superior for starving, I soon felt superior for never saying “no” to ice-cream and never ordering salad without a side of chips. I viewed healthy eaters with suspicion. Maybe I no longer believed that every woman had an eating disorder, but I certainly had the wrongheaded belief that every woman who worked out did.It’s hard to shake this mindset, which is, of course, entirely defensive – hence why I just masked my high cholesterol diagnosis with the word “boasting”. The truth is that my cholesterol results scared me: my family has a long history of strokes and heart attacks, and although I don’t have a pension, I am – on the whole – into the idea of reaching old age.I was first diagnosed with high cholesterol in 2023 when I had a health check as part of theOur Future Healthscheme, and made some half-hearted attempts to swap brownies for flapjacks. I only accepted that I would really have to change my diet and start exercising after the numbers jumped to “very high” a year later.I have now spent about half a year eating a healthier, lowersaturated fatdiet, and have reduced my total cholesterol to “normal” levels (although I’m only within them by 0.1 of a point, so I still have a way to go). The past six months has made me reflect a lot on our – and my – attitudes to food and health. I feel very happy about where I am mentally now, but quite despondent about the way we all remain imprisoned by contradictory and reductive health messaging.To start with, my doctor couldn’t have cared less when I was diagnosed with high cholesterol in 2023, and I don’t believe he would have been as flippant if I was overweight. We’re told the problem with being fat is that it’s unhealthy, but there are people who are heavier than I amwho have far better cholesterollevels. I’m certain my doctor would have been sterner if I was “fat”, which is ridiculous because the number on the scale should matter less than the numbers on my blood test results. Yet I was barely asked about my diet.I’m also angry that this all happened because I was taught – and women are still taught! – to focus on calories at the expense of nutrition. A “bad” food, to many minds, is a calorific one – but there are high-calorie foods that are very healthy, and low-calorie foods that are shockingly high in saturated fat, or low in nutrients in general. Once I recovered from my eating disorder, I saw no reason to limit myself – after all, the world told me that the scariest consequence of eating what you liked was gaining weight, and I was very proud to no longer be scared of that. Of course, I didn’t forget that too much saturated fat, salt and sugar are bad for you, but our culture repeats that “being fat is unhealthy” rather than “being unhealthy is unhealthy”. The world loves nothing more than a thin woman who can house a burger with extra bacon. Can you blame me for internalising that?But I think I’m most angry that society is set up so that if you want to be healthier, it’s assumed you must also want to lose weight. Because here is the sad truth: while total recovery is possible, anorexia never stops waiting for its next opportunity. At the start of the year, I downloaded an app to monitor my saturated fat intake and naturally, obviously, it also counted calories. At first I wished there was a way to remove this feature and then – comically quickly – I became very into it. I didn’t eat anywhere near enough for a week, until I confessed to my husband, deleted the app and broke the spell (which I want to let everyone know can be surprisingly easy to do if you break your silence).Again and again, I’m reminded that society seems set up to invite me back to my disorder. I was recently on holiday and averaging 30,000 steps a day because I adore exploring new places on foot. But while I didn’t connect my step count to my energy expenditure, my phone did – it sent me a cheery alert that I was burning more calories than usual. Why tell me that? Don’t tell me that. Why is the default assumption that I should care?And when I had an appointment with the nurse after my “very high” diagnosis, she handed me a sheet of paper banning me from eating “fancy breads”. It seemingly didn’t occur to anyone to approach things more sensitively because of my eating disorder history.It’s ironic that trying to save myself from a heart attack could have given me one – if I had allowed anorexia to take over my life again in the pursuit of “health”, I would have become unhealthier than ever before. The rise of “skinny” jabs is driving home these messages like never before: because weight loss is still seen as the ultimate, most desirable goal. Seemingly no one cares if some jabbers taking them for that reason alsolose their hair, experience painfulgastrointestinal side-effects,don’t get enough nutrientsto sustain their body, and evenreduce the efficacy of their contraception. That’s not to mention the risk ofvision loss. Once again, weight is seen as the most important marker of health, even though pursuing weight loss can and does make people very unhealthy.My Good Bright Wolf by Sarah Moss audiobook review – a life shaped by anorexia and literatureRead moreBut, in the end, it’s not just society I’m shaking my fists at – I’ve been forced to confront myself, too. Post-anorexia, it wasn’t healthy for my eating habits to still be such a huge part of my identity. I hated asking pals to swap a pizza reservation for sushi when I got my diagnosis, and I cringed at saying “no” to a slice of birthday cake at a party in a pub – I especially detested that when I ordered salad at lunch a friend copied me with the words: “Oh, I should be good too!” There’s still a defensive, confrontational part of me that thinks eating healthily and exercising is inherently disordered and unenlightened, and a mean little part of my brain that wants me to whisper, “Get a life!” at people who eat five fruits and vegetables a day.No matter how I started this article, this isn’t actually a healthy attitude. Though it’s painful to disclose, I do now actually enjoy exercising. And though it is against my political beliefs to admit this, treats actually are more enjoyable if you’re not having them on the hour, every hour.I’m slightly sad that my diagnosis means I once again have to go through life thinking about what I eat – but if I’m honest, maybe I never stopped thinking about it, even when I thought I was completely free. I’m still stuck in a strange middle ground where (sadly) I can feel a little burst of happiness if my trousers seem looser and yet, simultaneously, I can fill a stamp-able sweet shop loyalty card in two weeks. I don’t have all the answers. But if there’s one thing that I wish I could change … it’s my cholesterol. And if there’s a second thing, it’s our attitudes to diet and health.Amelia Tait is a freelance features writerIn the UK,Beatcan be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

Perenniallyindecisive, unpopular with thepublicand unable to pass major legislation withoutrebellions, the prime minister hasreportedly beenput “on notice” by senior figures within his party. Speculation about a potential successor is mounting.What would Labour’s dominant faction – the neo-Blairite right – look for in a candidate? Their best bet would be an effective operator who doesn’t carry too much political baggage, a decent communicator, free of Starmer’s stumbling reticence, and a committed partisan of their cause: namely the free market and a strong state. They need someone who will go on the offensive for these values, rather than offering the bland apologetics that we have seen from the incumbent.Few fit the bill better than the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who hasmade no secretof his ambition to lead the country and appears to have spent years laying the groundwork with media rounds, donor events and backroom conversations. When Starmer’s leadership of the Labour party was on the brink during theBeergate scandal, Peter Mandelson is said tohave canvassedthe Labour frontbench to anoint Streeting. “In the longer term,”briefedone party source, “Wes is their guy, not Keir.”Born into a working-class east London family in 1983, Streeting has been fairly consistent in both his political style and outlook since he was in his early 20s. A pugnacious advocate of private enterprise, and an effective behind-the-scenes operator, his deft handling of the press allows him to stride into the limelight at crucial moments, with memorable one-liners that seem crafted to enrage his opponents. As president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in the twilight of the New Labour era, he inveighed against lecturers’ strikes,remarkingthat “students need industrial action by university staff like a hole in the head”. He also broke with dominant student opinionby supportingtuition fees andcriticisingPalestine solidarity protests.From the NUS it was only a small step to parliament, where Streeting landed in 2015. The words “future leader” were immediately “appended to his name like a Homeric epithet”, according to oneinsider account. He vigorously opposed the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn,repeatedlyexcoriatinghim in parliamentary meetings and working with the People’s Vote campaign tochip awayat his resistance to a second Brexit referendum. This earned him a place in Starmer’s shadow cabinet once the right had regained control five years later. There, he made no bones about acceptinghundreds of thousandsof pounds from donors linked to the private healthcare industry. Heinsistedthat the party needed to get tough on “law and order” along with “defence and national security”; and he signalled a clear shift from the foreign policy of the Corbyn era byvisiting Israeland meeting with ministers in its government.Now that Streeting is at the helm of the NHS, we are beginning to see how his hypothetical prime ministership might play out. Shortly after the last general election, hesketched out his visionfor the health service in the pages of the Sun, writing that “major surgery” was needed to make it “fit for the future”: moving treatment out of hospitals, so as to focus on local care and prevention. This could not be achieved through public spending, Streeting warned, because “the money isn’t there”. It could only be done through hard-knuckled “reform”.True to his word, Streeting has helped to normalise the state of perma-austerity at the health department, which willreceive only an extra 2.8%annually in real terms over the coming years: less than the long-term historical norm of 3.7%, and far below the average increase of 6.8% under New Labour. This is nowhere near enough to solve the perpetual crisis in the sector, let alone make any real improvements in thequality of care.Without meaningful investment, the levers that Streeting can pull to realise his goals are limited. There is reorganisation through measures such as thesummary abolitionof NHS England and mass job cuts. There is techno-optimism,allowing AI companies such as Palantirto run parts of the ailing service. And, most importantly, there is privatisation.Streeting has been working hard to ensure that “more treatments can be delivered through the independent sector”, as anofficial briefingput it. Under his watch, an even greater portion of the NHS – including, potentially, sensitivepatient data– is beinghanded overto profit-making companies. His plan to set up 300 “neighbourhood health hubs” is powered bycorporate finance, in what is shaping up to be a frame-by-frame replay of the disastrous PFI initiatives of the 2000s. Research shows that the effect of these policies is toworsen health inequality. But this does not seem to concern the minister.Bullish as ever,Streeting has saidhe is “up for the fight” that his plan will provoke. And that is what he now has. In recent weeks, resident doctors rejected his notion that “reform” alone will magically resolve the service’s deep-rooted problems of under-resourcing and understaffing. They refused to accept a pay deal that wouldamount to a 21% reductionin their salaries since 2008, and instead made a principled case for wage restoration. Streeting was intransigent. During the resulting five-day strike he launched a series of broadsides against the workers,insisting thatthey must feel the “pain” of the walkouts andvowingthat they would “lose a war with this government”. Much like his “bullet in the head” rhetoric, the remarks showed that Streeting’s main interest is in positioning himself as a crusader on behalf of the establishment rather than fixing the service he oversees. He is also keenly aware of the populist appeal of his rhetoric at a time when support for the doctors’ struggle isin decline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has imposed a permanent ban onpuberty blockersfor trans children – despite a wealth ofdissenting expert opinionincluding that of theBritish Medical Association, which disputes the scientific basis of the prohibition – and he hasalso barredthose under 18 from changing gender markers on their NHS records, potentially making it more difficult for them to access vital services.The irony, of course, is that while Streetingstyles himselfas the man to beat Nigel Farage, his politics is one of deference to big business, clampdowns on trans rights and incendiary rhetoric to provoke the left. These features are more typically associated with reactionary populism than with social democracy. Streeting’s ascent reflects the fact that, in today’s Labour party, the former is cannibalising the latter.Oliver Eagleton is an associate editor at the New Left Review and author of The Starmer Project: A Journey to the RightExplore more on these topicsWes StreetingOpinionHealthLabourNHScommentShareReuse this content"

There will be a moral reckoningTue 19 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 04.11 EDTShareThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and her team face growing criticism of thecontroversial EU-US tariff dealagreed in July. I am hoping for similar calls for accountability over theEU’s complicityin Israel’s unfolding genocide in Gaza. Such a reckoning is long overdue.I have watched in despair for almost two years as European governments have done little or nothing while Israel has devastated Gaza through bombings, targeted strikes and forced starvation after the 7 October attack by Hamas. There are so many sanctions at the EU’s disposal which they are still refusing to deploy; so many levers they are refusing to pull. The bloc is Israel’s biggest trading partner, accounting for32% of Israel’s total tradein 2024. Yet at every meeting, EU leaders and foreign ministers have failed to secure the majority needed to suspend the EU-Israel association agreement. This despite pressure from Spain, Ireland and Slovenia, and despite the fact the EU’s own human rights experts have indicated that Israel is in breach of the accord’shuman rights obligations.Even a modest commission proposal topartly suspendIsrael from the EU’s €95bn Horizon Europe research programme – an initiative that the EU’s former foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has described as a “bad joke”, given the scale of Israel’s atrocities – remains blocked by Germany and Italy. Israeli exports to the EU actually rose in early 2024. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, says Berlin isnow stoppingexports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. But this follows almost two years of unabated military support: arms export licences from Germany aloneamounted to €485mof equipment in the 19 months after 7 October.I understand Europe’s historical guilt, internal divisions anddeep economic tieswith Israel. But it is impossible to ignore a more uncomfortable truth: Europe’s political and moral paralysis over Gaza is intimately linked to thestructural racismandviolencewhich so many black, brown and Muslim Europeans face every day. It is clear to me that attitudes towards Gaza are shaped by an enduring colonial mentality that is embedded in the EU’s foreign, trade and migration policies. The same dehumanising logic applied to racialised Europeans andrefugeesfrom Africa, Asia and the Middle East is now in plain view in the EU’s abandonmentof the Palestinian people.Europe’s domestic and external biases are feeding off and sustaining each other. This connection is not abstract. It is glaringly visible in the disparity of treatment of Ukraine and Gaza. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine was rightly condemned by the EU, which imposedsevere and unprecedentedsanctions on Moscow, gave more money to Kyiv and repeatedly condemned other states that did not follow suit. Palestinian lives, however, are treated as expendable, their suffering is minimised while children arerobbed of their childhoods. The suffering in Gaza, framed as a humanitarian crisis rather than a deliberate political choice, is decontextualised, depoliticised and sanitised. EU policymakers should listen when the Palestinian-American academic Rashid Khalidi says this conflict is “the last colonial war in the modern age”.The moral reckoning over the EU’s inaction on Gaza cannot be partial or piecemeal. It must include a recognition of how Europe’s past and present intersect, not only when it comes to Palestine but in many of its actions on the global stage. An EU that sees itself as a defender of international law and global justice should be willing to have these difficult conversations – in fact, it should encourage them. But the largely Eurocentric EU-policy circles see such talk as divisive.Without serious self-examination and long overdue action, the EU’s very visible double standards will continue to undermine its democracy at home and its credibility abroad.An updating of the 2020anti-racism action plancould provide a way forward. But for that to happen, measures to combat the currentalarming stateof EU-wide discrimination must be backed by clear-eyed reflections on Europe’s history. This too is overdue. The action plan has lost momentum and a recent bureaucratic reshuffle has sidelinedMichaela Moua, the first EU anti-racism coordinator, in what many fear could further undermine the bloc’s equality agenda in the coming years.Still, public pressure anddissent within EU institutions, including among senior officials, is growing. Von der Leyen, who has been criticised for her unwaveringpro-Israel bias, hascome outagainst plans for an Israeli occupation of Gaza City. It is far from enough. Critics of the EU’s stance are right to decry its double standards, its betrayal of international law and the eroding of its own credibility. Israel’s plans for occupying the whole of Gaza must be stopped, food must be brought in urgently and there must be an immediate ceasefire.Any serious reckoning over the EU’s inaction inGazawill remain incomplete without confronting the structural racism and lingering colonial hierarchies that still shape Europe’s worldview. Gaza has stripped away the pretence. The EU’s policymakers must finally confront these truths, however harsh, and act to dismantle them.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

We must address Australia’s growing inequality which is one of the major causes of weak productivity and declining living standards in Australia.We are now the second-wealthiest country in the world yet one in eight of us still lives in poverty, including one in six children. Meanwhile, wealth inequality continues to grow. Shares and investment property in Australia are very unequally distributed - the top 10% hold around 80% of those assets by value. And while those in the top 10% hold nearly $5m each in wealth, more than 600,000 people have been living on $395 per week for more than a year, with the unemployment payment now just 43% of the minimum wage. Many among this group are older people and people with disability.The ultra-wealthy have exploited Australia’s tax system for too long. It’s time to ensure everyone pays their fair share | Sally McManusRead moreWhat are the benefits?This dramatic concentration of wealth has been driven by damaging policy decisions with major social implications which harm us all. Large concentrations of wealth undermine competition and economic dynamism, grow the political influence of vested interests and deny opportunities for people, stifling innovation.OECD studies have found that reducing inequality increases a country’s GDP. If people have stable housing and decent incomes, we are much healthier and better able to learn and work. Poverty is one of the most expensive policy choices we continue to make. If our employment services were reformed, as well as the system to recognise overseas qualifications, we could provide the real help people need to develop the right skills and secure the jobs available now and into the future. For example, in Australia 5.5 million people are living with a disability. Truly tackling ableism, racism and ageism will help more people achieve their potential.What are the downsides?There is no downside to a fairer, more equal society that lifts living standards especially for those who have fallen behind.How practical is it?The Australian Council of Social Service has several proposals to improve productivity to create a fairer, better society that are both practical and reasonable. We believe that loopholes in our personal income tax system should be closed so that people pay their fair share of tax on investment incomes. This should include a gradual halving of the capital gains discount for individuals and trusts from 50% to 25%, reducing it 5% per year over five years.The use of private trusts and companies to shelter income should also be addressed to broaden the income tax base and address intergenerational inequity. These tax changes would put a break on growing inequality and also encourage more productive investments.Australia has engineers driving Uber – migrants’ skills and qualifications need to be recognised now | Violet RoumeliotisRead moreWe also have a range of proposals to improve productivity and quality in community services, lift public investment in housing for those with the least, and support households and businesses to adjust to climate change. Government needs to do more – not less – in all of these areas.How politically risky is it?There is far greater political risk in not acting to address inequality and raise living standards. Our polling in partnership with the University of New South Wales found 74% of people in Australia agreed that the gap between the wealthy and those living in poverty is too great and should be reduced.If inequality continues to grow it will present an increasing threat to economic dynamism and innovation, social wellbeing and democracy. At the same time, there is growing community support for the changes we would like to see, including fixing our woefully inadequate social security system.Dr Cassandra Goldie AO is the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social ServicesExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOne Big IdeaInequalityTaxcommentShareReuse this content"

But those appeared to be regarded as costs of doing business, at least when that business involves handling large sums of money and dealing with people who want to move it quickly.Until recently, non-financial corporations could, and did, take the same attitude. Offences such as wage theft attracted derisory penalties, if they were prosecuted at all. Even negligence leading to workplace deaths and injuries rarely involved substantial fines.Qantas fined $90m for illegally sacking ground staff as judge describes airline as ‘the wrong kind of sorry’Read moreQantas benefitedan estimated $100m a yearfrom outsourcing its baggage handling, though this may have been overoptimistic. Based on past precedent, Qantas managers would have assessed that any penalty could easily be recouped by cost savings. But with penalties of over $200m, as well as very substantial legal costs, it will take years before the airline comes out ahead. It would certainly have been better to engage in good-faith negotiations.All these developments followed decades of labour market reforms (a term meaning “change” which almost invariably refers to change for the worse). Nearly all of these reforms strengthened the position of employers and weakened that of workers. In particular, the enterprise bargaining system introduced under the Hawke-Keating government made strikes presumptively illegal, outside the limits of “protected industrial action”. The enterprise bargaining framework made it easy for corporations to replace their existing employees with lower-paid workers from labour hire agencies, or to outsource work altogether.Concerns about reputational damage used to play an important role in discouraging bad corporate behaviour. But Qantas’ 2011 lockout, highly successful in boosting profits, was seen as a lesson by many other employers. It took another decade before the ruthless profiteering of the Alan Joyce era began to erode the idea that the beloved “flying kangaroo” deserved the role of a national flag carrier, even though it had been privatised in the 1990s.Pushback from workers has been slow, but it has begun to have an effect. In contrast to its glacial pace on most policy issues, the Albanese government has been active in protecting workers’ rights. Deliberate wage theft has finally been criminalised at a national level from 1 January this year. The labour hire loophole has also been addressed, along with attacks on penalty rates.But the fundamental problems of enterprise bargaining remain. As Shae McCrystal of the University of Sydney has observed, the solution to the outsourcing problem lies inmulti-employer and industry-level bargaining. It shouldn’t be significantly cheaper to outsource your workers. If all employers within a sector have to pay the same rates through multi-employer or industry-level agreements, the incentive to outsource falls away.Australia has engineers driving Uber – migrants’ skills and qualifications need to be recognised now | Violet RoumeliotisRead moreBut employers are pushing back against this. In the lead-up to this week’s economic roundtable, there have been plenty of pronouncements aboutthe need for deregulationand the removal of unspecified “red tape” which issaid to be “strangling growth”.Despite this, it seems the tide has turned in favour of workers. Work from home has changed the culture of office work, much to the dismay of CEOs, with clear net benefits for the economy as a whole arising from reduced commuting and better work-life balance. The push for shorter standard working hours, abandoned after the failure of the 35-hour week campaign in the 1980s, is back on the agenda.There is much to be done to restore a fair balance of power in the workplace. The hefty penalty imposed on Qantas is one small step in that direction.John Quiggin is a professor at the University of Queensland’s School of EconomicsExplore more on these topicsIndustrial relationsOpinionQantasBusinessAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

Paul McCartney reveals how many of the Fab Four’s ‘far-out’ masterpieces were inspired by their sonic breakthroughsElizabeth AlkerTue 19 Aug 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt is a sunny October afternoon and I am sitting in a long wood-panelled hallway in an old converted townhouse in London waiting to be called into the office ofPaul McCartney. I am dressed in my best clothes and trying not to let nerves get the better of me. I am here to ask him about an aspect of his career that is rarely discussed but which, I believe, helped cement his reputation as a world-conquering compositional force and which made the Beatles the most interesting and influential band of all time.In the mid-1960s, as well as topping the charts, turning a generation of teenage girls hysterical and finding themselves the focus of obsessive media attention, the Beatles were also engaged with, and educating themselves about, the work of classical music’s most audacious and important composers.My plastic bag full of tape loop sounds took Tomorrow Never Knows to another placeMcCartney watched the communist and free improviser Cornelius Cardew play the prepared piano at the Royal College of Art in London. He saw Karlheinz Stockhausen deliver an address about the development of synthesised sound. And he went to meet Delia Derbyshire (“She was in a shed at the bottom of her garden full of machines”) to ask if she wanted to write an electronic score for Yesterday. He attended a lecture by the Italian composer and electronic experimentalist Luciano Berio, who later arranged a series of songs by the Beatles for his first wife, the mezzo-soprano Cathy Berberian.View image in fullscreenClassical student … McCartney at a lecture by electronic experimentalist Luciano Berio.Photograph: Les Lee/Getty ImagesThe Beatles, McCartney tells me, also took their cue from the 1956 piece Radio Music by John Cage for one of the band’s most famous songs: “Cage had a piece that started at one end of the radio’s range,” he says, “and he just turned the knob and went through to the end, scrolling randomly through all the stations. I brought that idea to I Am the Walrus. I said, ‘It’s got to be random.’ We ended up landing on some Shakespeare – King Lear. It was lovely having that spoken word at that moment. And that came from Cage.”On a purple velvet sofa in his office, McCartney talks to me with the same irrepressible energy that has driven his contribution to music for more than 60 years. He also has a very endearing way of never assuming knowledge and very politely checks, for instance, that I know about his friend, John. “You know, John Lennon?” (I do.) And did I know the Beatles had “this song called Yesterday?” (I did). He seems delighted to talk less about his own achievements and more about the people who helped broaden his scope.View image in fullscreenAlchemy … musique concrète pioneer Pierre Schaeffer.Photograph: INA/Getty ImagesTwo men who certainly did that were French composer-engineers Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaeffer who, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, pioneered a style of composition calledmusique concrète. Working in Parisian studios set up for propaganda broadcasts during the second world war, the pair used turntables and tape machines to forge an entirely original method of composing which, in line with French movements in art and philosophy at the time, sought to deconstruct established ideas and build from scratch a new means of making music.This was iconoclasm driven by an erosion of trust in a ruling class that had led millions to their deaths during two brutal international conflicts. Schaeffer and Henry recorded natural or found sounds on to magnetic tape – the bark of a dog, the whistle or chugging of a train, a cackling voice – and then, using tape machines to slow down, speed up or reverse the original sound, they created collages of altered or “manipulated” recordings that are completely bewildering and mesmeric. Our ear is lured by that which is familiar and then unsettled by its abstraction. The suggestion is that all is not what it seems – the very essence of psychedelia.“Not everything we see is clear and figurative,” McCartney says to me, pointing to a Willem de Kooning painting next to us on the wall. “Sometimes when you’re asleep or you rub your eye, you see an abstract: your mind knows about it. We know about this stuff. It was the same with music. We were messing around, but our minds could still accept it because it was something that we already kind of knew anyway. Even though we were in another lane to more classical composers, we were kind of equal in that we also wanted freedom.”You think: ‘Oh well, our audience wants a pop song.’ Then you read about William BurroughsAfter buying a pair of his own Brenell tape machines, McCartney set about looping and spooling these ideas into the work he had to do for “his day job”. He describes the recording ofTomorrow Never Knows, “which was shaping up to be kind of a far-out Beatles song”. McCartney remembers carrying a plastic bag full of tape loops – on which he’d recorded various sounds at home – to Abbey Road during sessions for Revolver. “I set up the tape machines to create popping, whirring and dissolving sounds all mixed together. There could have been a guitar solo in it – straightforward or wacky – but when you put the tape loops in, they take it to another place because when they play, you get all these kind of happy accidents. They’re unpredictable and that suited that track. We used those tricks to get the effect we wanted.”The result is a myriad of strange musical textures and meditative drones, a sonic vacuum into which all our troubling thoughts and feelings are swallowed up and disappear. It’s a big part of what made the Beatles as colourful as the recreational substances that were so popular at the time. It’s also the alchemical element in their work that helped put them in a different league, in terms of their legacy and influence.Eventually John Lennon also procured a pair of Brenell machines and entered new realms of experimentalism. This produced the hypnotic track Revolution 9: “John was fascinated and he loved the craziness of it,” McCartney says. He, meanwhile, preferred to use these new studio gadgets “in a controlled way”, working within the pop-song format, cherrypicking interesting stylistic elements and twisting them into the Beatles’ established song-writing template.Together the pair fashioned a new, intelligent and avant garde-informed kind of pop music – a reminder, as if we need it, of the magic of the Lennon-McCartney partnership. The push and pull of two genius creatives working together to upend the status quo. “You think, ‘Oh well our audience wants a pop song,’” McCartney says. “And then you might read about William Burroughs using the cut-up technique and you think, ‘Well, he had an audience, and his audience liked what he did.’ And eventually we decided that our audiences would come along with us, rather than it being down to us to feed them a conventional diet.”View image in fullscreen‘John loved the craziness’ … McCartney with Alker in his office.Photograph: Courtesy: Elizabeth AlkerMy quest into the roots of this trippy magic in the Beatles’ music is just one of many explorations I made into the way the 20th century’s most innovative pop musicians borrowed from the classical avant garde, for my book Everything We Do Is Music. In it, I draw a line from John Cale’s drone in the Velvet Underground to the extraordinary Indian classical-inspired sounds in music by La Monte Young; and connect the blistering microtonality of Polish sonorism to the angst-ridden rock of Radiohead. The feminist philosophies of Pauline Oliveros formed a blueprint for techno, meanwhile, and US composers such as Edgard Varèse, John Cage, Steve Reich and Philip Glass found ways to reflect the energy and freneticism of the urban metropolis in their work. In each case, I found that artists on both sides of the pop/classical divide reached across it, disregarding those things that usually separate us – education, class, nationality, gender – to do something epochal.At the end of our conversation, I ask McCartney if he ever felt restricted by the expectations of fans, or limited by his schooling and background. Actually, he says, he always felt a real sense of freedom to engage with the open-minded atmosphere of the time. This was largely thanks to his late wife Linda. “She used to say, ‘It’s allowed.’ And that lit up the skies for me. I’d think, ‘Yeah, it’s allowed.’”Everything We Do is Music by Elizabeth Alker (Faber & Faber, £20) is published on 28 August. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

As his ‘requel’ gets its world premiere, he talks Hammer horror, soundtrack heaven – and how his dad got him into Edgar Allan PoeTue 19 Aug 2025 10.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareWelcome to the celluloid jungle. Guitar legend and Guns N’ Roses axeman Slash is getting into movies, producing a “requel” of the 1983 cult Roger Corman trash classicDeathstalker. The film has its world premiere at the Locarno film festival in Switzerland, where Slash – aka Saul Hudson – is talking up this new addition to his CV.It turns out that Slash’s affection for Deathstalker goes way back. “When I was working at Tower Video, we had it on the monitors all the time. It was a real popular popcorn movie,” he says.“I’ve been producing movies for a little while now. I work with these Canadian producers and I did another film [The Breach] with them back in 2020. They managed to get the IP for Deathstalker, and they asked me about it, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, yes.’ I thought the script was great and Steve Kostanski, a director I love, was into doing it.”View image in fullscreen‘It was a real popcorn movie’ … Slash.Photograph: Randy Holmes/ABC/Getty ImagesKostanski previously co-directed the wonderfully Lovecraftian The Void and the utterly bonkersPsycho Goreman, which with its kooky comedy and OTT splatter is similar in tone to the nostalgic delights and gunky gore of Deathstalker. “It’s all practical effects. I’m not a big CGI guy,” says Slash. “Steve was totally into doing it that way. He had no interest in making it a CGI movie, so we hit it off right away. I knew that Steve could make it better than the budget.”Other fantasy films from the period proved an inspiration. “I loved Krull and the originalConan the Barbarian,” says Slash. “And I loved Deathstalker. It was sort of tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated and low budget, and it had this great theme song. My whole interest in getting to do this new one – which isn’t a remake, it’s sort of another version of it – was really nostalgic for me. Once we got the script, I thought ‘Man, we could really make a great movie.’ And Daniel Bernhardt coming in and being the lead was awesome because he played the part so perfectly. It was really a passion project.”I loved horror from as early as I can remember. That kind of film music was my first real introduction into scoringVeteran stunt performer Bernhardt, who has more than a passing resemblance to Hugh Jackman, plays the not-too-bright hero Deathstalker with a straight face.In the original movie, Deathstalker goes on a quest to collect magical objects and defeat evil wizard Munkar. “It’s got a great sense of humour to it, but it’s still effective as an action movie with a sort of fantasy element to it,” says Slash. “It ticks a lot of boxes.”Slash was born in the UK and spent his early childhood in Stoke-on-Trent before moving to the US at six years old. “I really grew up steeped in British Hammer movies. James Bond – seriously,” he says. “I loved horror from as early on as I can remember. That kind of film music was my first real introduction into scoring. And I don’t know if that had any influence on my tastes or not.” No doubt it did: Guns N’ Roses covered Paul McCartney and Wings’s Live and Let Die on their 1991 album Use Your Illusion I. “As far as visuals and storytelling, those were the first movies. And then there were the Edgar Allan Poe films of Roger Corman and more literary stuff that my dad turned me on to.”View image in fullscreenAxl Rose and Slash on stage with Guns N’ Roses in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, 1991.Photograph: Kevin.Mazur/WireImageSlash’s handlers say strictly no questions about music, so I ask him about how the movies influenced his work. “There’s a lot of different angles to how I got into music and movies and the combination thereof,” he says. “When I was a kid, I always loved movie theme songs and scores, and that’s always been a huge influence on me. I don’t know if it had any influence on me picking up the guitar, I was more of a straight ahead rock’n’roll guy. But when I started getting into the idea of producing movies, one of the things that I was really into was the fact that I’d have some say on the music for whatever movie I was working on.”Slash’s first producer credit was on the 2013 Anne Heche horror movie Nothing Left to Fear; more recently he was involved in producing Scandi-thriller-adapted TV seriesThe Crow Girl, and contributed score music for Nothing Left to Fear and the aforementioned The Breach.“Prior to producing, I’d done a lot of recordings for different movies. So when I pick a movie to produce, the first thing I think about is what the music is going to be like, and whether there’s going to be a theme song; what the vibe is going to be. It speaks to me in a different way than when I just think about writing a rock’n’roll song. I use a completely different part of my musical brain. It’s very satisfying.”Deathstalker is due for release in the US in October.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsSlashGuns N' RosesHorror filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a neat parallel to the housing market, where properties are also getting smaller and more expensive. But Alin’s chief metaphor is the “lost art” of the house party – indicative of her generation’s financial crisis and a wider crack in social cohesion. There’s no space to throw a decent party or the would-be hosts can’t risk trashing their precarious, overpriced rentals or family homes.The argument is put across with brio and evident authenticity on a homely stage decorated with balloons, heart-shaped cushions and a cocktail shaker. Greatly at ease with the audience, Alin plays Skip (smart name for a show about constant upheaval), born and raised in ever-gentrifying east London where she lives with her mum. Skip hearts Hackney, it even says so on her T-shirt, but how have we reached the point where dying in the place you’re from may be an unreachable dream?Bitterness is shot through a predominantly buoyant show with some sparkling sequences: Skip fantasising about “white-pillared Georgians” and other desirable addresses; hitting up RightMove as if it’s PornHub; finding that the TV series Skins has sold her a lie, and likening house parties to oceans while nightclubs are swimming pools.View image in fullscreenAnalytical … House Party.Photograph: Ella MuirEasy gags about gentrification are rife at the Edinburgh fringe but instead Alin gives us an inside perspective and a longer view of familiar issues, anticipating the hollowing-out when gentrifiers move on. The show also occasionally veers into straight standup: “What do they call French windows in France?” But amid the bubbling humour, the threat of homelessness for Skip and her mum is a constant concern.Blaze FM review – high-energy history of pirate radio stationRead moreAlin repeatedly strikes the pose of an analyst, whether explaining why Miley Cyrus’s We Can’t Stop should be on every playlist or the function of house parties for the Windrush generation. It’s two years since Skip left drama school and she gives a lucid account of how her chosen profession is similarly weighted against her, also dominated by those benefiting from inherited wealth.A subplot about a friend who sleeps rough needs deepening, as do a couple of supporting characters.

The matinee coach parties may need to brace themselvesStuart HeritageTue 19 Aug 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 10.16 EDTShareIf the last few days have taught us anything at all, then it is this: if you want Quentin Tarantino to open up about anything, invite him on to a podcast calledThe Church of Tarantino. This is what happened recently, and the slew of new information offered up has been remarkable.Thanks to the podcast appearance, we knowwhich of his movies he likes the best(Inglourious Basterds), why he didn’t make The Movie Critic (it would have been too easy) and who the best director is (him, along with David Fincher). And now comes the most exciting news of all – there will soon be a Tarantino West End play. Tarantino told the podcast that “the play is all written. It is absolutely the next thing I’m going to do. We’ll start the ball rolling on it in January … It’s probably going to take up a year and a half to two years of my life.”In truth, this news doesn’t come as a total surprise. As per the myth he has built around himself, Tarantino’s next movie will be his last. As a way to prolong his career as a film director, he has recently turned his hand to other mediums. He has written books, both fiction and nonfiction, and a script for aOnce Upon a Time … in Hollywoodsequel that will bedirected by Fincher. And now a play.At present, very few details about Tarantino’sWest Enddebut are available. But using what’s known about both Tarantino and the West End landscape, this is more than enough for some rampant speculation.Option one: a musicalView image in fullscreenStuck in the middle … of a row? Reservoir Dogs.Photograph: Rank Film/AllstarMusic has always been integral to Tarantino’s work as a director, plus musicals are the bread and butter of the West End, so it makes perfect sense that this would be his first option. Imagine a version ofReservoir Dogswhere the cast walks out on stage in slow motion belting out a chorus of Little Green Bag, or Mr Blonde performs a soaring version of Stuck in the Middle With You as he hacks that guy’s ear off. Wouldn’t that be great?Or maybe he’d rather start a new musical from scratch. One of the surest ways to make a fortune is to produce a jukebox musical centred around the work of a popular artist. Tarantino must be aware that Mamma Mia! has grossed almost £5bn globally since it debuted. All he’d need to do is pick a singer, string a loose plot based on the titles of their best-known songs and the money would automatically start rolling in. Picture this:Quentin TarantinoPresents the Shape of You, Based on the Music of Ed Sheeran. People would watch that, right?Option two: a murder mysteryView image in fullscreenTarantinodunnit … the 2021 cast of The Mousetrap.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianTarantino has long been able to build a story around specific locations, be it Los Angeles for Once Upon a Time or Japan for Kill Bill. When you think about the history of the West End, you tend to think of The Mousetrap. Wouldn’t it make sense for Tarantino’s work to pay tribute to the heritage of London theatre by making a detective story of his own? It’s a sure way to secure one’s legacy. Just think, 70 years from now the play could still be performed to endless coachloads of elderly tourists and dozing schoolchildren.Option three: a movie adaptationView image in fullscreenMight need a rewrite … Maid in Manhattan.Photograph: Barry Wetcher/APCurrently showing in the West End are plays based on Harry Potter, The Devil Wears Prada, Hercules, The Lion King, Clueless and Back to the Future. The message here is clear: if you want your play to get bums on seats, then adapt it from a film that people are vaguely nostalgic about. Might I be so bold as to suggest that Tarantino tries his hand at aMaid in Manhattanmusical? There’s plenty of room for him to flex his dramatic muscles – the moment where Jennifer Lopez reveals that she was actually a maid all along, probably some other bits – while ensuring that the play is a financial success. Sure, he’d need to make sure that his fingerprints are all over it, so perhaps he could rewrite the ending to have the Lopez character slitting someone’s throat, but it’s worth considering.Option four: a comedyView image in fullscreenProbably where this is heading … The Play That Goes Wrong.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianActually, this is probably where this is all heading. Tarantino has spoken of his desire to write a comic play in the past, saying that he’s intrigued by the challenge of making the audience part of the story. If that’s the case, then the West End is wide open for him. Maybe he could make The Play That Goes Wrong (Because a Gunfight Breaks Out and Everyone Dies in Screaming Blood-Soaked Agony)?Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoTheatreWest EndfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But who will triumph, and whose showstopper will be the much-heralded disaster?Stuart HeritageTue 19 Aug 2025 08.07 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 13.32 EDTShareThe Great British Bake Off is upon us once more, shipping a new fleet of enthusiastic bakers into the big tent for another round of slightly too ambitious bakes. In time, these bakers will become like a second family to their audience. But for now, it’s fair to say, we have no clue who any of them are.So, in time-honoured tradition, here’s my predicted ranking of the 2025 Great British Bake Off intake. The usual qualifications apply: I am basing this solely on the imageless press release that Channel 4 sent out, plus in all the years I have been doing this I have never once been right about anything. You’re welcome!12. Toby, 29, WarwickshireView image in fullscreenHomemaker baker … Toby.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsToby works for a fitness startup, and uses his contestant biography to reveal that he is three years into a home renovation project that was scheduled to last just six months. This leads me to believe that he initially applied to appear on Grand Designs, and is only on Bake Off due to a catastrophic clerical error.11. Lesley, 59, KentView image in fullscreenShort, back and bake … Lesley.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsIt has to be said that Lesley sounds absolutely lovely in her biography. However, she is a hairdresser who insists on giving a slice of cake to all her customers. So now I am fixated on what a terrible hairy cakey biohazard her floor must be, which is why I have ranked her so poorly.10. Nadia, 41, LiverpoolView image in fullscreenKitchen disco … NadiaPhotograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsI’ve been doing this for long enough to know a red flag when I see one, and Nadia is absolutely buried in them. Exhibit A: she is described as a “chatterbox”, which is code for “annoying”. Exhibit B: there are repeated mentions of her performing dance breaks, which is code for “attention seeking”. Exhibit C: like Lesley, she is a hairdresser, which is code for “I, Stuart, am bald and need to take out my insecurities on someone.”9. Iain, 29, BelfastView image in fullscreenRaising his fame … Iain.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsThe big concern with a show such as Bake Off is that it has been around for so long that it tends to attract people so desperate for fame that their personas have solidified into rigid caricatures. Enter Iain, a powerlifting influencer who refers to himself as the Yeastie Boy. However, let me remind you that at the time of writing, I don’t know what any of the contestants look like. If it turns out that Iain is big enough to beat me up, please ignore everything I just said and put him in the top three.8. Aaron, 38, LondonView image in fullscreenHobby crafter … Aaron.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsLots to worry about here. Aaron, who moved to London from Manchester four years ago, uses his contestant bio to make two controversial statements. One is to call himself The King of Hobbies, which makes him sound like a dilettante who never sticks with anything long enough to reach a point of basic competency. The second is that he refers to hotdogs as a snack, which genuinely beggars belief.7. Leighton, 59, SurreyView image in fullscreenMixing it up … Leighton.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsLeighton is a Welshman who lives in Surrey with his California husband and has a mathematical mind, which tends to be an advantage on a show like this. However, Leighton’s bio also reveals that he specialises in a fusion style of baking that doesn’t sound particularly delicious. One of his favourite dishes, for instance, is a victoria sponge with key lime pie filling. Honestly.6. Tom, 31, LondonView image in fullscreenBake it to make it … Tom.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsTom is a “creative entrepreneur”, which means that he founded an advertising agency then left it. The worrying part of his bio, though, is the bit where he citesNadiya Hussainas an inspiration, because she has dealt with a level of fame that he thinks he will soon experience. I’m worried that getting eliminated from a cooking show one week before the quarter-final is going to turn the poor man into an absolute monster.5. Jasmine, 23, LondonView image in fullscreenPass the cake slice … Jasmine.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsJasmine is a Scottish medical student. This would be the most interesting thing about her, except she is clearly so competitive that she used her bio to blow Aaron out of the water. Forget hotdogs; Jasmine thinks that “a big bowl of pasta” qualifies as a snack. Wild.4. Jessika, 32, LondonView image in fullscreenFahrenheit rising … Jessika.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsA few of the bios hint at someone’s showstopper going dramatically wrong in the upcoming season. My money is on the culprit being Jessika. A Cornish drag king, Jessika mentions that one of her showstoppers was “wildly heavy” and that she had to cover it in tempered chocolate in a panic.3. Hassan, 30, South YorkshireView image in fullscreenRecipe master … Hassan.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsI’ve got a very good feeling about Hassan. This is purely because he is an analytical research and development scientist by trade, so is statistically much less likely to get into a tizzy and dump a litre of milk into a bread dough or whatever. However, let me temper this enthusiasm by pointing out that, in his bio, he states that he’d like to make a book-shaped cake one day. You have to worry about a man whose flight of fancy involves baking something in the shape of a rectangle.2. Pui Man, 51, EssexView image in fullscreenDessert designer … Pui Man.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsPui Man was born in Hong Kong and spends her free time distributing surplus supermarket food around her Essex community. As well as sounding extremely nice, she is also ambitious, stating that she wants to be the first Bake Off contestant ever to receive a hug from Paul Hollywood. Hopefully she can back up this ostentatious aspiration or, like Icarus before her, she will plummet back to Earth unhugged.1. Nataliia, 32, East YorkshireView image in fullscreenIcing on the cake … Nataliia.Photograph: Channel 4 / Love ProductionsNataliia sounds like one of those fairytale Bake Off contestants who represent the very best of the country. A Ukrainian, she moved here a year before the war began, and her family followed as refugees. She has the potential to demonstrate that British people are more welcoming than headlines would have you believe. She also says that a cheese straw is an acceptable snack, which if nothing else clearly puts her head and shoulders above the pasta woman from earlier.The Great British Bake Off is back on 2 September at 8pm on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe Great British Bake OffFood TVBakingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now in its third year and approaching a final 10 nights at Wembley Stadium – though it’s expected to return from 2027 – Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres tour is now the highest attended in rock history with more than 12m tickets sold.It’s easy to see why. Over the Springsteen-esque shimmer of Higher Power, Chris Martin and co offer up a dizzying dose of Technicolor funk-pop with a level of production that is as impressive as it is overwhelming. At times it’s like being plugged into a VR version of a “good vibes only” LSD trip, including sections with the band dressed as cute aliens and the audience wearing 3D glasses that turn everything into lovehearts.There’s nokiss-cam dramatonight and Martin is in effusive form, gushing praise for Hull and the crowd to almost sycophantic levels. It’s arguably futile to criticise the cloying earnestness and heavy-handed sentiment of Coldplay, given how baked into their DNA and appeal it is by now, but it’s laid on so thick it can feel exhausting.View image in fullscreenEruptive energy … Coldplay at Craven Park.Photograph: Andrew Benge/Getty Images‘The Black experience is more than just London’: Chiedu Oraka, the Hull rapper handpicked to support ColdplayRead moreHowever, it is lapped up thirstily. When Martin tells the audience to “dance like nobody’s watching” over the EDM stomp of A Sky Full of Stars, to wave at someone in the crowd as if they are “a best friend you’ve not met yet” during the eruptive surge of Yellow, or to send positivity to the people of Sudan through wiggling their fingers as pyrotechnics pop, they do just that.Fix You is turned into an almost candlelit mass-type singalong as the audience’s wristbands turn into a warm yellow glow, and from a pounding version of Clocks to the gentle acoustic hum of Sparks, the band command, control and own every inch of the vast space as they move around it.An attempt at a karaoke-style singalong with the crowd to All My Love as a finale falls flat but it matters little. Fireworks are soon exploding again, bookending an evening that is pure visual extravaganza and intoxicating spectacle – like a rush of sugar to the head.Explore more on these topicsMusicColdplayPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

That film earned dreadful reviews, poor audience feedback and just $38m (£28m) at the global box office, compared to the original’s $353m (£261m).“If it goes the way the one that I was in went, I would just say, I don’t know why you’d do it,” said Stone. “I mean, go ahead, but good fucking luck.”She continued by questioning the logistics of her character’s return. “I’m at that stage where I already retired once, and I already died a couple of times,” Stone said. “I’m like, ‘What are you gonna do? Kill me again? Go ahead.’”Speaking last weekto the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone, Stone was yet more scornful about the project, saying: “There’s not going to be a Basic Instinct reboot. I hate to break it to you, but Joe Eszterhas couldn’t write himself out of a Walgreens drug store.”Stone, who is now promotingNobody 2, went on to say she “pretty much owned the 90s as an actress” before explaining that a stroke that led to a brain haemorrhage in 2001 stopped her working.She then took time out to raise a family before returning to acting.“I want to leave it on the screen,” she said, “because it lasts for ever, and I won’t. And I’m sure of that.”‘A wild and orgasmic ride’: Basic Instinct set for ‘anti-woke’ rebootRead moreLast month is was reported that Eszterhas, 80, has signed a deal with Amazon MGM: the streamer guarantees a $2m (£1.5m) fee for his new Basic Instinct script, which will be upped to $4m (£3m) should the film be made, making it the most lucrative spec sale of the year.“To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: the rumours of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist,” Esztherhas said, in a statement to the Wrap.“I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN and he lives somewhere deep inside me. He was born 29 and he will die 29 and he tells me he is ‘sky high up’ to write this piece and provide viewers with a wild and orgasmic ride. That makes me very happy.”Explore more on these topicsFilmSharon StoneThrillersnewsShareReuse this content"

So why have Field Music become a Doors cover band?Faced with ‘catastrophic financial doom’ in a difficult industry, the Sunderland outfit explain why imitating Jim Morrison is their way to surviveDaniel Dylan WrayTue 19 Aug 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 19 Aug 2025 10.31 EDTShareFor years,Field Musicplayfully toyed with the idea of forming a hybrid cover band called AC/BGs, featuring one set of AC/DC songs done in a Saturday Night Fever-style and one set of rock-heavy Bee Gees numbers. “These things are a joke until they stop being a joke,” says David Brewis, one half of the Sunderland art-pop band.Another idea made it beyond a tour bus gag to become their new side hustle: a Doors tribute band calledthe Fire Doors. When the band announced it on Facebook last month, they received critical questions asking: why? The band’s response was a piercingly honest multi-page statement. Brewis wrote of Field Music’s sincere love of the band, the high levels of skill required to do such a job proficiently – and how doing one tribute gig a month could help their “dire finances”, having accepted that after nine albums, they have “quietly passed into contemporary irrelevance”. He had an emphatic signoff: “Why the hell should I be embarrassed?”They were flooded with hundreds of comments of support from other professional musicians in similar scenarios. “Our situation is not unusual at all,” says Brewis. “There are tons of musicians who subsidise work by playing in some kind of entertainment band but mostly don’t talk about it because it’s seen as naff or embarrassing. It’s like a dirty secret. But me saying it out loud, because I have no shame, illustrated something unspoken.”The Fire Doors performing live – videoIt’s been 20 years since Field Music’s self-titled debut album was released, a milestone they will be celebrating with a live run in November. In that time, they’ve toured the world, released three Top 40 albums, have Spotify streams in the millions,found a fan in Princeand mostly made a living from their music. To many, Field Music are the definition of a successful band. “To have kept going without ever compromising is incredible,” concedes Brewis. “We’ve never had a hit, so we’ve never had to conform to anyone’s expectations. We’ve continued to make weird music just for us. But the world has changed.”An ageing audience, combined with an inability to neatly fit into the modern world of genre playlists, along with post-Covid industry changes, has hit them hard. “We’ve always worked on the tiniest of margins,” says Brewis. “So to then be selling three-quarters of the records we used to sell, while having to do twice the amount of promo, and finding it doubly hard to sell the same number of tickets for a gig – those are the things which turn our tiny margin of sustainability into catastrophic financial doom.”They see this necessary shift into cover-band territory – a move they say will sharpen their skills and benefit Field Music – as being symbolic of a wider cultural landscape. “Everyone in the creative industries has a portfolio career and juggling that is now the reality,” Brewis says. “But juggling that so you feel like you’re doing something worthwhile and not compromising your principles – that’s the game. That’s survival.”His brutal honesty has inadvertently paid off. “I only posted on Facebook because I thought, oh, this might sell, like, 10 tickets for our gig,” Brewis says. “And then it kind of blew up. Prior to that, I’d maybe sent 50 emails to venues and had only managed to book three gigs. We’re now booked until next September.”View image in fullscreenThe full Fire Doors band.Photograph: Ian WestAnd with good reason. This isn’t a half-arsed side project by any means. The band – made up of Andrew Moore; Brewis’s brother and bandmate, Peter; and the Futureheads’ David Hyde – are a genuine force and pull the Doors’ hits off with clout and conviction. The result achieves that magic combination of being so tight they almost sound loose. “I’m taking it very, very seriously,” says Brewis, before listing the books, documentaries and live footage he’s been studying. “It feels like a research project. Every little element of it we are digging into. Which is maybe why it doesn’t feel cheesy and naff. It feels like academia. Or like an acting role. But it’s also justsomuch fun.”Brewis is the band’s Jim Morrison and, on stage, he looks the part: long hair, necklace, leather trousers (faux – he’s vegetarian). He mimics the outre singer with subtlety, singing for prolonged periods with his eyes closed, twisting himself around the mic stand before bending himself in half. His voice is the most remarkable aspect. For those familiar with Brewis’s high-register offerings in Field Music (a Talking Heads cover band may have seemed more likely) it’s a shock to hear such a deep, raspy voice bellowing from his chest. “It is quite throat-shredding,” he admits.For Brewis, aside from having fun with his mates, this is simply some clear transparency and communication of what life as a professional musician entails for many people now. “The music industry is selling a lifestyle,” he says. “A kind of aspiration. A lot of money is made based on the perception of success, glamour or cool. I don’t think what we’re selling is very appealing, but this is authenticity.”Field Music’s 20th anniversary shows run from 7-14 November.

Zainab Johnson’s maiden fringe set – although she’s already a big noise in the US – gives an account of how she came to own a firearm. It’s not an explicitly political show – if a show about gun ownership by a black,Muslim, Americanfemale is allowed to be anything but. But Toxically Optimistic does invite engagement with some searching questions about guns, their use, and the safety they supposedly ensure – even if, so poised is Johnson’s delivery, you barely notice it doing so.Hers is that particularly American style of standup that can feel too polished for UK tastes: smiling, slick and a little bit frictionless. If a British comedian tells a dating story, you can bet they’ll be the butt of the joke; when Johnson does, it’s to lord it over the short guy who wants but can’t have her. Small wonder she is, by her own account, an eternal optimist – even if that quality is now to be tested when a friend tells her, apropos of her buying her own house, that she should acquire a gun without delay.Liam Withnail: Big Strong Boy review – look back in laughter at misfit youthRead moreIs that so? Johnson resists, and keeps resisting, even when her friend drags her to a shooting range, even when she imagines the home invasion scenario that might make a gun worthwhile. She asks herself questions about fear, with reference to an odd anecdote about a homeless man and a “bucket of shit”, and about safety, which has arguably been secured, but at what cost?Delivered with authority by the Harlem comic, the tone is smooth and philosophical, with the safety catch coming off only occasionally – see the excellent joke explaining why she takes notes when out on a first date. The show’s final quarter pivots to a different subject entirely – and a less compelling one, too, notwithstanding that Johnson justifies it persuasively with a take-that reveal at the end. If you didn’t know she was armed and dangerous before, that fine flourish of an ending proves it.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalUS gun controlreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there’s space too for quite-a-sticky-period comedy, a notch down on the scale of bad stuff that happens, but no less significant in the lives of those lucky enough to keep actual trauma at bay.That’s Liam Withnail’s mode in Big Strong Boy, which, from a vantage point of modest career success in his mid-30s, revisits a mild crisis weathered half a lifetime ago. In his unassuming hands, it takes the shape of a lovely story about misfit adolescence, family love, the guilt we carry – and redemption.Now resident in Edinburgh, Withnail transports us back to his youth in Dagenham, the support of whose tourist board he is unlikely be currying. In a town where, at least back then, homophobic abuse would follow on the slightest deviation from sartorial norm, young Liam does not fit in. He tries and fails to have a love affair with his “indie sleaze” soulmate. With his brother, he steals his dad’s Guinness, aged only seven, triggering a precocious alcohol habit. It spirals, he gets depressed, Dagenham starts feeling less dead end, more death sentence.The Ego review – tricksy stories from film sets and award ceremoniesRead moreNotwithstanding the volume of booze consumed, Withnail knows this is dramatic small beer. But it means a lot to him, to his mum, with her addiction to ALL CAPS text messages, and to his “leprechaun” dad. In an artfully structured show, directed by Jet Vevers, Withnail reconsiders this period in response to the question “Are you happy?”, which catches him cold. Was he then? Is he now? One of the story’s key players resurfaces in the present day, helping absolve our host’s guilt and make peace with the unwise teenager he once was.A churl may argue that the show’s charge by this point is more sentimental than comic. For my money, Withnail gets the balance right. Fine jokes about Grenade protein bars, generational reactions to comedy, and his parents’ indulgent child-rearing style keep the heart light in this tale of a teenager in panic, and his adult self letting him off the hook.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 August.

I feel really grateful to be moving through the world. I think I’m OK, but it’s like a daily struggle, obviously.”Baena, who directed Plaza in the comedies Life After Beth and The Little Hours, killed himself at the age of 47 at his Los Angeles home. At the time, a joint statement from Plaza and his familycalledit “an unimaginable tragedy”.In her interview with Poehler, Plaza used the Apple sci-fi horrorThe Gorgeas a “really dumb analogy” to describe the aftermath.“It’s like an alien movie with Miles Teller,” she said. “In the movie, there’s a cliff on one side and a cliff on the other side and there’s a gorge in between and it’s filled with all these monster people that are trying to get them. I swear when I watched it, I was like, ‘That what this feels like, what my grief is like – or what grief could be like.’ At all times there’s like a giant ocean of awfulness that’s likeright there, and I can see it. And sometimes, I just want to dive into it and be in it. And then sometimes, I just look at it. And then sometimes, I’m just trying to get away from it. But it’s always there. It’s just always there. And the monster people are trying to get me like Miles Teller.”The pair met in 2011 and married in 2021.In anobituaryfor the Guardian, Ryan Gilbey praised Baena’s “enjoyably twisted” movies. Baena also co-wrote I Heart Huckabees with David O Russell, and his final film was the dark comedy Spin Me Round, starring Plaza and Alison Brie.Plaza’s film roles also include Ingrid Goes West and Emily the Criminal, and she can next be seen in Ethan Coen’s comedy Honey Don’t.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

In a statement on 7 August, it said that Boyne had been longlisted “on merit” and that it was “inevitable” that “even within our community, we can at times hold radically different positions on substantive issues”.The statement in protest against Boyne’s longlisting, drafted in response to Polari’s 7 August statement, said that the author had “publicly and unequivocally associated himself with trans exclusionary sentiments”, citing anIrish Independentarticle in which Boyne expressed support for JK Rowling and described himself as a “fellow Terf”. Its hundreds of signatories included Alice Oseman, the author of Heartstopper, along with the writers Nikesh Shukla, Julia Armfield, Naoise Dolan and Seán Hewitt.Author Nicola Dinan, who won the Polari first book prize last year for her novel Bellies, resigned from this year’s jury for the debut prize. Guardian journalist Jason Okundaye asked for his book Revolutionary Acts to be removed from this year’s first book prize longlist, while Andrew McMillan withdrew his book Pity from the longlist for the overall Polari book prize for non-debuts, for which Boyne was also longlisted.Writingin the Guardianlast week, Okundaye said that the prize had “always been for the entire LGBTQ+ community”, and so “it is a contradiction to include someone who is trans-exclusionary”.In aresponseto the controversy, Boyne said that it seemed “absurd and wrong” that debut writers who were withdrawing were losing an opportunity, and said that if they returned, he would ask judges not to consider his novella, Earth, for the shortlist.Writing in the Telegraphon Tuesday, he called Polari’s decision to cancel the prize an “interesting example of self-cancellation”, and said that nobody from the prize had contacted him. “Had they done so, perhaps a happier resolution might have been found”.Explore more on these topicsBooksJohn BoyneSexualityTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Its scheduled screening was less than a month after Osbourne’s death. It was also less than three weeks after his wife, Sharon, and their childrenappeared before crowdsin his home city of Birmingham.In a new statement, the corporation suggested the delay had come after a request from the musician’s family. “Our sympathies are with the Osbourne family at this difficult time,” aBBCspokesperson said. “We are respecting the family’s wishes to wait a bit longer before airing this very special film. The new [broadcast] date will be confirmed shortly.”The BBC had recently stated that the film would go ahead. Clare Sillery, head of commissioning for BBC Documentaries, said earlier this month that the film, Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home, captured “family moments, humour, reflection and shows the enduring spirit that made Ozzy a global icon. We hope it brings comfort and joy to Ozzy’s fans and viewers as they remember and celebrate his extraordinary life”.The programme is not the only documentary in the offing about the life of the late star. Paramount+ has also made a feature-length film, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, about his struggles since a serious fall in LA in 2019. It had been slated to run later this year.The BBC’s documentary had already been completely overhauled as Osbourne’s health deteriorated. It was originally envisaged as a much wider, 10-part series called Home to Roost, which followed Ozzy and Sharon’s attempt to restart their lives back in the UK.It has now been re-edited into a one-off film, showing Osbourne’s battling attempts to become strong enough to perform and his struggles with ill-health. Osbournedied last month, aged 76, just weeks afterperforming from a throneon stage at Villa Park. The singer had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2019.The BBC film includes interviews with Osbourne family members, including Sharon, Kelly and Jack. It had been due to air on BBC One on Monday night, but was removed from the schedule earlier in the day.

It is known for its architecture that resembles alávvu(a Sámi hut).View image in fullscreenThe church is to be rolled to its new home at a pace of half-a-kilometre an hourPhotograph: Leonhard Föger/ReutersOn Wednesday, a church service and coffee event will be held in an attempt to break a world record for church coffee. There will also be musical entertainment, including a concert with the singer Carola.The church is expected to reopen at its new location at the end of next year, but the city’s entire relocation is not expected to be completed until 2035.The church is one of 23 cultural buildings being relocated in what LKAB has described as “a unique event in world history”. The mine’s operator gave residents the option to either financially compensate those affected by the town’s relocation or rebuild homes or buildings.LKAB mineThe expansion has attracted criticism, including from the Sámi community, who fear that fragmentation of the land will make reindeer herding more difficult and threaten the town’s Indigenous culture and way of life.Karin K Niia, a reindeer owner and board member of Gabna Sameby, a Sámi village that has its year-round lands in Kiruna municipality, said the moving of the church was a “big show” to distract from the destruction of the town and the culture of its Indigenous people.The church was just “one small part of Kiruna” that had been chosen to be preserved, she said, accusing the company of “land-grabbing” the grazing territory needed to support Sámi culture.“It feels rather difficult to see the move of the church when I’m well aware of the consequences that mining activities have on everything around it: biodiversity, the air, pollution of water, reindeer and wildlife in general,” she said.“They have planned it all in order to get people’s attention, media attention on this state-owned company and their action to preserve the church as a symbol for the cultural heritage of Kiruna.”Stefan Hämäläinen, senior vice president of urban development at LKAB, said: “The move of Kiruna church is necessary for it to continue to exist at all. LKAB has moved a vast amount of buildings in the ongoing urban transformation that began planning over 20 years ago. We are obliged to compensate for what is affected by the mine. In the same way, we seek constructive solutions when mining operations affect reindeer herding, as it is an important part of Sami society and culture.”View image in fullscreenPeople watching the move.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesIt has previously declined to specify the cost of the move, but on Tuesday the chief executive, Jan Moström, said it had cost more than half a billion kronor. He insisted it was worth the money.“If the mine is to remain, we have to move Kiruna city centre. Kiruna city centre without the church, I can’t see it – so there are no alternatives,” he said during SVT’s live broadcast.The altarpiece of the church, a pastel landscape by the late Prince Eugen of Sweden, and the more than 2,000-pipe organ have been carefully wrapped for the journey, and the ground around the church’s former location dug out so that beams could be placed underneath.“The church is sitting on a beam system, then two rows of trailers were brought in,” the LKAB project manager, Stefan Holmblad Johansson, said. These were slid underneath the beams.The bell tower, which is a separate structure, will be moved next week.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeHeritageArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

The director himself has finally weighed in – while also sharing his personal favourite and which of his films he was “born to make”.Speaking onThe Church of Tarantinopodcast, the 62-year-old film-maker said his 2009 second world war drama Inglourious Basterds was the best of his nine films, while his 2019 movieOnce Upon a Time … in Hollywoodwas his favourite.“But I think Kill Bill is the ultimate Quentin movie, like nobody else could’ve made it,” he added, of his two-part martial arts thriller. “Every aspect about it is so particularly ripped, like with tentacles and bloody tissue, from my imagination and my id and my loves and my passion and my obsession.“So I think Kill Bill is the movie I was born to make, I thinkInglourious Basterdsis my masterpiece but Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood is my favourite.”Tarantino is famed for writing all the feature films he’s directed since his 1992 debut Reservoir Dogs. When the conversation turned to screenplays, Tarantino said: “I think Inglourious Basterds is my best script, and I think Hateful Eight and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood are right behind.‘It would have been cool’: what happened to Quentin Tarantino’s Star Trek movie?Read more“But, there’s an aspect of Hateful Eight that I actually think is probably my best directing of my material, ie, the material is written and it’s solid,” he added. “So it’s not like I have to create it, like Kill Bill – it’s solid, it’s right there and I actually think it’s my best servicing [of] my material as a director.”Tarantino has chosen not to direct his sequel to Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, which follows the fading actor Rick, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his stuntman, Cliff, played by Brad Pitt, in 1969 Los Angeles. Instead he handed the reins toDavid Fincher, who will direct The Adventures of Cliff Booth for Netflix. Tarantino remains the writer and producer.“I think me and David Fincher are the two best directors,” Tarantino said. “So the idea that David Fincher actually wants to adapt my work, to me, shows a level of seriousness towards my work that I think needs to be taken into account.”Tarantino revealed he is working on a play which will open in the West End of London in 2026 before returning to work on his final film.He remains committed to retiring after his 10th film, having previously said: “Most directors have horrible last movies.”On the podcast he said he had passed on directing The Adventures of Cliff Booth because he felt “unenthused” about his final film being a sequel. He has only directed one sequel –Kill Bill: Volume 2– though he considers both parts of Kill Bill to be a single film.“I love this script but I’m still walking down the same ground I’ve already walked,” Tarantino said of The Adventures of Cliff Booth. “It just kind of unenthused me. This last movie, I’ve got to not know what I’m doing again. I’ve got to be in uncharted territory.”Tarantino’s final film was long rumoured to be The Movie Critic, which was to star Pitt and follow a cynical film critic working in California in 1977. But in 2024Tarantino abandoned his plans for the film, confirming on The Church of Tarantino podcast that he had scrapped The Movie Critic because he believed it was too similar to his past work.“I wasn’t really excited about dramatising what I wrote when I was in pre-production, partly because I’m using the skill set that I learned from Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood – ‘How are we going to turn Los Angeles into the Hollywood of 1969 without using CGI?’” he said.“It was something we had to pull off. We had to achieve it. It wasn’t for sure that we could do it … The Movie Critic, there was nothing to figure out. I already kind of knew, more or less, how to turn LA into an older time. It was too much like the last one.”Explore more on these topicsQuentin TarantinoDavid FincherInglourious BasterdsOnce Upon a Time in HollywoodKill Bill: Volume 1Kill Bill: Volume 2newsShareReuse this content"

One of only a handful of wooden carvings made by her during the 1940s, it is one of the first major such works she made using strings.In private ownership and rarely seen by the public, the carving can now be acquired as part of the UK’s national collection to go on permanent public display at the Hepworth Wakefield, in Hepworth’s home town inWest Yorkshire, for the first time since its creation.The government placed a temporary export ban on the work when it was sold to an anonymous bidder at Christie’s a year ago to prevent it going overseas and allow time for funds to be raised to keep in it the UK.Apioneer of abstract sculpture, Hepworth (1903-75) is well known for her innovative stringed works, of which this is one of the earliest and best examples.Escaping wartime London in 1939, Hepworth moved to Carbis Bay in St Ives with her four young children and second husband, the painter Ben Nicholson﻿, and settled in the area. She had brought only one piece with her to St Ives, the model for Sculpture with Colour, which was finished in 1943.View image in fullscreenHepworth with her Mother and Child carving.Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty ImagesShe initially had little time for work, no studio space, and limited access to materials. In 1943, she moved into a house large enough to have a small studio and was granted a special permit to use wood for sculpting.The only one of Hepworth’s works to include multicoloured strings, which are pulled taut against a pale blue interior, it reflected Hepworth’s experiences of the Cornish landscape around her.With more than 2,800 donations from the public and several large grants – including £1.89m from the National LotteryHeritageFund, and of £750,000 from Art Fund – the acquisition will enhance The Hepworth Wakefield’s ability to tell the full story of Hepworth’s career and pioneering creativity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Brian De Palma, 1970),3.10am, Talking Pictures TVView image in fullscreenRobert De Niro and Jennifer Salt in Hi, Mom!Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyThis early Brian De Palma effort from 1970 shows the New York-based director playing around with some of his influences (Godard, Hitchcock) in a lively if slightly scattergun satire. Robert De Niro – himself not fully formed as an actor – plays a voyeuristic film-maker trying to make a movie by spying on his neighbours in the apartment block opposite. This devolves into a bizarre mockumentary about a radical theatre group staging an experience called Be Black, Baby, which features paint and an education in racial inequality.SWLive sportThe Hundred Cricket: Trent Rockets Women v Manchester Originals Women2.45pm, BBC Two.

Which, given the function of a poster, doesn’t bode well for the marketing of my new standup hour. The festival has almost 4,000 shows, all jostling for attention, so bringing promotional material to the city this month can feel like chucking wads of cash into the sea.This year, my show is calledMy Apologies to the Chef, so I’ve gone with a photo in which I’m doing a kooky grin as my head is served on a silver platter under a cloche. Hilarious stuff, yes, but I feel apprehensive about the theme – largely because my show includes no mention of chefs or catering. Registration for the fringe typically happens around March, when a show might have included a large section about restaurants, for example, which has since been removed. It’s how you end up with an aesthetic that is far more culinary than is ideal.View image in fullscreenUnder the cloche … Alfie Packham’s poster for My Apologies to the Chef.Photograph: Rebecca Need-MenearThe other issue is that grin. Goofy faces on standup comedy posters are passe, I’m told. It’s all about moody lighting and nonchalant poses these days. One of the poster designers behind this cool trend isJonny Woolley.“I have always had a pet peeve for comedians doing funny faces on their posters,” he says. “It’s always been such a turn-off for me.”Oh, no.“When I started making posters nearly a decade ago, no comedy posters looked cool,” says Woolley. “And I was really influenced by album art and movie posters. I hate when comedy posters are just goofy. There are so many posters of comedians sitting on the toilet. I’m interested in trying to make art for the posters that feels like it could be a more longstanding representation of that show.”Woolley, who is also a co-founder of the clown ensembleStamptown, is interested in lending a “legitimacy” to the art of comedy through his designs. In parliament this month, a select committee of MPs called upon the government torecognise live comedy as an art form. As comedy is becoming more businesslike, apparently so is its marketing.One of Woolley’s clients this year is the musical comedianJordan Gray, who Jonny tells me is “very hands on” in the design of her posters. Gray wanted her photo (shot byDylan Woodley) to match her on stage persona – an image of unbridled rock star ego.“I like having a stupid title and a picture that makes you think that I’m very, very serious about this,” Gray says. “That lack of self-awareness is quite funny.”View image in fullscreen‘I was influenced by album art and movie posters’ … some of Jonny Woolley’s designs for Edinburgh shows this year.Composite: Jonny WoolleyMichael Julings, another prolific fringe poster designer, says simplicity is key to standing out at the fringe. So many posters are cluttered with stars, quotes, QR codes and subtitles. While you might think these accolades would sell tickets, it really creates a kind of “patchwork effect” when the posters are presented together, he says.Every year, the effort to stand out results in small, random coincidences. This year, stand-ups Alex Kitson, Daniel McKeon and Aaron Wood all use Post-it notes as a visual motif in their publicity photos. Two years ago, Julings recalls, six different acts’ posters included dogs for some reason.“The busier it is, the more it fades,” says Julings. “A good example of this is the most ubiquitous design of last summer, which is the green Charli xcxBrat album cover. I remember seeing all the Mercury nominees in a grid, with all this beautiful artwork that’s been made independent of each other. But the only one that stands out is the block of green.”It’s hard to equate selling 50 tickets to a fringe show with a multimillion-pound marketing campaign, but the Brat influence can be seen on the streets of Edinburgh this year. An obvious example is Ivo Graham’sdirect parody, which says “Ivo” in the same typography with an orange background. Meanwhile, Vittorio Angelone has used text-only billboards to coax passersby with the slogan: “Vittorio Angelone has always denied any involvement in the Edinburgh fringe.”View image in fullscreen‘The busier it is, the more it fades’ … posters by Michael Julings for Edinburgh this year.Composite: Michael JulingsFashionable music marketing appears to be a growing influence on the fringe and the comedy industry in general. This is reflected in the rise of comedy nights such as Adam Flood’s Late NightComedyRave; Ivo Graham’s DJ sets featuring comedian guests; and Jack Shep’s London comedy night, Wanting to Be Cool, Having to Be Funny. (I am devastated to report that I have not performed at any of these.)But unlike musicians, comedians don’t seem to mind hiring the same designers and photographers as each other. “Which is good for me,” says Julings. “Unfortunately, I think it’s because of the financial margins and the money that’s being spent at the fringe and the gamble that’s being made.” Performers spend hundreds or thousands of pounds hiring photographers, designers and booking advertising space with Out of Hand, the festival’s main outdoor advertising provider. “Everybody’s looking at each other saying, I don’t want to be the one to do something wrong.”I can relate to this. I ask Jonny what he thinks of my poster this year, which was photographed byRebecca Need-Menearand designed by my sister,Robyn Packham, who gave me a 15% discount.“I think it came out great!” he says.Phew. Maybe I am cool after all.Alfie Packham: My Apologies to the Chef is atUnderbelly, Bristo Square, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)PostersDesignEdinburgh festivalTheatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The performance has begun before the audience are given wristbands and enter the room. The stage is like a nightclub, a table filled with water cups to one side and a floor spotlight in the corner. Beneath an array of suspended tube lights, forming a kind of ramshackle roof, are three people lost in music: Oli Mathiesen, Lucy Lynch and Sharvon Mortimer. We are hearing Nocturbulous Behaviour by Detroit techno giant Suburban Knight. It is relentless, as are the dancers.For the next hour, you are seated spectators at a rave. The opening minutes seem impenetrable, as if the trio are surrounded by a force field, but your passivity melts away as the music shudders through us all and they respond to our whoops. Those screams disappear into a soundscape that includes sirens, punishing drums, insistent beats and otherworldly bleeps. The accompaniment is loud, heavy, an assault. But the dancers are incredibly light on their feet – butterflies who float while the music stings like a bee. They add a touch of humour, too, akin to Matteo Haitzmann’s similarly unremitting trio performanceMake It Count.At times, it is as if the fug and scrum of a club has cleared, leaving just three isolated dancers – or as if they have ascended to a podium. They often use familiar techno or street dance moves but the choreography grows increasingly sophisticated as the trio snake from one routine to the next, barely pausing for water breaks. Side steps suggest the swaggering attack of warriors or boxers and that drilled momentum abates for body ripples, elasticated legs, disco arms and blissed out reverie – even a few gestures towards line dancing. When exercise equipment is brought on, it morphs into a Hiit workout. All three don rave gloves like lightning mimes.View image in fullscreenLost in the music … The Butterfly Who Flew Into the Rave.Photograph: Lucy ParakhinaThe heat rises in the room. The dancers, clad in athleisure and cargo pants, shed bits of clothing. Their focus is absolute, switching between responding to the music and almost controlling it, only to occasionally recoil under strobes (part of Shanell Bielawa’s lighting design) from its shattering power. Frequently in triangular formation, their bond is as mesmerising as their compulsion to keep going, even if there’s no space for a deeper narrative or emotional nuance in the piece’s audacity.Choreographed by the trio (from a concept by Mathiesen and featuring Celia Hext as an occasional alternate performer), the show is billed as endurance art because it condenses a three-day rave into 60 minutes. It’s a testament to their stamina – but there is pure pleasure here, too. The lasting impression is of transcendence and when those red cups start glowing like votive candles, it almost attains a spiritual quality.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreDanceEdinburgh festivalClub cultureDance musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The neglect is barely credible, and this outstanding occasion showed what audiences have been denied. If ever there was a piece ideally suited to the Royal Albert Hall it is Delius’s voluptuous 1905 magnum opus, with its double chorus, vast and sensuous orchestration, and the ecstatic affirmations of its Nietzsche text. And no conductor is more ideally suited to bringing all this together than the lifelong Delius advocateMark Elder.Why the disregard? Partly, perhaps, the enduring boldness of Nietzsche’s atheist polemic Also Sprach Zarathustra, from which the text is culled. The main reason, though, is surely that Delius’s defiantly individual aesthetic – “a little intangible sometimes but always very beautiful”, as Elgar, no less, put it so well – remains a hard sell to audiences who want their music to have more obvious structure and progression.And yet few big pieces have a more clearcut beginning, middle and end than A Mass of Life. The opening summons leaps magnificently off the page. The atmospheric stillness at the start of the second part, with its distant horn calls – played high in the Albert Hall gallery – is a magical piece of writing. And the final chorus is an emphatic summation, admirably marshalled here by Elder to avoid any hint of bombast.Undeniably, the work has weaker moments, in which Delius’s music lingers less cogently. Yet few are without interest and none lacks artistry. The influence of Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde, philosophically as well as musically, is there. So is the echo of Delius’s exposure to African American singing in his Florida years. The orchestration is always alive with subtle changes of timbre and phrasing. All this was sensitively realised by theBBC Symphony Orchestra, with Alison Teale’s bass oboe providing a distinctive presence in the fine woodwind section.Among the vocal soloists, the baritone carries most of the weight, with Roderick Williams bringing clarity and taste to his marathon task. Jennifer Davis, Claudia Huckle and David Butt Philip showed they were not there to make up the numbers. The BBC Symphony Chorus and the London Philharmonic Choir never flagged. Surtitled translations of the German text were a good idea. But it was Elder who did most to make the case for A Mass of Life so conclusively.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’m heading for the Dart valley and the English Riviera, AKA Torbay, to explore by foot and ferry, river boat, bus and steam railway. The area promises wine, walking, seafood and an eclectic history from prehistoric cave-dwellers to Agatha Christie. It’s easy to assume a Devon holiday must involve driving, but it can be even better without. On previous trips, I’ve stayed inExeter and toured by train, or based myself inTorquayto walk the coast path and take the boat to Brixham. This time, I’m testing the limits of what can comfortably be done without a car by staying in an old farmhouse in the countryside, half a mile from the nearest bus stop.A map of south DevonBus 125runs every couple of hours from Paignton, and the road from Four Cross Lanes bus stop toSandridge Bartonwinery is laced with stitchwort and pink campion, growing under hedges wreathed in honeysuckle. Robins are singing in the apple trees and skylarks over the fields. Hard to believe I was in rainy Essex this morning and am now in a sunny Devon vineyard, ready for the midday tour. A whiff of wood smoke from the fire in the tasting cabin mixes with soft bubbles from the Sharpham sparkling wine, made on site and tasting of oak and tart apple crumble. The last taster, a young, fruity red, comes withSharpham cheesesand localchilli jam.The route to Stoke Gabriel is almost impossibly idyllic: a path I might never have found if I’d come by carAfterwards, I stroll for a mile down to Stoke Gabriel for provisions. The route is almost impossibly idyllic: a narrow track under banks of ferns and wildflowers. The only sounds are birdsong and a waterfall near the old mill. It’s a path I might never have found if I’d come by car. Along the stony beach of the big Millpool, I reach theRiver Shackand sit right by the water with bowls of sesame-seaweed salad and honeyed anchovies. Dozens of green and orange crabs are marching sideways over the dam nearby, caught and released by children fishing there with sacks of bacon. A heron is fishing too, far out in the pool.View image in fullscreenThe River Shack in Stoke GabrielBack at Sandridge Barton, thenew restauranthas closed for the day, and there are only sheep in the orchard and swallows spiralling overhead. My brother joins me from Somerset on the last bus and we have a whole floor each in the pale pink, wisteria-deckedLower Well Farmhousenext to the winery. It would comfortably sleep eight in three doubles and a twin, all en suite, and downstairs there’s a slate-floored farmhouse kitchen, beamed, log-fire-warmed sitting room and a walled courtyard strung with lights (from £278 a night, three nights minimum).Agatha Christie’s house atGreenwayis roughly three miles south, beside the River Dart, so we decide to walk there the next morning. After a mile or so along a lane, paths lead down to the quay at Galmpton Creek and we pick up the well-signedGreenway trail, along a stony beach, through woods and over hills, to the gate. There are lockers to store bags and free hot drinks for visitors who reach Greenway without a car. We have simnel scones with pots of tea before wandering through the gardens. Woodpeckers yaffle above banks of primroses and strawberry flowers, lipstick-bright camellias and cascading rhododendrons. We sit in Christie’s old sitting room, where 1930s songs are playing, and stroll into woods, past mossy fountains, river views and hillsides white with wild garlic. This year, the National Trust has introduced a new half-price admission for non-members after 2.30pm (full price £17 adults, £8.50 under-18s).View image in fullscreenAgatha Christie’s home, Greenway.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/AlamyThe Dartmouth Steam Railway and River Boat Company runs different routes across the River Dart and sells combi andRound Robin tickets. From the little quay below Greenway, we catch theboat to Dartmouth(£12) along the wide, tree-lined river to explore palm-studded gardens and half-timbered houses. A quickferry trip(£2.50) to Kingswear brings us to one end of thesteam railway(£23.50) and, from the glass-walled observation carriage (£3 extra), the views are unbeatable.The train passes wooded riverside cliffs and crosses viaducts, then climbs through oaks and neon-yellow broom flowers to reach the sandy beaches of Torbay. We end the day eating River Teign mussels on a sunny, pub-style terrace atThe Boathousein Paignton, with the foaming sea just feet away. The only problem is, once we’ve finished, the last bus has left and our options are a four-mile sunset walk or a £12taxi. We take the taxi.At Agatha Christie’s house we have simnel scones with pots of tea before wandering through the gardensHeading to the bus stop in Stoke Gabriel the next morning, paths lead us up from the water, through a blossoming community orchard and the village churchyard, where a 1,000-year-old yew tree rests its sagging branches on wooden posts.

She was born in Torquay in 1890 and several novels feature local settings. She would have been more familiar with yesterday’s boat and steam train trips than today’sRib ride(£37). A breezy, hour-long coastal tour takes in caves, coves and rocky arches, cormorants and harbourside seals, before flying us back across the bay with the salt spray spattering our laughing faces.View image in fullscreenThe Dartmouth Steam Railway.Photograph: Phoebe TaplinTorquay is peppered with Christie-related landmarks, including Beacon Cove, where she nearly drowned; the Grand Hotel, where she honeymooned; and Kents Cavern, which inspired her mystery novel The Man in the Brown Suit.The tour ofKents Cavernleads through a wooden door into dripping tunnels and dens of ancient cave bears, past stalactites, calcite bands and pickaxe marks. The guide lights moss-and-beeswax-filled scallop shells and holds up neolithic skulls like a cheery, enthusiastic Hamlet (£16.95 adults, £14.25 under-16s, if booked in advance).Torquay Museum, in an elegant gothic building five minutes by bus from Kents Cavern, displays the fossilised jawbone of a 41,000-year-old human, one of Britain’s earliest Homo sapiens. You can also find stuffed birds and farmhouse kitchens, delicate Egyptian sarcophagi and pictures crafted in Torquay marble. In the UK’s only gallery dedicated to Christie, there’s also one of her fur coats and the walking stick David Suchet used to play Poirot (£10 adults, £5 under-18s for an annual pass).There’s time before our train for a meal atNo Seven, a seafood bistro with a sea-view wine bar upstairs.

Why are they the essential alcopop at this year’s picnics, parties and festivals?Emma RussellTue 19 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhen Merrilee Kick invented BuzzBallz in 2009, she was a 47-year-old teacher from Texas who needed to make some money fast. “I was about to get a divorce and was terrified of becoming homeless,” she says. “I was a high-school teacher not making enough money to survive, much less put two sons through college.” She had the opportunity to do an MBA through a teacher-enrichment programme, and came up with the idea for BuzzBallz one hot afternoon while marking homework. “I chose booze because it thrives in good times, and thrives even more in bad times,” she says.Kick decided to make a cocktail that came in a plastic container rather than glass that could break, and was inspired by the shape of a snow globe she had brought back from Sweden. Finding the funds to manufacture her product proved challenging. She was turned down for business loans by every bank in Dallas, until one accepted the cows from her mum’s ranch and her old car as collateral.Since then, BuzzBallz has grown to become the US’s biggest-selling single-serve premixed cocktail, and the fastest-growing ready-to-drink brand in terms of sales volume in the UK. In 2022, the company was bought by Sazerac in an estimated $500m deal, which made Kick the89th-richest self-made womanin the US. In January 2025, Kick and her family stepped back from running the company – now valued at more than $1bn.BuzzBallz arrived in the UK in 2022, and in the past year sales have boomed. In one day in London, I spoke to students, lawyers and a group of festivalgoers, all swigging the vividly coloured drinks. You may have seen the packaging – bright, round, gaudy – on shelves in corner shops and supermarkets, clutched at house parties or spilling out of the bins in your local park.View image in fullscreenCarlo-Gino, Felicity Dunstan and Emil James drinking BuzzBallz in Peckham Rye park, London.Photograph: Emma Russell/The Guardian“The buzz has been largely driven by organic discovery, primarily in independent retailers and via word of mouth on social media,” says Jake Wenz, the CEO of Sazerac. “It has been incredible to watch BuzzBallz become a cult favourite among consumers in the UK, specifically gen Z.” And it’s not just BuzzBallz that are booming in popularity with this age group.A survey showedthat in March 2025, 76% of UK gen Z consumers had drunk alcohol in the last six months, up from 66% in 2023.Strawberry ‘Rita, Tequila ‘Rita and Chili Mango are Britain’s favourite flavours, according to Wenz. My nearest off-licence started selling them four months ago, and the shopkeeper tells me that young people can’t get enough of them. “It’s surreal,” says Kick. “What started as a wild idea has become a global party-starter.”“People my age are either buying a home and getting married,” says Freya McCann, 29, who works in sales in Edinburgh, “or they’re saying: ‘Let’s get some BuzzBallz and have a good time.’” McCann recently tried her first BuzzBallz, a Strawberry ‘Rita, at a friend’s party and now loves them. She thinks they’ve become popular in the UK because “you can get them at a corner shop, or before you get on the train”. They’re convenient, she says, “but they’re also quite silly”. For McCann, there’s something nostalgic about the drink, reminding her of school discos. “They used to sell these little drinks and you’d feel so hyper.” With about five teaspoons of sugar in each BuzzBallz, not far off the maximum daily recommendation for a woman, it’s no wonder.Like everything that was all the rage in the 90s and early 00s – from low-rise jeans to thin eyebrows – premixed drinks and alcopops are making a return. After a 10-year hiatus, Reef, the vodka, orange and passion fruit drink, was relaunched in 2024. Bacardi Breezer, also discontinued a decade ago, made a return this summer. In June, Smirnoff Ice launched a new advertising campaign across 20 countries. Nik Jhangiani, the interim chief executive of the drinks company Diageo, which makes Smirnoff Ice, told the Telegraph this month that it now has a “huge opportunity” to win over gen Z.In the mid-90s, when alcopops first came on the market, critics said they were being deliberately marketed to teenagers who were below the legal drinking age. “The thing that really bothered people about alcopops was that they are so palatable,” says Andrew Misell, a director at Alcohol Change UK. “We know from looking at statements from some of the drink companies that they were aware that if you want to sell more alcohol, you need to appeal to people who don’t like traditionally bitter or sharp drinks,” such as wine or beer. In 1996, the government slapped a 40% tax on alcopops and some supermarkets pulled them from their shelves. TV adverts for WKD and Smirnoff Ice were banned for encouraging under-18s to drink. By 2013, the ready-to-drink sector, which at its peak in 2005 was worth £1bn,had shrunk by half.Misell doesn’t think there’s anything especially wrong with alcopops or premixed cocktails making a return: “They don’t have any sort of extra-dangerous ingredients in them; they don’t tend to be particularly strong alcoholically.” But, he says, they are “easy to drink a lot of and they may appeal to younger drinkers who have a sweet palate”.Nick Lonergan, a 29-year-old Australian who moved to London two years ago and works in customer relations for a fashion brand, had his first taste of BuzzBallz at a house party four months ago. “I had a sip and then I ran down to the store and bought about five of them,” he says. He likes the fact that they are easy to fit in a bag, which makes them “the perfect drink for a party”.View image in fullscreen‘They’re everywhere’ … BuzzBallz.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFlorence Langford, a 30-year-old Italian-Scottish marketing executive living in Manchester, thinks they’re perfect before a night out or at a festival. “They’re not chic,” she says. “But they arethatdrink of the summer.” The appeal for her is the packaging, which is fun, trashy and toxic-looking. “I probably just go for the most obnoxious colour over the taste, if I’m honest,” she says.There are two types of consumers for these kinds of drinks, says Matthew Bulcroft, the marketing director of Global Brands, which owns Hooch and Reef: “The nostalgia-chasers – the over-30s who either remember it from their parents drinking it or actually consuming it themselves.” They make up about 65% of Hooch’s market. The rest are finding the drink for the first time: “Either because the 90s and 00s are cool again, or just because they want an easy drink that is nice and refreshing and won’t get them too drunk,” says Bulcroft.Since 2022, the consumption of alcohol-free drinks has risen, withMintel revealingthat 41% of UK adults have drunk low- or no-alcohol beer, wine, cider, spirits or cocktails in the past three months. The manufacturers of drinks such as Hooch and Reef have responded by creating drinks that are lower in alcohol: once about 6% ABV, they are now 3.4%. Misell says that while there is a cohort of under-25s who don’t drink at all, that “doesn’t mean that the rest of the under-25s are problem-free when it comes to alcohol”.That could explain the popularity of BuzzBallz with gen Z. “They’re generally having one or two as a precursor to a night out, or it’s an indulgent treat for the train,” says Bulcroft. Gen Z and millennials rate the cost of living as their top concern, with 52% of both generations reporting that they live from one payday to the next. According to a2025 survey by Deloitte, many young people will be looking for more cost-effective ways of socialising. Since the beginning of 2020, more than2,000 pubs have closed inEngland and Wales, in part due to rising costs and declining consumer spending.BuzzBallz cost from £2.99 in Aldi, which started stocking them this May, to £4.99. At 13.5% ABV, they are certainly not low alcohol.Felicity Dunstan, who is finishing off a Choc Tease with her friends Carlo-Gino, 27, and Emil James, 23, in a London park, says she first saw BuzzBallz on TikTok, where there are more than 50,000 videos of people taste-testing them. In a viral video to her 991,000 followers, the influencerHeather Bowlingdrinks a Chili Mango before a night out in Manchester, a voiceover of Samantha Jones from Sex and the City in the background. There’s a #buzzballchallenge to see how people react to drinking them.View image in fullscreenDiscarded BuzzBallz in London.Photograph: Simon Leigh“People litter them a lot, so you see them around,” says James. “It’s actually really good advertising. They’re everywhere.” Carlo-Gino chimes in: “But put them in the bin, guys.” BuzzBallz say they are packaged in 100% recyclable PET plastics.Are BuzzBallz actually any good? With the help of a few friends, I give them a go. We buy all six of the flavours stocked at my local shop. The Espresso Martini is watery and tastes like a strong black filter coffee, but it’s not bad. If I needed a pick-me-up on the way to a club, I’d probably give it another go.The Choc Tease is creamy and has a subtle hint of vodka – it tastes a bit like Baileys. The Pornstar Martini, made with vodka and passion fruit juice, tastes weirdly synthetic, as does the Strawberry ‘Rita with tequila and vodka. The Chili Mango, also with a tequila and vodka base, is my favourite. It’s very sugary but has a little kick from the jalapeños.All my friends were keen on the containers, until it came to finishing the last sip. The spherical shape means you have to tilt your head right back to drain it.Langford says she has noticed the alcopop revival – she’s seen Hooch around and is looking forward to trying WKD’s Irn-Bru flavour. She thinks BuzzBallz are fun but is just as happy to buy premixed Moth cocktails or a canned Cîroc Vodka Spritz. But the drinks are new and exciting for Lonergan, who didn’t grow up drinking alcopops in Sydney. “There’s no nostalgia attached. It’s like I’m living in the here and now. In the BuzzBallz era.”Explore more on these topicsCocktailsSpiritsAlcoholFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Think barbecue, braise or wrapAnna BerrillTue 19 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareMy garden has produced an abundance of lettuce(mainly butter lettuce)this year but there’s a limit to how much salad I can eat. What else can I use them for?Julian, by email“Start thinking of lettuce, and especially butter lettuce, as bread or a taco shell,” says Jesse Jenkins, author ofCooking with Vegetables, and happily this is a “highly adaptable” strategy, too. Sure, you could pile in grilled spicy pork belly and herbs, but this dinner fix also works well “with everything a big green salad does: a piece of nicely grilled protein, some sauce, a few pickled crunchy things, all wrapped in a big, beautiful green leaf”. But why stop there? “I also like to use butter lettuce to wrap cheese toasties,” Jenkins says. “It catches all the fatty goodness and acts as a barrier between the crunchy bread and the roof of your mouth.”Lettuce is also a great carrier of flavour, so braising is another potential ploy. “Start with a base of onion and garlic,” suggests Yohei Furuhashi, head chef atThe Laveryin London, then separately brown some chicken thighs and add them to the onions with a little thyme, a splash of wine and some chicken stock. Then tear in some lettuce and simmer for 10-15 minutes to “let all the flavours come together”.Julian might also give his abundant greens a quick stir-fry “with olive oil and garlic, then mix with cooked lentils, herbs and chilli and serve with salmon”, Furuhashi says. Alternatively, get a thrill from the grill, says Alice Power, head chef atThe Black Swan at Oldsteadnear York. “Halve or quarter lettuces, and get them on the barbecue. Pair with stone fruit and grilled halloumi or chicken, and that will feel very different from a standard salad.” Dressing-wise, the aim is to balance the smokiness, which can done in myriad ways: “Go sweet and fruity, or creamy and herby, or something quite spicy,” Power says.Otherwise, it’s a truth universally acknowledged that few problems can’t be remedied by soup, and tackling an excess of lettuce is no different. “Take any Asian-style broth with chilli, coriander and chicken, then add the lettuce and it will soak up all that juice,” Furuhashi says. Power, meanwhile, would chill out by blending said lettuce into gazpacho or a chilled green and herby soup. Asimakis Chaniotis, ofMyrtosin London, on the other hand, takes inspiration from a fricassee of lettuce with lamb, which is usually eaten in Greece at Easter. “As it’s summer, I’ve been making a version with fish,” he says, and at the moment that means pink bream. He starts by sweating onions and garlic, then adds lettuce and herbs (parsley, mint, dill, basil, chervil) and cooks for just a minute or two. Cook some fish, and serve with anavgolemonosauce (AKA whisked egg yolks, lemon juice and cornflour), which Chaniotis fancies up by turning it into a foam.All that said, sometimes the simplest solution comes from a change in mindset, Power says: “Start thinking of lettuce as a lighter-style leaf, such as spinach,” and stir it through sauces and pasta at the last minute. “Or shred lettuce and add to a courgette and herb risotto,” she says. “That would be nice at this time of year.” And who am I to disagree?Got a culinary dilemma?

Many of them first took root in Europe in Extremadura, where I’m from. In La Vera, peppers were smoked and ground into what becamepimentón de la Veraand is now part of our food culture. These fritters, which are simple, quick and full of flavour, bring together all these ingredients with long journeys behind them and a solid place in the modern Spanish kitchen.Sweetcorn, chorizo and piquillo pepper frittersPrep10 minCook30 minMakesAbout 12125g cured chorizo, skinned and finely diced75g jarred piquillo peppers, drained and finely chopped2 corn cobs, kernels shaved off with a big sharp knife125g plain flour1 tsp baking powderSea salt and black pepper2 largeeggs, beaten160ml whole milkOlive oil, for fryingPut the chorizo, peppers and corn in a large bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and toss to coat. Season generously, then add the eggs and milk, and mix again to combine.Heat a good layer of oil in a large nonstick frying pan, then, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, drop in spoonfuls of the fritter mixture and fry for a minute or two on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the rest of the fritters.Serve the fritters warm, either just as they are or with some creme fraiche or a little tomato salsa for dipping.Explore more on these topicsFoodSnacksSausagesSpanish food and drinkVegetablesSummer food and drinkEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"
